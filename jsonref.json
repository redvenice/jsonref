Kyle helped the pair stay together in March, even though Ms Mair claims he knew her bully boyfriend had violently grabbed her by the neck the last time they went on the show.

Still, that\u0027s what insurance is for — except that nobody wanted to pay out.\u0027The contents insurer paid for the majority of our possessions, but six months on, our solicitor told us the freeholder\u0027s buildings insurer was refusing to pay out, as it deemed the building had fallen down of its own accord,\u0027 recalls Jacquie.          Passers-by are still struck by the large crater in the centre of an otherwise attractive terrace of houses where Ed and Jacquie\u0027s house once stood         At the time Barnet Council declared the house a \u0027dangerous\u0027 structure that had to be demolished, along with everything inside, from precious photo albums including their first baby scan to family heirlooms Knott\u0027s insurers also refused to part with any cash, citing any number of reasons, among them that the price of the job was more than a certain percentage of his annual turnover.\u0027It was a horrific time,\u0027 Jacquie reflects. \u0027We had a new baby we were in temporary accommodation and having to wade through reams of paperwork. We were both pretty distraught and permanently exhausted. Despite being new parents, we couldn\u0027t really feel any joy in anything.\u0027The couple pinned their hopes on a compensation claim against their builder, though it would take another two years before the case came to court. When it did, it made little difference.While the judge, who called it a \u0027sad case\u0027, ordered Knott to pay the couple £290,000, they haven\u0027t seen a penny from him, as Knott had dissolved his company and set up a new one, Stone Hall Building Services. Astonishingly, this is not against the law, and is a strategy used all too often by builders.That company has since ceased trading, although, since their story became public, Jacquie and Ed have been contacted by two other people who claim Knott left a trail of destruction in their homes, too.\u0027One was left with an estimated £100,000 damage the other job was done so badly they couldn\u0027t get it signed off by building regulators without a lot more work. They can\u0027t afford to pay any more builders and have been trying to do it themselves around their own full-time job,\u0027 says Jacquie.\u0027It seems wrong to us that there appear to have been no consequences for him whatsoever.\u0027 All bad enough, you might think. But there were yet more complications regarding the property\u0027s freeholder, who, under English law, owns the building and the land it stands on outright.          The gaping space is still boarded up and has become overgrown         The couple are now issuing words of warning to those tempted to complete an \u0027iceberg conversion\u0027 Leaseholders lease their home from the freeholder and usually pay an annual sum in \u0027ground rent\u0027.\u0027Initially, it was a company called Deeya,\u0027 says Jacquie, \u0027but a couple of years after the collapse, it was put up for auction.\u0027We asked our lawyers if we should buy it, as we thought it would give us more options, but they advised us not to.\u0027A few months later, the company changed its name to Ground Rent Trading 4SA Ltd, and we found ourselves dealing with the new owner and professional freeholder, Laurence Freilich.\u0027In January 2018, the couple got a letter from lawyers acting for the freeholders, effectively trying to terminate their lease.\u0027It said we had to forfeit our lease as we had broken the terms of our leasehold,\u0027 recalls Jacquie. \u0027There was an element of: \u0027How much more can one family take?\u0027\u0027It accused us of breaking just about every part of the lease you could think of, including not looking after the communal areas — which is a bit ridiculous, seeing as there were no communal areas left as there was no house. We had two weeks to respond.\u0027Ridiculous though it may have been, the couple still had to defend themselves to retain the lease — their one chance of rebuilding their old home and clawing something back from the mess that enveloped them.With legal expenses mounting into the tens of thousands — not to mention the stress of simultaneous legal action against their former lawyers, who they feel badly advised them — a trial was set for early 2019.It never happened: earlier this year, Jacquie received an alert from a government website that monitors changes to title deeds, telling them Ground Rent Trading was going into administration.\u0027I rang my lawyer in a panic, asking what it meant,\u0027 she says. That remains to be seen. At the moment, Jacquie and Ed are dealing with administrators called in to replace the freeholder. \u0027It\u0027s all very fishy. They are trying to get us to go to yet another meeting, at more legal expense, saying if we don\u0027t go the freehold will default to the Crown, which will complicate things further. They are also saying there are now further debts of £400,000 attached to the freehold.\u0027Are there any lessons that could be learned? Jacquie thinks not. \u0027I get asked this a lot, particularly by friends who are embarking on building work,\u0027 she says. \u0027They\u0027re desperate to make sure the same thing doesn\u0027t happen to them.\u0027But, much as I wish I could tell people to do things differently, we have been told we did everything by the book.

The would-be author spent six months teaching at Welsh prep school Arnold House in 1925 and, while there, wrote to Plunket Greene about the lack of enjoyment he found in teaching the boys. “The older they are the more stupid I find them,” he wrote.He sent the manuscript for his first novel, The Temple at Thatch, to the writer Harold Acton while he was teaching at Arnold House. Acton told him that the story was “too English for my exotic taste. Too much nid-nodding over port,” and recommended that Waugh print it “in a few elegant copies for the friends who love you such as myself”.Not all is doom and gloom – at one point Waugh tells his friend that he won the masters’ egg-and-spoon race. But he also writes of how “five minutes ago I decided to accept the job at Pisa as secretary to Scott-Moncrieff … The only real regret I shall have will be leaving friends … for the most part England means only debt and drunkenness and disapproval.”This job offer from Proust’s translator, however, would fall through, and together with the rejection of his writing, would plunge Waugh into despair. In his autobiography A Little Learning, Waugh writes of how it drove him to leave his clothes and a note from Euripides on the beach and swim out to sea. “As earnest of my intent I had brought no towel,” he writes in his memoir. “I cannot tell how much real despair and act of will, how much play-acting, prompted the excursion.” He was repeatedly stung by jellyfish, as it turned out, and returned to the shore.According to Sotheby’s, which will auction the letters for an estimate of between £15,000 and £20,000, they provide “important clues about Waugh’s development as a writer, as well as revealing much detail about a key set of friendships, and his life in the school that was to provide the source of one of his most enduring fictions, Decline and Fall”.In another letter, Waugh writes of his plans for a new novel after The Temple at Thatch was rejected. It would be, he writes, “a prose epic of Silenus … with all manner of roistering in public houses and brothels”. One character, he says, is “an unpleasing but accurate portrait of myself”, but he promises that no one else is taken from real life.

It has been stuck for seven months below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.Employment in the sector fell for the eighth month in a row and the pace of job losses was the steepest since September 2012 as manufacturers sought to reduce their costs.Factories cut their output at a faster rate than previously as they ran down stocks they had built up before the 31 October Brexit deadline.New orders fell for the seventh consecutive month, reflecting tougher conditions in the UK and overseas. The drop in new export orders was among the steepest of the past seven years.Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, said: “November saw UK manufacturers squeezed between a rock and hard place as the uncertainty created by a further delay to Brexit was accompanied by growing paralysis ahead of the forthcoming general election.“Destocking at manufacturers and their clients following the latest Brexit delay was a major contributor to the weakness experienced by the sector. Inflationary pressures meanwhile showed signs of moderating further, with input costs falling slightly for the first time since March 2016.” This was linked to lower global commodity prices and exchange rate effects.Lee Collinson, the head of manufacturing at Barclays, said: “With any new year comes renewed hope, but the certainty the sector longs for needs to come pretty sharpish in 2020 to help bolster the performance of UK manufacturing.”In the eurozone, manufacturing activity declined for the 10th month in a row, although there were some signs of improvement. A Markit survey for the eurozone showed the PMI rose to 46.9 in November from October’s 45.9, signalling a slower rate of decline.Germany’s contraction eased but its export-reliant factory sector remained bottom of the table, followed by Austria, Spain and Italy. Only Greece and France recorded an expansion in their manufacturing industries.China’s manufacturers fared better than the UK and the eurozone last month, with new export orders posting the first back-to-back monthly rise for more than a year-and-a-half. The CaixinMarkit China manufacturing PMI rose to 51.8 in November from 51.7, suggesting the impact of the US-China trade war may be easing. Staffing levels at Chinese factories were stable following seven months of decline."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/feea7ece24fbea1b273c81b2881a4d78372aa192/0_118_3426_2056/master/3426.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0441cea30638bbaed139c6e41fcb3f5f","title":"uk retailers outstanding black friday sales","story":"Forecasts that Black Friday would leave shopping centres deserted as consumers shopped online or boycotted fake bargains have been confounded by figures revealing a sharp rise in sales.Barclaycard, which processes about £1 of every £3 spent in the UK, said it was an “outstanding” Black Friday compared with last year.Behind the soaring sales lay an important fact – that as Black Friday fell on the 29th of the month, it also coincided with the monthly payday for millions of workers.Springboard tracked numbers through the day, and said increased footfall was strongest at about 5pm, suggesting that many people joined the annual shopping frenzy as offices shut.The figures suggest that reports of Black Friday fatigue among shoppers, deterred by bogus discounting, may have been wide of the mark. They will also fuel a determination among retailers to keep Black Friday as a key retail event in the run-up to Christmas.Diane Wehrle, Springboard’s insights director, said: “This positive result may well seal the deal for retailers in terms of their commitment to Black Friday moving forward, as they will have claimed shoppers early on in the Christmas trading period giving them the opportunity to steal a march on their rivals.”But there is mounting evidence that the Black Friday sales simply displace spending that might otherwise have taken place in early December.Springboard said it was anticipating a lull in sales before a last-minute rush before Christmas, with Saturday 21 December expected to be the busiest sales day of the year.Springboard tracks shopper numbers at 450 different retail locations across the UK, and its figures also provide an insight into how consumer behaviour has changed in the post-Christmas sales.It said: “Post-Christmas it is expected that footfall on 27, 28 and 29 December will be higher than on Boxing Day, which historically was the key sales day. In 2018, footfall on each of these three days was a third higher than on Boxing Day as many consumers now initially search for bargains online before venturing to the stores themselves.”Meanwhile, the British Retail Consortium said on Tuesday that the outlook for its members had been improving in the weeks leading up to Black Friday.After making adjustments to account for the bargain day coming later than in 2018, the BRC said sales were higher in November 2019 than a year earlier – a stronger performance than in recent months.Helen Dickinson, the BRC’s chief executive, said: “Once the figures are adjusted to take account of the timing of Black Friday, growth appears stronger in November than in previous months. Shoppers appeared ready to take advantage of the great bargains available, both online and on the high street.“Electronics and clothes both benefited from big discounts, with the recent cold snap adding further urgency to purchases of winter-wear. Furthermore, as the spectre of a no-deal Brexit has been pushed back to after Christmas, consumers were more prepared to open their wallets to a little extra festive spending.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28d618e1a7b3f832b452c76998366064bf60d792/0_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5f899da166836f71d3bbb403b12255e","title":"im 53 and my face finally makes sense how i learned to stop worrying and age gracefully","story":"When you reach 50, beauty is about caring for what you have, not mourning what you don’t, argues Bibi LynchI didn’t know how I’d age. I had no idea what my face and skin would do. Most women glimpse that future in their mother’s face. But my mum died when she was 40, so I never saw her face – our face – age. What I did see, though, was my mum, twice a day, stand in front of the bathroom mirror and place a dot of white cream on her forehead, on her nose, on her chin, on her cheeks, and one dollop on the tip of my nose and rub the moisturiser in. Another guiding light came in the form of Jackie magazine. It instructed me on the twice-a-day cleanse, tone and moisturise routine, and it’s the only religion I’ve ever had. Since those days, I’ve gained the deepest lines around my eyes when I laugh. But that means I’ve laughed. My once-teenage smattering of cheek freckles has taken over my entire visage too. But that means the sun has kissed me over and over, the insatiable thing.I’m 53, and my face finally makes sense. Is it bad to say I sort of like my face? Sort of like it very much? Not that it’s perfect, of course mine is a nose only a parent could love (and not necessarily unconditionally). But I really do like it. And more so as I get older. I think my face is sort of beautiful. Not because the features are beautiful – don’t make me mention my jowls – but because there’s a beauty in ageing. We all know about the glow of youth, of course, but there’s an easy, radiating warmth in maturity that’s unmissable, too.Accepting how you look, letting go of the angst at last, breathing out and allowing your face to relax into itself is incredibly attractive. Oh, I was so uncomfortable in my younger skin. I thought myself ugly. I’d hide my nose with my hand when talking to people. I’d try to cover those freckles up with foundation and my face would look like a giant digestive and I truly put the trauma in T-zone by refusing to leave the flat if I had a spot. Thank God for my oily skin now, though, it’s given me fewer wrinkles than I deserve.Who would ever think they’d be happier in their skin in their 50s? Not me. But here I am, with a new love of online makeup tutorials and excitedly awaiting the delivery of my new chocolate brown eyeliner. (At 53 I’ve learned black is too harsh for me.)Beauty doesn’t end in mid-life. Nor does it end in your 60s, your 70s, or your 80s. It blossoms in new and unimagined ways. You’re kind to your skin and, most importantly, you’re kind to yourself. No, you don’t look the same as you did in your 30s. Good! I was miserable with how I looked in my 30s. Getting older throws up all sorts of unexpected realisations – but, for me, none quite as unexpected as sort of really liking my face.Beauty is ageless.

And the British women we spoke to are indulging themselves, guilt-freeI’d be lying if I said I’d been looking forward to my 40s. Before the big birthday rolled around, I’d defined this decade as old. Boring. I was wrong. Speaking to other fortysomething women, I realised this is the time to forget about guilty pleasures. Here, we’re celebrating all out, straight-up pleasures. Some are everyday. Some are extravagant. They share one important theme: experiences over things equals enjoyment.‘I treated myself to a bike that’s turned me superhuman’Sarah Emslie, 41, osteopath, EdinburghI caught myself saying “I’m having a midlife crisis” to the guy in the bike shop and I kicked myself, because it’s nonsense. If I want to blow four figures on a super-fast aerodynamic time trial bike then I should celebrate. We don’t need to apologise for having fun. Racing head down, number on my back, I feel superhuman. I love how clear my head feels speeding downhill at 60km an hour. My favourite moments are when my wife, Laura, rides ahead of me, so I can take in the view of the mountains with her zooming down. I’m faster over the course than I was last year. It’s exhilarating to be 41 and still get better at your sport. I don’t feel my age. I don’t feel anything except that I’m me.‘I just enjoy being in a creative space’Helena Smith, 41, psychologist, KentThere are many hoops to jump through to get out of the house, especially because I’m a single mum, but my Tuesday life drawing class is worth it. I don’t give two monkeys about being good at sketching I just enjoy being in a creative space where I don’t think about work or bills or the stress of being a working mum because I’m so in the moment. Taking time out forces you into a different mindset. It’s been years since I did anything creative like this, because when you have babies it’s nearly impossible to do anything for yourself. During the two-hour class, time disappears completely. It’s my ultimate indulgence, because it’s purely for myself – nobody else’s benefit.‘Reading all morning is my ultimate indulgence’Minhe Currier, 41, stay-at-home mum, SurreyIf I don’t get time to myself I just don’t function. It’s not even an indulgence, it’s a sanity issue. As a married mother of a six-year-old, I automatically put myself last. But after the school drop-off, I open a book and read. In my 20s and 30s all I did was work. I was a broker in the city, starting work at 6.30am, leaving at 7pm and coming home without the emotional energy to read anything at all. Now I’m really into non-fiction because I’ve discovered life is much stranger than anything an author can make up. Recently I’ve read Harriet Harman’s autobiography, A Woman’s Work, which I think is good enough to rival Michelle Obama’s Becoming. Harman was a big childcare campaigner and reinforced the idea that parents are better people when they have their own lives. I couldn’t agree more.‘I get excited about an early night’Rhiannon Evans, 48, surveyor, CardiffI’m happier after a big sleep, and my skin looks happier, too. I get excited about an early night. I crave sleep and dream about my duvet during a rough day at work. I’m in bed by 10pm and I fall asleep quickly, often while I’m reading, but perimenopausal hormonal mayhem means I’m often awake for two or three hours in the middle of the night. It doesn’t help that my kids, aged 18 and 21, keep totally different hours to mine. At the weekend I might sleep until 10am, which is bliss.‘I never thought high street pasta could feel so extravagant’Zohreh Ghaffari, 48, radiographer, LondonIs it boring that my ultimate indulgence is eating pasta alle vongole until I can’t breathe? Add a nice glass of wine and finish up with chocolate and I’m a happy woman. In my 20s I ate out a lot without really thinking about it. Now going out for dinner is a mission: we need to book a babysitter and there are lots of stars that have to align workwise, because my husband and I both do shifts in different hospitals. But because we eat out so rarely, it feels special when we do. Sometimes we even have a random day off midweek together, so we treat ourselves and go for pasta on the high street while the kids are at school. That feels like a real indulgence.Beauty is ageless.

Sunshine (yes, that is her real name), an interiors specialist and journalist, has carved an illustrious 21-year career working across the world’s most prestigious publications. A busy freelancer, she’s used to juggling multiple people, projects and workplaces but the role that’s newest to her is motherhood …On motherhood: ‘I now really understand the juggle’“I had my daughter when I was 40, so I was quite an old parent,” says Sunshine.“I always hoped that someday I would have a child, and for me it’s the best thing in the world. I feel incredibly lucky and happy, but as someone who had their first child relatively late in life, I now really understand the juggle.”While she wouldn’t change a thing, Sunshine thinks it’s important to acknowledge the challenges. “I was part of the generation of women who were told they could have it all but it really is harder than I anticipated, I have to be honest.”On friendship: ‘It’s a wonderful feeling that someone has your back’Friendships at 40 are more important than ever, says Sunshine – even if she has less time to spend on them. “I’ve known my best friend since I was 11,” she says. “For all intents and purposes, we’re sisters.“We don’t get much face-to-face time – but I can still text her and say: ‘My kid is struggling I’m finding it really difficult’ and she’ll phone me immediately and say: ‘Right, I’ve got 10 minutes before work, but please don’t worry, this happens, this is how we dealt with it …’”“That means everything,” she says. “It’s a wonderful feeling that someone has your back.”On work: ‘I haven’t got a plan’In her career, however, Sunshine strives to keep out of her comfort zone. She started on The ’s fashion desk in 1997.“It was cool Britannia, New Labour was in full swing – of course the old Tory boys there weren’t liking it,” she laughs. “For someone learning things on a newspaper, there was so much going on: the death of Princess Diana, Gianni Versace – it was an interesting time.”But the fashion world wasn’t for her. “I’m still haunted by fashion shows,” she says. So she “fell” into interior design journalism 15 years ago.“I was totally out of my depth when I stumbled into it,” says Sunshine. “But found it so thrilling and fascinating. I asked a million stupid questions that I genuinely wanted to know the answers to, and I haven’t stopped learning. I’m always slightly out of my depth, and that’s great.”It’s an attitude that underpins her career. “I haven’t got a plan,” she says. “I believe in being proactive – and in good luck, bad luck and happy accidents along the way.”On beauty: ‘You can be really smart and enjoy moisturiser and lipstick’When it comes to ageing, she’s equally laid back. “It’s fascinating watching my skin age,” Sunshine says. “I’m OK with it. I think it’s ageing well.”But while she may be laid back about the ageing process, Sunshine strikes a more serious note when it comes to her relationship with the beauty world. “I get annoyed that women are accused of not being serious or intelligent if they have an interest in beauty and fashion,” she says. “They aren’t mutually exclusive you can be really smart and enjoy moisturiser and lipstick. And never listen to anyone who tells you otherwise.”On happiness: ‘I feel lucky every day’This same self-assurance is something she’d have liked her younger self to have had more of. “I wish I had been less fearful of things in my 20s,” she says. “That I was braver – I wish I’d had more confidence.”“I love what I do. And the active choice I made to have a child. I am thrilled, I feel lucky every day, but I’m not going to make out that it’s all perfect, because it’s not.”Beauty is ageless.

They offer a glimmer of hope for the restoration of the country’s badly battered democracy – but only if they are free and fair. Meanwhile, her possible successors are beginning to jockey for position. Carlos Mesa, Evo Morales’ chief rival in the 20 October elections, has announced he is running, while Morales’ party Movement for Socialism (Mas) has said it will put forward “young candidates” in the place of the former president.Mesa’s opposition on the right will be an upstart contender who only burst on to Bolivia’s national scene in the past month. Luis Camacho is the president of the powerful civic organisation in the city of Santa Cruz, Bolivia’s “economic powerhouse”. He emerged as a key player in the deposition of Morales and the subsequent installation of Áñez.Camacho is an ardent Roman Catholic conservative who openly bribed the police to mutiny against the Morales government, with promises of increased retirement pay. In doing so, he pushed aside both Mesa and the Organization of American States, which urged a democratic transition that would have allowed Morales to complete his term. Instead, Camacho and his followers forced Morales’ immediate resignation.Widespread protests rocked the country for 10 days after Áñez’s takeover. Several cities faced shortages of food and gas because of the many roadblocks. “We think her government will bring back the racism we suffered in the past,” said an indigenous demonstrator who didn’t want his name used. “We denounce the coup she has carried out without any authority whatsoever.”On 15 November, the police and military opened fire on indigenous protesters outside Bolivia’s fourth largest city, Cochabamba, killing nine and wounding more than 120. “We were marching peacefully and they began shooting off tear gas and firing on us,” a crying woman told the Andean Information Network. “They treated us like animals.” Four days later, in El Alto, police and military opened fire again on indigenous demonstrators, leaving eight dead and more than 30 wounded.An uneasy equilibrium returned last week, following these violent showdowns between the police – accompanied by the army – and pro-Morales protesters. But how long can this reprieve last, and is Áñez the right person to lead the country through this transition period, and ensure a return to some form of stability?Áñez’s government initially behaved as if it had a mandate to transform the country and wreak revenge on those who supported the Morales administration. She was sworn into office holding a Bible, in a country that is constitutionally secular. Áñez has also been accused of publishing racist tweets against Bolivia’s indigenous majority.The tone she set has been reflected in a resurgence of Bolivia’s deep-seated racism, something that had eased under the 14 years Morales – Bolivia’s first indigenous president – was in power. In response to his government’s promotion of the indigenous wiphala flag, police mutinying against Morales ripped the wiphala off their uniforms. Racist graffiti, such as “Evo, shitty Indian”, in a country where Indian is still a pejorative term, appeared on city walls.Among Áñez’s first moves were recognising Juan Guiadó as Venezuela’s president and throwing out of the country Cuban doctors who were working in impoverished, remote areas. Not long afterwards she exempted the military from any consequences from deploying force against demonstrators, and then provided it with an additional $35m in funding.But Áñez’s government has recently backed down from its initial aggressive stance, and negotiations with the former government’s legislators have resulted in a law authorising new elections within 120 days. An agreement has also been reached with social movement organisations opposed to Áñez. This has led to the lifting of over 90 blockades that have paralysed the country, in exchange for the withdrawal of the military from non-strategic locations, and the revocation of a law granting the military impunity for its actions against protesters.These steps signal some hope that the government is moving closer towards acting as a true transition government, although faith in the promise of fair elections remains thin. “Should we support the new elections?” an El Alto-based Mas supporter asked me. “With all that they have done to us, can we trust that they will respect our vote?” The international community has committed extra assistance in conducting and monitoring the results of the new elections.Mas remains the single largest political force in the country, but its opponents are getting organised. As head of the transition government, Áñez is unable to run herself, but is expected to support Camacho, who announced last week that he intends to run as the leader of a united opposition, with his Potosí equivalent Marco Pumari at his side. This move to consolidate opposition to Mas, by a right wing that has not respected Bolivians’ human rights, feeds uncertainty over the possibility of peaceful and fair elections. The key question remains: if Mas were to win, would the Bolivian right accept the results?• Linda Farthing is a journalist and researcher who has co-authored three books on Bolivia"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05012e97af61096e443597c829ca597c29f34798/0_22_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cead9d36893f1b38289e559343f2c0c","title":"trust in politics has evaporated now it offers only fantasy","story":"There are the politicians – depressing, I know. There are “the people” – that movable feast that includes the lost souls in retail parks who “don’t trust any of them” and the passionate public sector workers who occasionally break through in phone-ins or Question Time to talk expertly of their experience. Then there are the journalists, apparently as untrustworthy as the politicians, dictated to by our evil overlords. Add to this bonfire of the vanities the spark of social media, where everyone lives in their own cocoon of self-righteousness, cancelling, blocking, or piling in on someone who must be evil since they vote differently.It often seems as if this election is happening elsewhere. I did get a leaflet but, outside of the media, I don’t hear much talk about what everyone knows is so important. The disconnect between knowing about the election and feeling it is what interests me.Johnson is a joke – the unfunniest joke ever. I don’t need films to tell me about child hunger. I have gone on enough school trips and, sure, I see Labour has a radical programme, but shilly-shallying around antisemitism is not radical. Maybe the fervour will hit me, but I wonder at my own profession’s failure to reflect the reality of what is happening. What happened to being less London-centric? What happened to listening?We are now post-truth, post-integrity and post-politics in a sense. A manifesto of wishful thinking versus a nonsensical slogan. Trust has evaporated because what is on offer is fantasy.The old journalistic codes are no longer viable. Speed versus veracity? Speed wins. Accountability? From who to whom? Protection of sources? Come on! Audience engagement is low because younger people are not getting their news from “trusted sources”. The BBC’s famous impartiality is not fit for purpose.None of this should surprise us. We have already seen the media bow and scrape before Trump, parsing his word salads as sentences, acquiescing to his tantrums in return for access. We now have the UK’s prime minister avoiding a tough interview, and debates with various mediocrities. Facts and stats are reeled off, but no one is properly challenged. Listen to Joe Rogan getting stoned with his guests on YouTube if you want that kind of truth. Accountability is to be achieved not by empty-chairing people but by much more relaxed interviews. Slow it all down: the need for speed is satisfied by the Twitter stories that implode within an hour or so. The confrontational approach of interviews, where media-trained politicians lie to well-informed presenters, backfires. Everyone is worried about ision and polarisation while feeding these beasts raw meat.There is little attempt to persuade voters to change lifelong voting patterns, even though this is what the main parties need. Corbyn likes to be among those who already love him. Johnson bowls up at a hospital where polite medics barely hide their contempt. Why are journalists reporting these tired stunts?Are press conferences useful? No. The lobby system is corrupt and always has been. Journalists should stop using unnamed sources. Above all, they should treat the people as if they know what is happening – because they do.The Marxist notion of false consciousness is detrimental, as warrioractivists believe that only if some smart person (them) explains to ordinary folk the true economic situation, will the scales fall from their eyes and their enslavement to capitalism end. Show me the evidence for this, please.In reality, the media has lost trust in the people. People are complicated and contradictory – the changing view on immigration is an example of this. Simplification may be the job of the politician, but it is not that of the journalist.The media loses if it cannot engage “the people”, and the people think we are one and the same as the political class. Too often this is true, I am afraid.As the French theorist Guy Debord put it: “The spectacle presents itself as a vast inaccessible reality that can never be questioned. Its sole message is: ‘What appears is good what is good appears.’”This is the passivity that both the spectacle and the media demand. But the people are no longer mesmerised. Pass the remote. They want to see something else."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5763e8bb8e9d5e801d943e8f77789e514ad4e47/0_0_6048_3629/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92eae5e48baae0aa381884a846248829","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of frozen","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘frozen’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘frozen’.Share your photos of what frozen means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 4 December at 10am.

The 48-page report, seen by the , includes 37 pages that are entirely blacked out and only one – the front cover – that was left uncensored.The remaining paragraphs outline plans to help frackers by countering the public’s rising public opposition to the industry with a government-led campaign to develop a “pro-shale narrative”.The report, written in 2016, was finally released after an information tribunal ruled that it would be in the public interest to disclose its findings. Greenpeace has fought a long legal battle with the government over the suppression of the document.Rebecca Newsom, Greenpeace UK’s head of politics, said: “Looking at this black wall of redacted pages, people will be wondering why there’s so little the government is willing to reveal about fracking and so much it wants to hide.“If ministers have really dropped their support for this polluting industry, why not publish this report in full and come clean about what’s been going on behind closed doors for years?”The report’s unredacted paragraphs said that the government was “already undertaking crucial work on communications to increase public acceptability of shale” and promised further government help to develop a “pro-shale nationalregional narrative” and “shale champions”.Greenpeace said the Conservative government should ban fracking permanently after it called an immediate halt to drilling in England this month. The government said it would not agree to any future fracking “until compelling new evidence is provided” that proves fracking could be safe, amid concerns over ground tremors caused by drilling.“People would feel much more confident about the Conservatives’ pledge on fracking if they used the overwhelming evidence of its unacceptable risks to people and our environment to introduce a permanent ban, and put this industry to bed once and for all,” Newsom said.Fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, involves pumping water, chemicals and sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release trapped oil and gas. Environmental campaigners argue that fracking should be banned because it increases carbon dioxide emissions and causes air and water pollution, alongside ground tremors.Jon Trickett, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said the Conservative party has “bent over backwards to serve the interests of big business, especially the oil and gas industry” while ignoring the voices of local people.The report was released to Unearthed, the investigations arm of Greenpeace, after a lengthy battle between the campaigners and the Cabinet Office.Greenpeace uncovered some of the report’s findings last year through a Freedom of Information (FoI) request but the campaigners were barred by Cabinet Office officials from obtaining the full report.Ken Cronin of UK Onshore Oil and Gas said the case for UK shale gas development “is stronger than ever” because the UK is relying more heavily on gas from Qatar and Russia.“This report plainly shows that there is still a lot of work left for us to do, which is what our members will be focusing on in the coming months,” he said.The government’s own data revealed last month that public opposition to shale gas fracking has climbed to record highs while support for the shale industry has slumped to the lowest levels since records began six years ago.The Cabinet Office declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e060e9b7c92433b3dfeccc98b9206778cda8b8e8/0_180_6680_4009/master/6680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99f3a03f42c3a3c5c20bd164c25e9f23","title":"migration v climate europes new political divide","story":"In Hungary and elsewhere, activists are demanding climate action but politicians say biggest threat comes from migrationThe crowd that gathered outside Hungary’s neo-gothic parliament building on Friday was loud, young and passionate. The latest round of global school climate strikes drew several thousand people in Budapest, including the city’s newly elected liberal mayor. They sang, chanted and shouted demands to the country’s politicians to take the climate emergency seriously.But there was little sign that inside parliament, dominated by the Fidesz party of the far-right prime minister, Viktor Orbán, the politicians were listening. It was an illustration of a key new political ide in Europe, between rightwing forces who preach that the greatest danger to life as we know it is migration, and those who say instead that the biggest threat comes from the climate emergency.One of the clearest examples of this is in Germany, which has seen parallel increases in popularity for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) and the Greens. In the eastern half of Europe, where traditionally green politics has found little support, there are signs of a similar ide appearing.Here, too, the climate emergency is filtering into the public consciousness, particularly though not exclusively among younger people in the cities. In October, Gergely Karácsony, an opposition politician who stood on a platform that prominently featured green issues, won a surprise victory in Budapest’s mayoral election against Orbán’s preferred candidate. His team believes that the climate issue has the potential to galvanise opposition to the government.There are several policy plans that will help make Budapest a greener city, he said, but to what extent they can be implemented will depend on funding from Orbán’s central government.Orbán has shied away from pure denial of climate science, but has on repeated occasions suggested the green movement is being used as a cover for liberal, globalist designs. “Aside from a few dozen activists, the whole topic interests no one, which only shows the sanity of Hungarian society,” his chief of staff, Gergely Gulyás, said in September. He also called Thunberg “a sick child”.Benedek Jávor, a Hungarian green politician and former MEP, said the climate scepticism was born out of political rather than ideological reasons. “Orbán has decided to position Fidesz on the populist extreme right and to oppose those new challenges to the political structure posed by the climate movement and Greens,” he said.At a European council summit in June, Hungary was among four countries that blocked an EU-wide plan for net zero-carbon emissions by 2050: the others were Poland, the Czech Republic and Estonia. All have rightwing, populist governments with the exception of Estonia, but there, too, the governing coalition includes a far-right party.Estonia has said in the interim that it is ready to back the target, but the other three holdouts look unlikely to budge. The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, asked at the June summit: “Why should we decide 31 years ahead of time what will happen in 2050?”Last week, the European parliament declared a global “climate and environmental emergency”, but activists have said the words will be meaningless if they are not backed up with tougher action. At a summit next week, the European council may try again to agree the 2050 target.In September, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, singled out Poland for blocking attempts to enshrine the carbon neutrality goal. “Marching every Friday to say that the planet is burning, that’s nice, but that is not the problem. Go protest in Poland! Help me move those I cannot push forward,” he said.Poland has said its reliance on coal means it will need to be compensated more from the central EU budget before it can commit to carbon neutrality.In Hungary, the government says its opposition to the target is also based on purely financial considerations. Orbán’s spokesman, Zoltán Kovács, said: “There’s no need to rush. We have an accepted strategy to 2030, if you want to change that you have to reconfigure the set of available data. Who is going to pay for the cost?”Kovács said Hungary had made it clear that it supported the EU’s broad climate goals and said the prime minister was in no way a climate sceptic. However, the parliament speaker, László Kövér, said in September that those who believed the climate emergency was a bigger danger than migration had been “brainwashed by the media”.A recent scandal over a consultation linked to the 2050 goals is illustrative. Over the past few years, Orbán’s government has spent millions of pounds sending out questionnaires to the population featuring leading questions on issues such as migration, EU interference and the supposed nefarious influence of the financier and philanthropist George Soros.But a survey on climate change last month was given different treatment: buried in a Google document posted in obscure corners of government websites. When opposition parties happened upon the survey and began publicising it, responses started pouring in, with a reported 200,000 Hungarians filling out the form. It was a sign both of the government’s lack of interest and the potential for popular mobilisation around climate issues.Dorosz says he thinks Orbán believes climate activism to be “a kind of hoax and a leftist conspiracy”, but that the prime minister is right to be wary of the issue. “There is a new wave of people who are realising that we’re running out of time. For the opposition, this will be one of the main pillars of our common platform, and part of our core identity.”Additional reporting by Christian Davies in Warsaw and Robert Tait in Prague"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/189701d9c230a3a02db92d28e00a484d70986313/0_37_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bd7cb5bbc8bd779b2e50b214685ed5d","title":"wild seed collectors turn indiana jones in search for resilient crops aoe","story":"More than 370 species were gathered during a six-year mission to widen the gene pool and ensure future food security The seeds of more than 370 wild crop species have been collected as part of a six-year Indiana Jones-style mission to widen the gene pool of staple crops and ensure future global food security in increasingly unpredictable growing conditions.A hundred scientists from 25 countries travelled by horse, canoe and even elephant to reach remote corners of the world in search of wild species of common agricultural crops such as rice, barley, beans and potatoes that billions of people rely on for basic nutrition.Domesticated crops are generally selected for their high yield and nutritional value but this means they have dangerously low genetic ersity. Their wild relatives – many of which are at risk of extinction – are sturdier because they have evolved to survive more challenging conditions.“These wild plants are related to a wide range of important crops,” said Hannes Dempewolf, a senior scientist at the Crop Trust, which ran the project in partnership with the Kew Royal Botanic Gardens’ Millennium Seed Bank project.“They hold the genetic ersity which breeders will need to improve those crops so we can feed 9 billion people with nutritious food.”For centuries scientists have travelled the world collecting plants – initially to grow in gardens – but increasingly they are looking to save seeds and store them in sub-zero vaults to ensure long-term survival.Collectors working on the Crop Wild Relatives (CWR) project spent a total of 2,973 days in the field and saved 4,644 seed samples from 371 crop wild relatives, according to a report published by the Crop Trust. They found seeds from 28 globally important crops, including nine species of banana, 21 of wild barley, two species of wild potato and four of wild aubergine.Researchers examined gene banks across the world and identified which had dangerously low ersity before setting out on expeditions to far-flung parts of Asia, Africa, Europe and South America. They used GPS to tag the location of their discoveries and silica gel to preserve the seeds.In one of the most treacherous expeditions, collectors in Nepal travelled on elephants to ward off tigers and rhinos. They found a species of wild rice (Oryza meyeriana) that is resistant to bacterial blight and collected a relative of the sweet potato (Ipomoea cairica) with high resistance to insect attack that can grow in salty soils.In Ecuador, collectors wore long plastic boots with metal tips to protect them from snakebites while collecting an elusive variety of high-yielding rice (Oryza grandiglumi) that is endemic to tropical America and tolerates flooding.Security concerns caused by al-Shabaab prevented collectors reaching their targets in the Lamu district of Kenya. Missions to north-eastern Nigeria were abandoned in 2015 and 2016 due to the Boko Haram insurgency but collectors were able to access the region in 2017.Dempewolf said: “The expeditions were not a walk in the park. They were perilous at times and physically demanding, with heat, dust, sweat and danger from wild animals – from blood-sucking leeches to tigers. The stories these seed collectors brought back from the field often resemble scenes from an Indiana Jones movie.”Seeds are only ripe for a narrow window of time and if collectors were too early they had to visit the site again. If they were too late they had to wait until the following year.Nicola Ardenghi from the University of Pavia in Italy spotted a type of pea with edible tubers while looking out of a train window between Piacenza and Milan – his team had almost given up hope before it was found.Many of these crops are already threatened with extinction due to deforestation, urban sprawl, conflict and the climate crisis. In some cases, wild crop relatives were already lost. For example in Costa Rica, land which was once home to wild rice has been turned into sugarcane plantations and tilapia ponds.Scientists say this work is more important than ever. “If we are to feed a growing population, we need to make our food crops more resilient. And crop wild relatives can help breeders develop new ‘climate-proof’ varieties,” said Marie Haga, the outgoing executive director of the Crop Trust.The wild relatives of crops share a “gene pool” which means that although they may be different species they are close enough relatives to exchange genetic traits. The collected samples are available to breeders and farmers everywhere and can be crossed with domesticated varieties.Work is already under way to develop 19 new crops with international partners in 38 countries. More than a dozen farmer seed clubs in the Mekong delta of Vietnam are testing rice derived from crosses with wild cousins.“This project has only succeeded thanks to the dedication and hard work of iniduals in organisations around the world working towards a common goal, to safeguard crop wild relatives, that previously were overlooked and disregarded, but probably hold the key to the world’s food security in the years ahead,” said Chris Cockel, Crop Wild Relatives project coordinator at Kew."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/699d96a1f7fdb50f77405468aeb05c499dffd122/0_292_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31c4400f8766be02334252daedf76ad3","title":"martin scorsese the irishman dont watch on phone netflix","story":"Five days after director’s mob epic hits Netflix, Scorsese urges viewers to see it on as big a screen as possibleMartin Scorsese has implored audiences not to watch his films – or those by other directors – on their smartphones.Scorsese was speaking to the Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers in the wake of the Netflix streaming release of his latest film, The Irishman.“I would suggest,” said Scorsese, “if you ever want to see one of my pictures, or most films – please, please don’t look at it on a phone, please. An iPad, a big iPad, maybe.”Following a three-week run in cinemas – where it continues to be shown – The Irishman was made available on Netflix accounts last Thursday. Netflix do not officially release viewing figures, or box office receipts, but numbers for both are likely to be high.Opinion on social media has been split between those championing a cinema viewing for the film, which stars Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci and those embracing its smaller-screen accessibility.Some users have proudly shown themselves watching the film on an Apple phone.Others, meanwhile, have offered guidance about how best to break the three-and-a-half-hour film into a manageable miniseries.This format was emphatically rejected by Scorsese. Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, he said he had “never even thought of it” as suited to such vying. Scorsese, who made an advert for the iPhone 4s in 2012, is winning some of the best reviews of his career for the film, which employs cutting-edge digital technology to tell a tale ning many decades.The film has won some limited criticism for the scant airtime offered to its female stars, most notably Anna Paquin, who plays De Niro’s adult daughter and speaks seven words in her 10 minutes on screen.Speaking to USA Today, De Niro defended the decision of screenwriter Steven Zaillian, saying that such silence was part of the point of the character.“She was very powerful and that’s what it was,” De Niro said. “Maybe in other scenes there could’ve been some interaction between Frank and her possibly, but that’s how it was done. She’s terrific and it resonates.”Other backlash to the film largely stems from superhero movie fans angered by Scorsese’s dismissal of the genre. Speaking at the Tallinn Black Nights film festival in Estonia at the weekend, Dante Spinotti, a cinematographer who worked on films including Marvel’s Ant-Man and the Wasp, said: “I think probably Scorsese wasn’t thinking correctly when he said what he said.“I ide movie-making into two large categories: good movies and bad movies. That’s all there is to it. Why say what’s a movie and isn’t a movie? I don’t see the point.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/081ef4fd488596c2da6beda3d2282fb8f948a2b7/0_168_4992_2995/master/4992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b91067822dd7ef1b08d98488f8817f7","title":"amazon prime premier league football arrival tv hefty price","story":"No matter how glossy the Amazon product, fans are still being sold the same things they already owned in the first placeThe Americans are coming. Or rather, they’re already here, and already launching the next step in a takeover by stealth that may only just be entering its imperial phase.English football has always had its own quiet obsession with American scale, American razzmatazz, and above all American money. In the late 1970s Jimmy Hill and his consortium members managed to lose a million dollars a year on the Washington Diplomats franchise in the North American Soccer League, a venture that saw Hill and co pay $200,000 to watch an injured, essentially immobile Johan Cruyff score a single brilliant goal from inside his own half before the whole thing folded.“I have never forgotten it, or how much it cost,” Hill wrote of that Cruyff goal in his autobiography. “And to this day I look very carefully at any business deal that arrives with an American accent.”On Sunday morning the US’s fifth richest corporation launched its own arrival as a Premier League player with a trip down the Thames on an Amazon Prime barge. Invited parties were offered the chance to hobnob with celebrity guests, perform some kind of “crossing skills” challenge, and generally do lots of things that have little to do with English football and quite a lot to with the more familiar business of high-end salesmanship.There is almost something reassuringly rickety about this unveiling, something reassuringly ITV Digital. English football has always been a stage for speculators. From flighty club chairmen to Rupert Murdoch’s dish-led transformation, the league carries the sweaty fingerprints of a century’s worth of rain-makers and carpetbaggers.At which point, enter Jeff Bezos, who distinguishes himself from this company first by his status as the planet’s wealthiest person, the man who sold the world back to itself in cardboard boxes. And second by the scale of Amazon’s operation, a footprint that allows the Premier League to be offered as a loss leader for the main business of overseeing the digital logistics of a large portion of the human race.Be afraid, traditional broadcasters and, indeed, traditional supporters. This could yet be a profound point of change. Kicking off with Crystal Palace v Bournemouth on Tuesday night Amazon will stream its package of 20 Premier League games across the next three and a half weeks. Coverage is bookended by a simulcast of five games on Wednesday night and then six – yes! Six! – on Boxing Day.Clive Tyldesley will act as the lead commentator. A mob-handed posse of 43 talking punditry heads has been hired, among them Harry Redknapp, Alan Shearer and Gabby Logan. It is a reassuringly glossy, reassuringly familiar-looking package, menaced only by the prospect of substandard UK streaming speeds.But step back a little and this is all part of a wider transatlantic insurgence. Bezos may have the look of a wide-eyed alien frontiersman, but he is following a well-trodden path. The arrival of the Silver Lake investment company at Manchester City last month means seven Premier League clubs now have some form of US ownership. Sky Sports, architect of the boom years, is a US-owned company these days following its sale last year to the broadcast giant Comcast.In the last few months even the newspaper industry has been jolted by the arrival of The Athletic, self-styled Netflix of sports writing, funded by American venture capitalists and openly hostile in its cash-splurging attack on the market share of traditional British media.At the end of which Wednesday night’s Merseyside derby will see British football fans watching the US-owned Premier League leaders on a US-based internet service – with the chance to read about it all on a US-owned subscription website the next day.This is, of course, a sign of continuing commercial good health. The Premier League has succeeded as a global product. Choice, we are told repeatedly, is only good. Welcome to the great global bazaar.And yet like every other aspect of football’s transformation, this comes with a price tag. Amazon’s entrance to the marketplace has been trumpeted as something entirely beneficial. News reports have described the deal as “breaking the stranglehold” of existing broadcasters. Some have written of the freebie offer to existing subscribers and new sign-ups as somehow returning football to free-to-air status (a laughable suggestion: Amazon is nothing if not a mindbogglingly expert cash-raking exercise).Players will earn more, clubs will spend more every part of the football industrial complex will welcome this frothing new income stream. But in reality this money comes, as ever, from those who pay to watch. The entry of BT Sport into this marketplace was similarly trumpeted as a golden moment of choice. In practice it became necessary for football supporters to pay twice, to engage with yet another monthly contract, just to receive essentially the same service.With the entry of a third major provider it remains a late-stage capitalism kind of choice. No matter how glossy and fun the Amazon product, how high the players’ salaries, English football fans are basically still being sold the same things they already owned in the first place.The prospects for genuine change depend on how far Amazon intends to go. This is a company with pockets deep enough to effectively take control, to blow Sky out of the water. Amazon Prime is the most profitable part of the business. With the Premier League thrown in it would perhaps generate significant growth in the same way Premier League football carried Sky’s early satellite service.But there are also hazards. The success of the English league is based on its strength in depth, which is in turn based around collective rights deals, the idea that all clubs in the top tier distribute revenue as evenly as possible. This is a kind of holy founding writ of the Premier League, the principle that allows clubs such as Leicester to challenge however briefly the dominance of the commercial giants.Some clubs, most notably Manchester City, have railed against this distinctly English way of doing things. Amazon’s streaming service would make it easier than ever to disregard, to sell access inidually at the click of a mouse, allowing the bigger clubs to pitch themselves as global revenue monsters to be measured only against Real Madrid, Barcelona, the Dallas Cowboys, the next series of Game of Thrones.For these reasons some will perhaps hope that Amazon is only dipping a toe in these waters. There is an opportunity to change this landscape completely, although into what is another question altogether. Greater revenue, a better service or another small step in English football’s journey into pure commodification."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d21027687e3098464dc55d80cc11963f2856650/0_0_2015_1209/master/2015.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3ff794673fbcb237b3e53df560a4c66","title":"ballon dor lionel messi megan rapinoe","story":"• Barcelona’s Messi picks up sixth Ballon d’Or• Rapinoe beats England’s Lucy Bronze into second placeLionel Messi was named the best player in the world for a record sixth time when he took home the Ballon d’Or at an awards ceremony in Paris on Monday.The Argentinian moved ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo, who has won the trophy five times and finished third in the men’s rankings this time behind Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk. Megan Rapinoe, star of USA’s World Cup winning side, won the women’s award.Messi, 32, received his first Ballon D’Or in 2009, and over the past decade has gone on to become the most celebrated player in football and perhaps the greatest to play the game. “Ten years ago I received my first Ballon d’Or, guided by my three brothers,” he said. “Today, I receive my sixth, guided by my wife and children.“As my wife says, it’s important to never stop dreaming and to always work to improve myself and continue to enjoy myself.

The Bulgaria football union were also fined €75,000.The sanction was criticised by the anti-discrimination network Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare), which said it was disappointed Bulgaria had not been expelled from the competition after being found guilty of a third offence this year, while Kick It Out said Uefa had “missed an opportunity” to send the right message.Uefa has been criticised for its handling of another cases – especially by black players – and Ceferin has conceded that a different, stronger approach is required to tackle what appears to be a worsening problem.Ceferin became president in September 2016 having been the president of Slovenia’s football association for the previous five years. Asked by the Mirror if he had underestimated how badly European football was blighted by racism, the one-time lawyer said: “Yes, I did. The situation in Europe is more and more tense. You can feel it.”Ceferin believes politicians are in part to blame for stoking racism across the continent and is particularly critical of Boris Johnson, who himself had criticised Uefa for their sanctions against Bulgaria.“When a politician who calls women with burqas postboxes or mailboxes then says publicly that he condemns you Uefa – do you reply to that?” Ceferin said. “Do you believe it’s honest? Come on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c565b9e7b7618e440e297e3b3df729fafb60ff50/42_93_2910_1746/master/2910.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c59a5fc2c1b98e9bbda189797999d2a","title":"unai emery language barrier english manager premier league","story":"Spaniard did not fail at Arsenal because of his poor English, but for a modern Premier League manager language is a weapon to be used with precision and nuanceThe first question of the press conference was about Petr Cech. The veteran Arsenal goalkeeper had just announced his retirement from football at the end of the season, and as Unai Emery was asked to offer some words of tribute you could see the cogs whirring in his head as he composed his response. A short pause. “Good afternoon,” he began with his customary courtesy. “First, I think he’s a very big person.”Certainly there could be no qualms about the factual content of the statement, given Cech’s height of 6ft 5in. Yet the suspicion remained that this was not quite the glowing tribute to his outgoing stalwart that Arsenal’s manager had quite intended. And as Emery departs north London, the suspicion remains that it is little comic vignettes like this – as much as anything he achieved on the pitch – that will be the true legacy of his time at Arsenal.Let’s be clear about one thing from the outset: Emery didn’t lose his job at Arsenal because of his language skills. Failure has a nasty habit of amplifying a man’s traits into flaws, and had Arsenal qualified for the Champions League or made a stronger start this season, Emery’s arresting linguistic salad would have been the least of anybody’s concerns.There were also times, to be fair, when the parody of Emery’s English verged on unkindness. It was ultimately to his credit that he tried, even though by his own admission his level was mixed. And if the results occasionally felt as if he was running his own speech through a sort of real-time Google Translate, it takes a certain conviction to eschew the translator and face the cameras in your third language. As Tennyson almost wrote, perhaps ‘tis better to have spoken and garbled than never to have spoken at all.Yet as results began to e, it clearly became an issue: not just in the media but, by all accounts, in the dressing room too. The fact he was perfectly capable of great eloquence in his Spanish-language interviews hardly helped matters. Nor did having to follow Arsène Wenger, perhaps the most articulate foreign manager ever to have worked in the English game. The contrast between “I believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art” and “All the people who work here, I think they help us for all the work” was always going to jar slightly.Perhaps there are wider traits at work here, too. Emery is by no means the first manager to arrive on these shores and have problems with the language. But whereas the struggles of Claudio Ranieri, Juande Ramos and Fabio Capello were regarded as surmountable obstacles – even quaint affectations – Emery’s are somehow regarded as symptomatic of a wider failure. The real lesson here, for Emery and others, is the way that communication – always an essential part of the manager’s armoury – is becoming, in many ways, the very point of the job.Back in those giddy early days, as the first overseas managers began to plant their flags like pilgrims, there was a certain bemusing fascination to the armies of translators and misunderstandings they brought with them. How we chuckled when Ossie Ardiles pronounced it “Tottingham”, or when Capello referred to the former Milan players “Rye Wilkins” and “Mark Hatley” during his first press conference as England manager.By the current decade our patience for foreigners butchering the Queen’s had clearly begun to wear thin. Despite speaking excellent English, André Villas-Boas was roundly ridiculed for his eclectic turns of phrase: Michael Dawson being “a player of immense human dimension” or Jermain Defoe being able to “smell every cross”. In his autobiography, the former Burnley chief executive Paul Fletcher openly scoffed at Villas-Boas’s language skills when he came to interview for a job. “Would Burnley players have understood ‘solidificate’, or some of his other terms?” Fletcher wrote. To which the answer is: um, probably yes.Now, it seems, we’ve come full circle. In an age where clubs are as much made-for-television entertainment vehicles as sporting enterprises, the role of the coach has subtly shifted. Once primarily a behind-the-scenes job, the modern Premier League coach is essentially that of a televangelist. The league position is now largely determined by wage bill, recruitment by the transfer committee, contract negotiations by the board, style of play by the sporting director. The coach’s primary function is thus to tell a story compelling enough that everyone – dressing room, owners, broadcasters and fans – will jump on for the ride.The leading managers in the game – Guardiola, Klopp, Pochettino, Mourinho – recognise this instinctively. Under these new rules, language is no longer an option but a weapon to be used with all due precision and nuance. It is why Diego Simeone will probably never manage in England, why the stock of quieter, less loquacious managers David Moyes and Mark Hughes has never been lower.There is a story about Moyes from his time at Manchester United, when in order to help him prepare for an upcoming press conference, the club’s media team prepared him a sheet of likely questions he might receive. Moyes studied it intently, turned it over, and then with a mixture of incredulity and apoplexy blurted out: “But where’s the answers?”This, essentially, is where Emery erred. His mistake, above all, was to believe that his work would do his talking for him. Ultimately, however, his failure to articulate a coherent identity for Arsenal, to sell himself and his methods, his refusal to feed the dream machine, would hasten his downfall. After all: there’s little point in being able to speak a language if you have nothing to say in it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea785ca0618d08d044e7bc21f1ae28dabc416e76/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c24d4898b8f95c95c8da25cbc6b0ceac","title":"fa cup third round draw live","story":"The Merseyside derby is pick of the ties from an intriguing draw that paired Arsenal with Leeds and Sheffield United with non-league FyldeRight.

Tony Adams has rather dressed down for this occasion, though his jacket does look a tad velvety, though might actually be brushed corduroy. He is promoting this scheme for the third round. Before the draw, we are treated to the traditional sight of Ronnie Radford smashing it in v Newcastle for Hereford United. Craig Elliott, boss of Boston United, has his sights on Rochdale, who his team must beat to reach the next round. Dave Challinor, the long throw king, is manager of Hartlepool and has to beat Exeter. Eastleigh’s chief exec Mick Budny, hope his team can get past Crewe Alex. Jim Bentley, manager of AFC Fylde, is up for the Cup. He is an Evertonian and wants the Toffees in the draw. It seems the draw is not taking place in newly opened The Ardwick, the traditional-style pub that sits within the Etihad exoskeleton but in the Legend’s Lounge, where pictures of Alfons Groenendijk and Alan Kernaghan fill the wall. We are greeted with footage of Manchester City’s 6-0 win in last season’s final. It seems a long time ago Watford are on their third manager since then.Tim Flowers’ Solihull Moors are playing Rotherham United tonight for their chance to reach the third round.AFC Fylde are the only non-league club definitely in the third round draw.

This year, staged at the Etihad, it will be drawn by Micah Richards, a winner in 2011 with City and still only 31, and Tony Adams, three-time winner, perhaps the greatest Arsenal defender of all and possessor of the curious mid-Atlantic of a late-1980s Radio One DJ.The third round ties take place between 3-6 January.

They live in Suffolk with their two-year-old daughter and two catsFor Holly and Sian, a job interview at the end of 2006 kicked off a love story they weren’t expecting. “I was managing the New Players theatre in Charing Cross in London and looking for a front-of-house manager,” Holly says. “When Sian came in, it was a very serious interview, but I did think: ‘Wow – she’s fit.’” During a tour of the theatre, she felt a “jolt of electricity”.As for Sian, she considered herself heterosexual. Yet, when she was offered the job, she had a feeling that it could change her life. “I wasn’t sure why, but it felt like a really big decision.”The pair quickly formed a close friendship. “My friends were wary of her at first,” says Holly. “They thought I was falling for a straight girl and that I’d get my heart broken.” In a “work hard, play hard” atmosphere, they enjoyed drinking together at the pub in the evenings. “One day, I ended up giving her an Indian head massage,” says Sian. Looking back, there must have been more going on than she realised.It wasn’t until Holly went away for a month for an operation that Sian started to question her feelings. “I think these days it’s easier to be gay, but at the time it was still seen as quite a big deal. It felt like something we’d have to keep secret.”Although she had “never connected with anyone like that before”, she was conflicted. When Holly returned in March 2007, Sian went to see her. “She came to my house to tell me that she was ‘definitely not interested in women’,” Holly remembers. But after spotting Sian’s overnight bag, she wasn’t sure that she meant it.“I knew I’d fallen for her, but it seemed easier to walk away,” explains Sian. She quickly changed her mind. “We’d had a few drinks and I remember thinking that I needed to live passionately, so I just decided to go for it. You have to grasp life with both hands,” she says.“Plus, you probably didn’t want to get the night bus home,” Holly laughs.They celebrated their love with a civil partnership in 2012, getting married four years later. “It seemed important to do, because it’s taken such a fight to get here,” says Holly.Although it took Sian longer to recognise the romantic nature of their relationship, she can’t imagine life without her partner. “I’ve met someone who understands me completely and utterly,” she says. “Holly is so genuine, caring, funny and loyal. I don’t know if it’s possible to put into words the connection of meeting ‘the one’.”For Holly, it was her partner’s warmth and kindness that stood out. “She has this amazing aura she’s a beautiful person.”In 2013, the couple moved to Shetland after Holly was offered a new job. “It’s such an amazing place and it was an incredible adventure,” says Sian. The couple spent their time exploring the outdoors. “We loved it there, but we were so far from friends and family and we knew we wanted to start a family.”They made the decision to return to England 18 months later, bringing back their three rescue cats. “We were actually together for a few years before we succumbed to the lesbian cat stereotype,” says Holly. “Although, sadly, one died, so we just have two now.” They had a daughter in 2017 – Sian carried her – and now live in a small town in Suffolk.“We haven’t always had it easy in terms of acceptance from others,” says Holly. “But we’re very lucky to have each other.”Sian agrees. “Sometimes you have to fight for the person you love. I never thought I’d end up with a woman. But love is genderless. You fall in love with a person and for me that’s Holly.”•Want to share your story?

Here’s what you need to knowSwiping singles are big money – it is estimated that the dating market is worth $12bn (£9.3bn) globally. But how do we navigate the glut of options available to help us find love? With about 25 million people in the US alone thought to have regularly used dating apps this year, the sea is stocked with fish aplenty – so should we Bumble, Tinder, Happn or perhaps Grindr our way to success?What is it? The most popular and enduring of the first wave of dating apps, Tinder was founded in 2013 as a way to help US students meet each other in other words, a social network for friendship as well as dating. By 2015, however, Tinder had moved far beyond the campus and was registering a billion swipes on the app every day (left for “no”, right for “yes”), with users spending an average of 90 minutes a day scanning through their geographically defined options. Despite having added “super-likes” and paid-for profile consultancy, the app has become known for one simple reason: hooking up.How do I use it? All you need to do is upload some (ideally well-lit) photos. Personal information can be as minimal as you want it to be, although men may want to be judicious in their use of dog pics: some users were accused of “dogfishing” – posing with furry friends in an effort to attract more dates – on the app.Who will I meet? Tinder is where you are most likely to find anyone and everyone in your local area: the person you see on the train platform each morning who you swear wears a wedding ring the primary-school friend you lost touch with 15 years ago your boss or maybe your ex. Either person can make the first move to start a conversation on the app, so it is anyone’s game.Word of warning If you meet “the one”, merely removing the app from your phone won’t be enough to delete your profile – you will still be roaming the ether looking for love. You have to delete your profile as well as the app to be fully off-grid.Use it if you are looking for … a late-night rendezvous.What is it? Billed as the female-friendly version of Tinder, Bumble is very similar except for the fact that only women can start the conversation. When it comes to same-sex matches, either person can make the first move.How do I use it? Again, users swipe left or right depending on their preference and the requirements for signing up are minimal: images, your name and your age.Who will I meet? With more than 55 million users, Bumble has become many people’s first port of call in the digital dating world Tinder’s open door and hookup-centric reputation puts off some new users.Word of warning Despite taking the lofty position of promising a platform for relationships rather than encounters, Bumble still exists for the same purpose, no matter what your matches may tell you. Watch out for the “softbois” here (alternative-minded emotional manipulators who draw you in with their promises of late-night chats about Lou Reed and Ocean Vuong then leave you high and dry).Use it if you are looking for … flirtatious texting.What is it? Here is where things get a little strange. Hinge’s USP is limiting your pool of potential matches to friends of friends (as gleaned from your Facebook account) or friends of friends of friends, and so on. In theory, you or someone you know should be friends with your match.How do I use it? There is no swiping – instead, users have to answer an array of questions that are posted on their profile page, along with their (again ideally well-lit) images. Question prompts range from the basic (“Most spontaneous thing I’ve ever done” – for some reason, always a holiday) to the aspirational (“A life goal of mine”) and the bizarre (“You should not go out with me if …”).Who will I meet? Hinge’s tagline is “Designed to be deleted” and the tenor of the conversations on the app makes it feel more relationship-focused than others. It is also prime territory for stumbling upon previous matches from other apps who have matured to Hinge’s aesthetic.Word of warning Hinge founder Justin McLeod’s romance with his wife has been turned into an episode of Amazon’s Modern Love series, after the journalist Deborah Copaken’s column on him in the New York Times in 2015 went viral – but it could also be a Hinge cautionary tale. McLeod and his wife met in college, broke up and spent eight years apart before Copaken encouraged him to take action before it was too late. If they had used Hinge, they might never have found their way to each other again.Use it if you are looking for … the one (or are ready to settle for less).What is it for? Things get even stranger here. Happn is designed for you to meet someone in your vicinity, ideally someone you have just brushed past on the street or made awkward eye contact with on the train (perhaps like Michael Fassbender’s opening scene in Shame).How do I use it? You need to be on the app all the time. Every time you see someone who catches your eye, you check the app to see if they are also on it. Then, rather than approach them on the street, you strike up a digital conversation, where you painstakingly recount your non-encounter in the hope that they will agree to a planned meet. Basically, a meet-cute for the socially anxious.Who will I meet? Anyone within a 1km radius, from colleagues to commuters and – God forbid – family members.Word of warning You are likely to bump into your matches again, so it may be harder to live down embarrassing first dates.Use it if you are looking for … convenience.What is it? There are plenty of apps for those with a more rarefied taste – see EliteSingles, which caters for “professionals” Luxy, which describes itself as a “millionaire dating app” and Uniform Dating, for people whose jobs usually involve wearing a uniform (firefighters ready yourselves). But none has the cachet of Raya – the private members’ club of dating apps.How do I use it? You can join only after being nominated by an anonymous “global committee”, which means Raya has become known as the dating app for celebs.Who will I meet? While you may find Made in Chelsea or Hollyoaks cast members on Bumble, celebrities said to have been spotted on Raya in the past include Cara Delevingne, Teri Hatcher and Diplo.Word of warning “Journalist” probably isn’t on the list of Raya-friendly professions, so there is no way to verify these rumours – unless you are able to join yourself.Use it if you are looking for … a story to sell to a gossip magazine.How do I use it? Founded in September 2018, Lumen reached 350,000 users in just six months with its canny reinterpretation of the swiping format. The interface is minimal but clunky – designed for the least tech-savvy Boomers – and has few market rivals.Who will I meet? Late bloomers, orcees and basically any singleton over 50 with functioning knowledge of a smartphone.Use it if you are looking for … a partner for a single parent, or love later in life.What is it? The ultimate, utilitarian ideal of the dating app world. Grindr is marketed as a “social networking app for gay, bi, trans and queer people”.How do I use it? The app removes any frivolous pre-date agonising from the equation and has been serving all manner of location-based meetings since its launch in 2009.Who will I meet? From the curious to the adventurous, all are welcome.Word of warning The anti-Hinge, Grindr isn’t designed to be deleted, but rather to be a quiet fixture on your phone’s home screen, always on hand, no matter the time, place – or relationship status.Use it if you are looking for … anything and everything.What is it? ’s dating app. Eighty per cent of users are  readers, so your political opinions and environmental consciousness will probably be reciprocated. And it is free (to start).How do I use it? This is a website and an app, so you can use your desktop to register your profile, images and personal details, then message away with other singles in your area. If you pay for a subscription, you can see more photos of potential soulmates, plus find out about their hobbies.Who will I meet? The erse range of single  readers (and maybe even some journos). With Soulmates flaunting marriages on its home page, this app is one for those who are in it for the long haul.Word of warning Do soulmates exist?Use it if you are looking for … someone to gaze at over your morning copy of the , of course."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d39d2bfaf5c09d6d1d262af432d55779f26f8db3/19_65_4795_2877/master/4795.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39410d25fcccceb5aa6836bab5d9a886","title":"the hollywood christmas parade 2019 in pictures","story":"The Hollywood Christmas Parade is an annual event held along Hollywood Boulevard on the Sunday after Thanksgiving Day.

If they’re not, no, you can’t because a child under 18 can’t own land or property in the UK. But assuming it is a possibility, whether you should go ahead with selling your flat to them at a discount price is quite another matter.Selling your flat to your children for the price you paid for it doesn’t reduce any potential capital gains tax (CGT) bill because, for tax purposes, the gain (or loss) you make on disposal of the flat is taken to be the difference between its market value and the price you paid for it even if you sell for less that market value. The difference between the price your children pay and its true value also counts as a gift for the purposes of inheritance tax. However, if you’re still alive seven years after making the gift, it loses its liability to inheritance tax.If your children already own their own homes, as well as not qualifying for first-time buyer relief, they would also have to pay the higher rate of SDLT – which is the standard rate plus three percentage points – on the purchase of your flat.Whatever their current ownership status, they should be aware that they will be liable to CGT when they come to sell your flat (assuming they did buy it).

The estimates are based on wealth reports produced by Forbes magazine and Credit Suisse.“This report should shock anyone who cares about the state of the UK today,” said Dr Wanda Wyporska, the executive director of the Equality Trust. “Such a huge gap between the very rich and the vast majority of the country is dangerous. Such extreme wealth in the hands of so few people demonstrates just how broken the economic system is.“Behind the numbers, the UK’s extreme inequality is the story of Ferraris and food banks. Families across the country are working for their poverty and unable to promise their children a better, secure future. The rich live longer and their children get the best education, the best jobs and a leg up on the housing ladder. The UK’s economy delivers billions for a few and poverty for millions. Destitution is the sad reality for millions this Christmas.”Tackling inequality has become a key battle ground in the general election campaign, with the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, vowing that a Labour government would go after super-rich people who exploit a “rigged system” to benefit themselves at the expense of the many.Corbyn named five other members of “the elite” he would target if he becomes prime minister: Mike Ashley, the founder and chief executive of Sports Direct Crispin Odey, a hedge fund boss who made millions betting against the pound in the run-up to the EU referendum Rupert Murdoch, who owns the Sun and the Times Hugh Grosvenor, the Duke of Westminster, who controls a large central London property empire and Ratcliffe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6801197fef5ce723afdcfc4533f8ab18e8ff5fc3/0_0_6048_3630/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8c1119013e3e03f9dfc14daddf0dc4f","title":"election 2019 shifting identities in peterborough podcast","story":"Robert Booth on the battle for Peterborough, one of the key swing seats set to determine the election.

I just dedicated myself. I said I would put myself on a 15-year prison sentence to boxing and have that focus.”That was in 2008 but when it was put to Joshua that he might retire in 2023 he replied: “I could go on longer. It’s just a mindset, a prison mindset, like a military mindset, lockdown. Training, focus, sleep. You have to have that mindset. You have to be in that regimen.”That includes celebrating his birthday at his digs in Sheffield where he talked to his nutritionist Mark Ellison about training. “I live boxing, I live it, that’s all I do,” Joshua said. “I have a lot more energy now I am no longer focused on any other opponent than Ruiz.”Joshua has also corrected the failings of his first camp against Ruiz, when he lacked sparring partners who could replicate the Mexican-American’s style and paid the price when he was stopped in the seventh round.“Sparring is important because it is the closest thing you can get to the fight,” Joshua said. “We don’t always want to do it because it is a big cost but it’s the best way to prepare. They throw everything at me, if I do 12 rounds then it’s with five different people back-to-back and I am dealing with every shot coming at me.“Ruiz doesn’t get enough credit for his jab. We need to be prepared for that, which is why we got so many sparring partners in.”Joshua has also been speaking regularly to Wladimir Klitschko, who has given him “tonnes of advice” on cutting out salt, improving his hydration and how to prepare his body better. “It’s almost good that I lost because all of the sparring partners are coming out of the woodwork now, no one wanted to spar me before,” Joshua said.“Klitschko told me it would happen, he said he could only get good sparring after he had lost. It’s ended up like a blessing because everyone wants to come to the gym now. When we lace the gloves up now there is no holding back.”“You have someone like Vasyl Lomachenko, who is great but then you have some who get better with every fight, like Canelo Álvarez, and that is what I am. You are going to see me get better every step of the way. One loss can’t strip your skin off overnight, when you put your solid foundations in, one chip in the brick can’t destroy the whole building.”Joshua said he has watched the first fight repeatedly in slow-motion, looking for how he could correct his mistakes. “Until he caught me, I was beating him to the punch,” he said. “They are all quick, but first two or three rounds I was beating him to the punch. He got hurt, I just have to keep down this time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c4026383e577cceef25532da31a37f76323d1c2/50_0_2098_1259/master/2098.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ec2b955504e3276a229925f73ed7cf0","title":"tiger woods interview win major augusta","story":"“We did it.” These words yelled by Tiger Woods to his caddie, Joe LaCava, as they embraced in celebration of Masters success form part of 2019’s outstanding sporting moments. Woods may not seem one for looking back but he has now revealed he has finally watched a rerun of that Augusta triumph in the company of the same man, with a key recollection being a fear of failure mid-championship.“I sat down and watched it with Joe,” Woods said. “He came down to Florida to do a TV spot then he and I just sat there, had a few beers and watched it.“We spoke about the conversations we had over each shot. Some of our friends and family who were there were like: ‘Oh, my God, you guys really talked about that?’ But that’s what we were talking about, that’s what was going on. We were running through all the scenarios, Joe looking at the boards, I am looking at the boards.“We were trying to figure out what was going on who birdied what, who was making a move. We were having those discussions on the fairway about what we needed to do while still staying focused about executing.“It was a lot of fun seeing it back and sharing it with Joe, because he has been through all the tough times with me as well as the good times.”Having returned from the depths of physical despair, it is little wonder Woods uses “incredible” to describe his year. That 15th major win – and his first since 2008 – was backed up by victory at the Zozo Championship in Japan to match Sam Snead’s record of 82 PGA Tour titles.Intriguingly, he appears to derive as much pleasure from the nature of his Masters success as the fact it transpired at all. Woods was two off the lead heading into the final round.“I’m just proud of what I’ve done, to come back to win another major championship but also to do it in a different way,” he said. “I’ve finally come from behind to win a major championship. I finally know I can do that. I had never done it 14-1 is not a bad record but I had never done it this way.”The 43-year-old admits a return to Augusta will prompt reflection. “I think we all get a bit more reflective as we age,” Woods said. “My window is a lot smaller than it used to be, so understanding that and recognising it is not a bad thing.”Jack Nicklaus’s haul of 18 majors remains an understandable target. “I think it is. I have to do everything right. I have to have all the pieces come together.”Woods does not object to analysis of his performance and character. “That’s life. What we have done in the past and what could be in the future,” he said. “Unfortunately tomorrow is never promised, so I live in the present, enjoy that moment while obviously making plans. People will look back on the past as well.”This week Woods hosts the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas, where his latest comeback essentially started in 2017. Afterwards Woods enters new territory by captaining USA in the Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne. “I always thought I was going to be a captain,” said Woods in response to whether inidual pursuits once made this a non-starter.The obvious subplot relates to when and where Woods will captain USA in the Ryder Cup, a competition that has not been kind to him. Woods formed part of a Ryder Cup taskforce established to improve American fortunes after a heavy defeat at Gleneagles in 2014. He has now supplied clarity on the broader picture.“It’s hard. For Phil Mickelson and I. It was a case of we needed to take a step back, take a look at it as a 20-year run. It is going to outlive us, so how do we set it up for that and how do we set it up to be successful? That’s what we have done and we will let it play out over the next 16 years and see how it ends up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1edb08f8c66dd3a3097dd86ac52f6f8d5d67ee40/0_0_2094_1256/master/2094.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59f2924aca83a0c69cd99b7921404f83","title":"new zealand v england second test final day live","story":"The heavens have opened in Auckland about 70 miles away...70th over: New Zealand 211-2 ( Williamson 96, Taylor 84) Ben Stokes bowls the last over before lunch. Williamson considers the forecast and pulls him twice, quite beautifully to the square leg boundary. They all potter off for sandwiches and we catch a glimpse of the sky, which is darkening. A bumbling morning for England, with those two drops by Ollie Pope and meme creator Joe Denly. The game drifts towards its natural end. Time for a quick stretch, back soon.69th over: New Zealand 202-2 ( Williamson 88, Taylor 83) Time for some Joe Root. He brings the fielders forward, he urges them back with his long conductorial fingers. Sleeves buttoned down, he twirls Taylor plays him with nuff respect, then a nudge down to square leg to reach 7000 Test runs, only the second New Zealander to get there. Then Root turns one into Taylor’s pads, big appeal turned down, but decides not to review. 68th over: New Zealand 201-2 ( Williamson 88, Taylor 82) Against the run of play, a little Christmas sparkle . Stokes fires one in short, Williamson misjudges as he swivels to pull and the ball pings into his helmet and sprays behind where Pope catches it. A half-hearted appeal from both Stokes and Pope and Root decides to go for the review. And why not? He’s not out - there’s no contact with the swooshing bat, and Lockie Ferguson brings out a new helmet. Taylor and Williamson continue to get their eye in for the battle ahead across the Tasman. New Zealand’s lead is 100.67th over: New Zealand 197-2 ( Williamson 87, Taylor 80) Curran heads wide of the crease to send the ball in. Williamson eases a couple of runs and starts to think about lunch. 66th over: New Zealand 195-2 ( Williamson 85, Taylor 80) Ben Stokes, to bowl for your life? He digs six short balls into unresponsive soil, undaunted by the lack of reward. He laughs in the face of pancakes.65th over: New Zealand 190-2 ( Williamson 84, Taylor 77) Nowt of note. Speaking of Gatting, writes Tom from North London, watch this. 64th over: New Zealand 186-2 ( Williamson 80, Taylor 77)  Denly. Two singles. Lots of school kids in maroon t-shirt and shorts frolic on the grass. 63rd over: New Zealand 184-2 ( Williamson 79, Taylor 76) The Christmas perfume ads have hit - though none as memorable as the one years ago for L’egoiste that involved lots of people opening and closing shutters loudly whilst shouting. It made quite an impression at a sensitive age. Not that I ever bought it. Curran skips through a maiden with a smile on his face and a lolly in his pocket.62nd over: New Zealand 183-2 ( Williamson 79, Taylor 75) Denly whizzes through his over, as if he might fast-forward through the day so fast that it disappears. 61st over: New Zealand 179-2 ( Williamson 75, Taylor 75) Woakes strides actively to the crease. Williamson trots through for a single. Would it be too harsh to say the most interesting thing that is going to happen before lunch is the race to see who reaches their century first? Though when I say race, I mean it in its broadest possible sense. Antnie writes from across the channel. I am following, avidly, I promise, in deepest France, though I’m having trouble picturing pink stains on bowlers trousers. I hope your hottie bottle is under control tonight.No hot water bottle yet - that’s for the 1.40am shift. Perhaps Daniel has got his ready and waiting by the kettle right now.  60th over: New Zealand 178-2 ( Williamson 74, Taylor 75) And with a single to mid-on off Denly, that’s the 150 partnership between Williamson and Taylor, off 306 balls. They reach out, and shake hands. 59th over: New Zealand 176-2 ( Williamson 72, Taylor 75) A bearded Chris Woakes is rather discombobulating , he starts to look like all the other bearded warriors, a bit of Mark Wood, with a touch of Virat Kohli. Beards have definitely got better though. Compare Mike Gatting’s to the 2019 versions. 58th over: New Zealand 175-2 ( Williamson 72, Taylor 74) Denly is bowling with his shades on, as Root polishes the ball for him on the back of his trousers. Not much happens, but the odd brain cell starts to disengage.57th over: New Zealand 172-2 ( Williamson 70, Taylor 73) And a maiden from Woakes, as the wind ruffles the players’ shirts. And some more appreciation for Steven Finn pops into my email box.  Good evening, Tanya, writes Peter Stoker. Not much to cheer about in this series other than, perhaps, the emergence of Steve Finn as a splendidly genial and good-natured pundit on TMS (although I appreciate, of course, that you have to follow the Sky telly feed). Let’s hope the lad has a good few years left steaming in from the Pavilion End at Lord’s. But after hanging up the size 16s...56th over: New Zealand 172-2 ( Williamson 70, Taylor 73) Denly again, Taylor and Williamson are untroubled, Taylor laying into a crisp cut for four off his last ball. 55th over: New Zealand 164-2 ( Williamson 68, Taylor 67) Time for a bit of Chris Woakes, who takes long, brisk strides back to his mark and unfurls a tidy over.  Surely if the DRS was applied to Schrödinger‘s Cat, writes Kim Thonger, we’d find out once and for all if the ruddy thing was dead or alive and put an end to the uncertainty? 54th over: New Zealand 163-2 ( Williamson 68, Taylor 66) Nice little bit of captaincy here, as Root throws the ball to Denly - let him try to make amends, or at least not mull over the drop isolated in the field. The wind is getting up, and rattling the trees surrounding the ground.53rd over: New Zealand 161-2 ( Williamson 66, Taylor 66) Fortified by drinks, Archer rolls through another over. It’s free entry today by the way, so if you’ve got time on your hands in Hamilton, why not mosey down. Joe Denly should never have gone to the Marnus Labuschagne catching school, snorts David Markham.while Dave Harris wonders, “Do you think Mrs Denly’s going to be letting Joe hold their little’un (https:mobile.twitterjoed1986status1172466162761908225) uunsupervised when he gets home?52nd over: New Zealand 157-2 ( Williamson 65, Taylor 63) Good old Stuart Broad runs yet another over into those tired old legs. Enthusiasm undimmed. Three not particularly memorable singles and that be drinks.This seems a bit cruel, but here you go, to accompany your coffeecocoa.51st over: New Zealand 155-2 ( Williamson 62, Taylor 61) A maiden from Archer. Trouble at the last ball when Taylor sends Williamson back and he only just makes his crease via a sprawled e. 50th over: New Zealand 155-2 ( Williamson 62, Taylor 61) A maiden from Broad, as poor ostracised Denly trudges around the field unloved. Give him a hug someone.49th over: New Zealand 154-2 ( Williamson 62, Taylor 61) Oh dear. Cover your eyes. Joe Denly has just dropped the sitter of all sitters. Archer bowls to Williamson, one of those balls where he doesn’t use his front arm, Williamson tips it straight into Denly’s hands at short midwicket, and I mean straight, Denly doesn’t move his feet an inch, and just waits for the ball to come into his hands, which it does, and then falls straight back out. Broad covers his mouth with his hands , Archer, who was already celebrating, puts head to his hand and then laughs. 48th over: New Zealand 151-2 ( Williamson 59, Taylor 61) There’s a scattering of bare-footed crowd on the banks either side of the sightscreen as this game meanders away. A steady over from Broad. 47th over: New Zealand 149-2 ( Williamson 59, Taylor 61) Archer again, nothing too steamy, but on the button. Just a couple from the over. Geoff Wignall offers this up:And you expect me to.open the door?46th over: New Zealand 147-2 ( Williamson 58, Taylor 60) A double-switch as Broad replaces Stokes. Nothing much to report except for Zak Crawley tripping over himself in the covers, like a British rom-com hero negociating unexpected ice.45th over: New Zealand 143-2 ( Williamson 58, Taylor 56) So Root turns to Archer. They have a man to man at the top of the mark and Root shuffles the field. Taylor swivels and pulls a short one, 117kph, for a single, then Williamson ducks, like a leapfrogger. I think if we’ve learned anything it’s that New Zealand are good enough to beat England, and that the groundskeepers should be more adventurous in preparing pitches for a result, writes Joe Harvey, wisely, This second test has been disappointing. As an England supporter, I worry that we haven’t learned much- we’re still trying to figure out if Root is cut out for Captaincy, and if the Bowling attack needs a more aggressive shuffle.I don’t think our bowling hand is too bad: Broad, Archer, Curran, Woakes, Stokes - then throw in Anderson and Wood with Mahmood sculling around in a florescent tabard. 44th over: New Zealand 143-2 ( Williamson 58, Taylor 56) And fifty for Taylor too, a more chunky, risky, effort but very entertaining. He jumps off the ground to swish a Stokes wide one over gully for four, then next ball sends him through the covers for successive boundaries. Taylor and Williamson stroll together, shoot the breeze, and touch gloves.43rd over: New Zealand 134-2 ( Williamson 58, Taylor 47) Beautiful from Kane Williamson, first a dreamy extra cover drive, then he drops the hands and kisses Curran down to third man for another four. I like him too. And Ramprakash, they both add something new to the squad.42nd over: New Zealand 124-2 ( Williamson 49, Taylor 46) Taylor decides to lay into Stokes with a swift-handed slap through backward point for four. Lots of muscle but no reward yet for Stokes. 41st over: New Zealand 115-2 ( Williamson 45, Taylor 40) Curran goes through the motions, all effort and sweaty hair. Williamson plays him poker-faced until stealing a couple down to long-off. A cracking email from John Starbuck.1) You’d think that a sport more obsessed with stats than perhaps any other (OK Baseball, but that’s just a sort of rounders) would place more trust in meteorological forecasts and start even earlier on the final day2) We seems to be selecting players for the next but one series at the moment and even later given the chance to select youngsters who need overseas experience3) Mince pies should, properly, be accompanied by glasses of Madeira now we’re in December. Boast: since the early 1980s I’ve been buying an extra bottle of Madeira each year to lay down for my retirement and, now it’s arrived, I’m very pleased to say it was all worthwhile. The problem is that word has got about and I now have to take a 40-year old bottle to every Yuletide family party. Note to the uninformed: Madeira in bottles is known to mature fabulously well for longer and varied treatment - in my case, several house removals, which isn’t the same as multiple trips across the Atlantic but it’ll do4) Here’s hoping you’ll sign off this series on a high.40th over: New Zealand 113-2 ( Williamson 45, Taylor 40) A Stokes tester, he torments Williamson with variations of length and bounce. You could say that, or it just means he’ll be a more confident captain with some form behind him, and can grow into the job while other candidates developsecure their place in the side. 39th over: New Zealand 113-2 ( Williamson 43, Taylor 40) Two contrasting boundaries for Taylor off Curran, a cover drive, all smooth hazelnut, then a Toxic Waste outside edge, down through third man.My nephew also has a new joke book. His favourite so far?37th over: New Zealand 103-2 ( Williamson 43, Taylor 32) A drop! Stokes shoves one short and Williamson gloves it down the leg-side only for a porridge-legged Ollie Pope to drop it . To rub salt into the wound, Williamson then pulls Stokes with pizazz for four and New Zealand go into the lead.37th over: New Zealand 99-2 ( Williamson 39, Taylor 32) A smart shy at the stumps from Sam Curran could have had Taylor in trouble, but his foot was comfortably back over the crease. Curran completes a neat maiden.William Hargreaves drops a line. What do you feel will be the outcome, how fair a reflection of two teams’ capabilities would this be, and how do you think this will influence two teams going forward, please?Gosh. I think that deserves two sides of A4. But briefly: a draw, a fairly true reflection (of England abroad) and I think it will give NZ some confidence going into the Australian series and reveals England’s weaknesses to be where they knew they were anyway. Incisive spin, Spots 2 and 3 in the batting order, and the killer instinct with the ball out of English conditions. 36th over: New Zealand 99-2 ( Williamson 39, Taylor 32) I was wondering whether Archer might get the ball from the other end, but Root has plumped for Stokes who toyed with Taylor yesterday evening. Again he seems to get Taylor in two minds, with the odd ball behaving unexpectedly off the pitch. Taylor pulls, inconclusively.35th over: New Zealand 98-2 ( Williamson 39, Taylor 31) Sam Curran is handed the ball and scampers in from the Barmy Army end where a half-cut rendition of Jerusalem assaults the ears.  And out the players come - for perhaps the last session of the series.  An early joke, for our more mature readers, care of James Debens.Someone’s stolen the Trotters’ Reliant Robin van and sold it to the US. No, but Rodney’s bloody livid. Another James, Butler this time, thinks Mike Atherton has forgotten the lesson of the near past.It feels a bit ironic to now be saying that Sibley is ‘a bit limited’. Personally I would have given away my most treasured cricketing possession (a signed copy of ‘Angus Fraser’s Tour Diaries’) during the Ashes if we could have found a ‘limited’ player who could have ground out 20 between lunch and tea in the face of Pat Cummins. Mark Butcher fancies Moeen Ali to rejoin England for the South Africa tour. I do hope so. Then they move on to Jofra Archer - Atherton says he’s an absolute diamond, but has realised how difficult Test cricket is away from England and the Dukes ball. Says we need to dampen expectation a little, but he’s a wonderful player. My son has a new joke book. This is his favourite.Bill: I’m letting my pet pig sleep on my bed.Jenny: What about the smell?Bill: He’ll just have to get used to it.In the Sky studio they’re having a selection chat for the South Africa series. Mike Atherton think Dom Sibley might not be right, for now, and looks a bit limited. He suggests they might shove Denly up to open and thinks Ollie Pope looks the best English batsman since Joe Root.  Butcher would keep Sibley for the tour to South Africa and see what happens. The England touring staff, according to Atherton, are both quite optimistic about Sibley and Crawley because of the way they are shaping up in practice.It’s not raining by the way, looks quite nice actually.So, here we are, two mince pies into December, with just one day left of the first tour of the new regime. Downpours are due, probably by lunch, so any hopes of England levelling the series, or New Zealand pulling another rabbit out of the hat, seem remote. It’s all about the little presents left unobtrusively at the foot of the tree. In foil, England’s longest Test innings for four years. With raffia, Ollie Pope’s debut fifty and Tom Latham’s century. Gift-boxed, Joe Root’s double ton. And finally, busting out of a too-small envelope, Neil Wagner’s five wickets.On Saturday New Zealand fly to Australia, where they need to hit the ground running. The first of the three Test series starts at Perth, before moving on to Melbourne on Boxing Day and Sydney at New Year. Their last Test win in Australia was in 2011 , but you have to travel back to the era of big hair and pixie boots to unearth their last series win, when Richard Hadless was in charge way back 1985-86. England have a couple of warm-up games before the first Test against South Africa which starts at Centurion on Boxing day. Three more Tests, three ODIs and three T20s follow.But we’ve still got today. Something to play for, even if it is Williamson and Taylor knocking themselves into form before the rain . Play is due to start at 10.30am NZST or 9.30pm GMT. See you soon!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/593206285b5350dc1e10c65a7ae116135b73f0e4/0_118_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2389eb64527fa99305d84537735d539d","title":"eu investigates google data collection practices","story":"European commission surveys companies about agreements they have made to share dataThe European commission is launching a new investigation into Google, examining the company’s data collection practices, according to a report from Reuters.During the past week, the competition commission has sent out questionnaires to companies that work with Google asking them about the agreements they have made to share data with the search firm.The regulator said: “The commission has sent out questionnaires as part of a preliminary investigation into Google’s practices relating to Google’s collection and use of data. The preliminary investigation is ongoing.”Foo Yun Chee, reporting for Reuters, said the questionnaires for the latest investigation showed that the EU’s focus was on “data related to local search services, online advertising, online ad targeting services, login services, web browsers and others”.The new investigation suggests that the EU is not yet done with its scrutiny of Google, which has already resulted in more than €8bn (£6.8bn) of fines. A 2017 investigation into Google Shopping resulted in a fine of €2.4bn in 2018, anticompetitive practices involving Google’s Android smartphone operating system were the basis of a €4.3bn fine and those were followed in 2019 with a €1.5bn fine over advertising violations.In the latter violations, the competition commission has placed increasing emphasis on the contracts Google has signed with third parties – restrictions which are not traditionally a part of antitrust enforcement, but which are widely seen as crucial to how companies such as Google maintain their lead.In the Android case, for example, Google was criticised for requiring handset manufacturers to agree to terms that banned them from building phones using non-Google versions of Android.Tech analyst Ben Thompson argues that such contractual restrictions are increasingly common. “This is an area ripe for enhanced antitrust enforcement,” Thompson wrote in March. “These large tech companies have enough advantages, most of them earned through delivering what customers want, and abetted by the fundamental nature of zero marginal costs. Seeking to augment those advantages through contracts that suppliers can’t say ‘no’ to should be viewed with extreme skepticism.”As well as the EU investigation, Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority on Monday announced its own inquiry into Google, focusing on the company’s acquisition of UK data science startup Looker.In a statement, the CMA said it “is considering whether it is or may be the case that this transaction, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 and, if so, whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services.”The acquisition, announced in June, saw Google spending more than £2bn on the company, intended to improve the analytics services Google provides customers of its cloud platform."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b22ea600a9c5a5da1fc0947f2da17793e2e986f/0_630_3288_1972/master/3288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2abd6becfdbf6c0607b18870de42788c","title":"the big picture gideon mendel south africa","story":"In 1990, when the photographer Gideon Mendel left his native South Africa for London, he deposited a number of boxes in his friend’s garage in Johannesburg for safekeeping. These boxes contained, among other things, negatives and transparencies from Mendel’s harrowing first few years as a photojournalist during the struggle against apartheid in the mid-80s.Over the next three decades, Mendel became renowned for his intimate, socially engaged photography, documenting the effects of the HIVAids crisis and climate breakdown. For one project, from his Drowning World series, he has gathered nearly 2,000 water-damaged family photographs picked up on his journeys through flooded communities in the US, India and elsewhere.In this image, taken at a mass funeral in Duduza township outside Johannesburg in 1985, the damage forms a frame within a frame, cropping the image to highlight the protester. The effect is “amazing”, says Mendel, even if the context was sobering: the young activists being buried were killed when an undercover agent gave eight people booby-trapped hand-grenades, which exploded when the pins were pulled. Funerals such as this often led to further outbreaks of violence, and more funerals.“The original images have an almost radioactive energy from that period they carry all the weight of history,” says Mendel. “And then you have this new layer, the effects of water and time and mould on the images” – they speak to Mendel of the deterioration of memory, and the fading of hope in post-apartheid South Africa – “which creates a much more complex and nuanced statement than the photograph can make on its own. It takes the image into a whole new dimension.”Freedom Or Death by Gideon Mendel is published by GOST (£35)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82f6d38163e3a8dda4cb63131ab3500c1010d0b5/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=926a5916e2ce323e6ff2d05ff9fc75c7","title":"man vs bear discovery channel weirdest tv show","story":"In a staggering, strange new series, people take on actual bears in physical tasks and, quite predictably, loseAn MMA fighter stands on top of a platform, hopping up and down as he prepares for a game of tug-of-war. “Come on baby, get some of this,” he shouts down at his opponent, attempting to psyche him out. Except he can’t psych his opponent out, because his opponent is a 1,400lb grizzly bear who unthinkingly yanks him screaming from the platform in about 10 seconds. A commentator intones: “I’ve seen just about everything in sports, but this tops it all.”Welcome to Man vs Bear. It is a television programme about some men who want to beat a bear in a fight. It is a real television programme that really exists. Donald Trump is president of America.In round two of Man vs Bear, the men try to push a 2,000lb barrel across a patch of land faster than a bear can. They all fail, because the bear is eight and a half feet tall, and also a bear. In round three they have to eat a giant mound of bear food faster than a bear can. Again, they all fail because the bear is a bear, and it has both the jaw size and dental structure to accommodate the food, and it weighs between six to 10 times more than the men, and the men are not bears. To reiterate, this is a real television programme that someone went to the trouble and expense of making, and Donald Trump is the leader of the free world.I don’t think I’ve ever seen a show as stupid as Man vs Bear. And that’s saying something because, for a while back there, shows really tried to be stupid. There was Naked and Afraid a Bear Grylls-style survival show about people who were nude for some reason. There was Man vs Food a food series determined to make all food look unnaturally revolting. There was Eaten Alive where a man attempted to get eaten whole by a snake. There was Touch the Truck. There was Don’t Scare the Hare. Before streaming came along and provided everyone with a smorgasbord of prestige drama, this is the sort of dumb crud that people actually watched.So in a way, it’s good that someone has made Man vs Bear. It’s a beautiful throwback. It’s heartening that, in this fractured media landscape, there is still room for an aggressively gormless television programme about a bunch of absolute idiots who have the sheer deluded balls to assume that they would ever be able to beat a bear at anything at all.And, obviously, the bear does win. The bear wins everything. It’s a bear. It’s a giant bear that dwarves all humans in every physical manner imaginable. Of course it’s going to win. It’d be a different story if the producers levelled the playing field a little and introduced a few categories that were weighted in the human’s favour. Maybe if there was a round about sudoku, or tying a Windsor knot, or working on the advice of a relationship counsellor in a doomed bid to save a failing marriage, the humans might have a shot. But no. Man vs Bear is all about people who think that they can be a bear better than a bear can. They’re all doomed right from the get-go. But, honestly, God bless them for having that sort of chutzpah in the first place. We need it these days.It’s hard to see what the point of Man vs Bear is, having watched the first episode. Is it that we should fear bears? Because that seems sort of redundant, given how inherently petrifying bears are. Is it that man will never be able to eat a pile of dead insects faster than a bear? Because, if it is, who does that information even serve? Is it, perhaps, that bears are some of the most majestic creatures on Earth, and that they deserve our respect? Because, if that’s the case, don’t make a TV show where you goad bears into playing tug-of-war with MMA fighters. Because, and I hate to break it to you like this, watching it sort of cheapens the majesty a teensy bit.In the final round of Man vs Bear the men get inside a big metal ball and try and stop a bear from pushing it into a ditch. They always fail, because they are normal-sized men and the bear is literally a bear.

It is hard to imagine any other television show that has inspired such dedication, if not quite devotion. Women, particularly queer women, came together to watch it, shared discs both legal and otherwise, and developed a complicated, love-hate relationship to its shiny saga of wealthy West Hollywood lesbian life. The show has been passed on and passed down over the years, as new generations have discovered it in their own ways. Partly, its longevity, despite its flaws, stands as a testament to the heady brew the show concocted, but at the same time it stands as an indictment of the fact that nothing has really taken its place since.In the 10 years since The L Word ended, in a gloomy cloud of terrible writing and bizarre plot twists – justice for Jenny – the internet’s intolerance for mistakes has become ferocious. There was a lot to question, first time around: biphobia and then erasure, unforgivable ethnic stereotyping, and, most famously, its tone-deaf trans storyline. Some also objected to its privilege, wealth and glossy sheen. Personally, I found that flashy, entertaining, camp over-the-top-ness to be one of its main strengths. There are plenty of miserable LGBTQ stories to be found in TV and film history. For the first time, lesbians were fun. It was never more L Word than when they decided to write an entire season about a movie adaptation of a fictional literary version of the characters in the series. It may have tripped up along the way, but it always had gumption.So, too, does The L Word: Generation Q, which opens with an explicit sex scene, though, to re-establish the boundary-pushing credentials that it once had, it adds an accent, a talking point, of this being period sex. I quite liked the cheekiness of it. Here we go again, I thought. Even though the showrunner has changed – it is now Marja-Lewis Ryan, with original creator Ilene Chaiken as executive producer – and it has learned many lessons from its first time out, it remains recognisably itself, and there is nothing quite like it.The action has shifted from West Hollywood to Silver Lake, where the new generation are flourishing. Sophie and Dani are the Bette and Tina of 2019, about to get engaged, while their roommate Micah, a trans man, navigates the dating scene, with a special interest in his hot new neighbour. Finley, “a traditional lesbian, when it comes to tools”, completes the quartet with rogueish swagger. They have good chemistry, solid stories, and lots of sex, and you get the sense that they are only cartoonish when they are intended to be so. Somehow, this combination of older concerns – orce, parenting – with 20-something strife about dating, housing and family, gives it room to breathe.The L Word: Generation Q had a lot to do. It had to ensure it did not repeat the missteps of the original, while maintaining its spirit it had to stand out in an age where gay storylines are not quite so scarce and it had to be better than its “graphic novel spinoff”-esque new title suggested it might be. It is all done of those things, with flair. It felt more joyful to have it back than I could possibly have imagined. It is popcorn fun, highly entertaining, rarely taking itself too seriously. I think the key to any renewed success will be that it has not lost its exuberant edge. I told a friend about the private jet scene. “It’s our Dynasty,” she said, solemnly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c069f64b29af450edf50b90ee61ce8c7e09f7c8b/40_0_1914_1149/master/1914.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60c8c7aad271883bbccfbea58c364b35","title":"youre hired why attenborough should narrate the apprentice","story":"This weekend, a subtitle error fused Seven Worlds, One Planet with the bumbling business contest – and it was brilliant. Here’s why the nature titan should join the show for goodSubtitle fails are ten a penny, existing solely to be packaged into the sort of mirthless listicle galleries slung together by low-rent sites purely so your dad can share them on Facebook. But sometimes, just sometimes, magic happens.It happened this weekend, in fact, when an iPlayer glitch meant the text from an episode of Seven Worlds, One Planet played over an episode of The Apprentice. Obviously, this made for rich screenshot material – a shot of an identikit big-tied candidate gazing neutrally is captioned ‘the leopard seal is now ready for its next victim’ a moment of boardroom frustration with ‘this is the toughest time in an animal’s life’. But, besides being unintentionally hilarious, could it have accidentally set an amazing idea in motion: why not get David Attenborough to narrate The Apprentice?Sure, there will be those of you who’ll deride this as folly. I’ve heard all pf your arguments. Attenborough is a living legend. Attenborough is 93 years old. Attenborough is now explicitly discussing the repercussions of the climate emergency, and erting him from this mission in order to hear his breathy, awestruck voice narrating the catastrophic uber-capitalism of a bunch of reality TV twits would be to literally endanger the future of the planet as we know it. I’ve heard all your arguments. Heck, I’ve even argued most of them myself.And yet my point remains. Let’s get David Attenborough to narrate The Apprentice. Come on. It isn’t like he hasn’t narrated people before. He used to do it all the time with The Zoo Quest Expeditions, explaining the traditions and behaviours of the tribespeople he’d come across. And if he can do it for them, why can’t he do it for the sort of bloodless perambulating shark-eyed morons that populate The Apprentice? And maybe it’s actually what this country needs now. Yes yes, plastic is bad, we know that now. But what about hearing a voice of hushed authority explaining the behaviour of the candidates. After all, it helped with tigers. Once, tigers were unknowably ferocious animals who urinated on anything they wanted as a show of might. But now Attenborough has explained the method behind their urination – it’s a way of communicating surprisingly complex messages with other tigers – we can understand them a little more.Wouldn’t it be great if he could do the same with the sort of hateful git who applies to be on The Apprentice? Why did that man just say “I love business more than sharks love blood?” Is it because he really is as stupid as he sounds, or is he perhaps communicating a greater understanding of the struggles of life on Earth as we know it?He could dig back into the Apprentice archives if he wanted, and perhaps explain the behaviour of Tre Azam from 2007 a man whose anger at the world was so immediate and overcompensatory that it had to have its roots in some deep genetic species-wide pathology. Perhaps he could discuss how the show’s total absence of morality directly created Katie Hopkins. Perhaps, if nothing else, he could explain why Alan Sugar always looks like a grumpy little hedgehog.Honestly, I’d welcome anything. As I’ve explained again and again, I cannot stand The Apprentice, but if The Greatest Englishman Alive offered to provide a running commentary, I’d be back in like a shot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90936f8c009dd6df049bb669283951a625b2e781/0_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf76b07efa38653715f7279b6940b999","title":"he made a fortune from his trademarked bikram yoga but now his empire is in tatters","story":"A new documentary chronicles Bikram Choudhury’s downfall after allegations of rape and sexual assaultLike many communities, yoga is grappling with its own #MeToo reckoning. There’s the issue of consent and hands-on adjustments in class as well as more straightforward examples of abuses of power and violence.But has there been a bigger fall from grace than that of Bikram Choudhury? From his base in Los Angeles, Choudhury made a fortune from a trademarked yoga routine, only to have his empire in tatters following multiple civil suits and allegations of rape and sexual assault.And in common with the stories of the girls in the Jeffrey Epstein case, there is also the depressing state of the Californian legal system that is not fleet-footed or motivated enough to bring sexual predators to justice.The rise and fall (and maybe rise again?) of Choudhury is rich material, and the Australian film-maker Eva Orner (Taxi to the Dark Side, Chasing Asylum) uses it well in Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator. She makes excellent use of the copious amounts of footage of Choudhury from his early days in India to now, aged in his mid-70s. Complementing this trove, Orner was able to access and interview people from Choudhury’s inner circle and several of his accusers.Choudhury was sued by former students alleging sexual assault and discrimination against racial and sexual minorities. In 2017 a court awarded $6.8m to his former lawyer, Minakshi Jafa-Boden, but she was unable to recover damages as he had fled the country. Bikram has denied the allegations.But the documentary is at its most intriguing when it looks at what the allegations against Choudhury did to the community. Some of those supporting accusers were ostracised, others struggled to break their loyalty to him and the yoga that was now a core part of their identity.In the early 2000s I met Choudhury. I was a reporter for the Sydney Morning Herald and he was opening his first studio in Australia. As part of the story, I went to one of the early classes and was shocked. What the hell was this practice? The yoga took place in a room heated to around 41C. It was packed and it stunk. There were mirrors everywhere and the room was carpeted, which absorbed the stench and the sweat.This won’t take off, I thought.Later that day I had an audience with him. He was staying in an apartment with panoramic views of the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge. An entourage sat around him, literally at his feet. The vibe was fawning. When I spoke to some members of his entourage, they discussed him with a degree of reverence usually reserved for a religious figure or guru, not the founder of an LA-based yoga school. Then there was Choudhury himself. I didn’t mind that he was a braggart – name-dropping Hollywood celebrities who had done his yoga, boasting about his wealth. After all, he had a product to promote and that is what he was doing. I did object however when, without warning, he looked me up and down and declared that I was overweight and needed to do his yoga.What an unpleasant man, I thought as I returned to the office.Despite the bragging and the insults, his yoga was a great success. At the height of his powers there were around 650 Bikram studios around the world.Bikram yoga came along at just the right time, when wellness became a multitrillion-dollar industry.Yoga was a key plank in the industry, promising not just to make you look good, but also feel as if you’d tapped into an ancient eastern tradition. It was more than just an exercise – it promised community and a way of life.It turns out, the odd dynamic that I experienced that day in Sydney was Choudhury’s usual MO and in many ways was the key to both his success and his downfall.In the documentary he is seen abusing people, calling one woman a “bitch” and “chicken shit”. He mocked another student for being overweight.But there was also a docility about his students – answering to his beck and call and unwilling to challenge him.This is in part connected to the money side of things. People’s livelihoods depended on his yoga: they ran Bikram studios they were franchisees they spent thousands of dollars on their studios and training.Much of the documentary’s early, pivotal moments are set during Choudhury’s nine-week teacher training course – an intense yoga gulag where specifically chosen yogis (giving the training a cult-like vibe) are taught the Bikram method. According to one of those interviewed, “You’re starving hungry, you’re sleep-deprived, this yoga just wipes you out – then you’re ripe for whatever it needs to be entered into next.”This documentary is an important addition to the chronicling of the #MeToo movement, but it also shows how much is yet to be achieved.• Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator is available on Netflix"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad21196f557f912da87cbb78b2740965311f56fe/338_442_2325_1394/master/2325.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e86ce5d95763727e5bf4fc6acaad1a2","title":"california water vending machines quality","story":"Vended water is many times more expensive than tap water. And there isn’t much evidence to show customers are getting the quality they’re paying forCustomers stream into the parking lot of a San Diego strip mall, lining up behind a windmill-shaped vending machine that fills their jugs for 25 to 35 cents a gallon.“The water that comes from the tap, I don’t trust it, and it doesn’t taste good,” Miguel Martinez said on a recent afternoon, as he filled his bottle from the kiosk. Martinez lives in San Diego’s nearby Shelltown neighborhood, an area located minutes from downtown where many immigrant families have landed.“Good water right here,” his friend says, patting the machine.Martinez says he doesn’t mind paying a little extra money for what he believes is premium water that tastes better than what comes from his home faucet. It’s a steal compared with the inidually sealed bottles you can buy at the store, he said.“I never drink tap water,” Eddie, a different customer who declined to give his last name, said in Spanish. He got used to buying bottled water 15 years ago when he lived in Mexico and never went back to tap water.Eddie, who works in construction, said when he is at home he drinks sealed water bottles he buys from the store, but he keeps the three-gallon jugs he fills up at the kiosks when he goes to work.Water vending machines have become a common feature in southern California. They’re not new – the state’s department of public health has licensed them since 1989 – and at first glance, they seem to offer a solution for California’s struggle to provide clean drinking water for all of its residents. Customers even swear by the improved taste and believe it is safer than tap water, even if there is not much evidence that they’re getting the quality they’re paying for.But records suggest that the department has been lax in regulating the industry and double-checking the vending machines.When the investigative news outlet Voice of San Diego dug into the issue earlier this year, it found that in 2015, the department only inspected two of the 1,100 machines in San Diego county, for example. Midway through 2019, it hadn’t inspected any. A spokesperson for the public health department told the  statewide data for this year was not immediately available. In the past, water and public health officials have raised concerns over the machines’ safety when they are not properly regulated.In 1997, when the public health department still relied on water vending operators to inspect their own machines, the environmental toxicology bureau in Los Angeles county found that the dispensers located in southern California supermarkets had higher levels of bacteria than plain tap water – probably related to old filters or dirty spigots on the machines.“You’re safer drinking the tap water,” a water official said at the time. “Not only are you safer, but you’re paying, oh, let’s see, about 250 times less per gallon.”A few years later, a study by the not-for-profit Environmental Working Group found that water from two-thirds of the machines they tested in California, owned by the then industry leader, Glacier Water, did not match its marketing claims in terms of contaminants.At the time of its merger, Primo said the acquisition gave it 46,000 retail locations in the US and Canada. Today Primo is valued at $400m.Vending machine companies usually offer a cut of their sales and possibly a signing bonus to stores that allow them to use their space.The market is so profitable it has sparked ugly turf wars between water companies competing for the coveted space in front of stores.About seven years ago, one vending machine company, Mountain’s Peak, filed a complaint against Glacier and accused it of threatening and pressuring store owners to sign contracts with Glacier. Glacier, in turn, accused Mountain Peak of benefiting from a plot to sabotage its machines and steal business.The two companies eventually settled and agreed not to tamper with each other’s machines.“It’s really a nasty business. It’s not a gentleman’s business,” Ed Rose, an attorney who represented Mountain’s Peak, told Voice of San Diego this year.The concerns raised over lax regulation don’t seem to matter to the dozens of customers who line up to fetch water from the machines – many of them located in front of liquor stores and strip malls in low-income neighborhoods and immigrant communities.Watermill Express, which operates the windmill-shaped water kiosks, did not respond to questions from the . But when asked in 2015 why so many kiosks were found in low-income neighborhoods, Lani Dolifka, the Watermill co-founder, told Fast Company that “budget conscious” clientele deserve options, too.“Not everyone can afford to buy bottled water or have a water delivery service, but everyone needs access to safe, affordable, pure drinking water,” she said.Debi Ores, a senior attorney with the Community Water Center, a not-for-profit organization that works to improve access to clean water for residents in central California, said the distrust of tap water is understandable for immigrants who come from countries without clean drinking water.“If the water looks or smells a little funny, they might not have faith that the water is safe to drink. Especially if they’ve known people or had family members who’ve gotten sick from drinking the water.”But the Environmental Working Group, which researches environmental issues, took a sharper view of the marketing in a 2002 report. At the time, it said the then industry leader, Glacier, was exploiting immigrants’ fear of tap water in order to turn a profit.“On the surface, the targeting of recent immigrants may seem like smart niche marketing. But on closer examination, it is cynical and exploitative,” the report read.“Glacier’s marketing strategy takes advantage of the fact that new arrivals, many of whom have limited English skills, may not know that California tap water is safer than the water back home. Then it charges people who can least afford it an inflated price for a basic necessity.”Neither Primo nor Watermill Express responded to multiple phone calls and emails from the .Questions over marketing aside, residents could be forgiven for not trusting the contents of their tap water.In recent years, California schools have been scrutinized for providing drinking water with high concentrations of lead – contamination that can happen when ageing pipes leach lead into the water before it leaves the faucet, said Alexis Temkin, a toxicologist with EWG.“There’s really no safe levels of lead, especially for children,” Temkin said. “It’s not necessarily a problem with the quality of the water that the utility is providing, but what’s coming out in the back end,” she said.In a school less than two miles away from where Eddie and Martinez filled up their jugs, officials were alerted to contaminated water after a therapy dog reportedly refused to drink. When officials tested the water they found lead as well as a chemical that came from plastic pipes. It was probably the reason the school nurse reported that students vomited after drinking the water.More than schools are at risk, though homes in low-income communities are particularly prone to contamination tied to ageing infrastructure and lax monitoring standards, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.Anxiety over having enough clean water has loomed over California for years.Panic set in four years ago after a winter of unusually low snowfall, which the state relies on to refill water reservoirs, exacerbated drought conditions. Cities began issuing water restrictions, but by May of that year nearly 2,000 wells had run dry, leaving some communities without water.The seven-year drought officially ended this year, but the dry stretch highlighted the precarious nature of water in California.Meanwhile, an estimated 1 million residents in California still go without clean water, many of them in the Central Valley, the state’s agricultural hub, which produces a quarter of the nation’s produce.Water vending machines may seem like an appropriate response to providing clean water for communities that struggle to provide it. But experts and advocates list a number of reasons why vended water falls short as a solution and may even further strain the residents who most need it.While the majority of water kiosks are found in southern California, the regions that accrued the most violations for contaminated drinking water are located north of Los Angeles, in less populous areas of the state, according to EWG’s tap water database, which includes enforcement and compliance related information.And the fact that the kiosks typically need a water supply that already meets federal and state standards means the machines wouldn’t work for areas where clean water is most scarce – places such as the San Joaquin Valley, which Jonathan London, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, has studied extensively.Vended water could help some, but it also imposes additional burdens on families, London said.“It’s not a great solution, long-term,” London said. “The vending machines unfortunately are not well-regulated.”A lot of the people who are dependent on vended water don’t have cars, so it is hard for them to actually access it, he said. And buying filtered water, on top of the water coming through their pipes, puts an extra financial burden on low-income families and cuts into their monthly income, he said.London and Ores instead favor longer-term solutions, like getting more residents off private-well water and on to public water systems of larger jurisdictions, which have more resources to treat and monitor water.The Safe and Affordable Drinking Water Fund, linked to legislation the California governor, Gavin Newsom, signed this year, could provide some relief. The plan allocates up to $130m a year to help cash-strapped districts improve access to clean water.Ores said it was a step toward sustainability and providing people the clean water they are entitled to.“People are spending a huge part of their income just on a basic human right.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69bf3b01dd2c655bc7ba26d5882bd0c441611756/0_16_4422_2653/master/4422.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6a9a38a0923e505124203a06768e91e","title":"rudy giuliani associates upgraded indictment likely","story":"A prosecutor says new charges likely in the criminal case against Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman with ties to UkraineA prosecutor said an upgraded indictment is likely in the criminal case against two Rudy Giuliani associates with ties to Ukraine.Assistant US attorney Douglas Zolkind made the prediction during a pre-trial hearing Monday in the case against Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman.The men are charged with using foreign money to make illegal campaign contributions.

But his refusal to go quickly has angered the Caruana Galizia family, who vowed to use all legal means to ensure he had no say over the murder investigation.On Monday, one of Caruana Galizia’s sons, Matthew Caruana Galizia, confirmed that the family was calling for an investigation into Muscat’s role.The family’s legal letter, drafted in Maltese and first reported by the Times of Malta, also urged authorities to ensure all relevant evidence was preserved, amid fears vital documents could be destroyed.In parliament on Monday, Muscat defended his government’s handling of the murder and called for national unity. “The case showed that Malta’s institutions work and everyone is equal before the law,” he said.Separately it emerged that one of the three men accused of Caruana Galizia’s murder has appealed to Maltese president George Vella for a pardon in exchange for “providing all the information he knows on various facts”.Vincent Muscat (no relation to the prime minister) wrote to Vella arguing that an earlier plea for mercy was not handled in a “proper, correct and just manner”.Protesters gathered on Monday evening near Malta’s parliament on Freedom Square, where police had erected a maze of metal barriers to keep away crowds. Footage on social media showed the crowd booing as MPs entering the building, or chanting “assassins, resign now”.The political crisis is expected to continue as a European parliament delegation begins an urgent two-day fact-finding mission on Tuesday. The seven-strong group of MEPs will meet the prime minister, president, as well as Malta’s justice minister, the police commissioner, parliamentary speaker, NGOs and the Caruana Galizia family.The European commission declined to comment on the investigation, but said it expected an “independent and through investigation and that the persons responsible for this crime must be brought to justice”.Malta’s political elite has been shaken as the murder inquiry picked up pace in recent days, more than two years after the crusading investigative journalist was assassinated by a car bomb.On Saturday, Malta’s richest man, the property and gambling tycoon Yorgen Fenech, was charged with complicity in the murder. He has pleaded not guilty to that charge and four others, including membership of a criminal gang.

The meeting is a precursor to a wider Nato leaders meeting on Wednesday that could see isions exposed across a wider front.Macron is angry both at the Turkish decision to invade Syria, and the manner in which the decision was taken in consultation with only one Nato ally, the US. Macron warned it will create a humanitarian disaster, undermine the YPG’s leading role in suppressing Isis and complicate efforts to secure a peace settlement across Syria.Britain and Germany are both critical of Turkish actions, but believe it would be a major strategic blunder if the criticism caused Turkey to desert Nato, and instead move to further cement its fledgling alliance with Vladimir Putin. Donald Trump, who endorsed Erdoğan’s decision to invade northern Syria on 6 October, is not due to attend the Downing Street meeting.Trump has a separate dispute with Erdoğan over Turkey’s decision to purchase the Russian S-400 air defence system. Trump has warned it may make it impossible for the US to supply F-35 stealth fighters since the Russian provision of air defences to Turkey may enable Russia to learn about the F-35 operational methods.Turkey says it can keep the S-400 technically apart from the Nato systems, and can limit its radar range.Erdoğan has defied US warnings by activating the system and then saying only technicalities were holding back further orders from Moscow.Turkey says its incursion into north-east Syria is designed to set up a safe zone that weakens the YPG, a faction that it claims is umbilically linked to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party that it has been fighting for decades. Trump’s decision to give Erdoğan the green light has been seen by the US military and Republican senators alike as a policy disaster that has weakened the US’s reputation for standing alongside allies such as the Syrian Kurds.In a fresh sign of the chaos being caused by the invasion, nine civilians – most of them children – lost their lives, and 10 others were wounded on Monday in an attack by Turkish artillery against the town of Tel Rifaat, south of the Turkish border. As many as 230,000 people were displaced by the initial Turkish invasion, but many have now returned to their homes.Turkey plans to establish a 20-mile-deep safe zone along a 75-mile stretch of the border, while on the east and west of the safe zone Turkish and Russian forces will conduct joint patrols. Turkey is holding back from expanding its safe zone partly due to agreements struck with Russia and the US."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1468ec32e2df3020a758c848b949b7b79d1e8c9/0_170_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e17659e75fbf93477b97459f4c4c5d6","title":"help us locate benin bronze statues in the uk","story":"We would like to start locating these objects and mapping their journeys to Britain – and we need your helpJesus College Cambridge has agreed to return a Benin bronze statue to Nigeria, after it was taken by British colonial forces from the country in the late nineteenth century.The artefact is set to be one of the first Benin bronzes returned to Nigeria, after thousands were stolen from Benin City in a punitive 1897 expedition by British forces.The decision to return the artefact comes after increasing scrutiny of the origins of our museum collections, and a growing movement to repatriate objects taken from former British colonies.Objects in national collections including the British Museum and the V\u0026ampA cannot be returned to their countries of origin because they are protected by the Heritage Act.

On the other hand, some researchers and a smaller group of teachers say some information is better than none and, indeed, point to evidence suggesting the feeder-school lists and league tables boost the performance of schools when it comes to the only metric that students get any formal credit for: exams.But data shows schools can do a great job, independent of the socio-economic background of its pupils, Reynolds says. “The idea that schools have no effects is wrong. That schools can get better is a left-wing, radical and revolutionary message: we can do something great with the kids if we run great schools. We know how to run great schools, and we should run great schools. It is not ‘right-wing’ to ensure that children can read. And it is not ‘right-wing’ if schools are surpassing expectations and league tables capture this information.”In the UK, data is routinely made available through the government here, opposition to league tables is generally embedded in the education system, from teachers right through to Government. This opposition has had a strange effect: the 1998 Education Act allows the Minister for Education to refuse access to information which would enable the compilation of information on “the comparative performance of schools in respect of the academic achievement of students”, but what has evolved is a system whereby only partial data is given out to the public, despite the State having more information.As a result, The  – the first newspaper to publish school progression data – can only provide information on the number of students from a given school that began studying at each higher-education institution, but we do not know how many of those students actually sat their Leaving Cert this year and how many entered third-level after repeating their Leaving, taking a year or more out, went through further education first, or went to college as a mature student.Criticising newspapers for publishing data is a waste of time, Reynolds suggests. “In a world where so much data is now available through freedom of information and other routes – on hospital performance, community indicators and so on – league tables or feeder schools charts are here to stay. Most industralised societies do publish raw data or data that has value added to it, and it’s a done deal now. But if we are to publish it, we should do it in a way that has as much value and information as possible. This was done in England, and the ceiling hasn’t fallen in.”What can feeder schools do?Brian Mooney, guidance counsellor and  columnist, acknowledges there are problems with the data, but says parents are hungry for information on what is happening in schools. “Parents and schools pay a lot of attention to feeder school lists, and therefore they are massively important. They give us a lot of clarity and an insight into schools, as well as feedback to those schools on how they are doing. They allow us to see patterns over time. Like a smoke alarm in the house, they are imperfect, but nonetheless a useful mechanism.”The flaws of feeder schools Emer Smyth is a research professor and head of the social research ision at the Economic and Social Research Institute and a critic of feeder schools. “The data is very misleading,” she says. “You are combining the profile of students who attend a particular school and the impact that school has on how they progress. Those two metrics cannot be separated out by league tables. Some schools attract middle-class students with high levels of achievement on entry and who have access to lots of resources outside school, making it look as though it’s all down to the school.“I don’t think they have any positive impacts on Irish education and the tables are never a surprise. Worse, there are some disadvantaged schools doing stellar work that won’t appear at the top of the tables, with 90 per cent plus going on to higher education these schools make a substantive difference to the lives of young people but don’t get proper acknowledgement in these tables.”“We know it is not a fully accurate reflection of progression, and nobody claims otherwise,” says Mooney. “The lists can’t count the growing number of students from Ireland who study in the UK, Europe or the US in one Dutch physiotherapy course, almost half of the students are Irish, but feeder school tables can’t count them. And it doesn’t count the growing number of students who go on to apprenticeships or further-education PLC courses, which are very attractive propositions.”The feeder school lists do credit students back to their school of origin where that student goes into higher education after a year or more on a further education course but, if the student goes straight from further education to work, the list does not record this.Mooney also points out that a student who can afford to go to an expensive repeat “grind school”, and who subsequently gets into third-level, will be credited back to their original school, raising that school’s place on the charts. “This means that social class is driving up progression in schools,” says Mooney.Deirdre MacDonald, president of the Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland (ASTI), would like to see feeder school tables abolished. “They are reductionist. If you’re born in parts of rural Ireland or inner-city Cork or Dublin, the cost of college could be prohibitive, whereas a student in a fee-paying school in Dublin 4 doesn’t need to worry as much.”MacDonald believes there are better metrics that parents should consider. “To get a full picture of a school, parents should go to the whole-school evaluations, which are all available online and which gives a much broader view of a school, through the objective eye of the school inspectorate. Parents can also go to open days before choosing to send their child there, and I don’t believe there is any principal or deputy who would not meet a parent face-to-face and provide information on the school. And while third-level access is a significant, there is more to school life than the academic side alone. There is an obsession with measurement these days, but all that is good does not have to be measured or assessed in some way.”Schools should be publicly accountable, but MacDonald says that happens through the Department of Education’s WSEs. “It is a very rigorous process, very demanding on school management and teachers.”MacDonald says there is a “cohort” of parents who want the information contained in today’s feeder school lists, but that it’s not their guiding light when choosing a school, and that the media overhypes their significance. “If you talk to parents and ask what they want for their child, they don’t say they want them to get into a certain college course across the social spectrum, they want their children to be happy, fulfilled and educated in a broad sense. The league tables won’t tell us that.”Improving school progression dataWays of adding value to the lists are dependent on more data being gathered by schools, third-levels and education authorities. They could include weighing the number of students from any school who go on to third-level against the number of students who drop out. Ideally, the lists would count the number of students who go on from any school to further education and apprenticeships, but this data remains unavailable.At best, feeder school tables provide only a partial picture, but they are nonetheless an important part of it. Prof Emer Smyth of the ESRI, says, however, that we need a more holistic approach to education. “I don’t know how seriously parents really take the league tables they also look at where their child will be happy and what subjects and activities are offered. I think further education and apprenticeship data would give a slightly more complete picture but, given the cultural norms about how higher education is the way to, it would not be enough to shift attention to those other routes.”A value-added approach, looking at the difference that a school makes over and above the profile of students coming in, would be technically difficult but could provide a clearer picture, says Smyth, although she remains sceptical and cautious about league tables. “One approach is to take ability test scores in the junior cycle and looking at progress at Leaving Cert level. How have the students in different schools improved relative to the baseline?”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4095474.1574777880!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"st columba s college popular with european parents","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStudents taking part in a school production of Grease in November.School type: Fee-paying, boarding and day school with Church of Ireland ethosFees: About €8,500 for day pupils and starting at €19,000 for junior boardersExtracurricular activities include: Six days of sport per week, choirs, music and band, drama, debatingSubject options: All core subjects, all science and business subjects, art, languages, music and moreUnusual fact: Regular classes take place on Saturday mornings, although the students do get slightly longer holidays at Easter and Christmas instead.One of the most exclusive – and privileged – fee-paying schools in Ireland is also one of the most erse, with about 40 per cent of the school population from overseas, including Europe, China and Africa. The school is popular with European parents who want a “British-style” boarding school, where their children can learn English and also do enough subjects to be eligible for entry to German universities. And, because it has such an international profile, the school’s students tend to go on to college in the UK, Europe and the US. As a result, the figure shown for St Columba’s on today’s list suggests that just 38 per cent of its students go on to third-level. The feeder school lists cannot record when a student goes to third-level overseas, so there is no way of crediting those students back to the school but, in fact, says school principal Mark Boobbyer, 100 per cent of the school’s students go on to third-level. Range of abilityThe school does not select for ability and so there is a range of ability, says Boobbyer. “We have a fantastic learning support department and some children who have special needs assistants.”Class sizes are small, with only about 15 per class. “This smaller staff-student ratio means we can give more attention to our students. Supervised study takes place in the evenings, running up to 2½ hours for the senior classes.”The school recently opened a new social centre, because seven-day boarders need a place to hang out, which includes a cafe, a small gallery to display student art, a music room and other activities. Students play an hour of sport every day, six days a week, with Sundays consisting of little more than chapel service and students having a chance to relax and do what they want. The school tends to invoke images of a Hogwarts-style castle. Boobbyer is keen to embrace the school’s roots and traditions but says that the facilities – particularly the science labs – are the best in Ireland. Whether the State should pay teacher salaries in schools like this – with so much more resources than non-fee paying schools – is another matter.

Gym facilities available and recording studio on site. The school is based in a youth centre and students are facilitated with access to the associated youth, activity and sporting groups.Subject options: Nine subjects for Junior Cert, with 13 subjects timetabled for Leaving Cert and 16 more available on request.Unusual fact: One of a tiny number of schools to offer Hebrew Studies. The XLC Project is unlike the majority of schools in Ireland, but it’s a refuge for young people in Waterford city who don’t fit into the mainstream system. Like the Cork Life Centre, the XLC Project focuses on young people who have left the formal secondary school system. Because it’s not a regular school, the XLC project doesn’t normally feature on The  feeder school lists. But this year, of the 38 students who sat the Leaving Cert there, eight went on to study at the local Waterford Institute of Technology. For fee-paying schools or the Gaelscoileanna that regularly appear at the top of these charts, that wouldn’t be any great shakes, but for the XLC project, it’s a big deal: these are young people who may otherwise have been left behind.The XLC Project, like Cork Life Centre, isn’t centrally funded by the Department of Education, instead currently relying on local fundraising and a grant – only renewed on a year-by-year basis – through the Back to Education Initiative. There are two staff, including Eoin Jackson, on a half-salary, and the rest are volunteers. In 2015, Tusla was critical of XLC, saying it “did not provide a certain minimum education”, that the standard of grammar and punctuation of the students was not up to speed and that not enough time was spent on subjects. Jackson has vociferously refuted this: he says the school’s model is one that includes a majority of students with a learning difficulty, and that the hours allocated at junior cycle match what is given to a child on home tuition – a full schedule would not work for these children and that distance learning is a core part of their model.The school has taken on young people who had challenging behaviours in their old school and gotten them through the State exams. What’s different is that attendance is strongly encouraged and followed up on, but not enforced by punishment. The school is now just over 20 years old. “We had a reunion with past pupils last year,” says Jackson. “A lot of our past pupils went on to become entrepreneurs. Perhaps this is because going to XLC is seen as a risk, but it can allow students take control of their life and learning – the very qualities we see in entrepreneurs.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4100872.1575146994!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"byelections 2019 ff wins two seats sf greens one each","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNewly elected Fianna Fál TD  Padraig O’Sullivan and party leader Micheal Martin  at the Cork North Central byelection count centre.Photograph: Provison Sinn Féin’s Mark Ward was declared the winner in Dublin Mid-West in a remarkable result while in Cork North Central Fianna Fáil’s Pádraig O’Sullivan has held Billy Kelleher’s seat in the 10th count.Fianna Fáil candidate Malcolm Byrne took the seat in Wexford.The Green Party’s Joe O’Brien won in Fingal when the result was confirmed shortly before 9pm.

Green Party sources said they wanted to beat Labour in this constituency at the byelection to maintain their momentum on the centre left.Speaking after the count concluded at the National Show Centre in Swords, Mr O’Brien said a lot of work had gone into his victory, but said people are “definitely” “changing their minds” on the climate issue.“We had the so called green wave in the summer at the local elections, but it’s gaining traction now and I think it’s more than a wave,” he said. “I think there’s a bit of a sea change in terms of how people are deciding where to put their votes.”Mr Ryan also said there has been a “change in the last year”.“ There is a green wave of thinking. It’s coming from younger people, but older people responding to that as well. Everyone knows now we’re in a climate crisis and a bioersity crisis.“Our job is to present the practical solutions that will allow us changes the country for the best in responding to those crises.”The Dublin Bay South TD said the number of Green TDs will increase in the next Dáil if the pattern of the past year is continued.He said he and Ms Martin were looking forward to having Mr O’Brien as a third TD.“I’d like to double and triple that again in the next election, and I think we can.

One thing was sure: They didn’t want company. They lived in a 14th-century hunting lodge, which they surrounded with loops of razor wire and ferocious dogs. The perimeter was marked with menacing signs. INTRUDERS SHALL BE GUNDOWN, said one.Macabre storiesEvery few years, the family agreed to admit a journalist, always a foreigner, to tell of their grievances against the state. The journalists emerged with deliciously macabre stories, which I had studied admiringly. In 1997, the prince and the princess told The Times of London that their mother, in a final gesture of protest against the treachery of Britain and India, had killed herself by drinking a poison mixed with crushed diamonds and pearls.I could see why these stories resonated so. The country was imprinted with trauma, by the epic deceit of the British conquest and then the blood bath of the British departure, known as Partition, which carved out Pakistan from India and set off convulsions of Hindu-Muslim violence.This family, displaying its own ruin, was a physical representation of all that India had suffered.A few grainy photographs of the siblings had been published: They were beautiful, pale and high-cheekboned, but also somehow ravaged, harrowed. Nearly every day, dropping my children at school, I drove past the narrow road that led into the middle of the forest, which was surrounded by an ornate wrought-iron fence. The woods were so thick that it was impossible to see much, and inhabited by gangs of monkeys. At night, you could hear jackals howling.The day after I got the message, I dialled the phone number. After a few rings, someone picked up, and I heard a high-pitched, quavering voice on the other end. On the following Monday, I asked our driver to take me into the woods at 5.30 in the afternoon, as instructed.The woods themselves were a bit magical, a thicket in the middle of a city of 20 million. British colonial officers had introduced mesquite trees in the 19th century, and they spread rapidly, swallowing pastures and roads and villages – everything that had been there before. Biologists would later describe it as a “massive invasion” by an “alien species”.We drove farther, until the tree canopy was tormented, thick enough to block out the light.Reader, I should confess that I wanted to write the story. That week, the contents of my inbox were not inspiring: There had been a fire at an ammunition depot. There were budget reports, an unending cycle of state and local elections, the introduction of a goods and services tax.These events, which filled so many of my days at that time, did not entirely satisfy my literary urge. The House of Oudh, now that was a story!Leave the carThe person on the phone had told me to leave the car at the end of the road, beside the high wall of an Indian military compound, and to come alone. This did not surprise me: The Oudh family refused, famously, to meet with Indians. I asked the driver to wait at a distance and stood in the woods, somewhat awkwardly, holding my notebook and wondering what came next.Then the bushes rustled, and a man appeared. He was elfin and wore high-waisted mom jeans. He had high cheekbones with hollows beneath them and wild gray hair that stood up in tufts.“I am Cyrus,” the prince said. It was the high-pitched voice I had heard on the phone.He spoke in bursts, like a person who spent most of his time alone. Then he turned and led me into the woods. I tried to keep up, stepping over a tangle of roots and thorns, and climbed a flight of massive stone stairs leading to the old hunting lodge. It was half-ruined, open to the air, and surrounded by metal gratings one steel bar was loose, and the prince moved it aside with a great clank so that we could enter.I stepped into spare, medieval grandeur, a bare stone antechamber lined with palm trees in brass pots and faded, once-elegant carpets. On the wall hung an oil painting of the prince’s mother swathed in voluminous, dark robes, her eyes closed as if in a trance.The prince led me up to the roof to show me the view. We stopped at the edge of the building, gazing across green treetops to the dusty city, shimmering in the heat. Other great cities may be built on top of ruins, but Delhi is built of them. It is almost impossible to go from one point to another without stumbling over a 700-year-old tomb or a 500-year-old fort.Seven successive Muslim dynasties built their capitals here, each swept aside when its time had passed. The ruins are a reminder that the present dispensation – democracy, Starbucks, Hindu nationalism – is only the blink of an eye in India. We were here, they seem to breathe. This was ours.My idea was to interview the prince and write the story. When I asked about his family, he launched into an animated speech about the perfidy of the British and Indian governments. I recognised quotes from articles I had read, written by colleagues from the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times. He ranted a little, complaining of persecution by a criminal gang. He was flinging his hands wide, declaiming and then dropping to a dramatic whisper, as he spoke of the decline of the house of Oudh.“I am shrinking,” he said. “We are shrinking. The princess is shrinking. We are shrinking.”When I asked if I could publish our interview, he balked. For this, he said, I would need the permission of his sister, Princess Sakina, who was not in Delhi. I would have to come back.It struck me as strange, though. Why summon a journalist if you don’t want to be written about?How it beganThe story began with his mother. She appeared, on the platform of New Delhi’s train station in the early 1970s, seemingly from nowhere, announcing herself as Wilayat, Begum of Oudh.Oudh (pronounced Uh-vud) was a kingdom that no longer existed. The British annexed it in 1856, a trauma from which its capital, Lucknow, never recovered. The core of the city is still made of Oudh’s vaulted shrines and palaces. The begum declared that she would stay in the station until these properties had been restored to her.She settled in the VIP waiting room, and unloaded a whole household there: carpets, potted palms, a silver tea set, Nepali servants in livery, glossy Great Danes. She also had two grown children, Prince Ali Raza and Princess Sakina, a son and a daughter who appeared to be in their 20s. They addressed her as “Your Highness.”The begum was an arresting-looking woman, tall and broad-shouldered, with a face as craggy and immobile as an Easter Island statue. She wore a sari of dark, heavy silk and kept a pistol in its folds. She and her children settled on red plastic chairs, and waited. For years.“Sitting, sitting like yogis,” recalled Father John, a Catholic charity worker who distributed food in the train station. The children were strangely submissive, he said, reluctant even to accept a banana without their mother’s permission.“They were more obedient than the dogs,” he said. “They were absolutely under her control.”The begum’s behaviour was imperious and dramatic. She refused direct conversation, demanding that queries be written on embossed stationery, placed on a silver platter and carried to her by a servant, who read them aloud. If the station master gave her any trouble, she threatened to kill herself by drinking snake venom.“The Nepali servants, they would walk on their knees,” said Saleem Kidwai, a historian who sought them out at the time.Government officials scrambled to find her somewhere to live. She was attracting attention from the media, and officials feared the Shia population in Lucknow could explode into civil unrest if they believed she was being abused.“It was such a romantic image,” Kidwai said. “She is out of the castle, now living in the railway station.”Ammar Rizvi, an aide to the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, was sent to New Delhi as a liaison. He recalled handing Wilayat an envelope with 10,000 rupees – about $90,000 at the time – so that they could set up a household in Lucknow.“In 1975, that was a big sum,” he recalled. “But she got angry and threw the envelope. The notes were flying everywhere, and my public relations officer had to catch this note here, that note there. She said no, she would not go, the amount was very little.”In the months that followed, Rizvi tried to persuade the begum to accept a four-bedroom house in Lucknow, but she refused, saying it was too small. He was getting anxious. Muslims were mobilising once, Rizvi visited during Muharram, an annual ritual of mourning, and found her surrounded by pilgrims, flagellating themselves with chains to which razor blades had been attached.“Poor passengers, they were looking at the whole scene,” he said. “There was blood all over the place.”Making her caseAround this time, Wilayat identified a far more effective way to make her case: foreign correspondents. “India Princess Reigns in Rail Station”, a Times correspondent wrote in 1981, describing her “genuine commitment to redeem the ancestors, to right wrongs suffered over centuries and to obtain justice”.People magazine recorded her declaring, “Let the world know how the descendant of the last nawab of Oudh is treated.”Foreign correspondents arrived, one after another, and readers began to send letters from all corners of the world, expressing outrage on her behalf. The begum imposed stringent conditions – she “could only be photographed when the moon was waning”, United Press International reported – and journalists complied, delighted with the Gothic peculiarity of it all.In 1984, her efforts paid off. Prime minister Indira Gandhi accepted their claim, granting them use of a 14th-century hunting lodge known as Malcha Mahal. They left the train station roughly a decade after they first appeared there. Wilayat never appeared in public again.My responsibilities in New Delhi included a great many diplomatic receptions and buffet dinners, which I found exhausting. It was like being drawn into an imperial court, in which every personal relationship was a series of transactions – exchanges, usually, of bits of status for bits of information. I did not have the clothes for this kind of work, or the personality.So I found it a relief to drive into the forest and sit on Cyrus’s porch, eating pistachios and watching motes of pollen circulate in the sunlight. In a meandering, roundabout way, I was trying to excavate his past. I felt flattered that he allowed me in, again and again, when so many others had been turned away.And yet something also nagged at me about the little family unit, the way they seemed to have scoured away any relationships from before their appearance at the train station.LucknowWhen our conversations had gone on for about nine months, I travelled to Lucknow, a large city in northern India that was the cradle of the Oudh dynasty. I was there to interview detectives for an unrelated story, but I knew that Cyrus had lived there with his mother and sister in the 1970s, so I went to the neighbourhood where I had heard that Oudh descendants lived.There, to my surprise, the old-timers remembered Cyrus and his family. But they told me, almost as an aside, that they had been dismissed as impostors. The Oudh descendants in Kolkata, where the nawab died in exile, had also rejected their claim. And there were questions Cyrus himself seemed unable to answer. Where was he born? Who was his father? How do you crush diamonds, anyway?His sister, Princess Sakina, had not turned up but he gave me a book that she had written, documenting their lives. The book was almost unreadable, haphazardly capitalised, lacking punctuation and written in florid, apocalyptic prose. But sprinkled in the rambling text were flashes of genuine tenderness between the siblings, as if they were two small children, stranded together on a lifeboat.Sakina wrote that she had intended to follow her mother into suicide, but for her brother. The question of his future nagged at her. “ABOUT PRINCE CYRUS RIZA MY BROTHER WHAT STEP SHALL HE FOLLOW?” it says. “MY SILENT SINCEREST SILENCE HAS A WISH THAT PRINCE SHOULD BE BLESSED WITH HAPPINESS.”One night Cyrus called me, howling unintelligibly, to tell me that his sister had in fact died seven months earlier. He had told no one, burying her body himself. He had lied to me about it for months, and seemed a bit ashamed by it. I curled up on my daughter’s bunk bed and listened to his voice over the phone. He said that I should never visit again, and also that he was so lonely.I waited a few days, and then showed up with a Filet O’ Fish from McDonald’s. Our relationship seemed to knit itself back together. He asked me to procure him a gun and a girlfriend, which I did not and a tarpaulin and a recording of Fiddler on the Roof, which I did. He was solicitous and a little corny, with pop culture references that seemed to date from the 1960s.Once, he asked me to kiss him on the cheek – his skin felt fragile, like tissue paper – and he told me that it was the first time he had been kissed in 10 years. “When you are over here, my heart goes doopity doo, Sophia Loren,” he said.He even said I could write something about him, as long as I didn’t go into much detail. “I have to tell the truth,” I told him. “Okay, you have to tell the truth,” he said. “Then again, there is a hole in the bucket, Harry Belafonte.”Final conversationsWe had been debating this for 15 months, and I was due to leave India soon and take up a new assignment in London. This sort of exchange made up the balance of our final conversations: I was trying to get him to reveal something about his origins – anything, really – and he was twisting away from me.“You are just a very mysterious person, because I don’t know who you are,” I said once. His response was coy. “Oh, really,” he said, in a singsong voice. “Well, anyway. Oh, really? If you have said me mysterious, I am just sitting before you.”In our last conversation, a few hours before I boarded a flight for London, he asked me how someone could get word to me, should he die. I asked if he planned to take his own life.“So far, I am going to preserve myself,” he said. “Good. Well, then, I’ll see you again,” I said.I think I hugged him goodbye. The last I saw of him, he was replacing the clanking iron bars that protected him from intruders.Three months later, I was in an airport, on my way home from interviewing the Swedish foreign minister, when I learned Cyrus had died. I got the news on Facebook messenger, from a friend at the BBC.I put down my bag and sat on the airport floor, feeling a little in shock. This feeling was partly selfish. I had a thick file of interviews in a manila envelope labelled “Prince Cyrus”.I had figured that, in this family’s story, there was a parable about India, something about trauma that went unresolved as one empire replaced another.And then there was a second feeling. I was sad that I was not there to help him. I had enjoyed our conversations, the maddening dance of 18 months. I could not believe that he had died alone in that forsaken place. I was sure that in the dark, he had wanted someone to hold his hand. Thinking about this made it difficult to breathe. I stayed there for a moment, in the corridor at the airport, while people hurried past, rolling suitcases behind them.It was the guards at the military facility next door – they called him “rajah”, or king – who later recounted how he had died. Three weeks after we said goodbye, Cyrus was seen trying to wheel his bicycle down the road, shaking violently. An electrician from the military facility helped him to his feet, and he staggered back to the hunting lodge. He asked for a bottle of lemonade and an ice cream.Rajinder Kumar, one of the guards, said it seemed to be dengue fever. I’ve had dengue. It’s like being wiped off the face of the Earth. For me, it began with a penetrating ache in my shoulder, and then, as I sweated through the hotel sheets, hallucinations. My senses were altered. When I drank water from the tap, it tasted like a mouthful of tin.I don’t know what Cyrus hallucinated. His illness may have progressed into haemorrhagic fever, with bleeding from the gums and nose, and under the skin. Patients dying of haemorrhagic fever sometimes have such low blood pressure that no pulse can be detected. Rajinder said Cyrus had refused to be taken to the hospital.“Madam, I really tried very hard,” he said. “I said we would call the police, we would take you to the hospital, but no, no, no. We are outsiders, third-party people, we can’t apply that kind of pressure. Had we been family we could have just taken his hand and taken him.”Rajinder thought it came down to pride. “He used to have the attitude that he was the king,” he said. “That is why he did not want to go to the hospital, that he did not want to be a normal person.”His illness lasted eight days. A boy, sent up to check on his welfare, saw him stalking the property half-clothed, naked from the waist down, or shivering under a mosquito net. Then, after a day or so, no one saw him, and the boy found him dead, curled on the rock floor.Back to Malcha MahalI climbed the stone stairs to Malcha Mahal several months later with a kind of curiosity that was in some ways like greed. I had returned to India for a few days, to see what I could find among his possessions.It is legitimate to ask why I was doing all this. I asked it myself. “Is Cyrus a white whale?” was the subject line of an email I sent my editor. I had become curious – Okay, obsessively curious – about how a family with wealth and status had become lost in the forest. About who they were. Stories like that had always flipped a switch in me, spilling outside the boundaries of the assignment. Something similar had happened to me once, years before, when I pieced together the life story of a woman who had stabbed her children in a basement.When I felt I was making progress it was a calming feeling, as if a cloud of buzzing, disparate information were being forced through a funnel, into a clear stream. Small breakthroughs would drive me forward, like a gambler. On such assignments it was possible to forget unpaid bills, unanswered telephone calls, to set aside anything not required to follow the trail.Cyrus and his family had lived through a great historical rupture: the country’s ision. My sense was that the answer lay there, in an act of government that disrupted the lives of half a continent. But what made me think I could track them down after all these years? Say I did – what could be more interesting than the story they told about themselves?This is what was going through my head as I climbed those stairs. Cyrus’s death had received lots of media coverage, inside India and abroad, and thrill-seekers had tramped through Malcha Mahal, taking video with their phones, hoping to see a ghost. The floor of the entry hall was a havoc of discarded papers that had been dumped from the wardrobe and chest of drawers.I leafed through the letters, looking for a birth certificate, a passport, something that anchored this family in the factual world. What I found instead was a chronicle of 30 years of interactions with journalists. This, it seemed, was the family business. There were dozens of requests from reporters. I have written enough letters of this kind in my life to recognise their pleading tone. Some were written in elaborate, courtly language. Others offered money.Sitting there on the carpet, I laughed out loud. Cyrus and his family would string them along – as he had strung me along – and then, when the mood struck them, disdainfully refuse the interview. The Oudhs were the ones with the story. They had the upper hand.Among the family papers was a column from The Statesman, published in 1993, with the headline “When History Is Based on Errors”. Two paragraphs had been marked.“Have you noticed that a factual error appearing in respected printed form tends to be copied by other researchers in the same field, until, inevitably, it competes with the truth for credibility?” it read. “The writers who perpetuate these mistakes rarely do so from evil motive: They have no axe to grind, they simply do not have time to check and double-check each fact, so they rely on the scholarship of their predecessors.”Two things genuinely surprised me. The first was a stack of receipts for regular, small transfers of cash through Western Union from a city in the industrial north of England. The sender identified himself as a “half brother”.A letterThe other thing was a letter. It was handwritten on fragile, blue airmail stationery and sent in 2006. It was cranky yet intimate, conveying both annoyance and concern, a letter that could only have been written by a relative.“I am in so much pain that I cannot go to the toilet even,” the writer began, and, after an extensive catalogue of physical ailments, went on to complain about the burden of providing continuous financial support for Wilayat and her children. He was obviously not a rich man.“For God’s sake, try to sort yourselves out financially, in case anything goes wrong with me,” the writer told them, appending information for the latest Western Union transfer. “May God help us all.” The letter was signed “Shahid”, and it was sent from an address in Bradford, Yorkshire.Let us pause, for a moment, to consider the tragedy of the house of Oudh. In the mid-19th century, the British East India Co had accelerated its consumption of Indian kingdoms. Having guzzled Punjab and Sindh, it set its ambitions on Oudh, a territory roughly the size of South Carolina.Oudh was ruled at the time by a nawab, or provincial governor, named Wajid Ali Shah, a dreamy aesthete who spent his time orchestrating lavish entertainments in a harem that he called the Parikhana, or “abode of fairies”. He thought the British were his allies, because his great-uncle had extended them vast loans.The British thought otherwise. They stripped the nawab of his kingdom on the grounds of mismanagement, thrusting into his hands a treaty declaring that “the territories of Oude shall be henceforth vested for ever, in the Honorable East India Company”.The nawab wept, solemnly removed his turban and placed it in the envoy’s hands. Soon thereafter, he set off for exile in Calcutta, and Lucknow was cast into mourning, the historian Rosie Llewellyn-Jones recalls in her biography of Wajid Ali Shah.“The body of the town was left soulless,” Zahuruddin Bilgrami wrote at that time. “Grief rained down from every door and wall. There was no lane, bazaar, or dwelling which did not wail in our full agony of separation.”The nawab’s mother, in seclusion, sailed to Britain in a desperate attempt to plead her case with Queen Victoria, something the wags at Punch magazine found hilarious:The Queen of Oude Is disendowed Of regions rich and juicy Their milk and honey I mean their money Squeezed out by Lord Dalhousie Oudh was finished. The vanished kingdom would hang over Lucknow like a pall.Haunted cityI returned to Lucknow, and took a cab to a warren of residential streets tucked behind the grand shrines and palaces of the old city.This is where I had encountered witnesses who could remember Cyrus and his family. Horses pulled carts through the narrow lanes, and I could hear tinny music playing on a radio. Nostalgia for Oudh was a cottage industry here. Everywhere I went, I saw the image of the last nawab, Wajid Ali Shah, his expression dreamy, one nipple poking out of his shirt.Then there were the descendants. Because Wajid Ali Shah had hundreds of wives and concubines, people identifying themselves as descendants are all over the place in Lucknow, fighting like polecats over the veracity of one another’s claims.When I asked about the family, I encountered instant recognition: Yes, three of them had moved into this complex for a few months in the 1970s. Abrar Hussain, who had worked for Wilayat as a servant, said the family had caused a sensation, especially among Shias. Ordinary people were moved to tears at the sight of them, and some were so awed by the begum – so convinced that she was their returning queen – that they refused to turn their backs to her, walking backward, out of respect.“It wasn’t just me – the whole public was coming to see her, and was going crazy,” he said. “People would cry to see her in this condition.”But the older men who presided over the neighbourhood, mostly descendants of members of the nawab’s court, said the family were impostors. Sayyed Suleiman Naqvi, a former code-breaker for the Indian army, said he had posed as a journalist in order to check Wilayat’s credentials.“She said, ‘We have got documentary evidence.’ I said, ‘Get it.’ She said, ‘I will give it only to those persons who are in authority.’ She showed us certain pieces of crockery and all that, which were of course antiques,” recalled Naqvi, now in his late 70s. “But she did not show us any documents.”The family left Lucknow abruptly, he said. Something had happened: An elderly aunt said she recognised Wilayat from before Partition. The aunt said Wilayat was an ordinary woman then, the young wife of a civil servant. Naqvi, who considers himself a keen student of human nature, said he believed they were frauds, but that they were not motivated by greed.“To my mind, this lady was a megalomaniac,” he said finally. “She should have been psychologically tested.”His assessment of her children, however, was quite different. “They believed their mother,” he said, “because she was their mother.”Everything I had learned in India was fragmentary, neighbourhood gossip unbottled after 40 years.To YorkshireI returned to London with three real leads. The airmail letter from Yorkshire. That name, Shahid. The Western Union receipts, testament that someone had been caring for Cyrus and his family in secret all these years. I took a train to Bradford, and walked to the address on the envelope. It was a gray, windblown day, and the walk took me past pawnshops, cheap Chinese takeout joints and dinky row houses of yellow brick, nearly all of them occupied by immigrants from India and Pakistan.I arrived, finally, at a small, neat brick house that was surrounded by a large collection of ceramic garden gnomes, teddy bears, Yorkies, mermaids and fairies. I was so nervous that I paced in front of the house for a while before ringing the bell. The door swung open, and before me stood a man in tiger-print pyjamas.He was barrel-chested and broad-shouldered, and looked to be in his mid-80s. He did not look well: His eyes were rheumy, his chest sunken. But he had Cyrus’s face, the same jutting cheekbones and hawk nose.He led me inside, showed me to a chair and then lay down on a cot. His movements were laborious. He glanced without expression at the photographs I had brought with me. When I offered to play him a recording of Cyrus’s voice, he shook his head in refusal, saying it would be too painful.Beside his sickbed were two framed pictures of Wilayat. This was Shahid. He was Cyrus’s older brother. And now, finally, there were some facts.They were, or had been, an ordinary family. Their father had been the registrar of Lucknow University, Inayatullah Butt. My friend’s name was not Prince Cyrus, or Prince Ali Raza, or Prince anything. He was plain old Mickey Butt. Here, in this brick house in West Yorkshire, I had found it: The identity that Cyrus and his family had worked so hard to keep secret.Shahid, who spent his adult life working in an iron foundry, could remember a life before Oudh, when they had housemaids and school uniforms. When their mother was not a rebel queen, but a housewife.Before long, Shahid’s wife, Camellia, came home. She was a friendly, plain-spoken Lancashire woman, animated on the subject of the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn (whom she despised), and her husband (whom she adored.) The two of them met in 1968, when she wore her hair in a blond beehive and Shahid was built like a heavyweight boxer in those days, she said, dreamily, he could fight four men at once.She never met her husband’s mother, but had corresponded with her for years. She thought the story about Oudh was, as she put it, “a bloody big act”. “What was wrong with this woman?” she said of Wilayat. “I believed every word of it at the beginning, but now I doubt all of it. It’s very hard to get Shahid to talk about it. I think it’s painful. I think he was led to believe it was true. Then, as he got older, he realised it was all built on sand.”Shahid ran away when he was about 14, then emigrated to Britain and rarely mentioned his mother’s claim to the royal house of Oudh. When I asked him about that story, he was evasive. He said he wasn’t even sure whether he was Indian or Pakistani.“I’m so confused, I don’t know who I am,” he said. “I am like a bird, a long lost bird, a lost lamb.”I kept asking questions but Shahid was preoccupied by the news of Cyrus’s death – he called him Mickey – and that no one knew exactly where he was buried.“I should have saved him,” he said.Now, all of a sudden, the field of witnesses had expanded. There were other relatives, respectable people, scattered across Pakistan, Britain and the United States. Cyrus’s oldest brother, Salahuddin Zahid Butt, was a pilot in the Pakistani air force, a war hero who bombed Indian positions in the 1965 war. He died in 2017, but his wife, Salma, lived in Texas.I called her. She said her mother-in-law’s claim to royal descent was false. “She thought she was the princess of Oudh, but this was never, ever,” she said of Wilayat. “We never heard this history about the princess of this, the princess of that. She obviously had some mental disorder.”LahoreTwo of Cyrus’s older cousins, Wahida and Khalida, were still in Lahore, so I flew to Pakistan to see them. I parked beside an open sewer full of black, seething water, and walked down a trash-choked alleyway and knocked on a wooden door. It opened into a spacious compound, eerily quiet and green, with rosebushes in bloom.The cousins were hunched, birdlike women in their 70s. Wahida had worked for many years as a teacher, and barely spoke. She seemed to communicate by slapping people, hard, across the face. She wandered from one of us to the other, looking for someone to slap. Once, it was me. Mostly it was my interpreter, whose face hardened into a permanent wince. Khalida did most of the talking.She remembered Wilayat as a tempestuous young woman, but said they hadn’t seen her since the late 1960s, when she suddenly left Pakistan and returned to India. They seemed unwilling to say anything further. After listening to them discuss other subjects for an hour, I pressed the issue, conscious of the passage of time.“Ask her, did you ever hear that your family was related to the royal nawabs of Oudh?” I relayed to my interpreter. “I have no idea,” Khalida answered.“Wilayat said she was the queen of Oudh,” I told them. “She told the Indian government that for many, many years.”I prodded them for hours, until I was tired and frustrated.“Wilayat is dead,” I said. “Her children are dead. There is no secret anymore.”“Everything is a lie,” Khalida said. “They are dead. Just leave them. God forgives them, so we should also forgive them.”Trying to get Shahid to speak about his mother and siblings was painful. He would get stuck at a particular moment in the story, when his mother sent him out to buy bananas and he fled the family. Camellia said that, to this day, he would not eat bananas. She thought it was guilt. Besides, he was becoming sicker and sicker.It wasn’t a chest infection, but lung cancer that had metastasised to his lymph nodes. Camellia would not think of allowing him to be admitted to the hospital, but nursed him in the front room until there was nothing to do but give him painkillers.On my fourth visit to Bradford, the last time I saw him, his voice was raspy, but he told me more than he ever had before. The story, as he told it, began at Partition.On June 3rd, 1947, the British viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, announced that the withdrawal of British Empire would create two independent nations, with Pakistan carved out for Muslims. Lucknow’s educated Muslims began slipping away overnight, headed for Pakistan’s new capital, where they would make up the DNA of a new elite. There were letters promising juicy promotions. And there were, on the other hand, rumours of violence if they stayed.Shahid’s parents had to make an immediate decision between India or Pakistan. His mother, Wilayat Butt, had never been so happy as she was in Lucknow. She was fiery and strong. Shahid has an image of her, striding out onto her balcony in Lucknow in jodhpurs and riding boots, slapping her thigh with a crop. She simply refused to leave.But then came one afternoon in the crumbling elegance of the nawab’s city. Shahid’s father – a man in distinguished middle age, wearing wire-rimmed glasses – was riding his bicycle home when he was surrounded by Hindu youths, who began beating him with hockey sticks.Bathed in bloodHe soon decided to move the whole family to Pakistan, where, in the great reshuffling, he had been offered a job overseeing the new country’s civil aviation agency. He was right to worry over the months that followed, the city of his youth, Lahore, would be bathed in blood.“We were children,” recalled Salma, Wilayat’s daughter-in-law. “Riots were on, and we couldn’t go out at all. Weeks and weeks, the dead bodies were lying around, and when we went to the bazaar to get our food there was so much rioting and robbing, people were robbing. At night it would be very frightening, you could hear people crying and shooting and stabbing. We would be sitting next to the window and watching.”Wilayat followed her husband, Shahid told me, but she never accepted his decision to leave India. She was obsessed with what she had left behind. In her mind, the grudge sprouted and germinated, and her behaviour became volatile. Then her husband suddenly died. Now with all restraining influence on her gone, furious over the expropriation of her property, she accosted Pakistan’s prime minister at a public appearance, Shahid said, and slapped him.This changed things for Wilayat. She was no longer a well-connected widow, but something shadier. She was confined to a mental hospital in Lahore for six months after that – the only way, Shahid said, to avoid a long prison sentence. Shahid remembers visiting her there, among the wails and curses of the patients.“It was horrible,” he said. “Women tied up with chains. One poor girl was chained up to a wall. It was four chains. And she was swinging. And spitting at everybody who went past.”Salma said that Wilayat was given electroshock therapy. “They said she was mental,” she said. “They gave her all these injections.”When she was free, Wilayat gathered up her youngest children without warning, packed trunks with carpets and jewellery, and smuggled it all back into India, with the goal of reclaiming her property. Shahid set out with them but eventually walked away. He could not put into words why he left. His story flickers out here.Early this month, Shahid died in the front room of his house, holding Camellia’s hand. It was Partition that ruined his mother, set her on the course toward the ruined palace, Shahid had told me.“We had to start all over again,” he said.In the early 1970s, still empty-handed, increasingly bizarre in her behaviour, Wilayat announced to the world that she was the queen of Oudh, demanding the vast properties of a kingdom that no longer existed. An ordinary grievance, unaddressed, had metastasised to become an epic one.They took on new identities: Farhad became Princess Sakina, occasionally Princess Alexandrina Mickey became Prince Ali Raza, and later called himself Prince Cyrus. They no longer made any mention of their Pakistani relatives, or the spacious family house in Lahore that was waiting for them should they return. Maybe they forgot it existed. They seemed to shed their past entirely, to come from nowhere.The rest of the story you already know. They were so convincing, and so insistent, that for 40 years people believed them. So there it is: I have plundered their secret.Cyrus would have hated it. He refused to answer questions about his past it was one of the essential themes of our friendship. I try to imagine how he would react to all this. His father on his bicycle, being beaten with hockey sticks. His mother in a mental hospital where women were chained to the wall. His older brother running away, abandoning him. Mickey Butt, the name he had left behind.There is no nice way to put this. I am unravelling the story that was the central work of their lives. It is impossible to know, now that he and his sister are dead, whether they even knew it wasn’t all true. Either way, this article would have crushed him. And yet, why do you invite a journalist into your life, if you do not expect this to happen? That is like asking a dog not to bark.I must admit, it offends me a little when people think they can lie to reporters. But even today there are plenty of autorickshaw drivers in Old Delhi who will tell you about the prince who lived in the jungle. And they will be telling that story long after mine has come and gone.I was reminded of this on my last trip to Delhi. I visited the cemetery where Cyrus is buried. I had an idea of placing a stone there, something that said Prince Cyrus of Oudh. But he had been buried as an unclaimed body, assigned the number DD33B. Unclaimed bodies are marked only with chips of stone, and small mounds extend in all directions, to the vanishing point. After wandering the cemetery for what seemed like hours, I sat down, sweaty and miserable.“He is lost in a city of the dead,” I wrote in my notebook.The strangerMy colleague Suhasini was haranguing the clerk, urging him to look through his ledger one more time, when I realised that a man was warming himself beside a stove, listening intently. He then stood up and presented himself, rather formally.He was Mohammad Aslam Chowdhury, a seller of electrical wiring from Old Delhi. He was wearing a voluminous, cheap-looking tweed jacket, and had a squiff of hair, dyed jet black. He presented a plastic folder and showed me its contents. It was filled with newspaper clippings about Cyrus’s death.He said he carried the clippings to remind himself how swiftly earthly glory passes. “In Old Delhi, this was the only topic of conversation,” he said. “People were saying such a big king passed away like this, in such a way that nobody knew him. How could the scion of such an illustrious royal family get lost in the darkness of oblivion?”As he spoke of Cyrus’s death, Chowdhury became distressed. “I feel really emotional about this, that something like this can happen on an Earth made by God,” he cried out, as the other people in the clerk’s office turned to stare. “O destiny, tell me why you are angry with me. What I have done wrong?”I glanced incredulously at my interpreter: Could this really be happening? But Chowdhury was in his own world. The story of the royals of Oudh had sounded a note within him. He would be telling the story for years, I realised.“If a person like this has gone into oblivion, and had this death of anonymity,” he said, wonderingly, “what can you say about the death of a commoner?” – New York Times"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4102421.1575321498!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"woman survives in australian outback for 12 days by boiling groundwater","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe trio’s truck  became bogged down in a riverbed and they suddenly found themselves in a battle for survival. Photograph: iStock The three Australians told family and friends they were making a quick trip into the central Australian outback. But when their truck became bogged down in a riverbed, they suddenly found themselves in a battle for survival, stranded in a remote landscape with little food and water.On Sunday, 12 days later, police said they had found one of the three people and a dog alive near a water hole about a mile away from the abandoned truck. Unusual tire tracks spotted by a cattle station worker, as well as a note left inside the vehicle, provided a breakthrough for searchers.The rescued woman, Tamra McBeath-Riley (52) survived in the 38-degree-plus heat by boiling and drinking groundwater, police said. She was airlifted to a roadhouse about 55 miles (88km) from Alice Springs, where paramedics found her breaking her fast with beer, cola and french fries, said Andrew Everingham, the regional manager for St John Ambulance.She was treated for dehydration and exposure and released from a hospital Monday. “It is an incredible story of survival, really,” Mr Everingham said. Although Ms McBeath-Riley had experienced some vomiting and gastrointestinal problems, he added, she was “in very good spirits and physically quite well.” Searchers in two helicopters are continuing to look for the other two people, Claire Hockridge (46) and Phu Tran (40), who split from Ms McBeath-Riley about a week ago to seek help. The two had some water with them when they broke away, although there is “significant concern” for their welfare, Mr Everingham said.When the truck first became stuck in the riverbed, the three stayed with the vehicle for a couple of days. But then they decided to set off toward the Finke River, and left a note inside the truck detailing their plans. For about a week, the group stayed close to the water, either boiling it or sieving it through a shirt to survive, Supt Pauline Vicary of the Northern Territory Police told reporters in Alice Springs on Monday. The three had brought only a packet of cookies and beef noodles for provisions.They were reported missing four days after they failed to return from their trip. But concerned that nobody was looking for them, Ms Hockridge and Mr Tran decided to venture north with a satellite navigation device and a compass. They hoped to find the Stuart Highway, about 23km (14 miles) away.Central Australia is known for its remoteness, a place where phone reception is rare and the next town can be hours of driving away. It is also dry and hot, with temperatures soaring beyond 43 degrees on some summer days and dropping rapidly at night.“We have historically seen a number of people struggle and require rescue, and we have seen some poor outcomes,” Mr Everingham said. Police said that the terrain in the search area included sandy dunes, hard clay, dense trees and rocks. “It’s quite a erse terrain and challenging terrain to look in,” Ms Vicary said.–New York Times "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4101991.1575301249!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"a story of being trafficked prince andrew s accuser speaks out","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVirginia Roberts Giuffre: Tells Monday night’s BBC Panorama  that Andrew was “the most hideous dancer I’ve ever seen in my life” and “his sweat was . . . raining basically everywhere”. Photograph: Jefferson SiegelThe New York TimesPrince Andrew’s accuser, Virginia Giuffre, has implored the British public to “stand up beside me to help me fight this fight” and “not accept this as being okay”.Ms Giuffre claims she was trafficked by disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and forced to have sex with the Duke of York when she was a teenager, which the duke categorically denies.In an interview with BBC Panorama, she told how Andrew was “the most hideous dancer I’ve ever seen in my life” and “his sweat was . . . raining basically everywhere”.She added: “I implore the people in the UK to stand up beside me, to help me fight this fight, to not accept this as being okay.“This is not some sordid sex story. This is a story of being trafficked, this is a story of abuse and this is a story of your guys’ royalty.”The hour-long investigative programme titled The Prince and the Epstein Scandal is being broadcast on BBC One on Monday at 9pm.Tramp nightclubIn clips released ahead of the screening, Ms Guiffre alleged how she was brought to London by Epstein in 2001, introduced to Andrew and taken to Tramp nightclub, and asked by the duke to dance.She told Panorama reporter Darragh Macintyre: “He is the most hideous dancer I’ve ever seen in my life.“It was horrible and this guy was sweating all over me, his sweat was like it was raining basically everywhere, I was just like grossed out from it, but I knew I had to keep him happy because that’s what Jeffrey and Ghislaine would have expected from me.”When they had left the club, Ms Giuffre said the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s then-girlfriend, gave her instructions.“In the car Ghislaine tells me that I have to do for Andrew what I do for Jeffrey and that just made me sick.”She said that later that evening she had sex with Andrew upstairs at Maxwell’s house in Belgravia.The duke has denied meeting Ms Giuffre, then called Virginia Roberts, saying: “I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened. I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.”PhotographThe duke has been pictured with his arm around Ms Giuffre’s waist at Ghislaine Maxwell’s house.He said he had no memory of the photo being taken and questioned whether it was his own hand in the image.Ms Giuffre told Panorama: “The people on the inside are going to keep coming up with these ridiculous excuses.“Like his arm was elongated or the photo was doctored, or he came to New York to break up with Jeffrey Epstein. I mean, come on, I’m calling BS on this, because that’s what it is.“He knows what happened. I know what happened and there’s only one of us telling the truth, and I know that’s me.”Andrew’s attempts to defend himself against Ms Giuffre’s previous accusations and explain his friendship with convicted sex offender Epstein in the BBC Newsnight interview last month were regarded as a disaster, and led to him withdrawing from public duties.He was widely criticised for failing to show remorse for his association with Epstein or empathy with Epstein’s victims during his television appearance.He has resigned from a large number of patronages and seen organisations he was once involved with sever ties.Ms Giuffre claimed in court papers in Florida that she was forced to have sex with Andrew when she was aged 17, below the state’s age of consent.Buckingham Palace has branded the allegations “false and without any foundation”, stating: “Any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors” by the duke was “categorically untrue”.Ms Giuffre alleges the duke slept with her on three separate occasions, twice while she was underage.During his Newnight interview, the duke said an alleged encounter with Ms Giuffre in 2001 did not happen as he spent the day with his daughter, Princess Beatrice, taking her to Pizza Express in Woking for a party.Epstein took his own life in August in a New York prison while he was being held on sex trafficking charges.Ms Giuffre’s interview took place before the duke’s appearance on Newsnight. – PA"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per

merritt first line defence against usman khans london bridge","story":"Jack Merritt had gone to try and calm Usman Khan down, witnesses say When Usman Khan emerged into the hallway armed and ready to begin his rampage of terror it was his mentor Jack Merritt who was the first to rush to stop him.Friends and colleagues have said that he had found an affinity with the convicted terrorists, and was convinced that he could “guide him to redemption”.But that faith was repaid with violence as Khan slashed out at those who tried to prevent his murderous spree.A detailed account of the first moments of Friday’s attack has emerged for the first time along with stories of the incredible acts of heroism of members of the public.Khan had been given special permission by the authorities to travel to London unsupervised and had in the morning given a “convincing” talk about his rehabilitation during a workshop at Learning Together’s fifth anniversary event.Usman Khan before his original conviction But the convicted terrorist, who had only been released from prison 11 months earlier, used a break in the afternoon’s proceedings to go into the toilets and tape a fake suicide vest to his body and knives to his hands.At around 1.55pm he emerged into the hallway on the first floor of the Fishmongers Hall and began his attack.Mr Merritt, 25, who had helped to organise the event, ran out to try and calm him down along with others who had been in the Banqueting Hall of the Grade I listed building, sources told the .Bryonn Bain, an associate professor with the University of California in Los Angeles who spoke at the conference, said that the “brave” Cambridge Graduate “was the first line of defence, he was the first person to confront him”.Lukasz, a worker at the venue had been cleaning glasses in the basement and heard the screams, also ran to help.“He goes towards the trouble, he gets there on the first floor and it is very clear that there’s a bad guy, he’s got two knives in his hand, there’s screaming, there’s chaos,” Toby Williamson, chief executive of the Fishmongers Company, told the BBC as he paid tribute to his staff.Lukasz armed himself with a long stick and “charges towards the bad guy” but hits “something protective”.But he’s buying time and he allows others to escape to move to adjacent rooms and at that point he has about a one minute one on one straight combat,” Mr Williamson said.“This guy Khan then works his way up Lukasz pole slashing with his knife, he takes five wounds to his left side.”Mr Bain said that it “felt like a warzone... it felt like total chaos.Lukasz, who it was announced on Monday will be getting an honour for bravery in his native Poland, started to lose strength but two men from the conference rushed to intervene.One was armed with a fire extinguisher and the other with a narwhal tusk that he had ripped from the wall.“They come and join the fight and it is pretty gruesome and I think the terrorist decided he was outnumbered, he runs though and goes down the main staircase and the next bit of hell is he is at reception and he can\u0027t get out the front door,  Mr Williamson said.Gareth, the doorman is pushing the door shut as good as he can whilst another worker named only as Dawn calls the police. People were trying to keep the door closed and Khan was swinging knives at them, it was said.Saskia Jones, a 23-year-old who had volunteered with Learning Together, a Cambridge University rehabilitation initiative, was also fatally wounded inside the building and at least two others were seriously injured.Saskia Jones was killed by Khan inside the Fishmongers Hall Finding himself trapped Khan turned to the girls in the cloakroom, Alla and Sandra, and gives them a “hell of a time” before a showdown in the entrance hall with Lukasz “leading the charge”.Mr Williamson said: “Andy the last guy introduced here, our maintenance man, he’s a Ministry of Defence ex-policeman and he’s also a pretty cool customer.“But when the knife goes to his chest and kill or open the door is the choice he pauses for a moment, he’s reluctant to spill all this out onto the pavement when members of public are going to be facing the same problems but he makes exactly the right choice, the door’s opened, out the terrorist falls and the first one after him is Lukasz shouting at everyone to get out of the way, to get back.But members of the public just don’t do that nowadays, they do what they needed to do, they join in and the man with the fire extinguisher, the man with the narwhal tusk, they are all in there.”Footage has emerged of the two men linked to the charity spraying and prodding Khan with the Narwhal tusk before he is tackled to the floor.Some of the have-a-go-heroes were former convicts who were attending the event, it was said. Moments later, at 2.02pm police marksmen arrive and after pulling the final member of the public away from Khan he is shot dead.Explained | The legend of the narwhal tuskBut in his wake he left a trail of devastation, with Mr Bain recognising: “I saw people die. I saw things that I will never be able to unsee.Those who will feel that devastation most keenly are the family and friends of Miss Jones and Mr Merritt, who had dedicated their lives to helping others.David Merritt wrote that his son was “was selfless in his dedication to make things right in every second of his life”.“Jack devoted his energy to the purpose of Learning Together: a pioneering programme to bring students from university and prisons together to share their unique perspectives on justice,” he said.“Unlike many of us, Jack did not just go to work. He lived and breathed fire in his pursuit of a better world for all humanity, particularly those most in need.”It emerged that Khan had shown “an affinity” towards Jack Merritt, the Learning Together course co-ordinator who helped mentor and supervise him.One source at Cambridge said: “We’ve heard that Khan was initially very sceptical about the group that wanted to help him rebuild his life but built up a mutual understanding and respect towards Jack. It wasn’t so much a friendship, but there seems to have been a special bond, a closeness.“Jack was convinced he could guide Khan to redemption, I think he really believed that he could turn his life round. “He even became a case study for the group.“That’s why it’s so galling that Jack was murdered in cold blood by the man who appeared to have bonded with him. “NHS spend £2.5m a week on out of area mental health patientsEnergy customers being left on phone for up to 41 mins, Which? findsFacebook \u0026#39doesn\u0026#39t care\u0026#39 about helping police solve child abuse, senior officer warnsPrince Andrew Panorama special review: A chilling noir-ish journey into a heart of darknessPrince William says he is worried about where our recycling goes as he joins litter pickers on Kuwait beachLabour told to \u0026#39come clean\u0026#39 about how it obtained leaked government documents after report  links them to RussiaBoris Johnson to have minimal contact with Donald Trump during UK visit amid fears it could negatively impact ToriesSecond terror suspect returned to prison as officers begin working through list of 69 suspectsComment: The chilling truth is that Corbyn does not believe in defending the WestAnjem Choudary\u0026#39s licence under \u0026#39urgent\u0026#39 review in wake of London Bridge attackPolice strip-searched minors at Australian music festivalLondon Bridge terrorist may have been \u0026#39incapable of rehabilitation\u0026#39 as he \u0026#39hoodwinked\u0026#39 authorities, ministers believeRoman Empire did not fall because of plague, study claimsNish Kumar met with boos and bread rolls for Brexit joke Man arrested after schoolboy, 12, killed and five others injured following hit-and-run outside Essex schoolI was supposed to be at the tragic Learning Together event in London Bridge - but I still think rehabilitation can workNo $2.8m payday for poker player as French court rules it is a game of \u0026#39chance not physical skill\u0026#39Comment: The Left\u0026#39s hypocrisy over the \u0026#39politicisation\u0026#39 of London Bridge is staggering\tWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/12/02/TELEMMGLPICT000190297199_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"labours cynical plan railways would worst possible worlds","story":"Labour have promised an eye-watering 33 per cent cut to regulated fares and free rail travel for under-16s from the start of next monthTheir unaffordable programme would put vested interest groups ahead of passengers From today and until New Year’s Day, commuters who use South West Trains will have a tough time of it.

That led to queues at Tube stations as travellers got their devices ready to pay.Now it will work in the same way as a contactless bank card, needing only to be tapped on the reader, as long as the new mode is switched on.​A notification is being sent out to users in the London area making them aware of the feature.The move comes as one in five contactless journeys across TfL are now made using a smart device.It is a step change in the way we think about how to charge people, the notion of having to understand what ticket you need, do I need an Oyster Card, explained Mike Tuckett, head of transformation delivery for TfL.We\u0027re just trying to sweep that away and make it super simple.Other transactions using Apple Pay will still need to be authenticated in the usual way, using Face ID or Touch ID before making a purchase.It\u0027s the first time Express Transit has been enabled in the UK, after countries including China and Japan, as well as a trial in New York.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Anything below 50 means the sector is contracting. However, market watchers might take some relief from the fact that it beat preliminary figures of 48.3, released for the first time ever two weeks ago.Created with Sketch.

The company provides automotive and and industrial parts worldwide and the Llanelli plant employs over 200 people. Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateThe sector was hit as companies continued to eat up the stockpiles they had built up in anticipation of a no-deal Brexit.Companies had worried they might not be able to get some supplies from Europe if Britain crashed out without a deal. However, now that the Brexit date has been postponed, businesses are using up these supplies, and not buying new products.This meant that new orders fell for the seventh month in a row, a fact that was exacerbated by global trade worries. The drop in new export orders was one of the steepest in the past seven years.“A heavy sense of inevitability hung around the sector in November as it continued to suffer the effects of a lethal cocktail of Brexit uncertainty, slowing global growth and an impending general election,” said Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply.He added: “Inevitably, where new orders fall, jobs are sure to follow and manufacturing employment fell at its fastest pace since September 2012.“Firms tried to balance their books by reducing overheads and improving efficiencies quickly, and staff numbers were the casualties.”Several businesses decided to shut their doors in November, with Mothercare among the highest-profile casualties.Last week Bonmarche announced it was avoiding collapse after being taken out of administration by Peacocks. But around 240 jobs will still be lost as 30 stores are closed before Christmas.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.Stephen Phipson, chief executive of Make UK, said: “Uncertainties about the outcome of Brexit and the impending general election continue to weigh on the UK manufacturing sector but the build-up to Christmas has brought a much needed boost.“Firms are reporting weaker business activity overall, especially from the domestic UK market, but export orders have increased slightly this quarter, indicating greater confidence from foreign customers about purchasing UK goods as concerns about an end-of-year no-deal Brexit fade.Hard Brexit would ‘slash UK car production by a third’“Manufacturers will hope that the next 12 months will see a return to Westminster focusing on critical issues such as delivering a long term vision for the economy.”Tom Lawton, head of manufacturing at BDO, which helped with the research, added: “Investment levels have slightly improved this quarter following a series of declines since the start of the year.“While this is positive, and possibly a sign that the prospect of a no-deal Brexit is less of a short-term worry, firms are still facing an uphill battle.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Citizens of Israel, Japan and South Korea were also not welcome.US Assistant Attorney General John Demers claimed that Mr Griffith provided highly technical information to North Korea, knowing that it could be used to launder money and evade sanctions.Despite receiving warnings not to go, Griffith allegedly travelled to one of the United States’ foremost adversaries, North Korea, where he taught his audience how to use blockchain technology to evade sanctions, Mr Demers said in a statement. By this complaint, we begin the process of seeking justice for such conduct.”Several high-profile figures within the cryptocurrency industry have expressed their support for Mr Griffith, including ethereum\u0026nbspfounder Vitalik Buterin, and cybersecurity pioneer John McAfee.Virgil Griffith\u0026nbsparrested for teaching North Korea how to avoid US\u0026nbspsanctions by using cryptocurrency and the blockchain, Mr McAfee tweeted.See what our government has become - a government corrupt at the core, declaring publicly available information a national secret.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He knows what happened, I know what happened. And there’s only one of us telling the truth.”But Prince Andrew told Newsnight that he did not remember the photograph being taken, and said he could not be certain it was his hand on her.He added: “From the investigations that we’ve done, you can’t prove whether or not that photograph is faked or not, because it is a photograph of a photograph of a photograph.“So it’s very difficult to be able to prove it, but I don’t remember that photograph ever being taken.“I am not one to, as it were, hug, and public displays of affection are not something that I do.“So that’s the best explanation I can give you, and I’m afraid to say that I don’t believe that photograph was taken in the way that has been suggested.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

There was no waiting in the lines obviously – you were with a prince,” she told Panorama.\u0026nbsp“Andrew asked me what I wanted to drink, you know, and I said, ‘Oh, you know, something from the bar’. He had something clear. I know mine was vodka … and then he asked me to dance.“He is the most hideous dancer I’ve ever seen in my life.“I mean it was horrible and this guy was sweating all over me, like his sweat was like it was raining basically everywhere. I was just like ‘ugh’ – grossed out from it, but I knew I had to keep him happy because that’s what Jeffrey and Ghislaine would have expected from me.”When they left the club, Ms Giuffre says Ms Maxwell gave her instructions.“In the car Ghislaine tells me that I have to do for Andrew what I do for Jeffrey, and that just made me sick.”\u0026nbspShe said that later that evening, she had sex with the duke upstairs at Ms Maxwell’s house in Belgravia.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I mean come on.“I’m calling BS on this. He knows what happened, I know what happened.

This is a story of being trafficked, this is a story of abuse and this is a story of your guys’ royalty.”The Panorama interview was recorded before the Prince spoke to Newsnight but she has since told the BBC she stands by every word she said.In response to the programme, Buckingham Palace referred to a previous statement saying: “It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.”A statement last month said the duke “unequivocally regrets his ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein” and “deeply sympathises with those affected who want some form of closure”.The Prince and the Epstein Scandal\u0026nbspis on BBC One at 9pm.Duke of York\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Anything below 50 means the sector is contracting. However, market watchers might take some relief from the fact that it beat preliminary figures of 48.3, released for the first time ever two weeks ago.Created with Sketch.

The company provides automotive and and industrial parts worldwide and the Llanelli plant employs over 200 people. Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateThe sector was hit as companies continued to eat up the stockpiles they had built up in anticipation of a no-deal Brexit.Companies had worried they might not be able to get some supplies from Europe if Britain crashed out without a deal. However, now that the Brexit date has been postponed, businesses are using up these supplies, and not buying new products.This meant that new orders fell for the seventh month in a row, a fact that was exacerbated by global trade worries. The drop in new export orders was one of the steepest in the past seven years.“A heavy sense of inevitability hung around the sector in November as it continued to suffer the effects of a lethal cocktail of Brexit uncertainty, slowing global growth and an impending general election,” said Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply.He added: “Inevitably, where new orders fall, jobs are sure to follow and manufacturing employment fell at its fastest pace since September 2012.“Firms tried to balance their books by reducing overheads and improving efficiencies quickly, and staff numbers were the casualties.”Several businesses decided to shut their doors in November, with Mothercare among the highest-profile casualties.Last week Bonmarche announced it was avoiding collapse after being taken out of administration by Peacocks. But around 240 jobs will still be lost as 30 stores are closed before Christmas.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Heres what happened in the BBC interview.During the interview Prince Andrew denied he slept with Virginia Giuffre, one of Epsteins victims, on three separate occasions, twice while she was underage.He said one encounter in  did not happen as he spent the day with his daughter Princess Beatrice, taking her to Pizza Express in Woking for a party.The same alleged sexual liaison, which the American Virginia Giuffre said began with the royal sweating heavily as they danced at London nightclub Tramp, was factually wrong, the Duke said.This is because, he claimed, he had a medical condition at the time which meant he did not sweat.He twice stated his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein had provided seriously beneficial outcomes, giving him the opportunity to meet people and prepare for a future role as a trade envoy.He cast doubt on the authenticity of a picture that appears to show Andrew with his arm around the waist of Mrs Giuffre, when a teenager.The royal said: From the investigations that weve done, you cant prove whether or not that photograph is faked or not because it is a photograph of a photograph of a photograph. “So its very dficult to be able to prove it but I dont remember that photograph ever being taken.He expressed regret at making contact with Epstein in  - flying to New York to say in person the friendship was over - after the -year-old had been released from an -month prison term for prostituting minors.But Maitlis highlighted how he spent a number of days with him at his home, and how he was guest of honour at a dinner party she said celebrated Epsteins release.Not good at all.The interview has been widely criticised with commentators questioning his responses and condemning his unsympathetic tone and lack of remorse for the friendship with the sex offender.It has been condemned,even by royalists. Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, told BBC Radio s World at One programme that in the wake of the interview, Andrew could find himself out of the core Royal Family,reports are correct that the monarchy will be slimmed down when the Prince of Wales becomes king.Public relations and crisis consultant Mark Borkowski said about the interview: I have never seen anything so disastrous. For any students of PR that is how not to do it.It was like watching a man in quicksand and unfortunately, I dont think anyone would have thrown him a line to get him out.The BBC has reported sources close to the Duke as saying he stands by his decision to set the record straight about his relationship with the disgraced financier - and counter allegations he slept with one of Epsteins groomed teenagers.Conflicting reports in the newspapers, also based on sources, claim Andrew told the Queen his television appearance on BBCs Newsnight programme was a success, while another says he expressed to friends regret at not mentioning sympathy for the women trafficked for sex by Epstein.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They were WRONG. All those Labour toffs thought they could live without all of us thick, ignorant peasants who dared to disobey the establishment and vote for Brexit.Emily Thornberry — Lady Nugee, who chuckled at seeing the flag of  St George! — was wrong. Sir Keir Starmer, so passionate in his adoration of Brussels, was wrong.Corbyn — a man without a patriotic bone in his withered old carcass — was wrong. Labour’s total contempt for the working class, who they were founded to represent, has them stumbling towards defeat.So Labour are rethinking their General Election strategy.In Leave-voting areas, Labour will get down on their knees and beg the working class to come home.Even an unequivocal Remainer like Ed Miliband is pretending he has always fought for a Brexit deal.No, Ed — you fought to keep us in a single market and a customs union. You fought for a Brexit that was unworthy of the name.You fought for a deal that was worse than staying in the EU.Labour should really stop fibbing to the British people.The modern Labour Party has no love, affection or understanding of the working class. It is the Tories who now represent the values of  the working man and woman — their patriotism, their belief in democracy, their belief in family  and hard work.In working-class communities, Labour are ludicrously flexing their non-existent Leave credentials — which is both bitterly ironic and horribly hypocritical.Ask all the decent Labour MPs who have suffered torrents of abuse from Labour’s online thugs for ­daring to suggest that the Referendum result, and democracy itself, should be respected.Labour are the Remain party who are too pathetically gutless to admit it. But this election is not simply about Brexit.Infinitely more important than our relationship with the European Union is stopping an economically moronic, terrorist sympathiser like Corbyn from getting anywhere near  Downing Street.I have only ever been a member of one political party — Labour.It was the party of my family, my neighbourhood and my class.That party no longer exists.Corbyn and his Marxist muppets have ruined Labour with their sickening Jew-baiting racism, their puerile class war, their total lack of understanding of even basic ­economics.Do not let them ruin the country.Do not believe the lies that they are going to tell you over the next  days.Andyou are working class, never believe for a single second that this pathetic excuse for a ­Labour Party is on your side.Labour have thrown in their lot with privately educated revolutionaries who would rather wave a Palestinian flag than the Union Jack.And it is only now they are starting to regret it.TOSSING back her golden tresses, Charlize Theron wears a gold dress against a golden background in an ad for Dior’s J’Adore perfume – which comes in a golden bottle.It is like being buried in an avalanche of Ferrero Rocher chocolates.And that’s a compliment.And because he wasn’t there, he must also have invented the scene where a young Prince Charles sobs because he has been forced to break up with a hot young Camilla.And far more offensively, Morgan is surely making it all up when he depicts the Queen faking a tear as she witnesses the horror of  Aberfan.All the real-le photos of the Queen visiting the tragic Welsh mining village show her looking shocked  beyond belief.I do not believe she faked a tear for the cameras.I enjoy The Crown but it is only a posh EastEnders.Don’t mistake it for anything resembling  historical truth.WHAT happened to Katie Price’s £million fortune Just guessing here – she spent it.I will leave it to others to analyse Katie’s profligacy with money and just say this in her defence.She has been a loving mother to her children, including her blind, autistic son Harvey, now , who she seems to have raised single-handedly.She is an inspiration to any parents raising a disabled child.  She has confronted the evil bullies who have mocked her son.She has been a passionate campaigner to hold social media s to account and make online abuse a criminal offence.I don’t think there is anyone in the country who has been more willing to stand up to bullies than Katie.And now she is bankrupt, owing £, to her creditors.I suspect she has faced bigger battles than bankruptcy.THE Liberal Democrats thought vowing to immediately cancel Brexit when Jo Swinson becomes Prime Minister would be a vote winner.Whoops! Now the Lib Dems are desperately offering a second Referendum.Whoops again!Because millions of us hope we never see another referendum in our letime.Paul has had more barmaids than the Rovers Return.VICTORIA Beckham’s  fashion empire has lost a jaw-dropping £million over  years.So who is doing Victoria’s financial planning Diane Abbott CLIVE James, who has died at the age of , was always the smartest man in the room.I met him a few times over the years but the Australian journalist, broadcaster and wit was best experienced on the page and on TV. That is when you got the full force of his brain, which was the size of a planet.Clive was also that great rarity – a true intellectual who was a laugh.As a TV critic, he brought his savage wit to bear on the nuttiest nooks and crannies of global television. As a writer, he was funny, wise and often deeply moving.When Princess Diana died, Clive wrote an unforgettable eulogy in the New Yorker magazine. It recalled how he met her, how their friendship grew and how, at their last lunch in Kensington Palace with -year-old Prince Harry present, he realised that he was about to be dropped from Diana’s court.“I never saw her again,” James concluded. “Neither will anyone  now.”I loved Clive because he made great writing look easy and he made me laugh.As recently as one week ago, a magazine asked Clive what was bothering him at the moment.“Imminent personal extinction,” he replied.And it is a mark of Clive James’ genius that I can’t imagine anyone  in the world coming out with that hilariously honest quip.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Despite what some of them think, Leave voters aren’t stupid and will see through their attempts to hoodwink them.”Sixteen of the  are Labour MPs seeking re-election, having defied voters in the past three years by voting to block, delay and derail Brexit on numerous occasions.Eight are in very heavy Leave areas where up to  per cent backed Brexit.They include high-profile figures such as the former Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett, ex-minister Chris Bryant and former shadow Cabinet member Mary Creagh.In total,  General Election candidates have signed a pledge drawn up by the campaign group Remain Labour.It states: “Labour is committed to a confirmatory referendum, to give you the final say on Brexit. If elected as your Labour MP, I pledge to campaign to Remain in the EU.”By contrast, all  Tory candidates have promised to vote in favour of Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal.But many Labour hopefuls appear to be going back on their word to deliver the will of the people.Mrs Beckett,  defending her Derby South seat where . per cent voted Leave, had previously insisted she accepted the decision her constituents had made. She declared in May : “We have to make the best of it.”Another, Anna Turley — seeking re-election in Redcar where . per cent voted for Brexit — had said: “I will fight for a Brexit that is fair for Teesside”.Wakefield MP Ms Creagh, who declared before the referendum “ we vote to leave, there’s no going back”, is now of the firm belief there is.Jess Phillips has also signed the Remain Pledge despite assuring Birmingham Yardley voters in : “Sixty-odd per cent of constituents want us to leave. I cannot ignore that.”Labour campaign chiefs will this week launch a last-ditch blitz of “Red Wall” Leave-voting constituencies amid evidence working classes are rallying behind Boris Johnson to save Brexit.They face losing a swathe of seats in the north Midlands and Wales, with the biggest swing to Tories in Leave areas.Labour support in Grimsby, held by the party since , has now collapsed dramatically from  per cent in  to just  per cent.Tony Blair’s former seat of Sedgefield, which has not had a Tory MP since , is on BoJo’s target list.An overwhelming . per cent there voted to Leave and sitting MP Phil Wilson said in : “We respect their decisions and voted accordingly in Parliament in favour of Article .” Yet he has since put his name to the “Remain Pledge”.Ilford North’s Wes Streeting has also changed his stance since he said: “I voted to give the people a choice and I will abide by their decision.” Many Labour candidates who have not signed the pledge have barely tried to hide their derision for Leave voters.Sonya Ward, standing in Mansfield, mocked the . per cent who voted Leave there by claiming they “got it wrong, because they didn’t understand”.Tory chairman James Cleverly said last night: “This is a damning indictment of the very people these candidates want to represent, as well as the .million people who voted to leave in .“Despite pledging to respect the result of the referendum, Labour candidates have turned their backs on Brexit in favour of backing a second referendum and stopping Brexit altogether.”Former Labour leader Ed Miliband, defending the Brexit hotbed of Doncaster North, has not signed the pledge.He has been telling his constituents,   per cent Leave, that he voted for a Brexit deal nine times — but Tories pointed out he voted down Theresa May’s and Boris Johnson’s.His double-dealing exposes the scale of panic in Labour’s northern heartlands.Left-wing activist Owen Jones woke up to the Brexit backlash last week, admitting: “If Labour doesn’t do more to win back Leave voters in the North, Midlands and Wales, then Boris Johnson will win a majority.”One candidate revealed they clocked up  miles knocking on doors in their constituency.The source said: “Walking for six or seven hours a day is taking its toll especially in the cold.“People are picking up injuries and we’ve still got two weeks to go.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And  I understand the desire to let yourself off the leash. But it might be one of the few times you find yourself in the same room as your boss — with a chance to impress or ruin your career.You’ll be well aware we are living in the #MeToo era. And we all know, on occasions, it can go too far and that we shouldn’t all be frightened about exactly what we say and who to say it to.To allay your fears, my advice to you isyou want to dance with a colleague, ask her. If she says no then that’s your answer.Compliments are fine by the way. Us women love them , but think of your sister when giving them out.“You look great in that dress” is something you’d say to your sister, and “you look hot in that dress” isn’t.If you are looking at the month ahead and feeling overwhelmed already, this is really the only advice that you need: Start delegating.Write a list of all the jobs that need to be done and then allocate jobs to everyone over the age of ten.Getting your family to pull their weight is the best way to ensure that everyone has a happy Christmas.I know a lot of people dread the season, partly because they have to spend time with tricky in-laws.You can either not invite them  — why ruin your day   — or invite others too . Or just grin and bear it.Lastly,you are struggling with presents, please allow me to share the rules of our traditional Brady Family Christmas Present Game, played by the  members of our family on Christmas Day.Everyone buys four gts, having set a price limit: We have three at £, one at £.Wrap each one beautully so it’s impossible to distinguish premium from Primark. I once placed a roll of toilet paper with Donald Trump’s face on it in a Chanel gt bag — it was the hotly contended present everyone wanted that year . . . until they opened it.You place all gts on the table then take it in turns to throw a dice. When you get a six you pick anyone present you want . Keep throwing until all gts are distributed.Then throw six rounds with two dice and for every six you get you can pinch a present from anyone’s pile.And when it’s done you keep and open the presents you have won. It keeps us occupied for hours.I LOVED the photos of Kelly Brook in the Bahamas, where she is celebrating turning . What a great advert she is for the idea that le begins at !Kelly is naturally beautul with a big smile – and I think she looks absolutely amazing.“Lord Sugar couldn’t relate to me. That was the fundamental problem.“And I started getting that feeling from about week four.”The problem with interviews like this is that it puts her in danger of sounding a little bit like a sore loser.Oh, and also, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but Lord Sugar doesn’t particularly like any of them at the moment.CONGRATULATIONS to builder Steve Thomson, , and his we Lenka, , who scooped the  £million EuroMillions jackpot.All their neighbours have said it couldn’t happen to a nicer couple. And I love the fact that the first thing they want to do with the money is given each of their three kids their own bedroom. This is a fairly humble ambition when you consider they are now one of the biggest British Lottery winners of all time.I also love the fact that Steve said he won’t stop working as a builder and will finish all his jobs before Christmas.He’s also already spelled out to his children thatthey want something “you’ll have to earn it”.All of which reveal an outlook that will stand him in very good stead indeed. It might just mean that he will be able to enjoy his win.The fact is money does change people. It also changes the way others see you. Most families will expect something and when they don’t get it will be angry. They will say things such as “we only want a car . . . it’s not much money for you, but would mean a lot to us”.They will expect you to share out your good fortune.My advice would be to think carefully about what to do with it before you make any rash decisions – and get a very good financial adviser.The problem with people who win a lot of money is that they often totally abandon all their values and spend, spend, spend. Let’s hope Steve and Lenka hold on to theirs.Yes, sure, I can see the temptation to magically get rid of the weight that inevitably comes when you have been, you know, growing another human being inside your body.But she only had a baby six weeks ago and,she waits a bit, she’ll probably just lose the baby weight naturally.In the meantime, yet another celeb demonstrates – and adds to – the pressure to “snap back” to their pre-pregnancy figure within weeks! Yes, your body is important but so is your mind!Six weeks after birth seems too soon to me.EVENit is true that the new Calornian craze of “butt sunning” gives you “surges of energy”, better sleep and “more creativity flowing through le”, which is what one devotee called Meagan promised on a recent Instagram post, I can’t see it catching on here.Meagan  says she has incorporated “perineum sunning” – which involves presenting the area between the anus and vulva to the sun – in to her “daily rising routine”.But talk about the sun shining out of your ar*e…what on earth must the neighbours think.ULRIKA JONSSON is on a dating app for people over   Good for her. She deserves another chance at happiness –  and at  she’s got a lot of le ahead of her.A lot of jokes are made at the expense of Ulrika’s love le and the fact she has had four kids by four men. I can’t help thinking it would be discussed in a dferent wayshe was a man.I KNOW some people are annoyed that Uber will not be granted a new licence to operate in London after repeated safety failures.But I think it’s great news. The reason that the licence hasn’t been granted is because Transport For  London said that the taxi app was not “fit and proper” as a licence holder.I can see the appeal of Uber – but notthe price we are paying is safety.Also, we are lucky enough to live in a country that has the best black cab drivers in the world – who know where they are actually going because they train for up to four years.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A Mirror investigation has found a dozen connections between the party of government and those who seek to profit from our NHS.They include Boris Johnson ’s former chief adviser Dominic Cummings, who previously worked for a healthcare firm which might benefit from a £million fund announced by the Government.This raises a question of a potential conflict of interest, as does a donation Health Secretary Matt Hancock received from the owner of a private NHS provider who has given £, to the Tories and has been made a director of NHS Improvement. Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth said: “This damning evidence shows beyond a shadow of doubt that the Tories simply don’t believe in the NHS and its future as a public universal free service is at stake. The revolving door between the Tories and the private health industry stinks.” Unison boss Dave Prentis said: “Patients and staff will be shocked to learn of the cosy relationship between senior Conservatives and some of the biggest players in the UK’s private healthcare market. “The NHS needs a government that protects it, instead of one that puts profit ahead of patient care.” Jeremy Corbyn yesterday wrote to the PM urging him to protect the NHS from US firms and demanded an end to NHS privatisation.The letter was sent just hours before US President Donald Trump arrived for a three-day visit.  The Labour leader wrote: “The public need to know all aspects of our health service are genuinely off the table in any UK-US trade talks, and that no part of the NHS or health system will be up for sale.”He added the “threat to the NHS from a future post-Brexit US-UK trade agreement, given the statements made by both US and British officials and politicians, is of profound concern to the public.”  He warned: “The cost of patented drugs in the USA is approximately . times higher than in the UK, and the price of the top  medicines is . times higher than in the UK. Your proposed trade deal with the US clearly threatens to drive up the cost at which our NHS buys drugs.” Mr Corbyn called for trade talks with the US to be shelved until the President agrees to remove “any reference to pharmaceuticals” from a pact.  He also wrote to the US President demanding similar reassurances. It comes after Labour uncovered official documents revealing the NHS is on the table in trade talks with the US. Experts warn the NHS could end up paying an extra £million a week. Last week, the Mirror revealed then-Trade Minister George Hollingbery met a boss of US pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly at the firm’s HQ last year.  The dirty dozen . Dominic Cummings Boris Johnson’s chief strategist until recently had previously worked at articial intelligence start-up firm Babylon Health, which is endorsed by Health Secretary Matt Hancock.

Terrorist Usman Khan killed Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones after being released early from jail on licence. Mr Corbyn warned cuts to the justice system can lead to “missed chances to intervene in the lives of people who go on to commit absolutely inexcusable acts”. He said: “You can’t keep people safe on the cheap.” He was backed by criminologist and former prison officer Ian Acheson, who led a government review of Islamist extremism in prisons and probation. Mr Acheson said: “At the heart of this is the destruction of the prison and probation service through crazy, failed, ideological austerity cuts.” Mr Corbyn also highlighted police cuts that have led to the loss of , officers since . He said: “No government can prevent every attack but it can act to make such acts of terror less rather than more likely. Public services are the glue that binds our society to­­gether – community pol­­icing, the probation service, mental health, youth and social services... When those public services are cut back they leave behind gaps.” He vowed to “do whatever is necessary and effective to keep our people safe”. Mr Corbyn, who opposed UK military action in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, also accused successive British governments – including New Labour – of fuelling the terror threat by waging war abroad. He said: “Their mistakes in no way absolve terrorists of blame for their murderous actions – the blame lies with the terrorists, their funders and recruiters.

Too often the actions of successive governments have fuelled, not reduced, that threat.”  He also lashed the government for failing to release a report into Saudi funding of extremist groups. He said: “Given Friday’s events and the continuing terror threat, it is simply unacceptable that this report is not in the public domain.” He vowed to “stop arms sales to Saudi Arabia for use in Yemen” and again pledged to introduce a War Powers Bill so a prime minister would have to win Parliament’s support for any military action. He was speaking in York on the election trail in North Yorkshire, where he was snapped in Whitby wearing a jacket with the words “for the many not the few” woven into the pinstripe.

Claire Wright is tipped by some to win in East Devon, a seat that has traditionally been a safe Conservative constituency. Love Actually star Hugh Grant has urged Labour , Lib Dem and Green voters to back Ms Wright. It comes after the MRP YouGov poll, released last week, said East Devon is likely to elect an Independent. It would be a major blow to the Conservativesthey lose the seat. Ms Wright, who has stood twice before, has seen her share of the vote rise from % in  to % in , and is eyeing up a place in Parliament. It will be an interesting battleground, Devon Live reports , as the Tories lost their district council majority in May after  years. It is now run as a minority administration by Independents. Their poll had Claire Wright on % of the vote, and ranging between % and % - just six points behind Tory candidate Simon Jupp. Ms Wright, , said: “The past few years have demonstrated that the party system is broken. “It is time for change. As an Independent, I would have exactly the same rights as other MPs and would work cross-party to achieve my manesto pledges. “I am dferent. I have no party whip to tell me how to vote. I am free to speak and free to act. And free to fight for the issues that the people of East Devon care about the most. “This election is very unpredictable and presents a rare opportunity for residents to elect an MP who truly cares and puts them first.” Former broadcaster Mr Jupp, , thinks dferently. He said: “I was expecting it to be a bit more dficult and to face a lot of opposition but people just saying to me that they want to get on with it. “I know it is what you would expect me to say, but people are telling me that they want to get Brexit done. I voted to remain, but I back Boris’s Brexit deal, it’s a fantastic deal for this country to move forward. Clearly anxious about losing the seat, both Boris Johnson and Health Secretary Matt Hancock have visited the constituency in recent weeks.  Mr Jupp said: “This may traditionally be a safe seat but it is not a safe seat this time around and we will have to fight to win it. “The Conservatives struggled earlier this year, but it is safe to say that the Tory party is in a very dferent position than it was the district council and EU elections. Speaking after a hustings event on Thursday night, Ms Wright said: Political parties should be judged on their records – ten years of grinding austerity in this case. East Devon voters should not be fooled by late apologies and hollow promises when election time comes around. “When faced by the public, the local candidate attempts to position himself as a campaigner against the same cuts over which his party has presided – it just won’t wash. The party pays lip service to the NHS. Actions always speak louder than words.

Like all schoolboys he also loves to play but there is no space for that – or even to do his homework in peace. He says: “Le in the BB is horrible, it’s worse than being in a real-le horror film. There’s no room to do anything. EvenI’m reading my book, I’m still going to get annoyed by someone. “I’ve been told off by someone for running in the small corridor. You can’t do much, you can’t play much.” The family sleep in one room and share kitchen facilities with the rest of the BB, in Ilford, East London.Will adds: “Sometimes me and Harry fight for the one chair, because we both want to sit at the table. I find it really hard to do my homework.” The brothers are among the soaring number of homeless children across Britain, increasing by one every eight minutes, according to charity Shelter. Some , youngsters will spend Christmas in temporary accommodation, a report by the charity found. Child homelessness is at its highest rate in  years, with  kids losing their homes each day last year. And for the , families with children living in emergency BBs and hostels, conditions are often sub-standard with little privacy, security or space to cook, the report found. Will’s family lost their rented home in a Section  no-fault eviction, which allows landlords to evict tenants without a reason when their fixed-term tenancy ends.Their landlord wanted to sell and thought it would be easier without a family living in the property. But with no time to save and increasingly unaffordable rents, they found themselves without enough cash for a deposit for a new rental home.  The ending of a private tenancy is the reason % of households in England became homeless or threatened with homelessness in the past year. Will says: “We moved here in September and they said we were going to stay for six weeks. “Then they told us we were going to stay for two more, then they told us it will be another week, then another one.” Will adds: “I love to read my book at the end of the day but my brother Harry needs to go to bed and we need to turn off the lights, which means I can’t see the pages. It’s really annoying that I can’t go to sleep in the bed that we share, as I have school and sometimes I am really miserable because I didn’t get a good night’s sleep. And Harry, he doesn’t like being woken up early when he hasn’t had a good night’s sleep. He sometimes falls asleep at school.” The number of children living in temporary accommodation has soared by % in Britain in the past five years. And in England, there are an additional , families with children who are homeless but have sourced their own temporary accommodation.  These families are not included in Shelter’s figures but are also officially without a home. Shelter warned that at current rates a further , children will be made homeless between now and the General Election on December . This will grow to , by Christmas. Chief executive Polly Neate says: “The fact  children become homeless every day is a scandalous figure and a reminder that political promises about tackling homelessness must be turned into action. Day in, day out we see the devastating impact the housing emergency is having on children. “They are being uprooted from friends, living in cold, cramped BBs and going to bed at night scared by the sound of strangers outside.” Shadow Housing Secretary John Healey slammed Tory cuts to housing benefits and the lack of investment. He says: “Rising homelessness is a direct result of decisions made by the Tories: slashing investment in new low-cost homes, refusing to help private renters and making huge cuts to housing benefit and homelessness services. “A Labour Government will end rough sleeping within five years and fix the root causes of rising homelessness with the biggest council and social housing programme since the s, stronger rights for renters and extra funding for homelessness services.” Your vote can help to tackle this disgrace, by Darren Lewis I still remember the times as a child when my dad struggled to find the cash-in-hand work that would keep us going. On those occasions “dinner” would consist of improvised meals, scraped together with the very last contents of the cupboard or fridge. Sometimes it would be even less than that. We lived at a time when, even after the Race Relations Act of , your CV didn’t matteran employer wanted to give a job to someone who didn’t look like you. Taking seconds at school dinner times was commonplace, as you didn’t know how big or small the evening meal would be at home. Four decades on, it is a scandal that thousands of children continue to live this.Channel ’s Dispatches documentary, Britain’s Breadline Kids, proved a harrowing insight into the scale of the problem. The sight of eight-year-old Courtney opening her fridge to find just an empty tomato ketchup bottle was heartbreaking. As was seeing her younger brother in bed with his coat on to keep warm. Delays in the Universal Credit system meant their mum Charlotte had to wait over a month for money after fleeing abuse. And still the Government reckons all ordinary people want is to Get Brexit Done  This is the politics we care about. Parents want to feed their kids without having to negotiate red tape. Girls Courtney’s age should be focused on school and Santa. Our country is going backwards. We need to use our votes to affect change.

He told the programme the Duke could have important information about sex trafficking. Mr Boies told Panorama: “One of the things that we have tried is to interview Prince Andrew and to try to get what his explanation is. He was a frequent visitor.

This is a story of being trafficked. This is a story of abuse and this is a story of your guys’ royalty.” Ms Giuffre also alleged on the programme that Maxwell helped Epstein recruit her and that the pair preyed on her vulnerability when she told them she was a runaway who had been sexually abused from a young age.

The child was allegedly made to perform sex acts in a churchyard, raped above a shop on a filthy mattress and abused when she tried to refuse their advances. A court heard how the victim was urinated on by one of the five men, all of whom went on trial today. The offences are said to have taken place in and around Telford, Shropshire, and went on for some years. The alleged victim is now an adult, Birmingham Crown Court was told.  Michelle Heeley QC, prosecuting, said: This case involves the sexual exploitation of a young girl, a girl passed around like a piece of meat for the sexual gratication of several young men, some of whom are in the dock. Each of these defendants deny that they in any way abused anyone. The prosecution say, having heard the evidence, you can be sure they did. She was befriended at a time when she was low, by a man called Tanveer Ahmed. Ahmed worked making takeaway deliveries for Perfect Pizza in the town, with jurors told the location was relevant, as the alleged victim claimed she was assaulted above the shop. The jury heard Ahmed was not on trial alongside the other five defendants, having been deported to Pakistan for other unrelated offences. After befriending the young girl, it was alleged Ahmed started forcing her to perform sex acts with other men. Ms Heeley said: One night he drove her to a flat above a shop, he took her into a room where there were three older men, and he told her she had to have sex with these men. She did not want to have sex but she was forced to, she was pushed down on to an old dirty mattress, and raped, said Ms Heeley.  She saw money exchange hands. Sadly for her, this did not happen just once, but on other occasions, when she was spat on and raped - all orchestrated by Tanveer Ahmed. He himself forced her to perform oral sex on him, andshe refused he would call her a slag, slap her and leave her stranded in random areas in Telford. Ahmed continued selling her for sex, including passing her details on to men, the prosecution said. Jurors heard this is how the girl came into contact with the first defendant, Mohammed Ali Sultan, , formerly of Telford. Ali Sultan is facing four charges of indecent assault and one of rape. Jurors were told: Ali Sultan would take her to meet other men, in the same way Tanveer Ahmed had, men would phone her and Ali Sultan and Tanveer Ahmed would make her answer, and do what the men wanted. The abuse took place at a number of locations, including above Perfect Pizza and in a churchyard in Wellington, amongst others. Ali Sultan would verbally abuse her, calling her a sl**, and on occasions slap her, or pull her hair. On a later occasion he allegedly raped her, coercing her into repeatedly meeting up by threatening to tell people at her school what she was doing. Ali Sultan is also charged in connection with a third incident, at the churchyard, when he allegedly became violent after she refused his advances.  The jury of six men and six women were told he already had convictions in both  and  for similar offences against young girls. Another of the alleged victimaposs alleged abusers is -year-old Amjad Hussain, of Telford, who is accused of forcing her to perform oral sex on two separate occasions. A third man, -year-old Shafiq Younas, from Wellington, is accused of orally raping the youngster in the same churchyard in Wellington. Another male, Nazam Akhtar, of Wellington, has been charged with rape, in an incident in which the girl was allegedly driven to a lane in a car along with Ali Sultan, Hussain, and another male.

He wasnapost mean or anything but... He got up and he said thanks, and walked out. I sat there in bed, just horried and ashamed and felt dirty and had to get up and go have a shower.

In tonightaposs hour-long investigative programme entitled The Prince and the Epstein Scandal, Ms Giuffre described how the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, Epsteinaposs then-girlfriend and daughter of disgraced tycoon Robert Maxwell, gave her instructions as they sat in a car after the sweaty nightclub ordeal.

Ken May could be booted out of his childhood home in Gateshead, after the controversial levy meant he fell £, behind on rent payments following the death of his mum.The charge is not levied on pensioners so Ken said he thinks his landlords Gateshead Housing Company are rushing through the eviction process before he starts collecting his pension next month, Chronicle Live reports.He said: Iaposm fighting a legal battle over the bedroom tax, but Iaposm due to reach state pension age in January and the bedroom tax wouldnapost apply any more. The bedroom tax, or “removal of the spare-room subsidy”, removes housing benefits from those who are deemed to have spare rooms. For one spare room a tenant loses % and for two more rooms they lose a quarter of their benefit. Theyaposre trying to evict me before the pension comes in because I could be in the property for the next  years, Ken said. Iaposve had this problem with the bedroom tax for three years and now they are trying to evict me. The housing company dispute his claims saying he is in clear breach of his tenancy agreement and they have made several attempts to help him including a crisis talk last week which he refused to attend. They also claim he has failed to follow their advice to help him keep his tenancy.  Ken, who has lived in the house since , said he has had no power in the property for three years following a dispute with utility companies over his bills. He said: Iaposve lived in this house since I was -months old, my mother died here, and I looked after her when she had cancer. If I get evicted Iaposll be on the streets at Christmas.  A spokeswoman for Gateshead Housing Company added that notice was served on Mr May because he was breaching his tenancy after several home visits and other discussions didnapost resolve things. We have been speaking with Mr May since July  to address the issue. Throughout our contact with Mr May we have tried to resolve the matter by several home visits and other discussions. In a further attempt to avoid legal action we visited Mr May last week to give him another opportunity to work with us, which he declined to do.

Little Courtney had been forced to understand the meaning of money – and how it feels to live without it. Hungry and cold, instead of enjoying a carefree childhood she worried about how her family would survive. She says: “Sometimes we slept in our coats because we couldn’t afford the heating. Mum sometimes didn’t have any dinner so me and my brother could eat ours. Or we would go to the foodbank to get food. “It was scary sometimes because I was worrying about money. It would worry me at school, and I wanted to make it better for my mum.” Mum Charlotte had fled abuse and was housed in a three-bedroom flat in Cambridge – one of the most expensive cities in the UK – with Courtney and her brother Nathaniel James, six. Out of work after being diagnosed with a serious mental health condition, the mum-of-two faced a five-week wait for Universal Credit and says she had to live on just £-a-day child benefit. Are you a struggling parent  Email webnews@mirror To add insult to injury, she had to find the money to pay bedroom tax – meaning there was little left to feed her young children or keep them warm. Charlotte, , says: “I felt like I was living in third world country, I had so little money. I had to make tough choices between paying to heat the flat, or buying food for the kids. “I’d get down to my last few pence and have nowhere to turn. Sometimes I’d go without food to make sure the kids ate – they always came first. “A lot of people are just one crisis away from living below the breadline. “We were OK before I had to move. The flat in Cambridge had three bedrooms, and I was told my children should be sharing a room, so had to pay an extra £ in bedroom tax. I had to take a loan out to pay for food for Christmas and to pay my rent and bills. I got behind on rent while waiting for my first Universal Credit payment. We had nothing. It was hell.”  That first time at the foodbank, hungry and confused, little Courtney didn’t even know what the place was. She says: “I thought a foodbank is where food came out of a bank – like a hole in the wall where money comes out, but with food in it. It was really weird being there – I didn’t like it. I can’t always get what I want to eat, because Mum doesn’t have that kind of money. But that day I got Pringles and biscuits. I went back there a few times with my mum.” Courtney is one of the . million children growing up in poverty in the UK, where one in three youngsters are living below the breadline. That is are why we are today asking readers to Give Kids a Cracking Christmas as we launch our Christmas appeal for charity Action for Children. Child poverty will surge to a -year highthe Conservatives remain in power, an influential think-tank says. And the country’s biggest foodbank charity, the Trussell Trust, is bracing itself for its busiest December ever, after distributing , emergency food parcels to children last Christmas. Courtney and her family were eventually forced to move to Hull, where Charlotte was able to save more than £-a-month in rent – vital money she needed for food and bills.

The issues are widespread in other estates across south Wales, with  homeowners claiming they canapost sell up and move on because of the mess . For many people, problems with their Persimmon home are an ongoing battle, WalesOnline reported .Two people, with young families, have spoken out about their experiences with the national house builder.  Michelle Holland said le had been a nightmare ever since she moved into her Persimmon home on the Golwg y Mynydd estate in  Mountain Ash .The mum-of-one was in hospital with her newborn baby when she and her partner got the keys to their house, just before Christmas in . It was her partner who was greeted with the unwelcome sight of a leak when he first stepped through his new front door. Persimmon was called in, and a hole was cut in the coupleaposs brand new ceiling in an attempt to patch the problem up. Not long after the family had moved in, Michelle said her new neighbours knocked on her door. There were issues with a gate, which was on her neighboursapos plans, but not hers. Michelle explained: They’d bought a house with a plan of a gate on the side of the house for their dogs and animals. We had bought a house with nothing attached. Michelle said all parties, including the Persimmon site manager, eventually agreed on a wooden gate between the houses. She was shocked and disappointed when she came home to find something  entirely more akin to a prison gate. Michelle said she was also consistently finding unfinished surfaces along the side of her house. Michelle said parking outside their home is also an ongoing battle. At one point, she arrived home to find workmen has dug up the freshly-laid Tarmac drive in order to fix a pinhole in a pipe underneath. This was in response to the fact that the toilets had never flushed properly since the family had moved in. The list of outstanding issues is on-going, Michelle said, with workmen constantly coming and going to make fixes. Persimmon said they had acted promptly and fairly in addressing the problems reported by Michelle. A spokesman said: A leak was reported towards the end of last year and immediately rectied. We are not aware of a problem with the ensuite floor. The spokesman also addressed the pipe issue, which he said Persimmon had fixed despite it being the water providersapos responsibility.  Another Persimmon resident, Tom Rees, moved with his family into a house at Parc Brynderi,  Llanelli ,  months ago.Tom, a new dad and first-time buyer, said they have had constant problems with their property. He said much of the work is yet to be carried out and claimed communication with Persimmonaposs customer service was poor.

Temperatures are expected to plunge to as low as -C overnight in some parts, which could result in travel chaos for road, rail and air travellers. Met Office forecasters have put a yellow warning in place for tonight and early tomorrow over the threat of potentially dangerous aposfreezing fogapos.It reads: “Fog or freezing fog is likely to lead to some travel disruption on Monday night and Tuesday morning.” Weather experts say the condition will result in “slower journey times with delays to bus and train services possible” as well as “a chance of delays or cancellations to flights”. This warning is in effect between .am and am on Thursday across parts of the south-east. Air passengers could see y delays to their journeys as airports put cold weather plans in place. The Met Office said: “Fog, snow, ice and crosswinds mean that air traffic controllers have to increase the gap between planes that are landing, reducing the number of aircraft that an airport can manage. “The same weather can make it slower and more dficult for the planes to taxi between runway and terminal building.”  It added: “An aircraft that’s stood overnight in freezing weather will need de-icing before its first flight in the morning. “That’s a fairly big task for one plane but imagine the task at Heathrow on a snowy January morning. “At the same time, there are miles of taxiways and runways to clear. Authorities have warned travellers to plan their journeys and leave plenty of extra time in case of delays. The frosty weather comes after Brits saw lows of -.C on Saturday night, the chilliest weather since February, the said.Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkhill said: “It is probably the coldest period of this autumn winter but the latter part of winter earlier this year has seen colder. “At the beginning of the year, we had temperatures falling to -C in Devon and less so Cornwall – about -C. “It will be similarly cold to that to be honest, so definitely one of the coldest weeks of the year.”  He added: “Temperatures will be as cold as -C or -C across Devon and -C in Cornwall on Monday night. “The next couple of days we will see lows of -C or -C most nights. “It is not until Thursday into Friday that it will be much milder so there are lots of cold, frosty nights to come. “Even by day, temperatures will struggle.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror world finally waking","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: The world is finally waking up to Boris Johnsons bigotryThe Prime Minister was accused of fuelling racism in an astonishing attack by UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin who promised to tackle discrimination in footballShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  DEC NewsopinionThe Prime Minster is a cynical politician who is prepared to get dirty \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Rebecca Fry claims she was simultaneously electrocuted, set on fire and shot  feet into the air during a balloon ride after it collided with power cables  feet above the ground. The then -year-old had posed for a selfie moments before the idyllic ride in May  - which was a gt from her fiancee Bret Hay - became a fiery catastrophe. She suffered agonising burns and was airlted to hospital for emergency treatment after the balloon crash-landed in a field in Earls Barton, Northamptonshire. Ms Fry, now , of Northampton, needed four weeks of intensive treatment in a specialist burns unit and required skin grafts to repair her damaged body. As she expects the birth of her first child Ms Fry is suing flight operators The Sackville Balloon Flying Group for more than £million in damages. Reliving the the terror of the mid-air crash, Ms Fry said: The basket burst into flames and the intense heat forced the balloon to shoot up - the heat was making it rise.  I was trying to scream, but I couldnapost open my mouth as the electricity was pressing my teeth together. My leggings were burnt and melted into my body. I thought I was going to die. My body became numb and I thought aposIaposm on fireapos. I could feel electricity going through me and I couldnapost see or hear anything.  I had no control over my body. I was conscious throughout most of it, I felt asmy neck was going to snap. During a pre-trial hearing in Londonaposs High Court Romilly Cummerson, her barrister, spoke about the impact the incident had had on Ms Fry. She is still having dficulties, particularly in respect of her psychiatric injuries, the lawyer said.  The accident occurred at a particularly inopportune moment for her, as she was about to embark on a course that she was hoping would lead to a medical degree. Ms Fry has tried to get back into a health care role as a nurse, but has experienced quite signicant dficulties. Ms Fry claims the accident stalled her hopes of studying to become a doctor, and part of her claim is for loss of future earnings as a medic.  Her claim includes damages for psychiatric trauma and for the impact of the balloon crash on her potential medical career. While they admit liability for her injuries, defence lawyers are disputing the amount of compensation she deserves.

I think he got around  in his short time here.“His attitude was phenomenal. He was no big-time Charlie – a nicer guy you couldn’t meet.“Everyone at the club loved big Louis. He would come over from Fe on the bus two nights a week for training. Nothing was a problem for him. He would pick up the cones or lend a hand with the kit.“On a match day, any instructions our manager Jamie McCunnie gave him, he carried them out to a T.”Finlayson reckons Appere’s future in the game may not stop at Tannadice.“His attitude means football should hold no barriers for him. He’ll give everything he’s got.“He used us as a . It was a chance to get playing men’s football. He said he would give it his best shot.“It was a fantastic opportunity and he took it with both hands. He came to us as a boy and left the club as a man.”Although dferent types of players, Finlayson says there are similarities between Appere and Murray, a player he worked with at another local junior club, Violet.Finlayson continued: “John McGlashan brought Simon to Violet.“He was a great lad, a bit older, a bit mischievous and a bit more street-wise than Louis.“But when that whistle went he was totally focused. In that respect he was very similar to Louis.“When he came to the club we were struggling against relegation but his goals and performances lted us up the table.“He was working as a plumber at the time but his performances saw him move to Tayport, then quickly on to Arbroath and Dundee United.“He’s since played for Hibs and Dundee and now he’s down in South Africa turning out for Bidvest Wits.“He’s done very well for himself.”Finlayson admits junior football isn’t for everyone but he reckons it can be either the path into senior football or a learning curve for young pros.He went on: “Players must have the right attitude to play junior football.“There can sometimes be a wee bit of senior snobbery. Not every club will send players out to the juniors.“But the likes of Peterhead boss Jim McInally is always in touch to see what’s going on and who the better players are.“Playing in the juniors can sometimes tell you a lot more about a young lad than, say, turning out in games in the U  league for their senior teams.“I’m convinced many would benefit more from a season in junior football.“However, they must have the right mentality – Louis and Simon certainly had that.“Junior football should not be discredited – it’s character- building.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/11/SNS-19652080-Dundee-v-Dundee-Utd.jpg ","title":"cammy kerr keen to finish month off on a high at home to queens","story":"Dundee need to go “full throttle” from the first whistle tomorrow to finish off a disappointing November on a high.That’s the view of Dark Blues full-back Cammy Kerr as he and his team-mates prepare for the visit of Queen of the South.Dundee started the month on a high as a home win over Morton made it three successes on the bounce but the two matches since then have ended in disappointing defeats to rivals Dundee United and Inverness.With no more international breaks until spring, this is the time of the year where form can make or break a season.And Kerr is keen to see Dundee head into the Christmas period with a morale-boosting three points against the Doonhamers.He told the Tele: “It’s been a frustrating month, we came into it on the back of a few victories but the last two haven’t been so good in the derby and then away at Inverness.“Again we just need to pick ourselves up – there’s been a lot of that this year where we’ve gone on a wee run, stalled, wee run, stalled.“It’s about getting that consistency, people go on about that all the time but it is important.“This time of the season is a great time to build a bit of momentum.“Looking at the table, ideally we’d want to be higher up, we are in the play-off position but we want to be kicking on.“At this football club, we don’t just settle for being in the mix, we want to push on – that’s something that’s very much in the players’ thoughts.”Dundee’s last match at Dens Park wasn’t one to remember for home fans and full-back Kerr is keen to banish those memories by getting off to a positive start to tomorrow’s Championship clash.He added: “It’s so important to try to get off to a good start, go full throttle from the start.“We need to take the game to teams, especially at Dens.“Not every game works out like that, though people think Dundee should go winning every game.“Everyone here wants to do that but teams set up dferently, they sit in and make things very dficult.“There are a lot of good teams in this league, teams that outsiders maybe write off but they are all very dficult sides.”He added: “The home record this season has been better bar the derby and the Partick defeats.“We want to build this place up and get the fans happy.“We’re just as gutted as them from the derby and last week’s defeat. We’ll keep striving to get up that table.”Kerr and the rest of the Dundee backline were pleasantly surprised this week by theof goalkeeper Jack Hamilton.The former Hearts man is set to make his comeback to the squad tomorrow after almost six weeks out after appendix surgery.“Everyone in the goalkeeping department has been great this season,” Kerr added.“Big Jack Hamilton has been outstanding for us this year and then we had Conor Hazard come in. He had a big jersey to fill with Jack being out ill.“We’ve also got Calum Ferrie who has been unfortunate not to play and what a goalkeeper he is.“A lot of that is down to the work done by Rab Geddes, the goalie coach, who works tirelessly with them.”Heading into the weekend, Dundee trail leaders United by a massive  points, prompting talk of the Tangerines having one hand on the trophy already.Kerr knows the Dark Blues can’t go believing that, however.“We only focus on the games we can win.

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"harry potter halloween at pony club","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHarry Potter was the theme for this year’s Hallowe’en Fun Day organised by Argyll South Pony Club at the Long Walk arena near Kilmartin.Even the judges # Ulla Riddell and Mary Lou Aitchison – got into the spirit of the day by dressing as Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed. At first I thought it was a dog on the road until my headlights picked him up.Tom Cullen, Dunskeig, Ardfern.We would like to invite readers to nominate a deserving carer for a chance of going on a free holiday, while the person they care for comes on a free break with us, Revitalise, through our new Grace Award for Caring.Carers save the economy £ billion per year, which is more than the NHS budget.

Itrsquos also a contact point for the council.ldquoThere is also a worry that people arenrsquot going to pop into nearby shops and to use them, itrsquos taking something away from the town centre.ldquoThere is also a big worry in Jedburgh about buildings going out of use. It is situated in a historic building that was purposefully built for the people of Jedburgh as a centre for information.Currently, the council is planning to close the old library, which was first opened in May , when the new intergenerational campus at Hatrigge Park opens in April .The library was built by the Scottish-American steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, who attended the opening ceremony in the town, after an earlier library he had built six years earlier on the high street had proved to be inadequate.Six years ago, Scottish Borders Council voted to integrate its contact centres into the regionrsquos libraries, and since then the council has maintained an outpost in Jedburgh Library, which will also move to the Jedburgh Grammar Campus in April.At the audit and scrutiny meeting, the service director for customers and communities, Jenni Craig, explained that the library will have much longer opening hours at the new campus: ldquoIn relation to accessibility, and the times that the library is open, one of the benefits of moving to the new campus will be the library will be longer.ldquoWe accept that this is a huge change but we also see this as an opportunity.ldquoMembers will be aware that as part of the councilrsquos lsquofit for rsquo transformation programme we are considering how we can deliver services dferently to make the best use of our facilities.ldquoWe have a very challenging financial outlook and we have a five year placen for transforming our services.ldquoIn Jedburgh, the signicant investment in the campus gives us the opportunity to make the most of the facility.After hearing from both sides, councillor Heather Anderson, who represents Tweeddale West, proposed that the matter is formally referred to Ms Craig, and that the service director begins a consultation with the public to address their concerns, from January to March, before the new campus opens in April.The motion was seconded by Galashiels councillor Harry Scott, and the motion was passed, with only Jedburgh councillor Sandy Scott voting against.Speaking after the meeting, petitioner Georgiana Craster said: ldquoIrsquom happy. I was expecting a year long consultation, but you know you ask for bigger and you get lesser, so this is something that we can actually put to the residents.ldquoThere is a lot of sentimentality around the building, and we have to be practical. The school is a wonderful thing, no one is going to say anything against that, but we have to think about everybody, itrsquos not only about educating children itrsquos also about the future of

The success of this flight was the impetus for pioneer flights from London to Australia and Cape Town and it is the former that is my subject.In May  the Australian government offered a prize of poundA, for the first Australians in a British aircraft to fly from Great Britain to Australia. In November  six entries started the race. Only two of these reached their final destination the other four crashed in Surbiton, Corfu, Crete and Bali .Of the two flights that succeeded, the clear winners were Ross and Keith Smith they piloted a Vickers Vimy aeroplane and were joined by two mechanics, Wally Shiers and Jim Bennett. Their flight left Hounslow on November ,  and after  days and , miles they arrived at Darwin on December  stops included Lyon, Rome, Cairo, Damascus, Basra, Karachi, Delhi, Calcutta, Rangoon, Singora, Singapore, Batavia and Surabaya. This compares with just under four weeks that it took my grandparents to sail to Perth when they emigrated from Edinburgh to seek a new le in Australia in  with help from the Assisted Passage Scheme.Pilot Ross Smith had flown for T E Lawrence during the First World War and in  he flew the first pioneering flight from Cairo to Calcutta which must have helped the record breaking journey the following year. The Smith brothers received knighthoods and the four members of the crew shared the prize of poundA,. The runners up, who left London on January ,  took  days to reach Darwin, arriving in August . These two flights compare with the recent ldquoworldrsquos longest flight -  hour non-stop from New York to Sydney.The two Smith brothers received a congratulatory telegram from the headmaster of small Scottish school,ldquoWell done Ross and Keith Warriston proud of you Mr F W Gardner headmaster.F Gardner was the headmaster of Warriston School in Moffat where the Smith brothers ndash and their sibling Colin ndash had spent the final two years of their education.Ross and Keith Smith both had the middle name of their mother ldquoMacpherson she was the daughter of an immigrant family from Scotland. Their father had been born in Moffat and emigrated to Western Australia, and in sending their three sons to Moffat to complete their education they were clearly strengthening their bonds with ldquothe old country.The Smith brothers were therefore grounded in Scotland.A well-known fact in the world of cricket is that the famous Australian all-rounder Keith Millerwas named after the two Smith brothers his parents named him Keith Ross Miller. It is not known whether Keith Miller realised that the Smith brothers had Scottish ancestry, but as he played wartime cricket matches in Scotland and visited again in  it is nice to speculate. Millerrsquos wartime service as a mosquito pilot adds a certain symmetry to the achievements of his distinguished namesakes.When he was in Scotland in  playing for the RAAF, Miller lodged with the McVey family in Clovenfords and when he ed with ldquoThe Invincibles in  he planted a tree in Selkirk and called in on the family to renew his acquaintance.In  I paid a visit to Selkirk to seeI could see the tree planted by Miller but was told it had been destroyed in a storm - this story came full circle when I recently spoke to Hazel McLean who used to live in Clovenfords and had met Keith Miller in  when he called on the McVeys.She recalled being taken by her parents to their friendsrsquo house nearby and the excitement in getting his autograph.

Thatrsquos because therersquos been a lack of strategic vision. You cannot expect public transport, such as buses, to pay for itself,itrsquos going to be a consistent service.ldquoIn Glasgow, we realised that keeping buses on during the night was vital because although they wouldnrsquot be used often, when people did use them it would be urgent.ldquoNow, Scottish Borders Council, in my view, does not adequately fund public transport.\"They say, and I think theyrsquore absolutely right, that theyrsquore inadequately funded by the Scottish Government.ldquoThe Scottish Government say: lsquoit was a bad boy who done it and he ran away because Westminster didnrsquot give us enough moneyrsquo. Now, thatrsquos an example of where there needs to be a degree of strategic thinking.ldquoOn the question of the train being driven by oil, that, as I understand it, was because it was going to be far too expensive to electry it.ldquoThey could only get diesel-driven stock, so it was that or nothing. Now thatrsquos not acceptable. Itrsquos also not acceptable, in my view, that the rails the Borders line runs on were actually made in China.ldquoThat didnrsquot create pollution here in Scotland, but it did across the world and the jobs werenrsquot created here they were created in China.Conservative candidate John Lamont said: ldquoSome parts of the Borders are very well connected but a lot are not,you speak to residents in Newcastleton or Paxton, they do not have a regular bus service to allow them to get around, so itrsquos wrong to say that buses and public transport are accessible.ldquoWersquore very lucky to have Borders Buses here, I have their exceptionally good app, I donrsquot knowmany of you use it but itrsquos a very simple way to get around and very easily find out where your bus is.ldquoI do use it, because itrsquos a good way to get around and itrsquos better for the environment.ldquoBut you canrsquot say that just because I can use it to get from Berwick Station to my house in Coldstream, that other people have access to public transport services, you canrsquot, because thatrsquos simply not true.On buses, Liberal Democrat candidate Jenny Marr said: ldquoBorders Buses is great, and the routes that have started this week with space for the bikes I think as really important.ldquoTo follow on from what John was saying, at Eyemouth College, they have a high rate of dropout In January and February because of how few buses there are and how dficult it is in the winter.ldquoI think we need to look at the successes in some parts of the region and then try and apply that to other places.ldquoI think with Newcastleton, one of the guys from the Campaign for Borders Rail was telling me thata kid wants to get out of the village on a Saturday they will struggle to get back after one or two in the afternoon, and I think we need to make sure that our public transport infrastructure is not a barrier to progress and not a barrier to children and younger people having the le they deserve to have.Finally, SNP candidate Calum Kerr added: ldquoIn relation to the points made on the railway, obviously there is a move around electrication and talk about hydrogen as well, the Scottish Government has set the target that the railways will be net-zero by , as it stands today.ldquoIn terms of public transport and buses, certainly when I met with bus companies previously, therersquos only two bus routes in the Borders which makes a profit, the X and the X.ldquoPeople just donrsquot use it, so it becomes self perpetuating, because then routes get cut, so people have to use their cars, soa green new deal means fundamentally resetting aspects of the economy, and included in that needs to be transport, then you have to invest:you build it they will come.ldquoYou canrsquot just hope people will start using it, and then yoursquoll find a way to make the routes work, it does require signicant investment.ldquoThere is a pound.m green bus fund, so itrsquos about adding green buses continually.

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star. Kick off is pm, with Kintyre Park the expected venue.The Pupils’ Liam Renton on the ball with Ryan Gilchrist looking on at Saturday#s match in Paisley.

Work ceased in the Clyde shipyards and on the shipping in the river.In Campbeltown the signal was given by the sounding of three long syren blasts from H.M.S. Thames, and the fallen were honoured by the uncovering of heads.Of course in a comparatively quiet country town the tribute lacked the impressiveness that characterised it in busy cities.In the Grammar School the scholars assembled in the large room at .a.m., when the rector gave a short address on the meaning of the celebration, read the King#s message, and explained shortly the aims of the League of Nations Union.A hymn as then sung, the two minutes# silence observed, and after the National Anthem had been sung, the pupils were dismissed for the day.In Dalintober School the period of silence was similarly observed and the scholars were afterwards dismissed."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 15 2019","story":"Remembrance is one of the main topics in this week#s Courier.We increasingly rely on our youngsters to keep the memory of the First and Second World Wars alive as those who experienced them first-hand # and second-hand # fade away.Renowned First World War poet Wilfred Owen, who was himself killed in action in , wrote of #the old lie# # #Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori#, which translates from Latin as #It is sweet and proper to die for one#s country#.Remembrance should not be about glorying war, but remembering the horric atrocities which are committed in its name so that in future they may be avoided.The four young people who took part in the service at Glenbarr War Memorial are direct descendants of men from the area who fell in battle.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

Itrsquos getting busy these days, often with families, which is great to see. Even still there is enough space amidst the trees to quickly find solitudeyou need it.I can never visit this wonderful place without whispering a word of thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson for his role, along with others, in saving this precious and magical wood, which my family has almost literally grown up in.I have got to know Gregor, who still lives in East Lothian, and the world is made a better place by caring and thoughtful people like him.We arrived at the wood in late afternoon, knowing that we wouldnrsquot have a lot of time before nightfall. The ground was literally carpeted with orange and yellow, and autumn colours still hung on the trees.But there was a nip in the air a cold crisp reminder that summer is now long gone and the fingers of winter are about to grip us. So we kept on the move to keep warm.As we ventured deeper into the wood I noticed something. ldquoStop, I said to the kids, ldquoand listen.There was not a breath of wind, it was deathly still. The trees stood in absolute silence. I couldnrsquot even hear any traffic, or the usual distant murmurings of modern day le. There was no noise, only the sound of nature.Bird song was above us. I was surprised to hear such a chorus on a late autumn afternoon.We stood, listening. It was asthe birds were suddenly singing for us, and the children were genuinely enthralled, as was I.We decided to continue our walk, but our mood had now changed. The silence could have been eerie but it wasnrsquot, it heightened our awareness that the wood had le we couldnrsquot see.It was asour inner senses had been aroused. The kids wanted to walk silently, so they could continue to listen. So we practised ldquowalking like a Native American hunter as taught to us by Chris Yule, another East Lothian environmental luminary.We crept through the wood, looking for deer, and faeries, now acutely aware of any faint sound that the absence of noise made possible to hear.Finally we reached our favourite place, and sat, still listening. I have to tell you, seeing my two youngest being so quiet for so long was a unique experience.Then it began to get dark, and the bird song faded away.We headed back to the car as the trees turned into shadows. But we still stopped every now and then to listen and peer into the undergrowth. We were convinced at one point we could see a deer hiding from us.We got to the car as the last glimmering light in the sky vanished, and the moon came out from behind the clouds. It was a magical experience, not a scary one. Wersquod had an unexpected connection with nature, that wasnrsquot visual, but something deeper.I turned the engine on, breaking the silence, and we ed to our world of articial light and constant noise. But the whole walk had had a meditative effect on us, and I reflected on the fact that we are replacing sound with noise, and we are the poorer for that.We are so constantly surrounded by human made sounds that we donrsquot notice it. The noise has become the background to our lives. Few of us probably reflect that we need to connect to the sounds of nature anymore, or true silence itself.Our inner selves do however. Call it what you will, our soul, our spiritual self, our primeval awareness. The truth is we need the absence of noise every now and then so the sounds of nature can be heard. It replenishes us, reminds us who we really are, and lts our mental health. No matter how much we pave nature over with cement, we cannot avoid the fact we are part of it and need it.Yet, we are increasingly separated from it, including the sounds and the silence that comes with the absence of our noise. Is there a connection between this and the mental health crisis we now face The neon lights of a shopping centre, and the constant buzz and noise we fill our everyday lives with may seem like progress, but it isnrsquot for our well being. We need places where such noise is absent ndash where only nature is heard. No, actually, we need many more of these places, but sadly we are going in the reverse direction destroying the ones that survive."},{"url":null,"title":"cockenzie-family-return-italian-roots-open-food-lovers-paradise","story":"They have restored the home of their ancestors in Picinisco in Lazio, Italy, and turned it into a holiday destination complete with a boutique hotel, cookery school and winery.Members of the Di Ciacca family moved to Cockenzie  years ago and Cesido Di Ciacca took over The Cockenzie Cafe, a cafe, fish  chip shop and ice-cream shop, in .The family lived above the shop on  High Street and integrated themselves into the community.

Hersquod not always been homeless, of course, but people rarely see the person behind the label.The one good thing about winter for him was the approach of Christmas. Peoplersquos consciences seemed to be more sensitive at Christmas time.He was an alcoholic and he blamed himself every day for what he was. But this just fed his sense of worthlessness and kept the cycle going. His earlier le, the lsquonormal onersquo with his we and children, was now a long time ago, but when he slumbered he often re-entered it in his dreams.Especially that last family Christmas, when they were all together. He would re-run that time in his mind, just like his we would watch The Devil Wears Prada over and over and never tire of it. Yes, when he closed his eyes it could seem he was there again.But when he came to his senses, he came back to himself: an unloved man, old before his time, who people ignored and passed in the street without looking at. He usually felt completely invisible. To be fair, some people did stop and talk, usually the same ones.Perhaps they never truly understood just how valued those moments were.He understood it, after all he despised himself, so how could he expect others to feel dferently.Alcohol seemed to be his one real friend, the only one to understand and ease his pain.But St Andrewrsquos Day was approaching and this was his cue to get completely sober.He would feel that tingle inside that people call lsquofeeling Christmassyrsquo. It was a painful, bittersweet emotion for John, and his friend alcohol always offered to help. But he would close his eyes and be strong.It was the one thing in his le where he felt he had not let people down.So he would summon all his strength and draw on who he used to be for those last vestiges of self-belief and refuse the offer of help from his destructive friend.He made it and arrived at the door of the managerrsquos office, clean, sober and ready to work.The manager had no idea John was the same man he passed on a daily basis on the street outside.Admittedly, he did look dferent now, butthe manager had ever paused to look at John or speak to him, then he would surely recognise him. But for once he was glad of his invisibility. If the manager had ever recognised him outside then John would probably lose his job.ldquoYour costume is in the back room. You start in  minutes, said the manager.ldquoThe paperwork came through last week so yoursquore set to go.John knew the routine and got changed.When he sat in his chair, he was transformed. He was Santa.For the next five weeks, he knew he was going to be noticed and even loved. People would speak to him in a kind and almost reverent way, ask him how he was. His beard and red suit wiped away his sense of worthlessness.All that day, families came and he spoke to more people in that one day being Santa than he did the rest of the year being himself.Afterwards, he headed back to the hostel with money in his pocket.His old friend whispered in his ear: ldquoSpend it on me, spend it on me.ldquoMaybe later, but not now, John replied in his head.But the hostel was full and he couldnrsquot find any other place.And so he knew hersquod have to spend a bitter night on the streets.The food van would arrive soon, so he decided to wait for it in the busy centre.As he sat, a young girl came up to him.She just stood and stared. John recognised her.She had been one of the children in his grotto earlier and suddenly a fear gripped him: she might recognise who he really was.ldquoCome away from there, shouted her mother.But the girl still stood, staring at John. Then she smiled. John smiled back.Her father came up and took her by the hand, pulling her away without looking at John.He recognised the father as well.He had been so nice and friendly in the grotto, while his daughter stood with him for a photo.But without his white beard and red suit, John was invisible again.ldquoSpend it on me, spend on me, whispered his old friend again, as John had flashbacks of Afghanistan.ldquoSpend it on me and I will keep you company, nobody  cares, pleaded his friend.Then the girl was in front of him again, smiling.ldquoThis is for you, Merry Christmas when it comes.Her father stood by her, holding her hand, but still not looking at John.It was chocolate. The same chocolate bar shersquod chosen with glee in the grotto.ldquoThank you, said John and the girl left with her dad.Johnrsquos old friend was now silent.

Andrew Marr wanted to knowMr Johnson would appear on The Andrew Neil Interviews, as Scotlandrsquos First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had done. The PM said he was happy to sit down with any interviewer called Andrew from the BBC. Which is not the same as saying he will go on Neilrsquos show.He could have been pledging to sit down with Andrew Kerr, Andrew Black, Andrew Thomson, Andrew Anderson, Andrew Picken hellip and thatrsquos just for starters at BBC Scotland. Auntie has lots of sons called Andrew. She may even have daughters, too. Why, at this very minute, Emily Maitlis or Emma Barnett could be changing their names to Andrew to secure that coveted one to one with the PM.: Iain Macwhirter on Johnsons poll leadIt may seem odd for the media to be gazing at its own navel in this way, but as anyone who lived through The War of Jennerrsquos Ear and Bigotgate will attest, it is not an election proper until journalists have joined in the fighting. Channel  felt the heat last week after replacing a no show Boris Johnson with an ice sculpture in a climate change debate. Not to be outdone, the BBC managed to get itself embroiled in argy bargy over its Andrews.At first, it seemed Auntie had sorted matters. Appear on Neilrsquos show, the BBC told Downing Street, or forget about Marr. It was a bold position which duly crumbled on Saturday afternoon when the BBC said that following Fridayrsquos terrorist attack at London Bridge it was now ldquoin the public interest for the PM to be on Marr. Cue outrage from Labour and others, accusing the corporation of caving in.Come am Sunday, all eyes that were open and focussed were trained on Marrrsquos show. Given the pressing national interest the producers surely would not keep us waiting. Oh, but they did, forcing the viewer to sit through interviews with Labourrsquos Shami Chakrabarti and the Lib Demsrsquo Chuka Umunna. It was like turning up to see the big movie only to be hit with eight hours of adverts.Finally, at  minutes past the hour, it was on. Johnson v Marr, the Englishman against the Scotsman. There was a lot at stake. Not the security of the nation or the countryrsquos economic prospects. This was far more serious than any of that. This was about ego. Mr Johnson had to show that he was not scared of blokes called Andrew, and a bloke called Andrew wanted to show him that he jolly well should be scared of blokes called Andrew.: Johnson accused over recordConsider,you will, how Marr might have felt as the row over the Neil show raged. Both big beasts in the jungle of political journalism yet there he was, by implication the softer option in comparison with his fellow countryman. If that was not the case, why would Downing Street say yes to his request but ldquowersquoll let you know to Neilrsquos  This was as much about Marr v Neil as it was Marr against Johnson.It turned out to be a marvellously tetchy encounter, handbags and harrumphs at dawn stuff, or as near to dawn as we could get without knocking the Match of the Day repeat out of the schedule.Marr began on the London Bridge attack, asking how a dangerous criminal could be released after  years in jail. Labourrsquos fault, claimed Mr Johnson, they brought in a law on automatic early release in . But you have been in power for ten years, Marr replied, you could have changed things. Irsquove been in office  days, said Mr Johnson.So it went on. The two were like characters in a cartoon fight. As verbal fists and feet flew, dust clouds enveloped the pair. Every now and then a speech balloon would pop up. ldquoTen years, kapow! ldquo days, crunch! Thump, thump, thump.Marr changed tack. ldquoYoursquore trying to avoid my questions by carrying on talking, he charged. This was a notable iation on the Mishal Husain line, in which the Today presenter, suffering a similar barrage of bluster from Johnson, told him to ldquoplease stop talking. It did not do her any good, and the same held true for Marr as he proceeded to go down a shopping list of topics from the NHS to library closures, getting nowhere. ldquoYou are chuntering! he told Mr Johnson. ldquoYou keep interrupting me! the PM snapped.The minutes were sprinting away like Bullingdon boys after a spot of bother at a local restaurant. Would Marr ask the big question, the one the media was interested in most of all. To wit: would the PM go on Neilrsquos show  Johnson dodged, weaved, and schmoozed, saying Neil could not have a better agent than Marr , before making his ldquoIrsquoll talk to any BBC Andrew declaration.: Nato Secretary General responds over TridentMarr, running over time, brought the interview to an abrupt end. The cameras focussed on the two men while the credits rolled. Usually in these situations there is a bit of chat, evenit is only the host asking what the guest fancies for breakfast. No such bonhomie here. Marr shuffled his papers. Mr Johnson, job done according to his reckoning, watched him. You could have cut the atmosphere with an industrial chainsaw. So much for Sundays being a day for peaceful reflection."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-become-climate-change-election","story":"Even in England, where there is much more interest in Brexit, any objective observer can see that this issue, however much it is claimed to be central to UK politics canrsquot be the signicant issue for this General Election, because in spite of the propaganda slogan, ldquoget Brexit done Brexit will not be \"done\", evenBoris Johnson gets a working majority and gets his deal through Westminster before Christmas. Becausethat happens, we will be in exactly the same position next autumn, as we were last autumn. It will again be a question of, is the negotiated trade deal with the EU good enough, or are we going out of the EU without a deal, or are we going to extend the leaving date None of this has been resolved, unless one accepts that the UK and EU negotiators can complete a comprehensive trade agreement dotting all the irsquos and crossing all the trsquos, in just a year. Such complex agreements usually take around seven years to complete in draft form as all politicians and media professionals will know.So Brexit will not be \"done\" in any real sense at this election. However what may be done in a very real sense after this election is that the electorate in the UK may be too late to get another chance to change UK policy in order to prevent us reaching a tipping point in the climate change struggle, as most scientist are now telling us.We do not have the luxury of waiting another five years before the UK seriously addresses this issue, and it is clear from both the Tory and Brexit Party that their leaders are not even prepared to turn up for a public debate on this subject which they are refusing to give attention to. In real terms, this may prove to be the climate change election for the UK, rather than the Brexit one and sadly the media are not really facing up to this.The Scottish Government is addressing this issue, and has been for some time, not nearly enough as it will need to do, but to a much greater extent than the UK is doing. In Scotland there have been efforts for some years now to use the limited investment and persuasive powers to influence power production and Scotland has made signicant advances in this area. One simple telling example of this is that the Tories, LibDems and Labour are telling us how many trees they will plantthey are elected. Scotland has planted  million trees in the last year,  per cent of all plantings in the UK, and has the organisation and capacity to develop this further.This question of climate change will prove, in historical terms, to have been the most important issue at this election and the politicians and media who are not seriously addressing this issue, which unfortunately are the majority, are doing a gross disservice to the British people and to democracy.Andy Anderson, Saltcoats.THERE is a small smidgeon of hope for Thelma Edwards wish that our political leaders can find ldquopeace, community and good sense , as Labour, Tory and LibDems promise huge tree-planting programmes in England.

Only in seeking an independent Scotland, free of nuclear weapons, connecting with Europe and the world, can we halt the land slipping into anarchy and destruction.Grant Frazer, Newtonmore.I HAVE become somewhat indferent to politics as there is little  to do except watch Britains race to the bottom. However, there does seem to be increasing interest in climate change, although it is dficult to knowit is just talk orpeople really want government action on this. The reason for saying this is the party gaining most support at present is also the one which is least likely to take action on global warming.James Evans, Dumbarton.MANY people seem to believe that a no deal Brexit has been avoided by the vote in Parliament for Boris Johnsons hard Brexit deal. I would encourage them to consider why Nigel Farage stood down most of his Brexit Party candidates and what he would get in . Page  in the new Conservative manesto states, in bold, that ldquowe will not extend the implementation period beyond December . Evenwe had the luxury of a semi-competent and serious UK negotiating team, it is not credible that a multi-year task can be completed in one year. Therefore, the ultra-right-wing hard-Brexiters have baked in their no deal Brexit.The  Scottish Conservative MPs signed up to this manesto and know this very well, but they pretend that they are all for Mr Johnsons deal. We can but hope that the Scottish electorate deprive these Scottish Conservatives of their part in this calamity.Dr J Toole, Crieff.PETER Russellshould know that the EU is a political as well as an economic union and that a self-governing Scotlandrsquos accession would be relatively quick evenit meant spending some time in the European Economic Area, which would be much better for our economy than the UK leaving the EU.As a modern, democratic country with a higher GDP per capita than most EU members, there is no reason why the EU would be dficult. but diplomatically their senior officials wonrsquot confirm easy access until such time as the UK leaves or Scotland votes for independence.Those opposed to self-government need to explain why Scotland would not be entitled to a share of the UKrsquos assets including currency reserves and Bank of England depositswe continue to pay interest on the UKrsquos national debt which accounts for a quarter of the total GERS notional deficit that Unionists gleefully pounce on to claim that Scotland is a fiscal basket case.Over the past  years more taxes and revenues have gone from Scotland to HM Treasury in London than has been spent by the UK Government in Scotland, including Barnet consequentials, which begs the question as to why GERS charges Scotland any interest on Westminsterrsquos debts.Given our natural assets, there is no logical reason why Scotland cannot emulate Denmarkrsquos economic success or tax oil and gas companies at Norwegian levels once we take charge of our own future. Small countries respond quicker and more successfully to dficult situations.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh EH.OPINION polls merely reflect the mood of the moment. Once their results appear in print, they fix their imprint in the minds of the readers. This can lead iniduals to jump on the bandwagon which the opinion poll points to. Others can be led to believe that there is no longer any point in voting for their chosen preference.Opinion polls operate on the premise of a framework of unalterable algorithms, which cannot take into account the extraordinary circumstances which affect local behaviour or the influence of electoral pacts. This makes opinion polls fallible in extrapolating from their findings to the wider intentions of the nation.This particular General Election has so many factors at work that the mood of the electorate is moving under the radar of what opinion polls are geared to pick up. All that opinion polls can do is to to create an impression that one party or the other is on an irresistible rise, thereby depressing the expectations of those trying to oppose the group portrayed in the poll as likely to winWith almost two weeks left to play, this is going to be a dficult election to call. If there is a serious meltdown by one side or the other, that would hand the election to the party profiting from such a collapse.What we have before us is the poorest collection of political leaders that I have witnessed in my  years as a voter. I am sure that I am not the only one who is finding it dficult to decide which way to vote. It looks as though it is going to be either voting tribally, going with a gut feeling or sticking a pin into the electoral list and so taking a leap into the dark.The two main candidates for the position of Prime Minister do not inspire the electorate that they can be trusted with the future of the countryOpinion polls, then, are rather reminiscent of the theories of the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, who said that everything rolls on and nothing is static.This idea was amplied by stating that you cannot step into the same river twice and refined more humorously with the remark that you cannot step into the same river once. Let that be the caveat to bear in mind when presented with any opinion poll.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.HAVING listened to him on TV recently my candidate for the \"Most boring politician of the Election\" must surely go to Barry the bore, Gardiner, Labours Shadow Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change in the last Parliament.

One of those at risk is Mr Raab, the Brexiter who didnrsquot understand how important Dover is to trade, and the man, too, who said people use foodbanks not because theyrsquore poor but because they have ldquocash-flow problems. The under-currents also make Scottish seats like Mr Blackfordrsquos just as hard to predict.The reason for the unpredictably is a trend in politics that started in earnest in the s but has now reached its apotheosis. In , after a  start in , Labour won the General Election thanks in a large part to tactical voting and itrsquos been a signicant factor in elections ever since. The Tories did well in Scotland in the last General Election, for example, because so many voters chose to vote tactically against the SNP.:SNPrsquos Ian Blackford has a great deal to answer for ndash Lord Menzies CampbellLooking at the polls, this tactical voting trend is going to be even more important this year. According to polling by the Electoral Reform Society,  per cent of voters plan to vote tactically to thwart a candidate they donrsquot like, although itrsquos amazing the figure isnrsquot much higher. Theresa May would have won a majority in just .% of voters had acted dferently, and this time round, the result will come down to a couple of hundred thousand people. If enough of them vote tactically, Boris Johnson wonrsquot get his majority.Over the years, it looks like more and more voters have started to understand this and wersquore now at the point where tactical voting is almost like a political party of its own. It has led to weird sights such as the former Tory minister Michael Heseltine standing behind a LibDem podium and the former Blair PR man Alastair Campbell saying ldquodonrsquot vote Labour! . There are also any number of tactical voting websites that will tell you how to achieve your aim.And it appears to be starting to work. In , Dominic Raab won Esher and Walton with nearly  per cent of the vote andthe national polls were replicated in the seat on December , he would easily win again. However, the current polling in his seat puts the Tories on %, just five per cent ahead of the LibDems. Perhaps Remainers in the constituency who are still wondering whether they should switch should listen to Alastair Campbell: Donrsquot vote Labour!:Harry Dunn: Dominic Raab booed and branded a coward as he leaves hustingsTactical voting is just as important, albeit more complicated, in Scotland, and therersquos evidence that the voters, and the parties, are willing to use it. In recent days ndash much to the amazement and disgust of some ndash support for the Conservatives in Scotland has been rising at the same time itrsquos been falling in England and the explanation has to be that some Unionist voters are choosing the Tories as a tactical vote against the SNP.Therersquos also been evidence of tactical thinking where in Scotland. In Ian Blackfordrsquos seat, for example, therersquos been suspicion that some of the candidates are working to an official pact to maximise voting for the LibDems, and the LibDemsrsquo private polling shows itrsquos having an effect. Some voters may also be unable to resist the chance to take a big SNP scalp in the way they did with Alex Salmond in  .What makes the whole thing much more complicated in Scotland is the way that Brexit and independence intersect. For tactical voting to have any serious effect on the SNP, it requires LibDems and some Labour supporters to switch to the Tories, which many of them did in . But will they be willing to do it again this time, now that the Tories are run by hard Brexiters like Boris Johnson  I suspect a lot of Scottish voters would rather die in a ditch.But the incentive for a big, central group of Scottish voters to behave tactically remains strong. Indeed, the evidence of tactical thinking in Scottish politics underlines a comforting fact about us: there is a still a strong, liberal, progressive, anti-nationalistic centre of voters in Scotland who are just as repulsed by Ian Blackfordrsquos Scottish nationalism as they are by Dominic Raabrsquos British version.If the world was dferent of course, and we were freed of the threats of Brexit and independence , many,not most, of these sensible centrist Scottish voters would support Labour or the LibDems. Certainly, by any realistic, liberal, progressive test, the LibDem manesto wins hands down.However, thatrsquos not the world wersquore stuck with, sadly, which leaves many centrist Scottish voters with an ugly dilemma, especially in seats that will be won either by the Tories or the SNP. Many of the tactical voting guides suggest voting SNP to beat Brexit-supporting Tories, but that misunderstands the subcutaneous trends in modern Scottish politics ndash many Scottish voters do not want Brexit but they do not want independence either. Ideally, they would vote to keep the SNP out of Scottish seats and the Tories out of power at Westminster, but in many constituencies, the system simply does not allow voters to support that option.:SNPs vetting process frustrated by senior MP prior to candidate selectionIn the end, the result of the election will depend on what this group of voters decides to do in Scotland, and what Remainers decide to do in the rest of the UK, but, with Labour support up in England and the Tories up in Scotland, the trend in the polls would seem to suggest that many are already choosing the tactical option. Nicola Sturgeonrsquos pronouncement that a vote for the SNP is a vote for a second Scottish referendum, as well as polls suggesting a Tory majority, may also concentrate the minds of potential tactical voters.And just think of the potential prize on election nightvoters do take the tactical option. .am.

The lsquovast majority,rsquo in fact, claries Graham.And that means officers need digital tools and skills and, increasingly, legal and ethical understanding of how to to use them.Last week Grahamrsquos boss, Chief Constable Iain Livingstone, announced that Police Scotland will early next year roll out what the force call lsquodigital triage devicesrsquo.Early press reports called these lsquocyber kiosksrsquo.What are they really  Laptops that let police officers instantly lsquohackrsquo - not the word the police would use - in to a smartphone at a local station without packing the device off to a lab somewhere for months.The technology could be revolutionary, not least in getting to the bottom of sex crimes.Victims and witnesses already routinely hand over their phones to police, voluntarily. So do suspects, usually under a warrant and sometimes voluntarily because they think their phone data will clear them.The current system can mean waving goodbye to the phone - and everything you need to live and work - for months, as specialist IT investigators crack it open.The triage devices are designed to make a quick assessment about what,any, pertinent evidence, there is in a phone.Graham explains: ldquoThe digital triage devices are effectively a lap top you plug the phone in to. You can use the laptop to see what information is on that phone very quickly.ldquoThe biggest dference is that it is going to allow us to focus on what is important. ldquoBecause at the moment we have to trawl through volumes of data in laborious ways without any kind of practical evidential value.ldquoThe beauty of triage devices is that it very quickly will allow us to capture the evidence pertinent to an investigation and therefore very quickly move us towards taking some action against iniduals.What kind of things could police find  Take threatening behavior. Two thirds of such crimes have a digital footprint. Are there threats or abusive messages on a phone  Or allegations of sexual offenses, a fth of which are categorised as cybercrimes. Are there messages or images or content that is itself criminal. Or are there communications which cast light on alleged crimes that took place in private, the kind of one-on-one offending that can be hard to corroborate  That applies as much to domestic abuse as to sex crimes.And your phone can contain so much more than communications, including your financial data, what you have browsed, your emails, calendars, your whole le. It may even cast light on where you have been thanks to dferent ways of geolocating a device. It can be an alibi. It can help suggest guilt. Or innocence.The sheer volume of private information on a phone explains why it is such a useful detection tool. It also explains why digital triage devices made privacy rights activists were worried.Police Scotland was rapped by MSPs last year for carrying out a pilot scheme with such laptops in Stirling and Edinburgh without fully consulting on how people consented to hand over their phones.Were people really sure they knew what they were getting in to  Were they being helped to understand that their whole world - where they go, where they shop, what they browse, with whom they communicate - was in their phones And, crucially, were they being told that they could change their mind Holyroodrsquos policing sub-committee did not think so.MSPs called a halt un the initial roll-out in April , saying the forcersquos main watchdog, the Scottish Police Authority, had only heard the upsides of digital triage, not potential concerns.The sub-committeersquos convener, Green MSP and ex-police officerJohn Finnie, said: ldquoEven the most fundamental questions, such as the legal basis for using this technology, appear to have been totally overlooked.ldquoThis sub-standard process has resulted in over half a million pounds worth of equipment sitting gathering dust.What followed the criticism was a huge exercise in consultation by Police Scotland, involving a huge number of outside organisations, including those critical of the initial pilot schemes, such as Open Rights.Graham said Police Scotland was ready with a whole package of procedures to ensure nobody is browbeaten in to handing over their entire digital worlds to the police - and that they can change their minds. This includes a leaflet to be taken home by witnesses or victims.Finnie is satisfied. He said: ldquoIt is good that exercise was done, that there was that level of scrutiny and hopefully there will be lessons learned for everybody.Livingstone this week said the final release of the devices would wait until the outcome of another review, by the Information Commissioners Office in to the extraction of information in to phones.In England earlier this year there was controversy earlier this year after police and prosecutors said that victims of sexual crimes would be expected to hand over their phones. That came after a  London rape trial collapsed after belatedly reviewed mobile phone messages undermined the case against the accused.Everybody in policing and outside knows there will be new technical innovations in detection and prevention of crime. Finnie and his subcommittee are already looking at the ethics and legalities or facial recognition.Graham believes that the controversy over cracking in to phones and how to manage informed consent has been lsquohelpfulrsquo for coming issues. Why  Because it got everybody around a table to think about the issues and how to find ways to resolve them.He says: ldquoThe issue here isnrsquot really the digital triage devices, it is probably more that general position society finds itself in that developments in digitisation has brought to the fore a huge number of contested issues about the balance of the requirement of the state to protect its citizens against the privacy people have.Groups advocating for - and supporting - the victims of sex crimes and domestic abuse - were among those taking part in Police Scotlandrsquos consultations. One of the things they were eager to see was a faster resolution of cases thanks to quick extraction of phone data.Graham says: ldquoThe feedback we are getting from victim-centred groups is that you need to make sure people are not losing their phone for a year. They are on a contract, they have bought a phone, itrsquos an expensive device with all the information on it that they need to live their lives.But there is a balance. Graham says: ldquoIn the future we will be looking at developing more tactics and techniques that allow us to access information.ldquoWe can now use [the digital triage device consultation] as a model for how we both reassure and seek advice for people on how we start it tackle some of these really dficult issues.Graham and senior officers are clear on one thing. It is not for them to set the rules on these privacy rights issues.He concludes: ldquoThis is a debate, I think, that is ongoing in society. We need to be a part of that but I donrsquot think the police should be at the centre of making decisions about some of these really challenging issues without wider engagement."},{"url":null,"title":"catalan-flemish-leaders-call-eu-membership-plan","story":"Quim Torra and Jan Jambon want to see \"mechanisms that could allow the integration of new independent states born by democratic means\" in to the union.In a joint statement, the leaders said they believe in a Scottish solution to their aspirations for their nations to split from Spain and Belgium respectively.Mr Torra - whose predecessor lives in exile in Belgium to escape a Spanish arrest warrant - repeated his callsfor \"anagreed referendum like that of Scotland\" in Catalonia.Catalan and Spanish observers have noted that Mr Torra has moved away from Slovene style to Scottish style independence.The Catalan government held an independence referendum in  without the permission of the Spanish authorities.This plebiscite was ruled illegal and its organisers were jailed or forced to flee the country.A Spanish crackdown has seen support for independence fall.

Active Schools Lead Coordinator for Central Aberdeenshire, Malcolm Grant, said: “Across Scotland this month the sporting theme from sportscotland is Local Heroes and Eilish ticked every box during her visits to Oyne Primary and Inverurie Academy. “The focus on personal best resonates strongly across a broad range of school subjects, not just sport, but having Eilish presenting her thoughts on her own career and how she intends to continue to improve and progress, despite her already extensive achievements in athletics, ensured that all of the pupils went home with some extra inspiration and motivation to do the best that they can, whatever they choose to do in the future.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Neil McDonald, Scott Duguid and Peter Taylor at the eBlast celebration event\"  Kintore firm marks th anniversaryviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Lady Michelle Mone OBE attended the Inverurie Loco Works Football Club Business Lunch\"  Inverurie club marks decade of success viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"retail plans at former health centre site","story":"Proposals for a new retail development in Inverurie town centre have been submitted to Aberdeenshire Council.Aberdeen-based developer West Coast Estates has been working on the plans with the National Health Service.The development would see the site of the former Inverurie Health Centre transformed into a new retail destination that will complement the existing shops currently available in the town.The proposals, which would see the current building demolished and the vacant town centre site regenerated, would feature four new retail units, including a Starbucks drive thru - the first for the town and only the second of its kind in Aberdeenshire.Developer West Coast Estates say the proposals have been “carefully developed to respect neighbouring properties, utilise its fantastic location and add to the unique character of the town”.West Coast Estates director Iftikar Mian said: “The proposal presents an excellent opportunity to breathe new le into a vacant site in a key location in the town, one that will benefit local residents, and importantly, complement the existing retail offer that is avaialble in Inverurie.“Importantly, and recognising the current need for additional car parking spaces within the town centre, the proposals would also deliver  much needed new car parking spaces.“Discussions are already underway with a iety of operators, including Starbucks, and we look forward to working with the local community, neighbouring businesses, and all those who have an interest in the proposals.”The development would see a total investment of £ million.It is also estimated that it would create up to  full and part-time job opportunities.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Did your name make the list \"  Baby Names : here are the top  most controversial baby names for boys viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"these are the foods you shouldn t feed your dog this christmas","story":"These are seven foods you should avoid giving to your pooch this Christmas, according to pet food experts at Canagan.

The energy produced is enough to power an estimated , homes, but environmentalists claim biomass energy isn’t as green as it appears.Scotlands biomass sites generate enough energy to power , homes.When people think of clean energy, wind turbines and solar  often come to mind.But biomass power plants – a less well-known method of generating renewable electricity – are booming across the UK and environmental campaigners have raised doubts about their green credentials.The burning of trees or plant matter – known as plant biomass – now accounts for more than a fth of the UK’s renewable energy, second only to wind power.The number of plant biomass power plants in the UK has more than trebled in four years, from  in  to  in .Between them, they now produce enough energy to power around . million homes, analysis by the JPIMedia Data Unit has found.In Scotland, the number has quadrupled from  biomass sites in  to  by . Unlike other forms of green energy, biomass plants produce greenhouse gases. Across the country, the rise in biomass means its total greenhouse gas emissions have nearly reached the amount produced by coal. The industry says wood is sourced from renewable forests, with new trees being planted which store carbon and help to offset the emissions produced.But with the environment proving a key policy battleground in this year’s General Election, campaigners are calling for the practice to come under more scrutiny.Katja Garson, forest and climate campaigner at European campaign group Fern, said: “It is very concerning that in the global push to reduce emissions, more is not being said about the climate impacts of harvesting and burning wood.” Critics have also raised concerns that some power plants ship wood in from overseas, saying this has an added impact on the environment.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Controversial baby names.\"  Baby Names : here are the top  most controversial baby names for girlsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Launching this years festive campaign, the first since the introduction of new drug-driving laws, are, from left, Chief Inspector Darren Faulds, Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf, and Superintendent Louise Blakelock, Police Scotlands Deputy Head of Road Policing.\"  Zero tolerance approach to both drink and drug driving this festive season viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"The UK now imports . million tonnes of wood pellets a year, more than  times the amount imported a decade ago. Most comes from the USA and Canada, data from the Office for National Statistics shows.Campaigners are also urging the Government to rethink the £. billion in annual subsidies that the biomass industry gets.Almuth Ernsting, of the pressure group Biofuelwatch, said the Government should redirect subsidies to “genuinely low-carbon renewable energy” instead.“For the climate, electricity from forest biomass is no better than electricity from coal,” she said. “Both are completely incompatible with the need to rapidly reduce carbon emissions.”However, Benedict McAleenan, senior advisor to the Renewable Energy Association, said: “Pretending that biomass is somehow no better than coal means ignoring a whole host of facts. “It particularly misunderstands the way forestry works, ignores the important role of regulations and forgets the fact that trees are being regrown all the time.“In reality, UK rules are world-leading and prevent unsustainable practices.”Mr McAleenan said technology being developed called Carbon Capture and Storage would allow biomass plants to “suck carbon out of the atmosphere”, reducing the emissions they produce.He said it would not be possible for the UK to hit net zero-carbon without using bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage.Scotland’s carbon reduction ambitions came a step closer with ground-breaking new charter signed by Government and industry last week. A new alliance of industry, academics and Government officially launched Scotland’s programme to deliver the country’s programme of industrial decarbonisation through the deployment of the UK’s first carbon capture, usage and storagetechnology. The industry led coalition, known as NECCUS, will be instrumental in driving forward the development of CCUS which is recognised as essentialScotland is to meet its target of reducing the country’s carbon emissions to net zero by . CCUS is becoming increasingly commonplace around the world as a way of mitigating climate change. At its simplest, the technology involves capturing the carbon that is emitted from power plantsor energy intensive industries such as chemical and steel producers and then storing the greenhouse gas safely and permanently in rock formations deep below the seabed. Scotland’s project will take this technique further by creating hydrogen which can be used as an alternative to high carbon fuels such as coal, oil and gas for heat and power. CCUS coupled with hydrogen production alongside renewable energy and reforestation – as well as more sustainable production of food and consumer goods – is seen as an essential component of Scotland’s carbon emission reduction target five years before the rest of the UK.The first CCUS plant is expected to be operational by .Mike Smith, NECCUS CEO, said: “We’ve made great progress with wind, solar and other renewable technologies over the last  years. “But the need to decarbonise our economy is urgent so we must build on the good start the UK has made by addressing the hard to decarbonise sectors like heat, heavy industry, transport, and chemicals. “The only way we can achieve that is with the deployment of CCUS. NECCUS, with its unrivalled support from all sectors of industry, academia and Government is now set to deliver on doing just that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"December ,  at : pmEmergency services are dealing with an incident on the main Stromness to Kirkwall road, the A.

The programme is made up of a iety of nature-themed events run by local organisations and iniduals and co-ordinated each year by the local RSPB Scotland team.“The Nature Festival is a fantastic opportunity for people to learn more about the special wildle of Orkney, take part in activities, and maybe even discover an island they’ve not visited before,# said RSPB Scotland’s events and communications officer for Orkney, Eleanor Davison.# being the Visit Scotland Year of Coasts and Waters certainly works well for Orkney and we look forward to providing even more coastal-themed events and activities than usual!”The festival is a chance for the people of Orkney to showcase and celebrate the natural wonders that Orkney has to offer and for local businesses to raise awareness of what they do, and so RSPB Scotland are keen for folk to get involved.“We know many people plan trips to Orkney each year to coincide with the festival week, and we aim to provide a range of events, activities and new experiences for all,# added Eleanor.#We are keen to highlight Orkney’s spectacular wildle and get people interacting with nature. With growing awareness of the huge threats facing wildle and habitats in the UK and across the world, it would be great to have more festival events which focus on the importance of looking after our environment and give people the opportunity to get involved on a local level to help save nature.#I would like to encourage anyone who has an idea for an event they would like to run to get in touch as soon as possible.”Any organisation or inidual who would like to take part in the  festival can contact Eleanor at the RSPB Orkney office in Stromness on  or email orkney@rspb.org.uk  For more information on the festival as it becomes available you can check out the website at: www.orkneynaturefestival.orgOr visit the festival#s Facebook page at: www.facebook OrkneyNatureFestivalcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The project was allowed to sell meat until October , and this extension takes advantage of the European Commission’s approval for Scotland-wide sales until any new potential EU exit date.These licences permit the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland directly to consumers as well as to retailers, such as hotels and butchers.Claudia Rowse, SNH’s head of natural resource management said #We are delighted to announce the continued sale of resident greylag goose meat. Now, licensed sellers from Orkney will have a chance to develop the market for their product and people can try goose for themselves, on Orkney, and across Scotland.“Wild geese are an important part of Scotland’s nature, but their rapid rise in numbers has been challenging for farmers and crofters. We know that striking the balance between conservation, farming and hunting can be dficult.“Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, allowing them to control goose numbers sustainably and sell goose meat for profit.”SNH have said they are working to secure longer-term arrangements for the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland. A project review will take place in January , in light of the UK’s EU exit arrangements, and take into account any changes arising from the current review of its General Licences.Sale of wild goose meat shot outside the project is prohibited under the Wildle and Countryside Act .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The former Traffic Commissioner for Scotland, who stepped down in February, also never minced her words in  years of regulating buses and lorries.Recalling her time in the hot seat at an event in Edinburgh this week, she said she had turned the “turgid”, paperwork-focused approach of the office into “dynamic engagement” with bus operators and haulage companies, driven by her overarching goal of keeping people safe on the roads.From the cases I have covered over the years, Ms Aitken had no compunction in banning miscreant operators or putting them out of business, and she let them know why in no uncertain terms.She told a Glasgow lorry driver she would not wait until he killed someone, and he could not be trusted behind the wheel because his greed for making more money came before safety.The owner of a South Lanarkshire childcare centre was told that Ms Aitken was “singularly unimpressed by her seeing herself as some sort of victim” - when she had failed to get a licence.Speaking to the Scottish Transport Studies Group think tank, Ms Aitken’s job sounded at times like being a sherf in the Wild West, imposing the law on bus wars, “baddies” and the “criminality” of some operators.However, while Ms Aitken said she had largely stamped out such behaviour, and buses were now much more reliable, punctual and safer, she admitted there was still one key area in which she wished she had done more.The former traffic commissioner said she had noticed sexism soon after taking over, and wondereddodgy operators told her wheels came off buses for no reason “because I was a girl”.She observed there had been some improvements, such as the “nonsense of naked lady photos” on depot walls being removed.But Ms Aitken said there remained “real issues” over increasing the number of women working in transport.A report by the cycling and walking body Sustrans Scotland last year highlighted that transport had the lowest percentage of women in senior posts within the public sector north of the Border - of just . per cent.In addition, despite comprising nearly half the UK workforce, women account for only around one in five transport workers.Ms Aitken observed that while there were some very successful female bus drivers and hauliers, working conditions remained a major deterrent to more women working in the sector.She said part of the problem was the lack of basic facilities, such as toilets, and suitable sht patterns.The Women in Transport group has stressed the importance of a more gender-balanced workforce to help better address women’s needs as passengers - since the majority on buses are female. With so few women at the helm of Scottish transport firms, it’s encouraging to see at least some new additions.As well as lawyer and engineer Claire Gilmore replacing Ms Aitken as traffic commissioner, Caroline Donaldson was this week appointed as managing director of the West Coast Partnership Development, which will help devise plans for HS, whose trains are due to run on to Edinburgh and Glasgow.She joins industry leaders such as bus firm Xplore Dundee managing director Christine McGlasson, and Scottish Canals chief executive Catherine Topley - but there should be many, many more.

It led me to consider just how quickly time passes, and indeed how it appears to pass more quickly as one travels through the years.It also took me down memory lane of the  and  general electionsI mention all of this because I urge readers to not believe anything is as presented in a general election by the leading political parties – or the media, who often have an agenda to push or have bought into some utterly ridiculous spin on why things seem as they do. Thankfully The Scotsman has eschewed taking an editorial line on which party to support in preference to seeking out the truth. No, what appears political reality is often a mirage, a poor reflection of what is actually happening a  paradigm that a Timelord might discover bears no relation to what is in the history books.This is where we are in this general election. We have esteemed experts, partisan politicians and bookmakers on the make all trying to tell us what is likely to happen – and the truth is they really do not know. How many of them would take a £ punt on what they tell us is the likely outcome  They can look at national polling, even regional polling they can play around with Electoral calculus which changes the colour of constituency maps as often as a Chameleon and they can attend focus groups to consider what biscuit each leader might be in the minds of the electorate.Yet they still cannot say what will happen.The reality I work under is that while there are national moods and regional swings there are also localised iations, and when with less than three weeks still to go a general election is as close as this one could be, it is in a small number of seats where the outcome will be decided.Last week I met an old friend, the former MEP Tim Aker who was a UKIP general election candidate in his local constituency of Thurrock in  and . Tim swears that it is only because of the strong campaigning by UKIP in Thurrock that the Conservatives defeated Labour on both those occasions. The reasoning is simple but compelling, the electoral ision of Thurrock is strongly eurosceptic and all the more so in Labour wards. Tim polled especially well in Labour heartlands such as Tilbury, so well that Labour lost enough votes in a three-way fight with the Tories for the Conservative Jackie Doyle-Price to hold the seat with a narrow majority.It is what we might call the Thurrock Effect, for it is not limited to Tim Aker’s personal intervention but is repeated in a crucial minority of constituencies across the land. The Thurrock Factor is where the intervention of a third-placed challenger such as UKIP, or in today’s case the Brexit Party, takes so many votes from the Labour candidate that the Conservatives win when the expectation is they will lose. As I wrote last week, Boris Johnson should win, but it is his to lose and Theresa May has shown how easily the Tories can fumble the ball. Thus In a time when the outcome is anything but clear constituencies, where the Thurrock effect might transpire could be the dference between a Johnson and Corbyn government. Seats such as Greater Grimsby are suddenly looking like good prospects for the Conservatives. In this Labour seat polling tells us that the Tory support has remained steady while Labour’s has declined by % with the intervention of the Brexit Party taking some % of the vote. This is a classic example of the Thurrock Effect.Other seats could experience the same phenomenon – or at least come close to scaring the bejeesus out of sitting Labour MPs. Everyone in Bishop Auckland, even Labour voters, tell me the incumbent Helen Goodman is unpopular. The Brexit Party has a good candidate in Nick Brown who should do well and could provide an upset, buthe doesn’t then the Tory Dehenna Davison could benefit from his campaigning winning over Labour voters, leaving her to seize the day. Other English seats such as Keighley, Rother Valley, Dewsbury and Wakefield fit this format. The common factor is these are all northern seats, where the Brexit Party could win a handful of Labour fiefdoms – or make it possible for the Tories to benefit from their hard work. So much for the Brexit Party splitting the leave vote and letting Jeremy Corbyn in – but don’t expect Boris Johnson to thank Nigel Farage for standing candidates in such marginals. Only a fortnight ago Johnson’s lieutenants were demanding Farage stand more of his candidates down.In Scotland the existence of the independence question changes everything. With the SNP decimating Labour in  and Corbyn’s party only coming third after the Tories in  the debate about Brexit has less resonance than in England and Wales – but it still matters.With Brexit Party candidates withdrawing from all Tory held seats the latest polling suggests the Conservatives are doing well in Scotland while Labour could lose all but Edinburgh South. I will go further and suggest there will be a perverse McThurrock Effect – where Labour voters who cannot stomach Corbyn hold their noses and vote Conservative as the most attractive unionist party, ironically helping the SNP to retain those marginal seats.This would be important, for seven of Labour’s top twenty target constituencies in the UK are held by the SNP. You don’t need to be a time traveller to work out Corbyn winning the general election will only exist in some parallel universe.Brian Monteith MEP is Chief Whip of the Brexit Party in the European Parliament©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon urges snp members not to campaign for neale hanvey","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has urged SNP members not to campaign for Neale Hanvey after he was suspended by party bosses for allegedly sharing antisemitic messages on social media.Mr Hanvey, the former leader of the SNP group on Fe Council, will still appear on ballot papers in the Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath constituency as the deadline for nominations has passed.Despite being suspended by his party, several activists have declared they will still support his candidacy in the key marginal seat - which is being defended by Labour’s Lesley Laird with a majority of just .Speaking for the first time about the suspension, the First Minister called for local SNP supporters to campaign in neighbouring seats, stressing her party “unfortunately” no longer has a candidate contesting the seat.“My message to SNP members and activists would be to campaign in neighbouring constituencies,” Ms Sturgeon said.“They’re not too far away from Stephen Gethins in North East Fe, for example, so there’s plenty of good candidates out there to get out and campaign for.”An investigation into Mr Hanvey’s actions has been launched by the party and, asked what would happenhe won the seat, Ms Sturgeon said: “He’s suspended at the moment, there’s disciplinary action that will flow from that and it would not be appropriate for me to comment while that’s ongoing.”Ms Sturgeon also addressed speculation Mr Hanvey may have been axed because of his views on trans rights.She said: “He was suspended because of the anti-Semitic comments he made and that is the long and short of it.”A pro-indepdence campaign group in Fe yesterday declared it would still support Mr Hanvey despite the SNP disowning his campaign. Yes Kirkcaldy, which was set up before the  referendum, had previously indicated it would back the Scottish Greens candidate’s campaign: SNP withdraws support for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath candidateIn statement, the group said: “We thought Neale Hanvey had dropped out of the race altogether, leaving the Greens’ Scott Rutherford as the only pro-independence candidate.“That turned out not to be the case, and since it became clear that Neale was running as a pro-independence, independent candidate, who still has very strong support, we have come to the conclusion he has the best chance of winning the seat.”A crowdfunding page launched by Mr Hanvey on Saturday to pay for his campaigning costs smashed its target in less than  hours.Speaking today, Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw described the decision by some SNP activists to support the party’s axed candidate as “appalling”.Last week, Mr Hanvey admitted to having shared an article from the Kremlin-backed news agency Sputnik from  concerning the Hungarian financier George Soros, illustrated with an image showing him holding puppets of world leaders.The former Dunfermline councillor made a full apology and later announced his intention to stand as an independent.Yesterday, the SNP’s defence spokesman questioned why some Nationalists were still supporting Mr Hanvey.Responding to one on Twitter who said the antisemitism was a mere allegation, he said: “It’s not ‘alleged antisemitism’, he posted a statement apologising for spreading antisemitism – in this case theories that lead directly to hatred of Jews: comparisons with Nazis and George Soros conspiracies. Why would you swing behind that ”Scott Rutherford, the Greens’ candidate in the seat, said: “I am disappointed that some in Yes Kirkcaldy have ultimately decided that they will not back the only pro-independence party in the constituency at this election. The fact is the SNP suspended Neale Hanvey because of his views. As an inclusive, cross-party movement, independence supporters should be uniting behind the only remaining pro-indy party on the ballot. “The Scottish Greens are already leading on the key issues in this constituency, calling for a just transition at Mossmorran and jobs at BiFab in Burntisland.

The event, which also included a family and community fun day, marked the end of a year long refurbishment programme.The work commenced in October, last year when the main contractor Martin Hamilton, a Ballymena based company, arrived on site.Over the course of the next twelve months they completely transformed the inside of the church building as well as adding a new welcome hub.Over the past ten years the congregation has been thinking how best to provide st century facilities for a twenty first century church. Under the guidance of the design team of Kennedy Fitzgerald Architects, Williams  Shaw and Doran Consulting we have been able to take the project forward.The now current minister, Rev William Sinclair was called in September  and ministers along with associate minister Rev Matthew Boyd.First Ballymena Presbyterian Church was one of the first congregations to have an organ installed in the meeting house, and a new digital organ was installed during the current building project. Moving on from here, First Ballymena is a congregation that seeks to have a passion for Jesus Christ and a compassion for people. They want to engage with the community and be a compassionate church with a heart at the heart of the town of Ballymena. The new welcome hub helps open up the church and makes it an inviting place to be.Over the course of the past year, Matthew Boyd has joined William Sinclair in the ministry team and his main role is to strengthen the church’s mission in the community and to develop discipleship programmes in the congregation.Matthew Boyd stated his primary focus is on Discipleship and it has been encouraging to see just how God has been working in a number of people’s lives.Also as a church they have been going “over the wall” and engaging with people outside of the congregation who don’t yet know Jesus. It is the prayer of the church that God might continue to use them to reach out and point others to Jesus.

Set in an old theatre in the s, the former St Genevieve’s pupil’s take on the festive and timeless classic will take families of all ages through a journey as they watch all the characters come together to show Ebenezer Scrooge the error of his ways.“The MAC’s Christmas audience is quite young so to introduce three ghosts can become quite scary so you have to work with that,” she said. “They always say write what you know and I know the theatre. I’ve set the story in a theatre where Scrooge is a producer, along with Jacob Marley they were the big theatre producers of the day. There is a term in threatre called the ‘ghost light’ this would have been turned on through the night so that people, who were still working through, wouldn’t have fallen through the trapdoor. I loved that idea and thought this would work as a way to introduce our ghosts. “This theatre, which Scrooge is in charge of, isn’t making the profit it used to the ghosts come to le in the hope that Scrooge won’t close down the theatre. The kids who will be in the audience are helping us create this story and it’s a way to introduce such a classic to a younger audience,” she said. Having starred in panto since she was , Tara Lynne will also be starring in Xmas For Dummies at the Grand Opera House with Chris Robinson, “an adult take on the classic ’s film Mannequin,” set in Castle Street.“It’s an hour of a show, either before or after your Christmas party to come in and have a laugh with us. I’m only in one of them so you’ll not be sick of my face,” she laughed.Having wowed audiences with her Shirley Valentine at The Lyric stage earlier this year, Tara Lynne exclusively reveals that her one-woman tour de force is coming back in  for a new run. “I’m really excited to be coming back with the show. The amount of feedback we got from people for a -year-old play was amazing. Everybody was coming up to me saying how they had ‘got a bit of Shirley in me’.“You could’ve heard a pin drop most nights in The Lyric. The support for the piece was unbelievable, it is such a gt of a show.”When not writing, acting or preparing to travel to ‘Greece for a fortnight’, Tara Lynne will be donning ‘Ma’s’ wig again as filming for Derry Girls series three gets underway in April.“I can’t wait to see what Lisa has instore for this series, I don’t think anyone can wait. It’s all very top secret at the minute. The scripts are so good, let’s hope I don’t get killed off or leave in a black taxi as that’s what happened me in Eastenders,” she laughed.

I remain focused on delivering for North Belfast.“It has generally been a positive campaign so far. The dynamic that this election transcends party politics is being received on the doors. That positive message about maximizing the Remain vote is being received very well.“We are running a very positive campaign by looking to the future by delivering better for North Belfast. It is an area as the readers will know that has been left behind and has many challenges. I want to be an MP to get stuck into those challenges.”Mr Finucane and his party have also faced criticism from opponents regarding Sean Kelly, the man convicted of the  Shankill bomb, who has worked as a party canvasser in North Belfast. However, John Finucane pointed to remarks by leading victims’ campaigner Alan McBride, who lost his we in the Shankill bomb, urging all political parties to be mindful of victims at election time.“Alan McBride is one of the most impressive people that I have met. He is considerate and well-measured,” said John.“His response to this debate is something everyone needs to listen to. I have and the party has, of being mindful and respectful of victims at election time. He has also called out the banners which are hurtful to those families who lost loved ones in the Shankill which I agree with.“He also called out the DUP hypocrisy on this issue – a party which has convicted drug dealers canvassing for them, engages with active loyalist paramilitaries connected with offences up to and including murder this year. Alan has been a strong and reasonable voice in this debate and I welcome his comments.”In an election that many see isabout Brexit, Sinn Fein’s long-standing abstentionism policy at Westminster has once again surfaced but Mr Finucane is adamant protection for the people of Ireland does not come from the green benches of the House of Commons. “It is an issue which has come up on the doors. Since the last Westminster election and the dynamic between the DUP and the Tories, there is absolutely no appetite by the British government to compensate or consider the impact of Brexit on the people of Ireland. It is not on their radar at all.“The DUP got spectacularly thrown under the bus and showed that no matter what your constitutional aspirations are, the British government simply does not careyou live in this part of the world.“Those who want to protect their European identity or voted to Remain – the protection is never coming from the green benches of Westminster. The protection comes from Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste Simon Coveney and the EU  and in America, supported by Sinn Féin.”John Finucane will contest a close-fought election contest with the DUP’s outgoing MP Nigel Dodds, someone many see as the chief architect of a hard Brexit.“Hewould be proud of that title. He was part of the Vote Leave campaign. He has been the DUP head at Westminster and is proud of his Brexit record.“The two defining political moments in my letime have been the Good Friday Agreement and Brexit and Nigel Dodds is on the wrong side of history in both of those. He continues to be opposed to the Good Friday Agreement and he continues to champion Brexit which goes against the majority of people’s views in North Belfast which is hopefully reflected on December .”Looking at local issues affecting North Belfast, the Sinn Féin candidate wants to address food banks, the mental health crisis, housing and anti-social behaviour, amongst others.“In North Belfast, we have food banks, a mental health crisis, reliance on prescription drugs, very toxic legacy from the conflict, suicide crisis particularly amongst our young people.“I don’t want to refight old battles or use the past to poke my neighbour in the eye. People want to move forward with political leadership that can do just that.”He said the DUP’s record on housing “is despicable”.“They object to housing for reasons that can be interpreted as nothing short of sectarian,” he said. “This is the brand of politics I think North Belfast wants to turn its back on. Housing is a right that is founded and based on need and nothing to do with religion, who you vote for or ethnicity.“North Belfast has a housing crisis – we are top of all the tables you don’t want to be top of and bottom of all the tables you don’t want to be bottom of.There are areas of land that need to be used for housing. There needs to be a major overhaul. We are up against a lot of opposition which the DUP are at the heart of.“Mental health, bonfires and anti-social behaviour are all linked in many ways. It is no surprise that those involved in anti-social behaviour come from economically-deprived and challenging backgrounds.“I was in the New Lodge this week and saw for myself the good work that is being done to remove people from engaging in anti-social behaviour. The community doesn’t want it. I think it was unfortunate this year to see the response of the police that eroded a lot of confidence from the local community.“Hard work needs to continue all year around. Statutory bodies, police and council all have a responsibility too. There is a lot of positive work happening – one example is the Féile dance night which takes young people away from bonfires.“From my day job as a solicitor, I know there are complicated reasons why people find themselves in the criminal justice system. The work has started and continues to operate all year around.”Asked about a border poll, John was quick to urge caution.“I don’t think we are ready for it tomorrow. The inevitability of a border poll is accepted and I say that, having listened to unionists. The mechanism is there in the Good Friday Agreement and we are close to the point when it will be called.“Brexit has shown you need to be prepared for a referendum and people need to be clear what they are voting for and what they are voting against.” also saw John Finucane installed as Lord Mayor, becoming the First Citizen of Belfast after he was elected to Belfast City Council in May and he says he has been encouraged by the fantastic work he has witnessed right across the city.“I was given advice from Tom Hartley who said you only think you know your city and he was absolutely right.“I am from the best part of the city – North Belfast – but really I only knew it geographically. I have seen the fantastic work that goes on in communities across the city that I wasn’t aware of. None of it gets much attention but I am very encouraged by the vision for this city, which is happening North, South, East and West.”As a former county footballer and the current goalkeeper for Lámh Dhearg, John suffered heartbreaking defeat in the Antrim Senior Football Final against Cargin last month.“I have tried to make sure this defeat isn’t talked about again,” he says. “It was a tough one to take but a season that won’t be forgotten in a hurry.“We had some really good wins over Creggan and Portglenone but just came up short in the second final against Cargin after extra-time.”The Sinn Féin man is determined not to come up short again when the votes are counted on December ."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they missed my sickness for 23 years and today its","story":"AN Oldpark woman has been diagnosed with a rare spinal illness –  years after being injured in a fall.Margaret Reevessays a scan revealed her condition in , but she was only told about it when she became one of the patients recalled last year by under-investigation neurologist Dr Michael Watt. Now, after waitingnearly a quarter-of-a-century for a correct diagnosis, she’s been told it’s too late for her to be cured of the spinal disorder spondylotic myelopathy.Margaret’s story began in  when she suffered a bad fall and was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra in her neck after a visit to the Mater. Days later, she was referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital who put the pain she was suffering down to an extra congenital rib that she was born with. Her chronic battle with pain took its toll to the extent that she had to quit her job in the Civil Service.Speaking to the North Belfast News in her Cedar Avenue flat, Margaret explained her long and painful journey to the truth began  years after her first fall.“I started having a series of bad falls in ,” she said. “In short, I was passed around dferent neurologists. I knew in my heart that something was wrong.“I was breaking bones all over my body. I just couldn’t balance. I was a patient of Dr Michael Watt. He diagnosed me with epilepsy, but I never took the medication because I never believed I had epilepsy.”On being recalled by Dr Watt last year, Margaret found out for the first time what a scan from the past had revealed.“It wasn’t until the recall that I was told a scan in  showed I had chronic spondylotic myelopathy, but now it was now too serious to be cured. I had been passed between neurology wards and GPs for over  years and the reality was that my diagnosis was known in  but nobody told me.“I only found out I had this condition because I was a recall patient for something .“How many more people are out there similar to me who haven’t been diagnosed with myelopathy “It is estimated that one in four people could have it. I would say to anyone who suffers from compression in the back, slipped discs, oryou are dropping things or have tingling in the hands, that you may have myelopathy.”A tearful Margaret added: “I will end up in a wheelchair. I will lose the power of my arms and not be able to feed myself because my diagnosis went on so long.“I feel very alone. I don’t know anyone  with it.“The sad reality is that this condition can be preventedit is discovered early enough.”Margaret wants to use her heartbreaking story to reach out to others and raise awareness of myelopathy to let them know they are not alone.She recently ed from a trip to New York to meet fellow patients and top neurologists from across the world at a myelopathy conference.“Myelopathy is out there but people don’t know they have it,” she added. “I want to focus on the disease and its progressionnot treated. Myelopathy is a degenerative disease and there are guidelines on when to operate.“Unfortunately for me, I wasn’t treated sooner and it may have slowed the condition down.“I suffered for years not knowing what was wrong with me.“There is no support here in Northern Ireland. I don’t know where I would be without the support of myelopathy.org, Spinal Injuries Association and AOSpine as well as Cambridge University who are pioneering more research and work into the condition.“We need to talk about myelopathy. If I was living in England I would have been treated quicker.“I am worried about the future because it has been left to deteriorate for so long.”Margaret said she wanted to thank Belfast Back Care for their treatment and Archie Coogan for his holistic therapies.If you suffer from, or believe you suffer from, myelopathy, you can get in touch with Margaret Reeves atMargaret-@hotmail."},{"url":null,"title":"joshua garrett 9 has cracked egg market and is now eyeing up future with","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The SDLP were out in force on the ground in the Lower Ormeau and the Markets this week.SDLP’s Claire HannaAs her partys most high-profile MLA on broadcast media, and with personal and family links to the constituency dating back decades, Hanna has a strong hand generally.She is also fortunate in her main unionist opponent. In neighbouring East Belfast, DUP MP Gavin Robinson has kept a relatively low-profile. He hasnt antagonised those who didnt vote for him.The same cannot be said of Little-Pengelly in South Belfast. When she was elected, she had the opportunity to build bridges with nationalists and others in this most erse constituency - as an act of self-preservationnothing .DUP’s Emma Little-PengellyInstead, she became involved in rows over bonfires and UVF flags. It was unwise to antagonise those who otherwise might have developed a civil relationship with a reconciliatory and progressive DUP MP.Yet Little-Pengelly certainly cant be written off in next months poll. She has a fine electoral track record in this constituency. She increased her partys vote by an impressive % between  and , something for which she is given insufficient credit.She is a prodigious constituency worker. Despite Ulster Unionist Michael Henderson standing, she should secure a massive unionist vote.DUP Balmoral councillor David Graham is running her campaign, and doesnt think it is a lost cause.\"Emma got over , votes last time, and there is room for growth in our core area,\" he says.\"If you compare our  bestboxes in the constituency with the top  nationalist boxes in  - when we did exceptionally well - there was still a far higher proportion of people in our best areas who didnt vote or werent even registered.\"Weve done a lot of work on the ground to change that, and unionist voters are very motivated for this election. Emma grew unionist turnout in , and we need to do that again. I think we will as people realise it has never been more important to defend the Union.\"Graham also cites the outgoing MPs grassroots endeavours: \"Emma has dealt with over , cases in her office in her two years as an MP. Christopher Stalford is a hard-working MLA and we have an excellent council team locally. That helps us hugely.\"Alliance Party’s Paula Bradshaw The key to the DUPs chances is how Alliance fares. If the Remain camp is fairly evenly split and Hanna doesnt pull signicantly ahead of Bradshaw, then Little-Pengelly should win.Support for Bradshaw next month is dficult to predict. The SDLP was , votes ahead of Alliance in . Yet the Naomi factor and the partys extraordinary success in the EU election may have changed the dynamic.Alliance surged ahead of the SDLP in Mays council poll. But the fact Bradshaw stood as an Ulster Unionist Conservative candidate in  might limit her reach more than it would an Alliance candidate without such a history.Ray Kennedy was the SDLPs election guru in South Belfast for two decades. He ran Alasdair McDonnells campaigns. He says: \"This seat is now Claire Hannas to lose. But I think it will be tight at the top with the SDLP just edging it over the DUP, and Alliance coming a good third.\"Alasdair won around , soft unionist votes in . I reckon theyre in doubt, with these voters perhaps switching to Alliance or staying at home.\"The SDLPs perceived pact with Sinn Fein doesnt help as its being sold by others as a sectarian pact.\"However, Kennedy sees Hanna winning support where. \"Claire wont get % of the Green vote, but she will get a fair chunk. But I think she will secure no more than half Sinn Fein votes, and perhaps only a third,\" he says.\"The benchmark will be whether she manages to get as high a turnout as Alasdair in and the SDLP won over , votes.\"While forecasting defeat for Alliance this time, Kennedy predicts future growth.\"Alliance did very well in the council election, but the archaic and undemocratic first-past-the-post system for Westminster doesnt suit the party,\" he says.\"I see it occupying the same space in South Belfast as we did  years ago. Alasdair ran for Westminster and wasnt close, but he made up ground in every election and we used that momentum to grow our vote. Alliance will do similarly. It has bright prospects ahead.\""},{"url":null,"title":"constituency profile ian paisley certain to weather the storm in north antrims staunch dup country","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Either we stop this addiction to coal or all our efforts to tackle the climate crisis will be doomed. We need ambitious #ClimateAction now. My remarks at #COP: https:t.co OlQxODdEJ pic XyCkyUjcg— António GuterresDecember , “Do we really want to be remembered as the generation that buried its head in the sand, that fiddled while the planet burned ” Mr Guterres asked.His appeal came after Chile’s environment minister, Carolina Schmidt, said the December - meeting needs to lay the groundwork for moving toward carbon-neutral economies while being sensitive to the poorest and those most vulnerable to rising temperatures, something that policymakers have termed “just transition”.“Those who don’t want to see it will be on the wrong side of history,” said Ms Schmidt, who is chairing the meeting.She called on governments to make more ambitious pledges to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases ahead of a deadline to do so next year.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi speaks during a press conference at the COP climate talks summit in Madrid The summit, which moved to the Spanish capital after Chile had to pull out amid anti-government protests, aims to put the finishing touches to the rules governing the  Paris accord.That involves creating a ing international emissions-trading system and compensating poor countries for losses they suffer from rising sea levels and other consequences of climate change.“We have a common challenge but with dferentiated needs and urgencies, which we can only overcomewe work together,” said Ms Schmidt.Countries agreed in Paris four years ago to limit global warming to well below C , ideally .Cby the end of the century compared with pre-industrial times.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A coal fired power plant Already, average temperatures have increased by about C, leaving little room for the more ambitious target to be met.Mr Guterres called out big greenhouse gas emitters that are still building coal-fired power plants, saying that unless the world stops burning coal “all our efforts to tackle climate change will be doomed.”He noted that had countries started cutting their emissions drastically a decade ago, reaching the Paris goal would have been much easier.“Ten years ago,countries had acted on the science, they would have needed to reduce emissions by .% each year,” he said.“Today, we need to reduce emissions by .% each year.”“The impact on all le on the planet, including ours, would be catastrophic,” he added.To address the climate emergency, we need a rapid  deep change in how we do business, how we generate power, how we build cities, how we move and how we feed the world.If we don’t urgently change our way of le, we jeopardize le itself. #COP pic SeRCCXoEa— António GuterresDecember , “The only solution is rapid, ambitious, transformative action by all — governments, regions, cities, businesses and civil society, all working toward a common goal.”Organisers expect around , visitors at the meeting, including around  heads of state and government for Monday’s opening session.In contrast to the European Union, which sent its newly sworn-in executive leadership team to the summit, the rest of the world’s largest carbon emitters, the United States, China and India, have sent lower-level ministers and officials.The US sent a delegation, led by Ambassador Marcia Bernicat, a senior State Department official, even though President Donald Trump has formally begun the process of pulling the country out of the Paris accord.However, that won’t be technically completed until November  .But Democratic members of Congress led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the nation remains committed to the  agreement’s goals and that climate change poses a threat to public health, the economy and national security.“We’re still in it,” Ms Pelosi said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Traffic is seen on a highway in Minsk, Belarus Asked about comments by Spain’s interim prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, that “only a handful of fanatics deny the evidence” of man-made global warming, Ms Pelosi responded that she had “three words that describe how we address this: science, science and science. And maybe four: science, again”.“If we can stick with the science, I think we can come up with some sane solutions to it all,” she said.In an interview with The Associated Press, the UN chief hoped that stricter goals in Europe would allow EU leaders to convince fellow big polluters “to understand that this must be a collective effort and that they all will have to correct their policies in order to drastically be able to reduce the emissions”."},{"url":null,"title":"498117","story":"Why not head along and get into the the Christmas spirit at the St. Mary’s College annual Christmas Craft Fair in the school this Saturday from am-.pm.

Father Micheaacutel McGavigan, Director of the Diocesan Pastoral Centre, who has overseen the development of the new website said: “Communication is changing in the st Century and we, as a Diocese, want to ensure we are communicating with parishioners and the wider community in the most effective way possible. googletag.cmd.push “The new website has a fresh look with navigation that makes it much easier for people to find material. It also contains contact and other information on all of the Diocese’s  parishes across Derry, Donegal and Tyrone. “The aim is to communicate effectively with all of those currently active in parishes as well to encourage those who want to reconnect with their faith or enquire about their local parish.” The Derry priest noted that one of the key themes of the Diocesan Pastoral Plan is: ’To Make Jesus Known and Loved.’  He continued: “As well as the new website being a reference point for information about parishes, priests and organisations, it seeks to be a tool for evangelisation. Events that are happening around the diocese will be publicised, and good news stories shared and the faith of the people of the Diocese will be nourished. googletag.cmd.push “People will be able to find details of upcoming events at parish and diocesan level Mass times, details of clergy, and ious organisations at work within the diocese and across Ireland that are associated with the Catholic Church. “People will also be able to stay up to date with the Diocesan Pastoral Plan as the Diocese works towards the Diocesan Assembly in . “The website also has links to external sites where people can find out more about their faith and what we believe and why. We look forward to people looking at the website and giving us their feedback.” In tandem with the new website, the Derry Diocese has also developed another online page, dedicated solely to the development of Vocations for men and women. www.derryvocations.orgcan be accessed directly from diocesan website, and also as an independent domain. Father Chris Ferguson, Director of Vocations said that an important part of the Diocesan Pastoral Plan is highlighting the importance of vocation. He added: “As Christians, we believe every person has received a personal calling from God, which we are asked to respond to throughout our lives. In Baptism, every person is welcomed into the community of God’s people. We all have a part to play in Jesus’ mission to bring healing and mercy. “In a desire to create a culture of vocations, the vocations website is designed to help people question and celebrate their calling in le. The website has been created to provide information and support to those seeking to discover who God is calling them to be, and what path in le might bring them true contentment and happiness.

A solution needs to be found through a determined revolt, inspired by a trade union movement workers led revolution.The accessibility of liberty, free from oppressive restrictions would seem to have been achieved for all, but is this the case  When a child goes to school hungry, to a school unable toeffectively due to a lack of resources, where is the ownership of that childs le  Health and Social Care services are collapsing but so too is society, collapsing under the rule of capitalist governments, depriving working class communities of true liberty and opportunity.Working class communities deserve better, workers deserve equality, now more than ever we need to organise and mobilise, a class war is raging and key battles lie ahead. This is what this election should be about, fighting back and electing those who will stand up to the establishment, breaking the mould, not just becoming part of the establishment when elected.Workers and their families need both political leadership and solidarity. The DTUC Workers Hustings will provide the Foyle constituency candidates with an opportunity to listen to workers and detail why a vote for them is a vote to fight, a vote worth giving.Out of the seven Foyle candidates, four have confirmed attendance, Anne McCloskey , Colum Eastwood , Elisha McCallionand Shaun Harkin .Darren Guy , Gary Middleton , and Rachael Fergusonall said they had made prior arrangements and therefore couldnt attend. googletag.cmd.push The DTUC Workers Hustings will take place at UNISON Hall, Clarendon Street, Derry, on December  at pm. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

So, what is the connection between Hippocrates the father of medicine, an ancient oriental tree, a Greek born medical consultant and the section of Derry’s Walls that the terraced houses of Nailors’ Row once nestled under  Every week, hundreds, maybe thousands of us, walk through historic Bishop’s Gate to and from the city centre. But how many of us pay more than a cursory glance to the beautul patch of sculpted greenery that lies on the right-hand side of the road just outside the walled city  googletag.cmd.push In your mind you may have fleetingly admired its prettiness and thought it a vast improvement on the strip of plain grass that used be there. Just around the corner from the end of the garden, it gives way to steep green slopes that roll downwards the Bogside. It is a site that has seen its fair share of trouble over the decades standing as it does right on the boundary between the Fountain and the Bogside. The at times, serious sectarian clashes there have seen it labelled with one of those cold and condemnatory Northern Ireland terms – interface. However, since November  that small piece of land right in the middle of the often wrongly maligned trouble spot has stood as a quiet beacon to something that should truly uny us all – the gt of good health. googletag.cmd.push It is known as the New Le Garden and is a place of reflection for those who have been given a second crack at existence through organ donation. Whilst the garden is dedicated to all those who have both received and given all transplantable organs either as living donors or through donation after death, a local group based at the city’s hospital has championed the garden and the spirit in which it was created. The words on a stone monument in the heart of the garden erected by the Altnagelvin Renal Support Group state: “This Garden of Le celebrates the gt of new le through organ donation and gives thanks to all organ donors, both living and deceased, for their tremendous generosity and empathy in providing new le through their selfless sacrice.” When the garden was opened six years ago, the official ceremony was attended by representatives of all the city’s main churches, the Northern Ireland Kidney Patients Association, the Fountain and Bogside communities, residents of nearby Alexander House and many people from the then Derry City Council who backed the project. The commemorative garden was also integrated with St Columba’s Peace Garden which occupies the same space. On a chosen Sunday each Christmas time since , as people with arms weighed down with shopping bags in preparation for the festive period hurry by, a group of people gather at the garden to do what it says on the monument – give thanks and remember. The annual ceremony isn’t one that pays attention to either pomp or circumstance. Instead, it’s conducted quietly and reverently, consisting mainly of a few meaningful, heartfelt words by someone who has faced the crushing ordeal of facing leaving le before the inexpressible and joyous relief of having it prolonged by those who have been kind and brave enough to donate. Prayers and a few well-chosen hymns and songs only add to the poignancy of the occasion. With each passing year some of the faces are no longer there, but their families are. New faces are also there – new because they have been added to the list awaiting a new kidney, a new heart, liver or lung. Those who already have done or are waiting to provide a new lease of le are also there, as are the families of those who by their passing handed on extended le to many others. The garden is also where those awaiting a transplant can visit and gain strength. What however, has that got to do with Hippocrates, an ancient oriental tree and specialist medic from modern Greece  The Plane Tree of Kos, or the Tree of Hippocrates according to legend, is the place where in ancient Greece the father of medicine taught his students. The current -foot high tree in the centre of Kos is only around  years old but is believed to be a descendant of the original tree which stood there over two and a half thousand years ago. Seeds or cuttings from the tree have been transported all over the world and one will soon be planted at the New Le Garden in Derry. It will not be the first time a cutting of the famed tree has been placed in Northern Ireland. The practice was first initiated by an intriguing doctor who landed on these shores in the s and who sadly passed away in . Dr Dimitrios Oreopoulous was born in Alexandroupolis and was one of five brothers who grew up in impoverished circumstances. However, he managed to get admitted to the medical school at the University of Athens and received his specialist certicate in . He then moved to the City Hospital in Belfast as a renal registrar where he completed his PhD in nephrology. Upon completion of his studies in Belfast Dr Oreopoulous was recruited by the Toronto Western Hospital where he continued his research at the Metabolic Renal Unit. It was in  whilst studying at Queen’s that the Greek medic presented seeds from the Plane Tree of Kos to both the university and Erskine House at the City Hospital where it continues to thrive to this day. In fact, in , the Erskine House Tree was nominated and won the Woodland Trust’s Tree of the Year competition. In turn, Dr James Douglas, former consultant Nephrologist at Belfast City Hospital, took several cuttings from the Erskine House Tree and these have now matured into saplings ready to be transferred to the New Le Gardens across Northern Ireland. Outside of Derry, other gardens can be found at Kiltonga in Newtonards and at Botanic Gardens in Belfast next door to Queen’s University. Patron of Northern Ireland Kidney Patients, Eamonn Holmes said of the tree at Belfast City Hospital being named tree of the year: “The Erskine House Tree means many things to many dferent people throughout the world, especially the transplant family. I am delighted that the tree has received prestigious accolade and will forever remain a symbol of the ‘Gt of Le’ and a representation of our brave organ donors.” According to the Department of Health, around  people are waiting for an organ transplant, and sadly, around  people die each year while on the waiting list. If you want to add your name to the NHS Organ Donor Register you can either register online at the Organ Donation NI website at https:www.organdonationni.info  or telephone    . A lesser known option is the possibility of becoming a living donor and the most common type in this respect is kidney donation. This takes place when one kidney is removed from a healthy person and transplanted into someone , often a relative. Quite rightly, the NHS point out that this is a major decision to make and everyone who comes forward undergoes a thorough assessment. All live donors and recipients are reviewed by an independent assessor who makes sure there is no pressure or coercion involved and that all parties understand the risks of complications. To make the distinction, the Organ Donor Register is only for those who wish to donate after death – to become a living donor, you must contact a transplant centre directly. The Living Donation Kidney Transplant Team can be contacted at Belfast City Hospital also on    . The team have also released a strategy paper on live kidney donation which can be viewed at https:www.odt.nhs.uk odt-structures-and-standards key-strategies living-donor-transplantation-strategy- . The annual service of remembrance organised by the Altnagelvin Renal Support Group, including the planting of the Plane tree sapling, takes place this year on Sunday, December  at the New Le Garden, Nailors Row at pm.

So, what is the connection between Hippocrates the father of medicine, an ancient oriental tree, a Greek born medical consultant and the section of Derry’s Walls that the terraced houses of Nailors’ Row once nestled under  Every week, hundreds, maybe thousands of us, walk through historic Bishop’s Gate to and from the city centre. But how many of us pay more than a cursory glance to the beautul patch of sculpted greenery that lies on the right-hand side of the road just outside the walled city  googletag.cmd.push In your mind you may have fleetingly admired its prettiness and thought it a vast improvement on the strip of plain grass that used be there. Just around the corner from the end of the garden, it gives way to steep green slopes that roll downwards the Bogside. It is a site that has seen its fair share of trouble over the decades standing as it does right on the boundary between the Fountain and the Bogside. The at times, serious sectarian clashes there have seen it labelled with one of those cold and condemnatory Northern Ireland terms – interface. However, since November  that small piece of land right in the middle of the often wrongly maligned trouble spot has stood as a quiet beacon to something that should truly uny us all – the gt of good health. googletag.cmd.push It is known as the New Le Garden and is a place of reflection for those who have been given a second crack at existence through organ donation. Whilst the garden is dedicated to all those who have both received and given all transplantable organs either as living donors or through donation after death, a local group based at the city’s hospital has championed the garden and the spirit in which it was created. The words on a stone monument in the heart of the garden erected by the Altnagelvin Renal Support Group state: “This Garden of Le celebrates the gt of new le through organ donation and gives thanks to all organ donors, both living and deceased, for their tremendous generosity and empathy in providing new le through their selfless sacrice.” When the garden was opened six years ago, the official ceremony was attended by representatives of all the city’s main churches, the Northern Ireland Kidney Patients Association, the Fountain and Bogside communities, residents of nearby Alexander House and many people from the then Derry City Council who backed the project. The commemorative garden was also integrated with St Columba’s Peace Garden which occupies the same space. On a chosen Sunday each Christmas time since , as people with arms weighed down with shopping bags in preparation for the festive period hurry by, a group of people gather at the garden to do what it says on the monument – give thanks and remember. The annual ceremony isn’t one that pays attention to either pomp or circumstance. Instead, it’s conducted quietly and reverently, consisting mainly of a few meaningful, heartfelt words by someone who has faced the crushing ordeal of facing leaving le before the inexpressible and joyous relief of having it prolonged by those who have been kind and brave enough to donate. Prayers and a few well-chosen hymns and songs only add to the poignancy of the occasion. With each passing year some of the faces are no longer there, but their families are. New faces are also there – new because they have been added to the list awaiting a new kidney, a new heart, liver or lung. Those who already have done or are waiting to provide a new lease of le are also there, as are the families of those who by their passing handed on extended le to many others. The garden is also where those awaiting a transplant can visit and gain strength. What however, has that got to do with Hippocrates, an ancient oriental tree and specialist medic from modern Greece  The Plane Tree of Kos, or the Tree of Hippocrates according to legend, is the place where in ancient Greece the father of medicine taught his students. The current -foot high tree in the centre of Kos is only around  years old but is believed to be a descendant of the original tree which stood there over two and a half thousand years ago. Seeds or cuttings from the tree have been transported all over the world and one will soon be planted at the New Le Garden in Derry. It will not be the first time a cutting of the famed tree has been placed in Northern Ireland. The practice was first initiated by an intriguing doctor who landed on these shores in the s and who sadly passed away in . Dr Dimitrios Oreopoulous was born in Alexandroupolis and was one of five brothers who grew up in impoverished circumstances. However, he managed to get admitted to the medical school at the University of Athens and received his specialist certicate in . He then moved to the City Hospital in Belfast as a renal registrar where he completed his PhD in nephrology. Upon completion of his studies in Belfast Dr Oreopoulous was recruited by the Toronto Western Hospital where he continued his research at the Metabolic Renal Unit. It was in  whilst studying at Queen’s that the Greek medic presented seeds from the Plane Tree of Kos to both the university and Erskine House at the City Hospital where it continues to thrive to this day. In fact, in , the Erskine House Tree was nominated and won the Woodland Trust’s Tree of the Year competition. In turn, Dr James Douglas, former consultant Nephrologist at Belfast City Hospital, took several cuttings from the Erskine House Tree and these have now matured into saplings ready to be transferred to the New Le Gardens across Northern Ireland. Outside of Derry, other gardens can be found at Kiltonga in Newtonards and at Botanic Gardens in Belfast next door to Queen’s University. Patron of Northern Ireland Kidney Patients, Eamonn Holmes said of the tree at Belfast City Hospital being named tree of the year: “The Erskine House Tree means many things to many dferent people throughout the world, especially the transplant family. I am delighted that the tree has received prestigious accolade and will forever remain a symbol of the ‘Gt of Le’ and a representation of our brave organ donors.” According to the Department of Health, around  people are waiting for an organ transplant, and sadly, around  people die each year while on the waiting list. If you want to add your name to the NHS Organ Donor Register you can either register online at the Organ Donation NI website at https:www.organdonationni.info  or telephone    . A lesser known option is the possibility of becoming a living donor and the most common type in this respect is kidney donation. This takes place when one kidney is removed from a healthy person and transplanted into someone , often a relative. Quite rightly, the NHS point out that this is a major decision to make and everyone who comes forward undergoes a thorough assessment. All live donors and recipients are reviewed by an independent assessor who makes sure there is no pressure or coercion involved and that all parties understand the risks of complications. To make the distinction, the Organ Donor Register is only for those who wish to donate after death – to become a living donor, you must contact a transplant centre directly. The Living Donation Kidney Transplant Team can be contacted at Belfast City Hospital also on    . The team have also released a strategy paper on live kidney donation which can be viewed at https:www.odt.nhs.uk odt-structures-and-standards key-strategies living-donor-transplantation-strategy- . The annual service of remembrance organised by the Altnagelvin Renal Support Group, including the planting of the Plane tree sapling, takes place this year on Sunday, December  at the New Le Garden, Nailors Row at pm.

Jarvis, who has publicly thanked the Dundalk fans for their support during his two years at Oriel Park, admitted that his desire to be closer to his family is one of the main factors in deciding his next move. “I have been chatting to a few teams,” he admitted. “Im  with a young family so I want to move closer to home. “Living away from my family and travelling up and down to Dundalk was hard. I have to take all that into consideration.“Ive chatted to Paddy McCourt but nothing has been finalised. I have had deeper discussions with other teams and Derry are still in the pack.“ I remember at the start of last year Deckygot in contact with me. I was in his plans then. Tiernanat Larne was the same last year as well, and even before I signed with Dundalk, but it all still has to be decided.”Still only , Jarvis has won more than many players manage in a career, but he is still hungry for more success, and his continued ambition is something which must be matched by his next club.“One of the main reasons I left Derry was because I thought I had a better chance of winning stuff,” he admitted. “I went down there and I couldnt ask for any more because Ive won everything available in the past two years so it was a good decision from that point of view.“The whole standard of the group and inidually was high. “Everyone was always trying to push on knowing that we were trying to win the league at the start of each year. We wanted to win everything. “Last year we started out looking to win the treble and we were a penalty shoot-out away from that. “Wherever I go next Ill be looking for the same standard. It might not be the heights of Dundalk because the last two years it has been unbelievable but wherever I go Ill be pushing to do the same and hopefully using my experience to help the group.”First team footballJarvis admits he is in no hurry to make his mind up, but first team football, something he constantly battled for at Dundalk, is another key factor whichever team he chooses.“The end of last season didnt go as planned,” he stated. “At the start of the season I was in the team and playing well and hoping to kick on - wherever I go I want to be playing every week, and do my best to start every week and thats not going to change.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The property also benefits from an integral garage.A key feature of the island is the direct road access to the mainland via Castle Island Road and onto Strangford Road which connects Strangford with Downpatrick.The new owners will share the island with Quoile Yacht Club, which offers some of the finest facilities in Strangford Lough, and the Quoile Pondage Nature Reserve and Bird Hide.The enclosed garden and grounds at the house extend to . acres and slope from the house to Castle Island Road and include manicured lawns and mature trees which provide shelter and amenity. There is also a small gravel area next to the house with trees and shrubs.An extensive block of farmland lies within a perimeter fence and is well suited for the grazing of livestock and production of silage hay.Estate agents Osborne King say that while nestled in private surroundings, the island conveniently lies a short distance from several towns including Downpatrick.While there is an abundance of amenities on the island including wildle, and sporting opportunities, there are also plenty of interest points nearby, including Castle Ward and Delamont Country Park.Gavin Clarke, from Osborne King, says the property has been on the market for over a week and is already generating interest from potential buyers.ldquoThis delightful property would make an ideal second home or, alternatively, a main family residence, given its tranquil location and magnicent views, with the Mournes to one side and Strangford on the other, he said.ldquoThe current owners have lived there for around  years and while they are very sorry to see it go, they look forward to seeing others benefit from it. The bungalow is ready to walk into as it has been well maintained down through the years.Gavin added: ldquoWith a couple of viewings in the pipeline, it would be nice to sell this side of Christmas.Further information is available from the Osborne King office, Donegal Square South, Belfast on    or email property@osborneking..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Businesswoman.jpg","title":"Businesswomen mentor Assumption students  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH students have taken part in their first management programme that promotes womenrsquos capacity for leadership.Over  sixth form girls at Assumption Grammar School spent the day recently shadowing female leaders in a range of industries including financial services, recruitment, law, media, construction and health, last month.SistersIN Female Leadership Programme, was launched this year to help foster girlsrsquo confidence in leadership roles.Organisers say it gave those taking part an opportunity to work alongside a female mentor at CEO, director or partner level across several trades in which women continue to be underrepresented at the top.Projects and communications assistant Hannah Magorrian said: ldquoAfter spending the day with mentors, the students develop their leadership skills in school, leading initiatives including mental health, peer mentoring, photography, sport, music, drama, debating, literacy, creative writing, religion and coding.ldquoThe school hopes these pupil-led initiatives will provide a legacy that benefits the whole school and wider community.ldquoIn line with the ethos at the heart of Assumption Grammar School, the pupils have already spent time with female leaders in local charities.She continued: ldquoThe school is currently working with its sister Assumption schools in South Africa to develop a parallel initiative with the aim of empowering African girls to become future leaders.ldquoThis global aspect of the SistersIN programme is reaching out to a country where females are vastly underrepresented at senior management and executive levels.The SistersIN Female Leadership Programme is being piloted in Assumption Grammar School this year, in association with Women in Business.Pupils will have two further leadership experience days, working with female leaders, on February  and June  when they will gain a dferent experience of leadership from one of over  partner industries..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Celebration.jpg","title":"Celebration time for Aughlisnafin  ","story":"AUGHLISNAFIN GAC held their annual presentations and dinner in the Burrendale Hotel last Saturday evening with Armagh and Crossmaglen Rangers legend Oisin McConville as the special guest.Major awards were as follows: seniors mdash managerrsquos player of the year, Donagh Steele managerrsquos sportsperson, Sean Fitzsimmons playersrsquo player, Donagh Steele.Minors mdash managerrsquos player, Morgan Croskery managerrsquos sportsperson, Peter OrsquoHare playersrsquo player, Ben Ogle.Senior players Oran Flanagan and Oisin OrsquoToole, received a commemorative league winners shield, on behalf of the squad, which has the names of every player and the management team engraved on it.The senior  and management team were also presented with league and championship medals and the minors were presented with their All County league medals.There were two recipients of the club person of the year award mdash chairperson Sheena Murray in recognition of an outstanding first term in her role and also Gerard Lenaghan in his role as coaching officer and PRO.The final award of the evening was presented to club vice-chairperson and senior player Rory Murphy in recognition of his outstanding contribution over the past  years.Oisin McConville was then invited to say a few words and spoke well with excellent advice for the future and encouraging rank and file members to put their shoulders to the wheel.There is much to do in a growing club and help is vital to sustain the clubrsquos development.

Many from Kilmegan and the surrounding areas tragically paid the ultimate price on a foreign field and are remembered in the book.Chapters on the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, the Troubles, the loyalist and IRA ceasefires and the Good Friday Agreement take the history of the parish into the modern age.Hundreds of hours of painstaking work researching historical documents and the archives of local newspapers, including those of the Down Recorder, were involved in the production of this book which will undoubtedly be regarded as an important point of reference for current and future generations.In a typically noble and generous gesture the Kilmegan and Maghera Historical Group have decided proceeds from the sale of the book will go to the Childrenrsquos Heartbeat Trust.Copies are now on sale at Walkersrsquo newsagents and JRrsquos Discount Stores, Castlewellan, with details of further points of sale on the Grouprsquos Facebook page, Kilmegan Maghera..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Jasmine.jpg","title":"Jasmine\u0027s first Christmas without a home  ","story":"JASMINE Carbery is one of the many unseen homeless people in Northern Ireland.She looks like any other young woman you may notice walking along Market Street in Downpatrick mdash bright, full of le and full of chat.Yet, at the young age of , she will spend Christmas at the Simon Community house in Saul Street away from her family for the first time.She moved into Saul Street in August after staying in the Newry Simon Community hostel a few months before that.Jasmine is one of three young women living in the Saul Street house. So far she is doing well and enjoying her new le in Downpatrick.Jasmine was asked her to leave her home earlier this year. Her parents have not been in her le for some time.ldquoLiving in Downpatrick is alright. Irsquove actually made a few friends outside the hostel which makes me happy, said Jasmine.ldquoThere was a breakdown in the family relationship. I was working but then I needed to have some serious surgery on the back of my neck and I wasnrsquot able to work. Thatrsquos what led to the breakdown and I was asked to leave.What Jasmine says next is said in a calm, non-emotive manner.ldquoBecause I hadnrsquot been working, I didnrsquot have much money to contribute to the house. Also because I have two rare medical conditions, I had been on preion painkillers for them for over a year now. Irsquom actually addicted to them. It was probably another factor in why I was asked to leave.Jasmine was born with whatrsquos known as a Chiari malformation, a condition in which brain tissue extends into the spinal canal as well as Syringomyeli, another condition where a cyst or cavity forms in the spinal canal.Her recent surgery was to correct the growth of her brain into the top of her spine.She adds: ldquoWhile I was living in Craigavon, I was going out with a guy who was a drug dealer but I had never taken drugs before that. When I became homeless, I started taking drugs, mainly cocaine and tablets, as they were all around me.ldquoI suppose itrsquos a bit of an escape as well as many people see homelessness as rock bottom. But the prescription painkiller addiction would be my biggest problem and I suffer really badly with my mental health.Jasmine relationship with her relatives is still fragile, although there has been some infrequent communication between them.Living in a hostel has had some high and low points for her.ldquoSimon Community hostels are used as bail hostels but they are not exclusive to just prisoners, she said. ldquoI have never been in jail, never been arrested and would be classed as a vulnerable person.ldquoYou donrsquot really know who you are living with in a hostel as therersquos all sorts of people. That makes you more apprehensive.ldquoMy experience is that there have been predominantly male residents in the two hostels I have lived in. I was the only girl in about - fellas in the Newry hostelrsquos main building, so that took a bit of getting used to and was quite scary. Here is smaller, so itrsquos not as bad.ldquoBut the staff are amazing here. They go above and beyond their job description for you. They will sit and talk with you, watch the TV with you, play a board game, cook for us, everything we need.Jasmine left school at  with some qualications and has been told she is bright, but she has not been able to complete other educational courses, mostly due to her medical condition.However, she has recently been working with the human rights charity, Participation and the Practice of Rights, to help others know their entitlement in seeking social housing.She is being supported in the hostel for her problems and will be soon working with an Community Addiction worker.Jasmine has some goals for the New Year ahead which she hopes to achieve, again with the support of the Simon Community team.ldquoI would love to get my own place, thatrsquos my number one priority, she said. ldquoI would like not to be taking drugs and I also would like to reconnect with my family and get back into some education..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Lecale.jpg","title":"Lecale and Downe Historical Society launches annual publication  ","story":"THE Lecale and Downe Historical Society launched its th annual journal at the Down County Museum last week.Lecale Review No , has proved to be another excellent mix of compelling articles of local interest, published just in time for Christmas.The latest annual charters the history of one of the oldest racecourses in the world outside Downpatrick.The story penned by Joan Magee, lsquoHorse Racing At the Flying Horsersquo tells how a handful of gentry held a horse race around  but little  is known of the occasion.Within  years, the Earl of Ardglass and other noblemen petitioned King James II to set up a Royal Corporation of Horse Breeders within the county.All its members were to be known as Freemen and it had the power to meet in Downpatrick or some other Co Down town every Tuesday of Easter week.As well as having permission to race, the corporation was also permitted to hold a horse fair too.Joan explains that a race transpired at the Flying Horse, Downpatrick, on March ,  and is especially signicant as this race marked the beginning of what is one of the earliest flat racing courses in the world.The winner was Colonel Byerley, who fought at the Battle of the Boyne four months later against the platersquos donor ndash King James II.Another interesting article written by Colm Rooney charts the history of cinema within Downpatrick.Colm reveals that while Belfast had over two dozen cinemas, Downpatrick finally welcomed its first, the Pavilion Picture Theatre in St Patrickrsquos Avenue, at a glitzy opening ceremony on Wednesday June , .It was a huge event for local entrepreneur, Downpatrick man, William Tweedie who watched as locals queued up to pay over one shilling to see the Prisoner of Zenda, the first movie ever shown in the cinema.The cinema later moved to Market Street in the early s with the Breen family taking over the running of the business around , which ran until the s.Another article, Downpatrick by Gaslight, written by Andy Gilmore, reflects on the journey of natural gas over the centuries in Downpatrick.Andy points out that the use of town gas in Ireland dates back to  when gas for lighting streets and homes began to be produced from coal.However, it wasnrsquot until , and a concerted effort by the townsfolk that led to the foundation of a gas company that brought the energy source to Downpatrick.A site on Market Street was agreed for the gasworks in  and it opened later that year.

Furthermore, it has only been extracted from them reluctantly at a press conference and does not form part of their manesto.Letter to the editorIt would therefore be helpful and provide reassurance to the many vulnerable people — not least retired RUC officers and victims groups —the DUP was to confirm clearly what they will not accept in any legacy bill and what they will dothe bill proceeds as planned. Calling for unspecied “substantial changes” to the bill will not suffice when the new government on the advice of the Northern Ireland Office will press for rapid legislative implementation with minimum media interest..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Previously the DUP complained confusingly that, “It would be an overhaul of established practice for civilians to be pursued for alleged disciplinary matters as public servants, when retired or deceased”. At the same time, they unwisely suggested collusion should be defined in law despite many existing offences being available. We need clarity not vagueness.None the less this is indeed a radical and welcome departure from the party’s near silence and non-engagement with critics, but the question remains as to why it has taken the DUP so long to arrive at this position, and just how committed they really are to it, given their longstanding support for the Historical Investigations Unitin some form and the Stormont House legacy arrangements.Indeed the main legal adviser on the DUP side was Emma Little Pengelly and she must now resile openly from support for the HIU in either a local or the suggested UK form.That said, it is now time for the secretary of state — post the election — to review the position with regard to legacy. The Ulster Unionist Party will be asking for the whole bill to be set aside by the new government and a full review of legacy policy and of the relentless lawfare in our courts instead, so that we can thwart the rewriting of history, and agree on a process that is truly balanced, proportionate, transparent, fair and equitable.Jeff Dudgeon, UUP human rights campaigner, former councillor©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

The lights were such a let down.”.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Kirsty Bridges added: “At first we thought one half didn’t turn on properly only to realise that was it. Honestly, would be safer turning them off, so embarrassing ”Fiona Edgar agreed. “Its a disgrace” she said, adding that the council does not even supply a tree but just puts light on “an old Yew tree” in the town centre. “Kids were asking why no lights all over [the tree]” she added.Dozens of people said they were amazed at the contrast between the attractive council Christmas trees in Newcastle and Warrenpoint by comparison.UUP Councillor Harold McKee said: “Is this the worst council Christmas tree in Northern Ireland  I have got over  comments on Facebook about it. It is obviously a cost cutting exercise Kilkeel got £k for a tree where Newcastle got £k for theirs.” After representations from the Chamber of Commerce, he had raised the impending problem repeatedly since October , but to no avail, he said.Kilkeel Chamber of Commerce said it has been advised the council will erect a new tree this week. Newry, Mourne and Down District Council said it “recognises the disappointment” and is “moving forward with a solution”.“For a number of years it has been the preference of the local community to light up a large pine tree in Kilkeel as its Christmas tree,” it said in a statement. “As the tree has grown over the years this has become increasingly dficult to light in a way which represents the traditional Christmas tree shape. “Newry, Mourne and Down District Council managed to do this last year but this involved placing the sets of lights in such a way that they were exposed to signicant movement during windy conditions, resulting in the lights breaking and requiring a lot of repair during the festive season.“The Council spent £ on these lights last year and at the end of the season they were in such a poor condition that they could no longer be used.Michelle ONeill: Form a just and sustainable powersharing administratrionLame donkey Brexit must be reconsidered, Alliance Leader Naomi Long says Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“This year Council staff carried the lights along the main branches so that they would not be subject to the same level of movement. The Council recognises the disappointment felt by local residents and has agreed an alternative solution with local councillors.”The council will install a nine metre “cut” Christmas tree at the lower square before this weekend, it added.try catch  TrendingPost-mortem findings revealed after tragic death of -year-old girl in NI riverLarne: Emergency services converge on river in major operationTeenage girldies after going into river in NI town last night -

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But right now, more and more people in the Vale are being forced to our food bankrsquos doors.ldquoThis isnrsquot right.ldquoWhile our help is needed, wersquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community without enough money for food are able to access emergency support.ldquoOur vital work in the community has only been possible because of the incredible generosity shown by local people who have donated food, time and funds.ldquoThank you.The Vale Foodbank is particularly in need of UHT milk, fruit juice, tinned meat, and tinned vegetables.The charity has asked for festive donations to be donated in early December at the latest, to ensure volunteers have enough time to process and distribute these donations to people before Christmas. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.

We now come to Portadown with confidence and able to play free-flowing football on the attack.“The club has come on leaps and bounds in my two or three seasons here, not just in terms of players but across the pitch, behind the scenes and the backroom staff.“The club has developed so much on and off the pitch too, including bringing better personnel to the club so that, in turn, should lead to greater results.“So much work has been put in overall and now we are leaving places like Portadown disappointed not to have our just rewards.“We’ve played better and a couple of inidual mistakes cost us but today was certainly our best performance of the past few games.“The players gave everything, inidually and collectively.“It’s a long season and the luck we maybe had at the early stage of the season is not with us at the minute but will hopefully come back.“Peter Campbell was outstanding, Nathaniel Ferris fantastic and Jordan Gibson running things in midfield.“I think Peter is the best player in this league and he’s added goals now to his pace and all-round game.“He’s invaluable, with a great attitude on and off the pitch, and I’m sure he will go on to play at a higher level.“He came to us from Portadown and has developed here season-on-season, with that physical strength now added to Peter’s other attributes.”\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"substitute aaron duke aiming build derby boost portadown ","story":"These are the warning symptoms of flu and norovirus parents need to know - and how to stop the viruses spreadingKeady baby death | Rest with the angels baby Hunter -  month old baby Hunter McGleenan was cherished by mumNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsSubstitute Aaron Duke aiming to build on derby boost for PortadownAaron Duke is hoping to turn  memorable minutes into a long-term spot in the starting line-up thanks to his match-defining introduction off the weekend substitutes’ bench.By The NewsroomFriday, th November , : pm\" enjoys his successful substitute appearance for Portadown against Loughgall.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed.

Deloitte has confirmed that Bamford Bus Company Limited, a company which is led by industrialist Jo Bamford, has agreed a deal to buy the business and assets of Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited and Metallix Limited “The deal also includes an option to acquire the international ision of Wright Group Limited.” However, it remains unclear how many of the , jobs could be saved. Bamford Bus Company says it is “currently determining the size and composition of the workforce required for its future plans, but the  staff retained by the joint administrators have transferred to Bamford Bus Company”. Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were last month appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Meanwhile, in a separate deal, Jans Composites Limited has also agreed the purchase of Wright Composites Limited for an undisclosed sum. “Three staff members who were retained by the joint administrators, have transferred with the business. The purchaser is currently determining the size and the composition of the workforce it requires going forward.\" Peter Allen, joint administrator, said: “We are delighted to have reached a deal with Bamford Bus Company to secure the future of the business in Ballymena.  After making extensive efforts to find a buyer, we are confident the new owner represents a bright future for a key employer in Northern Ireland.” Jo Bamford says that \"Wrightbus is a proud family business which is part of the fabric of Northern Ireland le and business\". \"I am delighted to acquire such an established and respected brand. We can now start to look to the future and build on the excellent work that Sir William Wright and his family have done to develop the Wrightbus business. \"We will now begin speaking with customers and suppliers over the coming weeks in order to take a closer look at the financial situation that Wrightbus faces in order to build a viable and sustainable business.\" Mr Bamford will serve as executive chairman of Wrightbus and Buta Atwal becomes chief executive Mr Atwal said: \"As bus transportation looks to decarbonise, there is growing demand for market leaders in this field. Wrightbus has the potential to lead the way in this area given its track record in manufacturing state of the art zero emission hydrogen buses as well as electric and hybrid models. We must now focus on that opportunity and work hard as a team to move forward and rebuild this great business. Recruitment will begin over the coming weeks and we are very excited about the prospect of recruiting a world class calibre of people to the business.\"View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/WEB2.jpg","title":"danske bank the top team shaping the future","story":"Posted on Tuesday November  by Ulster Business Kevin Kingston, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett speak to John Mulgrew Danske Bank has made a big move in creating two deputy chief executiveroles to help boost business, engagement and further bolster a strong public face for the organisation. Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/buil1.jpg","title":"nine storey office scheme for belfast city centre","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew A new proposed nine-storey office building in the heart of Belfast city centre could house up to  workers once completed, Ulster Business can reveal. There are now plans to build the grade A office building at Victoria Street. It would see the current Chancery House building knocked down to make way for the development. In , the building was sold off in excess of its guide price of £.m following a competitive bidding process. Chancery House, which is located on the edge of Belfast’s Law Courts and opposite Victoria Square Shopping Centre, was purchased by a local private developer. The fresh planning application has been made by Chancery House Investments Ltd, which includes Northern Ireland businessman Darren Donnelly as a director. Its being designed by Todd Architects alongside planning consultancy Turley. The building would include more than , sq ft of grade A office space, and those behind it have said it “would assist in addressing an identied need in the marketplace for small office floor plates to primarily serve indigenous businesses which are expanding and want a city centre business location”. It also says the design of the development “has been carefully formulated and responds to the immediate context of the site and its surrounding”. “The proposals improve the setting of the Old Town Hall and define its location with a building which adds vibrancy to this important nodal point”. A design statement says the development could accommodate between - office workers. Speaking at the time of the sale of Chancery House, Neil McShane, director at Lambert Smith Hampton, who the sale process, said: “Chancery House represented a unique opportunity in that it is an income-producing investment property with exciting development prospects. The prime location and secure tenant means that it will continue to perform well as an office investment but,redeveloped, will attract signicant interest from potential occupiers.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
