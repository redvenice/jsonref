But the monarch is highly regarded as the guardian of Islam and Malay tradition, particularly among the ethnic Malay Muslim majority.The king is the nominal head of the government and armed forces. All laws, Cabinet appointments and the dissolution of Parliament for general elections require his assent. The king also issues pardons for criminals. Malaysia\u0027s Constitution allocates some 5 million ringgit (£930,000) a year for the expenses of the king and his household, including palace maintenance, although the sum can be increased with Cabinet approval."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/24/11/057103B10000044D-6626775-image-m-71_1548328942517.jpg","title":"Venezuela rises end President Maduros dictatorship","story":"    Lighting a fire: A masked demonstrator in Caracas holds bottles as a fire burns in the street during mass protests yesterday, which saw an opposition leader declare himself President and seven people killed in violence across the country   Rivals: Juan Guaido (left), President of Venezuela\u0027s National Assembly, who has declared himself the country\u0027s interim President, and current leader Nicolas Maduro (right), who has vowed to fight on and hit back at Donald Trump          Huge crowds: Opposition supporters carry letters to form the word \u0027Democracy\u0027 at the huge rally in Caracas where Juan Guaido, President of Venezuela\u0027s National Assembly, declared himself interim leader           Eruption of violence: A demonstrator throws back a gas canister in Caracas while clashing with security forces during a rally against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro\u0027s government          Violence in the streets: Demonstrators hurl objects at riot police as tear gas fills the streets of Caracas amid nationwide protests yesterday which have left the country in crisis       Showdown in Venezuela: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warns...Ivanka tells Venezuelan opposition trying to topple Maduro...Share this articleVenezuela\u0027s defence minister warned that the top military leadership would come out on Thursday \u0027in support of the constitutional president\u0027. Trump\u0027s announcement has also put him at odds with China, as Beijing - which has given Venezuela $65billion in loans and investment - called for Washington to stay out of the crisis. China \u0027opposes the interference (in) Venezuelan affairs by external forces,\u0027 the foreign ministry said.     Maduro is also a strong ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad, whose government today condemned a \u0027flagrant intervention\u0027 by the United States.           Lighting a fire: A protester burns a motorcycle during clashes with the security forces in a protest against the government of President Nicolas Maduro          Turning point: Juan Guaido holds up a copy of the Venezuelan constitution as he declares himself the country\u0027s interim leader          Hugo Chavez at the UN in 2006 where he called Bush \u0027the devil\u00272002: Chavez is briefly toppled by a coup before returning to power.

This photograph was taken by Gijsbert Hanekroot, the Netherlands\u0027 premier rock photographer at the time, who said that Bowie was his favourite musician to work with. On one occasion in 1971, Hankeroot told of how he bumped into Bowie in a canteen while he was working on lyrics for Ziggy Stardust and asked his opinion on one of the lines          Bob Dylan photographed at Madison Square Garden in New York, 1974. Hankeroot managed to inset himself in the midst of a heady time in both music and culture, living the rockstar lifestyle by proxy as he flew all over the world to photograph its biggest stars. \u0027We saw The Eagles in London, Paul McCartney in south of France, Bob Dylan in New York and the Stones in Hamburg. We visited London every two months. It was the most natural thing in the world,\u0027 he said          John Lennon and Yoko Ono photographed in Selfridges on Oxford Street in 1971. Hankeroot was best-known for working in low-light settings, such as concert halls and music venues, so this is one of his rarer daylight shots. He used darkroom techniques that lent a grainy texture to the pictures he took, which is particularly visible on the faces of his subjects          Keith Richards, of the Rolling Stones, smoke a cigarette somewhere in Belgium, 1976. Hankeroot was recognised for his talent in his own time, working for Dutch magazine Oort, but he left the field of music photography in the 80s and his work has gone ingored. But he is now opening a new show in Hong Kong to display a retrospective of his works          Lou Reed lights a cigarette in Amsterdam, 1972. Hankeroot liked to spend as much time as possible with his subjects, staying the full length of their set if they were playing, or \u0027until the subject was bored of me\u0027, if they were in a studio. \u0027That\u0027s the moment that he or she would stop acting or posing, those often became the best pictures,\u0027 he said  Neil Young slumps on a sofa in his hotel  in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1976 (left) while Patti Smith poses during a photo shoot in Amsterdam, exact date unknown (right). Hankeroot tried to embody the same spirit of reinvention and innovation that the musicians put into their songs in his photography, searching for new way to capture and define the seminal decade in art          Leonard Cohen, photographed on a cobbled street among pigeons, somewhere in Amsterdam in 1974.  Hankeroot was deeply embedded in the musical culture of the 1970s, by the time the following decade rolled around he decided to pursue \u0027other adventures\u0027, and now works mostly as a street photographer and documentary-maker          Frank Zappa photographed in Amsterdam in 1972. Though Hankeroot was born in Brussels, in neighbouring Belgium, he grew up in the Netherlands where he was given his first camera aged 13. At 16 he dropped out of school to pursue photography full-time and got an internship with Philip Mechanicus, where he learned to take portraits          Bryan Ferry at the Amstel Hotel in Amsterdam, 1976. At the time, Ferry had just released Let\u0027s Stick Together, his first solo album since Roxy Music disbanded for the first time earlier the same year. He would release In Your Mind the following year and The Bride Stripped Bare the year after that before Roxy Music reformed          Photographers crowd around Mick Jagger, who is behind the camera in the shot, as they try to get a picture of him in Hamburg, Germany, in 1970          Hankeroot began digitising his archives years ago which led to the publication of Abba...

Shepherd smiled for the camera today. Ignoring the jury\u0027s verdict that he was responsible for the safety of the boat and those on board, he said: \u0027It\u0027s very upsetting to read these lies in the newspaper\u0027His lawyers at Tuckers Solicitors, which has offices around the country, were in communication with their client all along.Under client confidentiality rules, they were not in a position to help Scotland Yard find him and repeatedly stressed they didn\u0027t know where he was in any case.Not that the Metropolitan Police covered themselves in glory either. Officers, it emerged, were tipped off that Shepherd had fled to Georgia more than six months ago yet did nothing.The Georgian authorities invited their British counterparts to belatedly join the hunt for the killer, who is believed to have entered the country after disappearing nearly a year ago, but the offer wasn\u0027t taken up.Charlotte\u0027s family met Home Secretary Sajid Javid this week and he vowed to \u0027strain every sinew\u0027 to catch him.That meeting followed a campaign by the Daily Mail which put up a £25,000 reward to bring Shepherd to justice.          Shepherd zigzagged across the water at almost twice the speed limit of 12 knots. Sometime before midnight, the speedboat (pictured) hit a submerged log near Wandsworth Bridge and capsizedLet us remind you of the circumstances surrounding Charlotte\u0027s death on December 9, 2015, to explain why we took that decision.It was Shepherd\u0027s first date with Charlotte, who must have been more than a little impressed by the dashing, well-spoken man wining and dining her at the glamourous Oblix restaurant on the 32nd floor of the The Shard skyscraper at London Bridge.What Charlotte could not have known was that womanising Shepherd wasn\u0027t interested in romance, or even having a relationship with her or anyone else. He was a predator who had wined and dined up to ten other young women shortly before they met.Charlotte, an English literature graduate and business consultant, agreed to his suggestion that, after leaving the Oblix, they should take taxi back to his place – a houseboat on the Thames at Hammersmith, West London.  Jack Shepherd looks a different man after his time on the run. Pictured left: at the Old Bailey in 2016. Right: speaking in Georgia after his re-arrest todayMoored outside was a 14ft Fletcher Arrowflyte speedboat with a supply of champagne, for a late night, drink-fuelled spin along the river – purchased, he would later admit to detectives, to \u0027pull women\u0027.The boat was a death trap. The craft\u0027s kill cord (which is used to cut the engine if the driver becomes incapacitated) had been disconnected, the life jackets were tucked away out of reach, and the steering was faulty. Shepherd knew all this he knew that his boat was an accident waiting to happen.Still, he zigzagged across the water at almost twice the speed limit of 12 knots (14mph). And let us not forget that he had already been warned twice before by the river police about speeding. But, as we have already stated, arrogance was one of Shepherd\u0027s defining characteristics.‘I am thankful for Mariano’s support’: President Trump...Share this articleSometime before midnight, the speedboat hit a submerged log near Wandsworth Bridge and capsized. What happened next, you might think, also revealed another aspect of his character.Shepherd called out from the water for someone to \u0027help me\u0027 – not \u0027help us\u0027.Apparently Shepherd, a web designer, was still slurring his words for hours afterwards.Charlotte herself was eventually pulled from the water and died in hospital. She never regained consciousness after the accident.Due to the complexities of the case, the investigation was passed from Wandsworth CID to Scotland Yard\u0027s Homicide and Serious Crime Command.It wasn\u0027t until September 2017 that Shepherd, who had met Charlotte online, was charged with her death. He denied manslaughter and was granted unconditional bail. Then, after attending three preliminary hearings, he absconded.Charlotte\u0027s devastated family knew nothing of this until the eve of the trial, which went ahead without him in July 2018. Her mother Roz Wickens, 43, a council careline operator, expressed what everything else was thinking: \u0027There has got to be someone harbouring him, either financially or otherwise. He has got support.\u0027I don\u0027t think he\u0027s able to do this on his own.\u0027The public might now find out if that was indeed the case. He took out loans of at least £50,000 before he fled and has failed to pay back a single penny.Perhaps it is no surprise to learn that Shepherd is also facing trial for grievous bodily harm after being accused of glassing a barman, which makes the decision to grant him Legal Aid all the more astonishing.Typical of his heartless behaviour was the fact that he also married his wife – who lives in Wales with their baby son – only two months after the speedboat tragedy.Shepherd grew up in Paignton, Devon, with two younger sisters and a brother.His orced father, who worked as a product control administrator, was 40 at the time of his birth and had already fathered five children from previous relationships. His mother, 26 at the time, was a sales assistant.          Charlotte Brown, who died aged 24, on a date on a speedboat with Jack Shepherd on the Thames in 2015The couple ran a health food shop in nearby Totnes and kept what is said to have been a chaotic household (\u0027the parents were hippy-dippy types who never properly punished their kids\u0027, says one acquaintance).They split up when Shepherd was a teenager.Extremely \u0027arrogant\u0027 (that word again) is how his old teacher Richard Pennell remembers him. \u0027He thought he was better than everyone else,\u0027 he said. \u0027Despite our best efforts we weren\u0027t able to help him behave better.\u0027Since then much more has come to light about Shepherd.After leaving school in 2005, he did not go to university but went instead to London to pursue a career in IT.In 2013 he incorporated a web development company (named JSS Web after his initials). But it was struck off the register six months later without ever having filed accounts.He created a second software business, JS Digital, in 2014, again as the sole director. But Shepherd also had another, less respectable, business. He was behind a website called Dating In Kent which claimed to have more than 7,000 members and offered its users advice on \u0027how to impress on the first date\u0027. One section read: \u0027First dates should supply a window into the excitement and joy you can offer your partner, so never be afraid to think outside the box to ensure that your name is the first on your lover\u0027s lips.\u0027Another website linked to Shepherd, allegedly with 1,000 members, included a \u0027newbie\u0027s guide to no-strings sex\u0027.This is surely what he was trying to accomplish on his first – and only date – with Charlotte.This will be why he took her to the swish Oblix restaurant, an establishment which combines \u0027sophisticated, urban dining\u0027 with spectacular views over the capital. Sadly for Charlotte, it was all part of his cynical seduction routine.She had met Shepherd on an unconnected dating website. The pair had been exchanging messages for about four weeks before their fateful date.Haunting video footage retrieved from Charlotte\u0027s smartphone from that night shows the flickering lights of the capital reflected in the water as they speed along the river. Charlotte can be heard exclaiming: \u0027Oh my god, you\u0027re going so fast.\u0027Four months before the speedboat tragedy (at a time when Shepherd must have been dating his future wife), a young woman called Clare Hyam posted an image of herself \u0027drinking champers\u0027 on his boat near the Houses of Parliament.Meanwhile, several mysteriously anonymous Twitter accounts have sprung up on social media to defend Shepherd. One recently claimed that he \u0027loves\u0027 his son and is \u0027missing his family, too\u0027.Of course nothing can match the anguish and anger of poor Charlotte\u0027s family, who spoke yesterday to the BBC\u0027s Victoria Derbyshire show.Her father Graham Brown, a civil servant, told the programme: \u0027Our family do feel let down by the criminal justice system because Jack Shepherd was able to flout the law and unfortunately our daughter lost her life.\u0027His absence from trial while on unconditional bail, and just how easy it was to abscond, has surely got to be a concern.\u0027I don\u0027t know whether it\u0027s the police, the Crown Prosecution Service, the clunky justice system – but something is not right.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"WHSmith stockpiling notebooks diaries pens no deal Brexit","story":"    WHSmith said it would be stockpiling six months worth of supplies which it would usually import from AsiaHigh-end fashion retailer Joules also reiterated its hard-Brexit contingency plans yesterday, after outlining them last month.The company is setting up a third-party warehouse on the continent to serve wholesale custom-ers in the EU, which will be up and running by April.Joules has also arranged for early deliveries of its spring-summer collection and boosted its for-eign currency holdings to protect the business from a potentially volatile pound.High Street chain Karen Millen swoops in to buy assets of...Share this articleIt said it is also: ‘Evaluating and preparing for increased administrative activities such as export documentation.’Burberry, the luxury fashion house, warned that a no-deal Brexit would be ‘complex’ and could cost the firm tens of millions of pounds in added expenses.Julie Brown, finance chief at the FTSE 100 company, predicted in a trading update to the City yesterday that crashing out of the EU without a deal ‘would be complex to manage’.Any disruption to supply chains would impact how fast Burberry could deliver its clothing lines to retailers.

Extradition between Georgia and the UK is governed by the 1957 European Convention on Extradition. It is too early to say how long this process will take. \u0027Were he to consent to his return he could be back in the UK in a matter of weeks but in the event that he contests his extradition the matter could take a considerable period of time. \u0027It would naturally be wrong to comment on the specifics of any possible bars to extradition he might raise and it is important that the Georgian process is allowed to take its course. However, given the high profile nature of the case and the direct involvement of the Home Secretary himself, it is clear that the UK authorities will be putting all their resources and energy in securing a speedy resolution to the matter.\u0027  On Wednesday a heavily-bearded Shepherd smiled as he walked into the station some 2,000 miles away while flanked by lawyers.He vowed to local reporters he would clear his name over the \u0027tragic accident\u0027.Ms Brown\u0027s father, Graham Brown, celebrated the \u0027overwhelming\u0027 development, writing on Facebook: \u0027Justice for Charlotte is close!\u0027\u0027My opinions towards Jack Shepherd is that he\u0027s a very crass, reckless man, who managed to abscond and stick two fingers up at the judiciary,\u0027 Mr Brown told BBC Radio 5 Live.\u0027He\u0027s got to come back to atone for all that and I think that he\u0027s done the right thing and thank goodness he\u0027s realised that now and handed himself in.\u0027Ms Brown, from Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, died in December 2015 when Shepherd\u0027s boat flipped into the wintry waters of the River Thames in London after they shared a Champagne-fuelled first date.The family of Ms Brown, known to loved ones as Charli, ramped up pressure in recent weeks and renewed their calls for Shepherd to surrender after they met with Home Secretary Sajid Javid on Tuesday.

Shepherd smiled for the camera today.

He certainly shows no remorse.\u0027Miss Brown\u0027s sister Katie told the BBC: \u0027I feel very surprised at how smug he looks to be honest. It just shows a very arrogant man.\u0027I don\u0027t understand how someone can go on the run for two crimes and be found guilty and still then just walk straight in with a very smug look on his face and claim innocence. It\u0027s unbelievable.\u0027Someone who\u0027s run away from this doesn\u0027t scream an innocent man\u0027s actions to me. Why did he run away if he\u0027s claiming innocence?\u0027Shepherd said he said he had chosen \u0027wonderful\u0027 Georgia to flee to because \u0027it was affordable, had generous visa regime and mountains, sea, and it was a country I\u0027d always wanted to visit and I think the culture is very wonderful\u0027.             Charlotte Brown, who died aged 24, on a date on a speedboat with Jack Shepherd on the Thames in 2015Revealing how closely he has been following the Mail\u0027s campaign, he said: \u0027The father met with the Home Secretary in the UK and this is testament to the fact he has some kind of leverage within the system.\u0027It\u0027s also why there has been so much press coverage in the UK. I\u0027ve only spoken to him once but he took the opportunity to tell me I would have a very bad time in prison.\u0027I said, \u0027I\u0027m so sorry Graham\u0027 but he didn\u0027t want to hear it and hung up. I feel at risk from him and his power in the prison system, and that\u0027s the reason I ran away. I blamed myself at the time and said I was very drunk and driving too fast, but an assessment of the facts shows we were actually going below the speed limit. I\u0027m very, very frightened about what might happen, but it seemed like this is the right thing to do. I hope justice will prevail and my appeal will be successful.\u0027At his home in Sidcup, Kent, Mr Brown thanked the Daily Mail for its help in offering a £25,000 reward to catch his daughter\u0027s killer. He said: \u0027It made me cry. That was my emotion. It\u0027s been a long journey. Relieved is a better word – it\u0027s difficult to say I\u0027m delighted when I\u0027ve lost a daughter.\u0027Hopefully Shepherd will come back voluntarily and won\u0027t put any legal obstacles in the way. If he does, more fool him.\u0027Shepherd is acting the victim – he certainly claims he\u0027s an innocent man. But the jury didn\u0027t find him so. If he was so sure of his innocence he should have stayed and faced his trial.\u0027 Mr Brown added: \u0027Not one member of his family has sent any condolences or any expression of remorse.\u0027Additional reporting: Neil SearsAuthorities seek \u0027swift\u0027 extradition of fugitive killer Jack Shepherd after surrender in Georgia - ITV News"},{"url":null,"title":"Sainsburys recalls vegan Freefrom garlic bread traces cheese food","story":"Deliciously Free From Garlic Pizza Bread is being removed from shelves at hundreds of Sainsbury\u0027s stores round Britain because it is too cheesy and could kill peopleThe supermarket have apologised for any inconvenience this may have caused.A spokesman for Sainsbury\u0027s said: \u0027Our supplier has robust processes in place to prevent incidents like this and we\u0027re urgently investigating what went wrong to prevent this from happening again\u0027 added the store.\u0027We are recalling Sainsbury\u0027s Deliciously Free From Garlic Pizza Bread with the use by date 27th January.

Did I sense any regret about the situation he’d left behind? Not really’ This picture has actually lost me a few jobs. Plus I think I might even have lost a flat because of it. I was looking at a property and was chatting to the estate agent and told them that I’d recently shot David Cameron. We put an offer in – for the asking price – but it was turned down. So yes, I do suspect people don’t like David Cameron.But when you shoot someone like Cameron, though, you have to remain neutral. If you turn up thinking too many things then you’ll inevitably forget something, or position the lighting wrong, and the subject will get irritated. You have to go in with clarity. Whether you’re a former prime minister or a bus driver, I’ll always have the same clarity of thought.The photograph came about as part of a project I was working on, aiming to capture interesting faces in the style of artists such as Holbein and Caravaggio. It took place in Cameron’s office, almost exactly one year after his resignation. My degree is in medieval history, and so shooting people who are part of our history like this gives me an excuse to touch history.He arrived in his gym clothing, which was rather funny, and he was worried he looked a bit pasty. I explained my ideas, and about how I wanted to capture this sort of meditative statesman feeling. I wanted a sense of looking backwards at the current political situation.I was worried that Cameron might be a difficult person to photograph, but as a sitter he proved to be a darling. He had a lot of patience. You have to separate politics from the person, and he was a charming chap.I knew the public would be wondering, what is he thinking? That’s why I wanted him in this pose, shot in profile. There are no other pictures of Cameron like this – the others normally capture the signature “call me Dave” look. But now he’s not in power he can afford to show more emotion and try different poses.I do think the contemplation was genuine. I’ve worked with a lot of actors in Los Angeles so I know what faking it looks like. I’ve also worked with many politicians, both Conservative and Labour, and when I ask for a certain look, some of them can turn around instantly with that expression. But David seemed to me a genuine guy, a family man, who had a real sense of the seriousness of office. Did I sense any regret about the situation he’d left behind? Not really.However, I never mentioned the B-word during the half hour we had for the sitting. I decided that wouldn’t have been a good idea. But he seemed very happy to talk about other things throughout his career. He told me that the most interesting place he’d visited was Libya after Gaddafi.I was inspired by Sir James Guthrie, the realist painter who depicted a lot of politicians straight after the first world war. They’d experienced all that horror and history, and he captured that moment. Backdrops are important for me. Guthrie painted in a muddy brown, suggestive of the trenches. I went with a fading blue backdrop. You can interpret that as the European flag fading away, or simply as the blue of Conservatism.I’m a realist photographer so I like to capture everything – the grey hairs, blotchy skin, all the details and lines. I want to say – this was the true image of David Cameron at this moment in history.He’s not the first leader I’ve photographed – I did John Major back in 2017 for another project. When I went to shoot him there was a sense of betrayal there. It was in his mouth, in his breath. But with David there was not that sense. He was energetic, almost raring to go. There was a restlessness I could really sense. I think he wants to return after this Brexit situation is resolved. I think he’ll be back.Born: Chester, 1982.Training: King’s College London.Influences: Caravaggio, Titian, Ribera, HolbeinHigh point: ‘Sir Patrick Stewart portrait sitting, New York.’Low point: ‘Not picking up a camera after I graduated.’Top tip: ‘Direction, direction, direction: break the ice with your subjects.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c59865ac2e69a9dfb1e2e25c65f9527dc4b1cfeb/0_0_1958_2400/master/1958.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1177dc5e9abd763e384851623ad6149d 1320w","title":"airbus brands uk government handling of brexit a disgrace","story":"‘Don’t listen to Brexiters’ madness’ and no deal could mean ‘harmful decisions’ – CEOAirbus has branded the UK government’s handling of Brexit a “disgrace” and warned the aerospace firm could pull out of the UK if the country crashes out of the EU without a deal.In a video message released on Thursday, Tom Enders, the chief executive, warned that if there was a no-deal Brexit, Airbus would have to make “potentially very harmful decisions for the UK”.He added: “Please don’t listen to the Brexiteers’ madness, which asserts that because we have huge plants here we will not move and we will always be here. They are wrong.”The European aerospace group is one of the biggest manufacturers in the UK, where it employs more than 14,000 people. A further 110,000 supply-chain jobs depend on its operations, which have an annual turnover of £6bn.Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, said he took the warning “very seriously”.He told parliament: “What the chief executive and others in the business community are clear on is that they want a deal to avoid the uncertainty of no deal and that is why he is backing the prime minister.”Enders called for a pragmatic withdrawal agreement that allows for an orderly Brexit. Airbus had previously backed Theresa May’s proposed deal, which failed to get a parliamentary majority.The Airbus warning is another blow for the government in a week in which Sir James Dyson, the Brexit-backing billionaire, announced plans to shift his company HQ from Wiltshire to Singapore and Sony confirmed it is moving its European HQ from London to Amsterdam.Enders said: “Of course it’s not possible to pick up and move our large UK factories to other parts of the world immediately. However, aerospace is a long-term business and we could be forced to redirect future investments in the event of a no-deal Brexit and, make no mistake, there are plenty of countries out there who would love to build the wings for Airbus aircraft.”His comments come after previous warnings that Airbus was considering abandoning plans to build new wings in the UK, which would mean thousands of job losses.Airbus manufactures wings for its range of commercial aircraft in Broughton in north Wales, where 6,000 people work, while the design and engineering happens at its Filton site in Bristol, which employs 3,000. Broughton produces more than 1,000 wings a year and even has its own football team nicknamed the Wingmakers, who play in the Cymru Alliance League.Darren Jones, the Labour MP for Bristol North West, tweeted:Ben Bradshaw, the Labour MP for Exeter, tweeted: “Good for @Airbus, telling it as it is. We need more business leaders to be honest \u0026amp truthful about #BrexitShambles. Why it’s vital parliament blocks a crash out no-deal #Brexit next week.”David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham and an outspoken Remain supporter, tweeted: “Airbus has warned it could move wing-building out of the UK because of Brexit. There is no clearer imagery for this national project of self-harm than this. Wings clipped, we will be isolated and alone.”Enders said the UK’s aerospace industry “now stands at a precipice. In a global economy the UK no longer has the capability to go it alone. Brexit is threatening to destroy a century of development based on education, research and human capital.”Unite, Britain’s largest union, said ministers and MPs must stop gambling with the future of UK workers by taking “no deal” off the table.The Unite assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, said: “Tens of thousands of decent well-paid skilled jobs that support families and represent the backbone of communities across the country are caught in the crossfire of a no-deal face-off which could deny future generations the hope and opportunity of high-quality, well-paid apprenticeships into skilled work.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5a5600f5b9eb5a351ac93b193afa009bb9008d2/0_307_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb41509535609f37aad6591a275535ed","title":"coalition of major companies trial reusable packaging for online orders","story":"Under Loop scheme, durable containers will be delivered instead of single-use packagingSeveral of the world’s biggest consumer goods companies are to trial a new scheme of refillable and returnable containers for some of its leading brands in place of their current plastic packaging, which could significantly reduce waste.Under the Loop scheme, customers can make online orders for goods, such as shampoo, washing powder and mouthwash, that normally come in single-use plastic packaging. They will be delivered instead in durable, refillable containers that can be collected from the doorstep and cleaned for reuse.Procter \u0026amp Gamble, Unilever, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, Nestlé and Danone are among the big names signing up to run a pilot scheme.“This is hassle-free and convenient for the consumer,” said Virginie Helias, vice president of global sustainability for Procter \u0026amp Gamble. “You can receive your order within 24 hours and you can return your bottle when empty.”The Loop scheme is run by the recycling company TerraCycle. Key to the scheme is online ordering, which means people do not need to bring their old containers to shops to have them refilled, and fits well with people’s increasing tendency to shop online.Much of the plastic packaging currently used either cannot be recycled or has little value when recycled. By cutting out the need for single-use containers, Helias hopes to make “significant” reductions in plastic waste, but until the pilot schemes are evaluated it is difficult to estimate the savings, or the costs.New York and Paris will see the first pilot schemes later this year, but if they are successful after a 12-month trial the scheme will be rolled out widely.The “waste-free shopping platform” will be launched on Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where Greenpeace will publicly debate the issue of plastic waste with Procter \u0026amp Gamble chief executive David Taylor.Taylor is also chair of the recently forged Alliance to End Plastic Waste, under which companies will invest $1bn (£778m) over five years in ways to stop plastic ending up in the oceans, where it has a disastrous effect on marine life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ead1d6402c2c9a2f09172b58fdcb7e44dce780a/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2310d79c97a4ee229f98f394324b22bd","title":"did you work for a uk high street chain that has closed","story":"For an upcoming project, we would like to hear from former workers of chain shops that shut about how it affected their livesWith thousands of high street shops closing over the last decade, communities have been rightly concerned about the decline and what the future holds.If you worked for a high street chain that shut down, we’d like to hear from you.

He has accommodated as many speaking requests as possible in the short time available.Carney was asked whether firms are ready for a hard Brexit:Meanwhile Kalyeena Makortoff, the ’s banking correspondent, has been attending a Davos session featuring Bank of England governor Mark Carney and the IMF’s Christine Lagarde.The subject was ‘shaping the future of finance’ but they seem to have veered off-topic:So Philip Hammond, UK chancellor, pulled out of the panel session on Europe this morning but it’s not entirely clear why...It did mean however that the rest of the panel could focus on the future of the EU, without discussing Brexit once. Q: What should be the next concrete steps to recreate the necessary trust in Europe?Ireland’s Leo Varadkar: Over the next 5-10 years we need to move it from being just an economic power and trading bloc into a group of nations that is politically influential. The US is moving away from that role, China is getting bigger. Europe needs to have a common foreign policy and act as a force for good in the world on a number of key issues.Cecilia Malmstrom, EU trade commissioner: Europe is so many things. We see a rise of populist movements as the European parliamentary elections approach. It’s a great time to show the pro-European leadership we need.Mark Rutte, Dutch PM: You have to stick to the rules and keep to your promises. If we do we could make much faster progress (he’s really got it in for Italy today.)And with that, the panel ends.Back at the Arctic Basecamp, Greta Thunberg, the 16-year old Swedish climate change activist, tells delegates she spent last night in a tent at minus 18 degrees celsius.Greta explains that she couldn’t turn down the invitation to Davos - for one thing, it’s an adventure.Most people came here in private jets, and stay in hotels, but I came on a 20-hour train journey and slept in a tent, she says.But it’s also a valuable opportunity to push her campaign, which began when she went on strike from school because Sweden’s government wasn’t doing enough on climate change.Her message for Davos leaders:I want to tell them that if we do not care about the climate crisis then no other issue will matter in the future.This is what shapes the future.Ireland’s Leo Varadkar says the best way to address tax loopholes is through the OECD.He says the best way to address the digital tax is to tax where the value - and not turnover - is created.Mark Rutte of the Netherlands returns to the subject of Italy and it’s spending plans. He says the Netherlands now has a budget surplus because the economy is growing and because it is the correct thing to do, even if larger European economies are not playing by the rules.Ana Botin, chair of Santander, says Spain has had by far the biggest flow of immigrants than any other country. (That comment is directed at Dutch PM Mark Rutte who spoke earlier about a northsouth ide in the EU.)She says Europe needs to “punch its weight” when it comes to trade, amid a ChinaUS trade war. “Scale matters,” she says, urging leaders to focus on a single market for services.On regulatory reform and a banking union:We are famously known in the world for being slow in Europe. But we’re also trying to do the right thing. Let’s prove everybody wrong and do the right thing, but a little bit faster.China, the US and the EU are all major contributors to global emissions.... and Professor Gail Whiteman of Lancaster University points out that companies also have responsibility.Look at the holdings of asset manager BlackRock, she says.

Eliminating all tax havens from the EU would help bring about a level playing field.Dutch PM Mark Rutte: Trump is an opportunity.. to make use of his criticism of multilateralism and reform areas that need it.There is an eastwest ide in the EU on the refugee crisis. This needs to be addressed.And north and south ides too. The commission not acting on Italy and it’s budget plans has notified the northern countries that while we’re playing by the rules, others are not. If Italy is getting away with it, why should we get our own house in order, I’m asked. It is creating a ide and mistrust.Klaus Schwab asks: what would you tell young people today about the value of European identity?Dutch PM Mark Rutte: Three words: prosperity, collective safety and values.Ireland’s Leo Varadkar: Europe works and as a result we’ve had 70 years of peace and prosperity. We need to stick together.EU commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom: The one word is “together”. We can only save the planet and make things better if we work together.Mateusz Morawiecki, Poland’s PM says it’s all about ersity.

They were among tens of thousands who took to the streets to celebrate and support Colombia’s LGBT community.Many annual Pride marches that were once solemn protests against repression have become celebrations of now-existing rights or progress, reflecting the strength of LGBT communities. In Bogotá, for example, the capital of a macho and socially conservative country, there has been surprising progress in LGBT rights.In March, Angélica Lozano Correa, a former member of the Bogotá city council, became the first openly LGBT person to be elected to the country’s Senate. In 2016 the country’s government passed laws allowing same-sex couples to adopt and marry, and the previous year it granted transgender people the right to change their identity on official government documents – policies which have allowed more equality and openness.But while these laws and political representation might suggest Bogotá is “friendly” and tolerant of the LGBT community, the issue is not clear-cut. This year’s Bogotá Pride march was marked by an undertone of resistance to and fear of the right-wing government of the new president, Ivan Duque.Duque openly opposes the LGBT-inclusive peace agreement his predecessor, Juan Manuel Santos, signed with leftist rebels Farc in 2016. Activists claim he is also against same-sex marriage and adoption rights.“Although the government promised there would be no setbacks to LGBT rights, the appointment of several anti-LGBT officials, cuts in resources for public policies and the continued strengthening of radical religious movements that promote hate speech and misinformation against the LGBT population are worrying,” says Marcela Sánchez, director of Colombia Diversa, a leading LGBT rights organisation.Indeed, determining a city’s attitude towards the LGBT community is complex. Studies that try to do this often look at political or legal metrics such as freedom to marry, or laws protecting against discrimination.Equaldex, a collaborative knowledge base for the global LGBT movement that maps the legality of homosexuality, identifies a number of factors including freedom to change gender and to adopt – although it hasn’t ranked countries or cities in order of best to worst.An index from the Human Rights Campaign looks at municipal services, law enforcement and the city leadership’s public position on equality across the US.Seventy-eight out of 506 US cities had a “perfect score” of 100, for reasons such as introducing trans-inclusive health benefits to city employees, as in Brookings, South Dakota. Birmingham, Alabama, obtained a full score for passing comprehensive nondiscrimination ordinances, along with other cities such as Cleveland in Ohio, a state that had previously prohibited same-sex marriage and civil unions.However, the Human Rights Campaign clearly states its index does not and cannot reflect a city’s friendliness.Other global surveys have tried to assess friendliness by covering public attitudes, access to nightlife and personal safety. A 2017 survey by the housing website Nestpick ranked the best LGBT cities by asking thousands of people how friendly they felt their city was based on safety and nightlife. Madrid, Amsterdam and Toronto came out as the top three.Arguably the size of the LGBT population in urban areas could reflect the level of friendliness, as “many LGBTI folk head to cities from rural areas because of the promise of a freer, more tolerant life there,” says André du Plessis, executive director of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association.But even when cities seem progressive on the surface, the lived experience of members of the LGBT community can tell a dramatically different story.Brazil’s second-largest city, Rio de Janeiro, has been branding itself as an LGBT tourist destination for years. It has made huge efforts in providing anti-bullying projects aimed at students, and has outlawed discrimination in nightclubs. However, the last year has seen record numbers of violent attacks against the queer community.And with a newly elected far-right government, there are fears it could get worse.Conversely, in some countries with backward and dangerous attitudes to the LGBT community, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, discreet but vibrant underground scenes can thrive. This is even the case in Russia, where activists say two people were killed last week and nearly 40 detained, as part of a new homophobic crackdown by police in the Chechnya region.“You’ll find a gay scene in many places that may surprise you,” says Ed Salvato, an LGBT travel expert. “Some places like Moscow and St Petersburghave vibrant gay communities, despite the homophobic laws there.”In Dublin, an exciting scene exploded out of a staunchly Catholic country.“Dublin is like gay Disneyland now, and that wasn’t the case 20 or 30 years ago,” says Prof Andrew Reynolds, founder of the University of North Carolina’s LGBTQ Representation and Rights Research Initiative.“With the last couple of referendums, Ireland and Dublin have embraced their new presentation as an inclusive, progressive and loving place.”He says: “They went to Australia. They went to America. Now they’ve come home.”The political glass ceiling has broken for many LGBT people across the world, which inevitably has ripple effects on the community. Minneapolis made US history last year by electing Andrea Jenkins, the first openly trans woman of colour to office in 2017. The gay stronghold of Palm Springs, California, has elected an entire city council that identifies as LGBT. And in November, Jared Polis became the first openly gay man to be elected as a US state governor.In Poland, one of Europe’s most Catholic and conservative countries, voters in the small city of Slupsk this year elected a gay atheist mayor, Robert Biedron. Just a few years ago, Biedron was attacked on the streets of his city because of his sexuality.In Kathmandu, Nepal, Sunil Pant became Asia’s first openly gay federal-level elected official in 2008, resulting in a spate of public scrutiny.“I think that the spinoff is that Kathmandu is a lot more gay-friendly than it was before,” says Reynolds. “Whilst it is not perfect by any stretch, like Bogotá, it is a place now that I feel like is much more friendly and accepting – and that’s obviously coming from a place where the Hindu religion was not helpful before.”As the most direct representatives of citizens, city officials are uniquely positioned to understand and address the needs of their communities, says Xavier Persad of the Human Rights Campaign, pointing to “the need to provide for one’s family without the fear of being fired, to secure housing without the fear of eviction, and to participate in community life”.“When cities enact LGBTQ-inclusive protections,” he adds, “they send a clear message that they value and welcome everyone, attracting the country’s top talent and spurring economic growth.”Ultimately, even the most progressive laws and equal representation at political levels do not necessarily reflect the efficiency of enforcement, or indeed capture the lived experience of discrimination and fear many LGBT people face every day.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e05e8ee36fbee4166f1eb7d5734475ae3c35ef0e/0_142_4272_2563/master/4272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9766ecdb959568ca654857e07b1ae9de","title":"zombie clunkers has your local bus been resurrected in guatemala","story":"Phased out vehicles often end up back in use in developing countries – a form of dumping with serious environmental consequencesIn a sparsely furnished office overlooking dozens of buses at the Zone 21 depot in Guatemala City, Jorge Castro flips through photographs on his mobile phone. He settles on one.“There’s the bus when I bought it in Maryland,” he says proudly. It is a blue and white bus emblazoned with the words “Ride On”, the name of Montgomery County’s public transit system.The same bus is now parked outside with a new paint job that reads “Transurbano”, the name of Guatemala City’s bus network. Castro’s job is to buy and refurbish used buses for the city’s bus lines. He bought the bus outside and seven others in 2017 last year from Maryland’s public fleet after they were phased out. He drove them to a New Jersey port and loaded them on a cargo ship bound for Guatemala. He also bought another dozen in Houston, Texas, which he drove south through Mexico, a three-day journey.In a little-known form of environmental dumping, your city’s used bus or your old car might have a new life in a developing country. It is a pattern that plays out all over the world. Many of the buses that crowd Guatemala City’s streets came from the US. Sri Lanka imports used cars from Japan. A 20-year-old German car might end up on Lagos’s crowded roads. In developing countries with no domestic vehicle manufacturing and only limited controls on emissions, vehicles can continue operating for years beyond what is considered their useful lifetime in their countries of origin.Trade in used vehicles is a challenge for both exporting and importing countries. There are no uniform emissions standards worldwide, so low-income countries end up bearing the brunt of air pollution from inefficient used vehicles. Of the 2bn vehicles operating worldwide, an estimated 40m reach end-of-life every year, according to a July report from the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) in New Delhi, and large numbers of these are traded to low-income countries.“The global community which has, time and again, expressed its deep concern about the deteriorating air quality in the southern world, cannot look away from this problem of dumping any more,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of research and advocacy at the CSE.The CSE report also found that exports of used vehicles to Africa and South Asia were contributing to dangerous air pollution, and points out that there are no uniform criteria to determine when a used vehicle becomes so unfit it should be barred from export.Zone 21 in Guatemala City is one of the city’s roughest areas, though inside the bus depot it is quiet, with only the occasional buzz of machinery. Transurbano is part of the city’s efforts to modernise its largely unregulated bus fleet. For years, residents have relied on “red buses”: old American school buses painted bright red that are privately owned and largely unregulated. Drivers of red buses collect cash fares onboard and change their routes at will. Gangs have targeted red buses for extortion payments in recent years because drivers carry large amounts of cash, sometimes even killing drivers who don’t pay up.As a result, their owners often struggle to break even buying new buses is out of the question.In contrast, private companies receive permits to operate Transurbano buses, and the new system includes prepaid fares, designated bus stations and established routes.In an effort to modernise Guatemala City’s buses, operators like Castro must “trade out” a red bus for every Transurbano bus they put into the system. But that doesn’t mean the Transurbano buses are new. Originally, the city planned to buy over 3,000 new buses manufactured in Brazil. However, ultimately only 445 Brazilian buses were purchased and authorities subsidised bus operators to purchase their own buses – such as those from Maryland – to fill out the fleet.Outside Guatemala City, antiquated buses are the only public transportation option. Known as “extra-urbans”, these former American school buses are painted bright colours and travel between cities like Quetzaltenango, Antigua, and Chimaltenango. The narrow streets of Ciudad Vieja, an hour outside Guatemala City, are lined with automotive workshops that specialise in refurbishing buses for intercity routes.The intercity buses may be ornamented with chrome and elaborate custom paint jobs, but under the surface they are clunkers. Antonio Estrada, a mechanic, says his workshop recently repainted a 1989 model bus that will go on to transport dozens of people on hazardous rural roads.Imported used vehicles are frequently modified, making safety features useless. In Guatemala, modifications to the engines, brakes and seating are a few potential safety hazards.“We change the motors because all the bus lines compete for passengers,” says Estrada. “Whoever has the fastest bus gets the riders.”Far from addressing the dangers of exporting clunkers, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Trump administration hopes to freeze fuel efficiency standards at 2020 levels. Several states have said they will sue to block the measure.The EPA offers cash incentives to scrap diesel buses, but there is still a steady flow of vehicles heading south over the Mexico border, destined primarily for Central America.Jamie Cooke, the fleet manager for Montgomery County, Maryland, oversees 3,800 vehicles, including 380 Ride On buses. Montgomery is trying to make its working fleet more sustainable the county is in the process of transitioning its fleet from diesel to compressed natural gas (CGN) and electric vehicles (EV). Buses are phased out after 12 years, or 500,000 miles, per federal regulations. On average, the county phases out 31 buses a year, and according to Cooke, most are sold, not scrapped. “If there’s more value in selling, we’ll sell it. If there’s more value in scrapping it, we scrap it,” says Cooke. “It’s a business decision.” Vehicles are bought from the county by “GovDeals”, an auction site that sells former state and federal property – everything from buses to office supplies –\u0026nbspto eager bidders all over the world.The CSE report makes many recommendations for both importing and exporting countries, including harmonising emission standards and fuel quality at the minimum level of Euro IV – which stipulates a maximum of 50 ppm of sulphur in diesel fuel for most vehicles – as well as age-caps and increased taxes on used vehicles. But even with tighter restrictions on used vehicle imports, demand for personal vehicles is on the rise in the developing world. In Mozambique, officials introduced a law in 2007 to discourage importing clunkers, but it was abandoned after public protests.At the automotive shop in Ciudad Vieja, Pablo Ramos, who owns a bus line operating between Quetzaltenango and Guatemala City, is waiting for the mechanics to finish working on one of his buses.“Guatemalans don’t have good enough jobs to buy a nice car from a dealership,” he says. “There just isn’t the money.”In the meantime, these clunkers will have to do.This reporting was supported by the International Women’s Media Foundation as part of its Adelante Latin American Reporting InitiativeFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/156131916d77a60354b2d8e1b9934e4bc667830f/0_185_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=986b7e43a711cd47a3e4b18353652110","title":"brexit nightmare tories fault dont blame labour","story":"From Cameron promising a vote he never wanted to hold to May taking us to the brink of no deal - it’s a very Conservative messThere isn’t much that’s funny about Brexit. At least, not funny ha-ha. But there is one aspect of it that is at least curious: that this act of national foot-shooting has resulted in quite so many people putting the blame for it on the two main political parties – even though only one of them has been in power since 2010.Scroll through the comments or tweets on any story about Brexit and the online rage from remainers splits evenly. “I’ll never vote Labour again if they facilitate Brexit in any form” is a fairly representative comment, as is the idea that “supporting Labour means Brexit catastrophe”. When I tweeted an observation on this, I was told: “Both parties own this mess”, that “there are those of us who will never vote Tory, but also never vote Labour because they have enabled the whole thing”, and that the “main parties” were uncaring about voters thoughts on the EU.Going through it step-by-by step, affixing blame shouldn’t be particularly controversial. The blame for even holding a Brexit referendum lies squarely at the feet of David Cameron. European council president Donald Tusk revealed on Monday that the former PM had only included the promise to hold a referendum in his party’s 2015 manifesto in a desperate attempt to soothe the internal dynamics that had already threatened to split the Tories once before.Cameron, like everyone else that year, didn’t expect to win a majority, Tusk said. He believed that the coalition with the Liberal Democrats would extend to a second term, and that promised referendum would be the first thing to fall to coalition negotiations. Unfortunately, Ed Miliband ate a bacon sandwich weirdly, and the rest is history.Unless we’re willing to pin the blame for all of that on the Labour PR staff who recommended such an unphotogenic breakfast, so far we’re one-for-one on the Tories being at fault.But even once Cameron pratfalled into promising a vote he never wanted to hold, the Conservatives could still have avoided disaster. With a working majority in parliament and a five-year term guaranteed by the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, the government had room to do things properly.It’s generally a bad idea to hold referendums when the government of the day doesn’t support the change proposition, because of the exact problems we’ve seen over the past two years. But if you must do so, the trick is to be very, very clear about what the vote entails.That means model legislation in place before the election, charting exactly the process from A to B it means a neutral arbiter, such as a citizens’ assembly, to keep campaigning reality-based and it means committing to follow those promises through to completion on the other side, whatever the outcome. It also means someone in the British government actually noticing that Northern Ireland has a pretty shaky constitutional settlement , which maybe should be addressed before the vote.We did not get those things. We got disaster. Worse, once Cameron had quit, throwing the already murky mandate of the leave victory (leave how?) into even greater confusion, the Conservative party didn’t pull itself together and commit to rescuing the country from the brink of chaos.Again, it’s not entirely clear how Labour deserves any of the blame for that. The party, in opposition for the whole period, didn’t write the ballot paper, couldn’t have stopped article 50 from being triggered, and had no power to end the fight within the Conservatives. Perhaps Labour could have helped by doing much worse in the 2017 election, and handing Theresa May a majority large enough that she could simply ignore Jacob Rees-Mogg and the ERG, but that seems an odd demand to make of a political party.And now, the Conservative party is careering towards leaving the EU with no deal – a disaster on top of a disaster. Labour remain in opposition, without the votes to call a general election, let alone force a highly contentious second referendum or to straight-up cancel Brexit. So the weight of anger directed against a player with a relatively small role in this saga is odd.It’s true that the party could team up with the rump of the Conservative party and pass Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement, shooting off the country’s other foot to prevent the Tory right pulling the trigger on the gun held to the nation’s head instead. But when you can’t even get people you pay to agree with you to vote for you, it seems a bit off to try and attribute the real blame for your failures on your political opponents.Look: other parties exist. Labour is owed no one’s votes, and disliking the party or its leader doesn’t make you a Tory. But let’s make sure that blame falls where blame is due. Only one party got us into this mess, and it’s not the one with a rose in its logo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25b57e8cd00fb02f63be6a3e0bec18ffb08bf82c/0_290_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26cbd4d6e3fa3da6a4491c9f6e141944","title":"clooney and prendergast were not silent on sudan were going after the regimes loot","story":"We’ve learned that working behind the scenes achieves more than naming and shaming “Where are George Clooney and co now that Sudan needs them?” asked an Opinion article in the  this week. The oped assumed that a lack of public statements by us and others with a long association with Darfur, Sudan more broadly, and South Sudan meant that we were doing nothing in response to the Sudanese regime’s brutal crackdown of escalating protests throughout the country.This is indeed a critical moment in Sudan’s fraught history. The people of Sudan are rightly leading demands for change, and we believe our role is to support the cause of human rights for Sudanese people by using strategic and tactical advocacy in Europe, the US, and Africa focused on key points of leverage. As the demonstrations have unfolded this past month, our entire team has continuously engaged officials in governments around the world to take measures to hold the Bashir regime accountable. Much of this advocacy is not done in public.To support Sudanese efforts for change we have been working assiduously behind the scenes to suspend the US government’s process for removing president Omar al-Bashir’s regime from its state sponsors of terrorism list. Such a move would lift remaining sanctions and make the Sudanese government eligible for massive debt relief one of the few points of leverage the international community has over the Khartoum regime.We have been engaging the Trump administration and the US Congress to suspend the process of normalising relations with Bashir’s regime, whose human rights abuses go far beyond killing protesters. And we have dispatched staff to to engage governments in Europe and to the headquarters of the African Union in Addis Ababa.Over more than a dozen years, we’ve invested millions of dollars into efforts to address Sudan’s – and South Sudan’s – crises. We launched the Satellite Sentinel Project to monitor the regime’s mass atrocities using satellite technology and teams of imagery analysts. We were able to uncover evidence of mass graves, Chinese-made rockets, hidden troop movements in violations of ceasefires, and many other destabilising actions of the Sudan regime.1956 Independence\u0026nbspSudan – including the area that will later become South Sudan - attains independence\u0026nbspafter being under Anglo-Egyptian rule since 1899.1962 First civil war\u0026nbspIn a pattern that will later re-establish itself, civil war breaks out\u0026nbspin 1962\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspwith a rebellion led by southern separatists, leading to limited autonomy being granted by Khartoum following a peace agreement signed in Addis Ababa in 1972.1983 Second civil war\u0026nbspWar between Khartoum and the south breaks out again when\u0026nbsp​President Jaafar Numeiri abolishes southern autonomy, leading to almost two decades of conflict.2005 Peace and autonomy for the south\u0026nbspThe Comprehensive Peace Agreement is signed between\u0026nbsp​John Garang​’s southern Sudanese People’s Liberation Movement and Khartoum which sees a new constitution and autonomy in the south whose administration is dominated by Garang’s former guerilla colleagues, foremost among them Salva Kiir.2011 South Sudan formed\u0026nbspAfter an uneasy period punctuated by\u0026nbspoutbreaks of\u0026nbspviolence, political leaders in the north and south agree to an independence referendum which sees the birth of the state of South Sudan2013 War in the south\u0026nbsp​Peace is short lived, however, with new conflict breaking out in 2013 when pPresident Salva Kiir​ dismisses his cabinet and vice-president Riek\u0026nbspMachar in a power struggle within the ruling Sudan People’s Liberation Movementleading to conflict with Uganda which supports Kiir’s government forces.An attempted mediation for which Machar returns to Juba in 2016 breaks down amid more fighting, including accusations from the UN against Kiir of ethnic cleansing. Famine is declared a year later. Despite peace talks the conflict and atrocities continue, creating the continent’s largest refugee crisis.But over time, we realised that naming and shaming the regime and exposing its complicity in mass atrocities were not having sufficient impact on the policies of governments in Europe, America and Africa, so we decided on a new approach.We assessed the most significant point of vulnerability of this unshamable regime to be all the money it has been stealing from its people and squirrelling out of the country into hidden accounts, real estate, and shell companies, funnelling the rest of the funds into the machinery of state repression now responsible for killing and arresting protesters. So we decided to go after the regime’s massive corruption and illicit financial flows by creating an organisation called The Sentry, aimed at making it harder for them to loot the natural resources of the country to line their pockets and finance their repression.Our financial forensic investigative team is gathering evidence and we hope to have our first reports on Sudan in the coming year, just as we have already done in South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Central African Republic. The Sentry has also undertaken an assessment of Sudan’s anti-money laundering framework, and our report coming in the near future will show that the system is barely sufficient to meet international standards on paper, and far more concerning in practice. Bashir’s theft has taken longer to crack because his regime has been more sophisticated in obscuring its illicit money trails, including through manipulating and abusing their own flawed systems.It is our belief that exposing the Bashir regime’s massive theft of resources from its people, and the complicity of the international financial system in this effort, constitutes the most critical way in which we can support Sudanese activists on the ground as they lead the campaign for justice and human rights. Much of our work in this regard is not public. We provide evidence directly to global banks to help them guard against money laundering through the international financial system, and we provide dossiers to governments, including to the US Treasury recently to support sanctions under the new Global Magnitsky authorities.This work has gone hand-in-hand with our ongoing efforts in South Sudan. We’ve worked to expose the vast corruption in the Juba regime, and to successfully advocate for network sanctions and anti-money laundering measures imposed against key regime officials and financiers. The networks of looting are transnational, so many of the vultures feeding on South Sudan are also doing the same to Sudan. There is much money to be made in war, and the deliberate absence of the rule of law has supported the efforts of the thieves of state in Khartoum and Juba.We’ve also supported the restoration of coffee farming in areas of South Sudan to help create incomes for the hard-working people there. Unfortunately, the conflict has overwhelmed these efforts, but we will continue to look for opportunities.We certainly support the work of journalists to ask questions about the activities of those working to address the world’s problems. But the  and other publications with a history of important investigative journalism should be asking questions of the UK and other European governments, which continue to pursue favourable trade and investment opportunities with Sudan, and which are providing funds to the Sudan regime to contain migration, not fully understanding that those funds are going to the most violent paramilitary forces associated with the regime, ironically causing further out-migration from Sudan to Europe.And journalists should be asking the US government how it can consider normalising relations with a government that is killing protesters, looting the country’s natural resources, failing to combat money laundering through its own system, maintaining ties with extremists inside and outside Sudan, and undermining basic religious freedoms.This is a catalytic moment for the people of Sudan. We and our team – which includes Sudanese experts – are working in every way we can to support the aspirations of the people of Sudan for a peaceful transition from three decades of violent, kleptocratic dictatorship. • Actor George Clooney and activist John Prendergast are co-founders of The Sentry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e37bcb54f3e2c2e92b05b0920fb5babf9b62749c/6_303_2674_1604/master/2674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f7daa5667197fe995c8936842b18dbd","title":"matteo salvini italy far right interior minister","story":"A few weeks ago Matteo Salvini, the interior minister and leader of Italy’s far-right League party, conducted a press conference wearing the full uniform of Italy’s fire and rescue helicopter crew. More recently he wore a jacket belonging to the country’s mountain rescue unit, another time a firefighter’s uniform. Images of him in a police jacket are plastered all over his Instagram account – he’s frequently sighted wearing this outfit at political rallies. Clearly Salvini is not a policeman, a firefighter or a member of Italy’s mountain rescue crew.Saturating his social media feeds with pictures of him in these costumes is part of an elaborate ploy. Nicknamed “the captain” by his supporters, this wardrobe projects the vision of powerful leadership his fans crave. When he started out, it’s worth noting, Salvini resisted the more traditional outfits of political life, wearing sweaters and hoodies rather than suits to such an extent that his opponents dubbed him Felpetta (a twist on the Italian term for sweater – felpa), or even Felpetta Nera – a play on the infamous Italian fascist anthem Faccetta Nera.Now it seems he’s found clothes with connotations that fit his self-fashioned image – not quite the military bravado of Mussolini perhaps, but a step closer to the same dangerous political posturing. By wearing uniforms so casually, Salvini not only disrespects those who wear them as a result of their training and vocation, he manipulates them for his own political ends. He is co-opting an identity to which he has no right.He’s not the first politician to pull this trick. One only has to think of George W Bush landing on an aircraft carrier decked out in a military flight suit as part of the infamous 2003 Mission Accomplished event to declare victory in Iraq. Bush, whose own military record was undistinguished to say the least, got to pretend to be “one of the boys” and project his version of power. Last year, Donald Trump was criticised by veterans for wearing clothes that resembled a uniform. Dressing up in police or fire brigade clothes might seem trivial but it highlights Salvini’s insidious attempt to align himself with state power – meanwhile, he undermines them by cutting funding.It is easy to see through the hollowness of these gestures: he dresses himself in uniforms that the public connote with positive and honourable work – at the same time he insults, bullies and incites violence against some of the weakest in society. After a regular stream of appearances in such costumes, Italy’s firefighters union – in the wake of budget cuts – sent a letter to Salvini pointing out that according to the country’s criminal code, it is illegal to wear a public official’s uniform without qualification. Technically, as interior minister, Salvini is head of the Italian police and fire brigade – but that doesn’t afford him the privilege of wearing their clothes.Unfortunately, he’s started a trend: Luigi Di Maio, deputy prime minister and the leader of Italy’s Five Star Movement, was photographed in the wake of the recent Sicilian earthquake wearing a jersey with the civil protection logo just a few days ago the minister for justice, Alfonso Bonafede, oversaw the extradition of a former terrorist from Brazil to Italy in a police jacket. Repeated so meticulously, this becomes a form of insidious propaganda. Uniforms allow these politicians to appropriate the identity of a protector or saviour.In our evolving digital world a politician’s visual image is an ever-more important commodity. Entire campaigns can be shaped by public perception of simple, direct images. For Salvini and other politicians, a uniform is a dangerously effective shortcut to power.• Thea Hawlin is a freelance journalist based in Milan"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acbfb917b384c52f69806446045499a7743ac428/0_202_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=173272389432c6acb877adbfa1e388a6","title":"right tricked rampant inequality lse meritocracy myth","story":"An LSE study has traced how we have come to swallow the meritocracy myth. This narrative needs to changeWhy don’t people rebel? The wonder of decades of rising inequality across the west is how placidly people put up with it. UK wages are still below 2008 levels, and a growing sector of jobs are nasty: non-unionised, achingly hard, with workers treated worse, the boot on the employer’s foot despite low unemployment. You might call Brexit a kind of protest, but that can be overdone. The vote was swung largely by comfortable older Tory voters in the shires, led – or misled – by privileged ideologues.Those on the progressive left have been perplexed that rising social injustice hasn’t led to much sign of the oppressed rising up, either at the ballot box or through more physical acts of protest. New research out on Wednesday suggests some explanations – though these will be of precious little comfort. Looking at surveys across 23 western countries since the 1980s, Dr Jonathan Mijs of the London School of Economics International Inequalities Institute monitors how, as countries become less equal, attitudes of the majority shift in the wrong direction.The meritocracy myth comes with other tropes, especially placing the blame on the poor, with decreasing social empathy. Believing people sink through their own fault is the necessary adjunct for proving that the mega-wealthy got there by merit alone.Politically, the mystery is how politicians have got away with making things more unfair once the lid blew off top earning in the 80s. Now there’s less chance of owning a home, fewer savings, more debt and public services deteriorating. Cedric Brown, the first fatcat shocker to catch the public eye, who was rewarded in 1995 for privatising British Gas with a salary of £475,000 (47 times that of his average employee), and a £600,000 incentive deal, comes from more innocent days. FTSE 100 CEOs now earn £4m.Yet riots are extraordinarily rare – the French have always done it: it’s in their founding revolutionary DNA, and it helps to keep them less unequal than the anglophones. Fear of revolution in the cold war years kept unions strong and boardrooms wary of excess: the mid-70s, famed for union militancy, were the most equal years in British history.This research suggests that as countries get more unequal, people live in greater social isolation, locked within a narrow income group. Their friends and family share the same incomes, are segregated by neighbourhood and marry similar partners. Children mix less in socially segregated schools. People no longer see over the high social fences, so they don’t know how the other half lives, Mijs finds.Ignorant of the facts, everyone wrongly places themselves on the income scale closer to the middle. Both rich and poor delude themselves that they are ordinary. But telling people the facts doesn’t change their attitudes: increasingly they cling to a moral belief that people rise by merit, sinking for lack of it. Spend time talking to people using food banks or in Citizens Advice offices knocked down by benefit sanctions, and too often you hear people absorbing the blame. “I should have tried harder at school,” is a frequent refrain, as if no other forces were at play. Talk to the mega-rich – I once conducted focus groups of earners up to £10m – and they are wilfully ignorant about their super-privilege, unshakable in believing their superior merit.The right captured the story, the emotions, the moral framing: social democrats need to seize it back with a narrative of immorality that is more compelling. The British Social Attitudes survey suggests a swing back towards empathy with the swelling numbers of poor people – including more than four million children. But still inheritance tax remains the most reviled of all taxes. The right forever tries to prove poor people are more stupid by nature than the rich, but Professor Steve Jones, a celebrated geneticist, when asked about the heritability of intelligence, replies deftly that the most important heritable trait, by miles, is wealth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000. Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud. I worked on this film to tell my story and hoped that it would resonate with people. To be nominated for this award is the highest recognition.”The film was produced by Simon Chinn and Jonathan Chinn of Lightbox (collaborator on the Whitney Houston documentary Whitney).

Hence Glass, the new film from M Night Shyamalan, extending the story of his earlier films Unbreakable (2000) and Split (2017). Uniting the casts of those two titles – notably James McAvoy, Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson – looked like a strategy to give the director his biggest hit in more than a decade.So far, Glass looks set to do just that, with a UK debut of £3.33m (£3.42m including previews). That compares with £2.56m for Split exactly two years ago. Unbreakable debuted on the last weekend of 2000 with just over £2m. In the US, Glass began with just over $40m, for which the UK equivalent would be £4m. Split also opened in the US with $40m, and the UK debut fell short of the equivalent figure.Split became a word-of-mouth hit in the UK, eventually reaching £11.4m. It’s uncertain whether the much hyped Glass will match that total: it will depend on how broader audiences respond once the initial fanbase is used up.Another week, and another awards contender lands in cinemas – this time from British production powerhouse Working Title. Mary Queen of Scots, the big-screen debut of acclaimed theatre director Josie Rourke, boasts a classy cast led by Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie, who were both nominated for the best actress Oscar a year ago, respectively for Lady Bird and I, Tonya – losing to Frances McDormand.Mary Queen of Scots opened solidly with £2.08m, including negligible previews, from 499 cinemas. That’s a bit down on the debuts for awards-fare hits The Favourite and Stan \u0026amp Ollie. Most relevant comparisons are with Elizabeth and its sequel Elizabeth: The Golden Age, which reached lifetime totals of £5.54m and £5.22m respectively. Mary Queen of Scots should easily pass those numbers, albeit helped by higher ticket prices.Indie cinemas are chock-a-block with Mary Queen of Scots, Stan \u0026amp Ollie and The Favourite as well as Colette, so StudioCanal made the sensible decision not to push too wide with its own awards contender, Beautiful Boy, the true story of how one young man’s drug addiction affected his family. Steve Carell and Timothée Chalamet star.Beautiful Boy opened with a respectable £252,000 from 124 cinemas, yielding a site average just above £2,000. Including previews, the total rises to £361,000 – but that wasn’t enough to earn a place in the UK Top 10.But that’s not the whole story. A year ago, Darkest Hour was performing better than any of this year’s awards contenders, while The Greatest Showman and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle were also steady contributors to the money pot. We currently lack the equivalents.From this Friday, hopes are pinned on the family film A Dog’s Way Home, the Jennifer Lopez comedy Second Act, Clint Eastwood in The Mule and awards contenders Vice and Destroyer.

Our critic calls it ‘truly terrible’ – but how does it compare to The Back-Up Plan?Could it have been anything else? Gigli wasn’t just a lead balloon it was the Hindenburg. It’s widely considered to be one of the worst films ever made. It made a 10th of its budget back. It derailed the careers of Lopez and Ben Affleck (who were engaged but split up shortly after it was made) and the director, Martin Brest, who never directed again. To quote one of the great poets, “gobble gobble”.How did Lopez bounce back from this historic flop? By making the second-worst film of her career, also with Affleck. A sludgy Kevin Smith melodrama, Lopez’s role was pruned for fear it would remind people of Gigli, which it did anyway. The best thing about it is that Lopez dies quite quickly.One of those films where every detail makes you question whether or not it even existed. It stars Robin Williams as a schoolboy who looks like a middle-aged man. The poster features the title written in crayon. Bill Cosby is in it. Francis Ford Coppola directed it, for crying out loud. Lopez isn’t bad in Jack – she has a relatively small, sweet part – but that shouldn’t detract from the fact that she’s in it.Booed at its Berlin premiere, Bordertown is a witless would-be thriller that obliterates every one of its good intentions with sheer turbo-powered boneheadedness. Lopez plays a hardbitten news reporter on investigating a spate of murders on the US-Mexico border in a film that contains a genuinely confusing musical number by the Colombian pop star Juanes for literally no reason at all.By far the worst J-Lo romcom of all time, The Back-Up Plan sees Lopez playing a woman who falls in love with an anonymous boy actor three seconds after being artificially inseminated with twins. Will they stay together? Will he raise her kids? Who decided this film was a good idea? Fun fact: Lopez vomits into a bin at the end.AKA what happens when Lopez takes a dumb swing at Oscar bait. There’s grief, there’s domestic abuse, there’s a car crash, there’s endless hokey small-town Americana, there’s a bear attack. Robert Redford is in this if it wasn’t for Lions for Lambs, this would be his worst film.Gigli and Jersey Girl taught Lopez important lessons about the dangers of working with your romantic partner. But she clearly never listened, because in 2006 she made this entirely generic vanity project of a music biopic with her new husband, Marc Anthony. It is just as miserable as you would expect.Last year, Viola Davis railed against her unfair treatment as a black woman in Hollywood. Looking at Lila \u0026amp Eve – a direct-to-VOD vigilante crime drama co-starring Lopez from 2015, in which she recites the Alcoholics Anonymous serenity prayer to avenge her son’s death – it’s hard to disagree.A mystical jazz musician-turned-hobo walks the streets of Chicago performing kind acts for strangers. One of these kind acts, inexplicably, involves stopping the world’s most beautiful cop from being shot in the head with a machine gun. Then they fall in love. I promise I am not making any of this up.In which Lopez’s teenage neighbour gives her a suspiciously new-looking first-edition copy of the Iliad, sleeps with her, then goes bananas and ultimately gets stabbed in the eye with an EpiPen. Not anywhere as fun as I’ve made it sound.A film that only exists by sheer dint of J-Lo’s effort. It borrows the hacky romcom premise of her other films (low-class woman is mistaken for high-class woman), gives itself a title that’s clearly meant to be seen as a future delineation point in Lopez’s filmography, then spaffs itself raw trying and failing to justify its own existence. You will watch this on a plane and then instantly forget about it.On paper, this should have been Lopez’s nadir – playing a supporting role in a Jason Statham film, for God’s sake – and yet it isn’t completely awful. It’s a little anonymous, and entirely forgettable, but she’s made much worse.True, sequels such as Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid, Anaconda 3: Offspring, Anacondas: Trail of Blood and Lake Placid vs Anaconda might have taken the shine off the original a little. However, this is still fun and stupid, especially if you like watching Owen Wilson get swallowed by a snake.A film that Lopez could only have made at the height of her fame. It’s a sort of Karate Kid remake, but about a woman who learns krav maga in order to kill her abusive husband. It’s a drama (sort of), it’s issue-led (sort of) and it’s actually quite good (sort of).A dumb – extraordinarily dumb – mid-90s Tarantino-ish thriller from Oliver Stone that wants to be Chinatown but ends up hitting Doc Hollywood. Lopez is literally the only good thing about this.One of J-Lo’s best-known roles, playing a hotel chambermaid who gets mistaken for a millionaire socialite by a clot. It’s Pretty Woman without any sex work, and only really let down by Ralph Fiennes, who bungles his potential mainstream breakout by generally coming off like a witness protection serial killer.Maligned upon release, this romcom succeeds purely for one reason: Jane Fonda. Everyone else in this film plays it straight from the J-Lo romcom rulebook, but Fonda is coming from an entirely different universe. She hadn’t made a film for 15 years before Monster-in-Law, and attacks her role like an exploding volcano. Seriously, watch it just for her.Has Lopez ever made a more visually arresting film than this? No. The Cell is a work of art. Every frame of Tarsem Singh’s debut has clearly been agonised over. But has anyone who has ever watched The Cell figured out what it’s about? Again, probably no.The definitive J-Lo romcom in a field packed with them. In fact, probably the platonic ideal of what a romcom should be. Two beautiful leads (the other is Matthew McConaughey). A love story packed with obstacles. A demented belief in the undying sanctity of marriage. Judy Greer in a supporting role that she’s clearly overqualified for. This film has everything, and in the middle of it is Lopez.The film that put Lopez on the map, and the lighter flipside to El Cantante. It’s another musical biopic, but one that plays to all of Lopez’s early strengths. She’s radiant, restless and determined here. She’s so good, in fact, that Selena gives all of her subsequent films a slightly bitter aftertaste. What could she have achieved, you wonder, if she had stayed this loose and free instead of hardening into J-Lo?Lopez’s best film by a country mile. She, George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh have never been better than in this stylish, sexy, unquestionably cool Elmore Leonard adaptation. The whole thing is like taking off your shoes and wriggling your toes in a thick carpet, and it’s propelled by the crackling chemistry between the two leads. It did badly at the box office and Lopez never went near anything like this again. Which is an extraordinary shame."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bd17336cba20528c612dd77b35308a106048c50/0_62_6585_3951/master/6585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ffba68a95a5854986b35269ddfdef58","title":"accrington stanley dump charm fa cup derby county","story":"A smell of toast fills the directors’ lounge at Accrington Stanley, where two large boxes of Daz and seven bottles of Bold sit in one corner. Simple parts of the daily routine, yet also signs of why the club that wouldn’t die – as “Accie” describe themselves – are thriving, setting an example and dismantling a tired joke.“We still get the jibes about the milk advert,” the manager, John Coleman, says. “You can let it annoy you or embrace the fact it is one of the things that made us famous. We are a unique club. The name is famous around the world. We are the archetypal underdog. If you wanted a David and Goliath you would say Man United and it would always be Accrington Stanley. As of late, we are not that. We are trying to get away from that.” A second FA Cup fourth-round appearance in three seasons and a remarkable title triumph in between illustrates the progress made. “Oh I don’t want that to be the end,” adds Coleman on winning League Two last year. “You should always strive to be better.”Preparations are under way for Saturday’s visit of Derby County on the morning  takes a look behind the scenes at the Wham Stadium. A commercial deal is being struck to hire digital advertising screens to go around the perimeter of the pitch. They will generate extra revenue on top of the £150,000 for being live on BT Sport and will be removed on Sunday.There is a seating issue to resolve. Frank Lampard has more backroom staff than Accrington have seats in the away dugout. And space must be kept available for paramedics. Derby’s technical area will be a squeeze but many of their 2,600 supporters, their portion of a capacity 5,400 crowd, will be in comparative luxury in the new Eric Whalley Stand. Built for £1.2m and part of an ongoing stadium redevelopment that has brought new floodlights, concourses, drainage, pitch, power and water supply (£800,000 is also being spent on the Clayton Road End), it will be fully open and operational for the first time on Saturday. Ideal timing.Negotiations are taking place over two transfers. Agents’ demands are relayed across the directors’ lounge to Coleman, who instantly responds with lower counter-offers. He secures both transfers on his terms. And all the while a steady stream of Accrington employees stop by to use the toaster, located near a plaque commemorating the club’s heritage as a founder member of the Football League in 1888.Managing director, management staff, physio or player: everyone makes their own breakfast here. It can be a culture shock to loanees from Premier League academies, as is collecting their own kit from the opposite side of the stadium, but it is part of what the owner, Andy Holt, views as “a finishing school” for players from more cosseted backgrounds.They are in it together at Accrington. Players and management socialise with supporters after games, Holt during them. The owner does not like the directors’ lounge – “too warm” – and pays for his own tickets and pints in the stands. Coleman and his long-time assistant, Jimmy Bell, helped dig the foundations for the gym. The kitman, Naz Ali, is a qualified lawyer and helps the club with legal advice.“We look at personality,” says the manager on his success in the transfer market. “Will they fit into our environment? Are they our type of player? It’s difficult to attract League One players because they can get more money elsewhere. We have to sell the dream that we can make them better players and help them skip League One after a year and go into the Championship or the Prem. We haven’t got salubrious surroundings. We are in the process of finding a new training ground which would make my job a lot easier but, as things stand, we have to create an environment players enjoy.”The camaraderie at Accrington is striking, befitting the progression under Coleman that last season yielded promotion to the third tier for the first time in the club’s history. The support structure is impressive too.Holt, a successful local businessman, has been at the forefront of Accrington’s revival from a perilous state in October 2015 when he paid off debt of £1.2m, plus £600,000 to other creditors. Behind him stands an engaged local community and fanbase. The washing powder, for example, is provided free of charge by Fowlers, a local business who have also donated an industrial washing machine to the club. The supporters club raised £25,000 for a large screen at the stadium and £15,000 for frost covers. Sponsorship has increased from £10,000 to almost £300,000 a year under Holt’s ownership. Last season Accrington won League Two on the second-smallest budget in the ision, posting a modest profit as they did so. This season, with the lowest budget in League One, they sit 14th. A club that was once synonymous with financial failure and averages gates of 2,850 is now self-sufficient, debt-free and owns its own ground. How?“We’ve got great managers with great work ethic and we all get on well,” Holt suggests. “Me, John and Jimmy all come from council houses and we used to play against people from the posh houses with fancier kits and boots. We still used to beat them. We had that desire, determination and morale.“I’m not here forever. I came in to do a job and I’m doing it. I’ll finish it and it will be a sound little club with good finances and holding its own. The fans got us here and all I’m doing is the next step. I’m not subsidising it. I’m not overfeeding the puppy until it blows up and dies. We’ve gone from having negative assets of £2m to positive assets of a similar figure.”Holt gives a guided tour of the upgraded Wham Stadium, speaking to every surveyor, builder and plasterer working on site. He knows them all by name. “It’s probably the biggest job I’ve ever taken on and I get a lot of pride out of it,” the Accrington owner admits. “Other fans might say we’ve got a shite ground. They should have seen it three years ago. We are no longer the laughing stock in terms of facilities. What people see as a dump has charm to us, the people of Accrington. They want it to be their club. Many fans I talk to at matches carried the bricks for the old stand and spent weeks digging holes in the ground for it.“What applies to Accrington applies to every football club outside the Premier League. We’ve got to run clubs that are self-sustainable and we’ve got to have a framework in football that is self-sustainable so that we’ve still got a league in 50 years. It can’t go on as it is. The analogy I use is it’s like all trains have been decoupled, and the steam train that is the Premier League is powering off into the distance and we are slowing down. Eventually we will stop.” Accrington, however, may be the exception."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b95469e036faf721105b4d0d67ebbca511acd488/17_186_2661_1596/master/2661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8b4185af7db1e34423be54fc3092e41","title":"false nine ancient tactic power shock football tactics","story":"It is 125 years since the first false nine and its history since is fascinating as much for its failure to become a dominant tactic as for its many successful applicationsAt times it feels in football there is nothing new, merely the reinvocation of old ideas. It is well over 100 years since GO Smith started operating for the Corinthians as what we would now term a false nine and yet still the idea of a team operating without a fixed focal point in the centre of their attack can cause chaos. It is 63 years since the England centre-half Harry Johnston spoke of the sense of “utter helplessness” he felt in facing the deep-lying Nándor Hidegkuti as England lost 6-3 to Hungary at Wembley. And yet, as Jesse Lingard proved recently for Manchester United against Tottenham, the false nine, used well, still has the capacity to take opponents by surprise.What is striking about the use of the false nine over time is that it has never taken root. Nobody in England copied Smith. There was a period in the 1920s in Argentina when the centre-forward as “conductor” became popular but that style of play, with a V-shaped five-man forward line, was in effect obliterated by the emergence of Bernabé Ferreyra, a brilliant centre-forward of monstrous proportions.Perhaps Matthias Sindelar would have had followers in Austria had it not been for the second world war but even at the time his talents seemed to be regarded as unique. The deep-lying centre-forward used by Hungary in the early fifties was essentially the brainchild of Marton Bukovi. He developed the style in Zagreb during the war before finding at MTK on his return to Budapest not one but two players ideally suited to the role, Hidegkuti and Peter Palotas. As the national team took on the approach it gained popularitybut even there the false nine never became a defining style and, by the sixties, by which time the culture that had generated the tactical radicalism had been devastated by the Uprising and its aftermath, the image of the Hungarian striker was the far more orthodox Florian Albert.Other incarnations have followed a similar pattern: Alfrédo di Stéfano, Johan Cruyff, Lionel Messi, Francesco Totti, Cristiano Ronaldo (at times at Manchester United, before he bulked up and transformed himself into a more traditional number nine) … they’ve all either played as a false nine for only part of their career, or have been a one-off and have turned out, in that role, to be irreplaceable.There have been four notable examples of the false nine in the Premier League this season. Roberto Firmino has proved particularly adept in the role, dropping deep, creating space for the pace of Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané. But even Liverpool, whose success in the latter part of last season was so predicated on their front three, have changed. Often this season Salah has played more centrally with Firmino dropping off into a more traditional number 10 role in a 4-2-3-1, something that gets an additional creative player on to the pitch and shifts Salah slightly nearer goal.At Chelsea Eden Hazard has been a reluctant false nine. When used like that against Barcelona last season, it was a specific tactic designed to take advantage of Chelsea’s superior pace on the break. This season, though, it feels like a stopgap while Maurizio Sarri waits for the club to provide him with a central striker who does not rely on getting crosses into the box.Raheem Sterling was used by Manchester City as a false nine at Chelsea, in part because of Sergio Agüero’s injury problems but also to direct his pace at the heart of the Chelsea defence (as England had used him at times in advance of Harry Kane at the World Cup). In that sense, though, he is arguably part of a slightly different trend, less a false nine than a wide player noted for his speed being used centrally – something Louis van Gaal did with Arjen Robben with the Netherlands and Mauricio Pochettino has done with Lucas Moura.And then there was Lingard. Again, he is perhaps not an orthodox false nine, if such a thing can be said to exist. He did not drop deep, dragging the central defenders out of position. Rather he played at the tip of a midfield diamond but with the two central forwards pulling wide to attack the space behind the full-backs so there was often space for him to accelerate into.So this is where the false nine finds itself after 125 years of history. It is a role that demands perhaps too unusual a skill-set ever to become a dominant mode – and that anyway is probably the preserve of high-class sides for whom having a target for their clearance is less of a concern – and so, familiar as it now is, it tends to be used only in very specific circumstances.It has mutated to take on numerous forms – centre-forward dropping off, winger playing centrally, attacking midfielder pushing forward, the sort of advanced passing hub that Cesc Fàbregas represented briefly for Spain – but without a genius to operate as a roving centre-forward, around whom a team is in effect built, the false nine has become a shock tactic. It has proved very difficult to implement over any protracted period but it remains a highly effective way of unsettling an opponent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b34dc34165c231284abeacec142013efbc38b2c/0_3382_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9011cede453f0ce4b2605372740e63b4","title":"young or old tell us about the major life events that shaped you","story":"We would like to hear from you as part of a project introducing readers of different generations to one anotherAs part of a new project that aims to explore major life events from different perspectives and across generational ides, the ’s Weekend magazine is looking to hear from readers.If one of the following questions apply to you, we’d like to hear from you.

Tickets were booked via Lastminute. At the check-in desk they were asked for the children’s birth certificates, which they did not have. They were therefore refused boarding. Virgin staff said my daughter should have known because the information was on its website.The family had no alternative but to go home to fetch the birth certificates and, as Virgin was unable or unwilling to rebook their flight, had to book with another airline for the next day, which cost £3,000. They later discovered that as they were marked as a “no-show” for their outward bound flight, their return tickets had been voided and they would have to rebook that, too, at a cost of more than £2,000. Staff admitted it was common for families to be denied boarding for this reason, in which case – while ignorance is not an excuse – should they not provide better information?Always consult the Foreign Office website for entry requirements when you fly to any country outside the EU (and, if Brexit happens, any destination outside the UK). It was in June 2015 that South Africa introduced the most stringent immigration rules in the world, requiring all under-18s to present an unabridged birth certificate at the departure gate. This was intended to reduce child trafficking. But it was taking such a toll on tourism that the rules were relaxed. However, passengers are still urged to carry the documents as immigration officers may request them and, since airlines face fines if they carry inadequately documented passengers, some gate staff may still insist on them.Virgin told the Observer that there was a link to South African entry requirements on the e-tickets it sends to customers, but as you booked through Lastminute the format was different and the link not included.

She first came to prominence in the US as a member of Danity Kane, a girl group manufactured to Sean Combs’s specifications on the MTV series Making the Band. After their brief career ended in the obligatory acrimonious split (an attempted reunion in 2013 was drawn to a swift conclusion by a fight), and following an equally brief period in Combs’s ho-hum collective Diddy-Dirty Money, Richard took off on a solo career no one could have predicted. She made three critically hosannaed, interlinked concept albums. Lyrical imagery drawn from science-fiction and medieval warfare crashed into futuristic production and songs that frequently dispensed with standard verse-chorus-verse structures in favour of a stream-of-consciousness approach.Behind its extraordinary cover – Richard reclining on the front porch of a derelict wooden house, clad in silver platform boots and a vast white feathered headdress of the Washitaw, a group of black Americans who claim to be a sovereign Native American nation – New Breed is a slightly more straightforward prospect than its predecessors. It is rooted in her home town of New Orleans: the lyrics are thick with references to locations in the city, and there are samples of discussions of local cultural traditions and of artists shouting out to their home town from the stage between songs. But New Orleans’ musical imprint is subtle. If the ghosts of the R\u0026ampB records that poured out of the city in the late 50s and early 60s haunt the sampled voices on opener The Nine, you would never characterise the results as an obvious homage.Similarly, there’s a hint of the Meters’ taut funk about the guitar line of Dreams and Converse, and an echo of Allen Toussaint in the lovely, rolling piano of We, Diamonds, but they sit amid thoroughly modern pop songs. The former is a wash of dreamy synthesiser and house-influenced beats, the latter boasts a mesh of overlapping voices and the kind of chorus that – in a fairer world, where Richard’s placings on end-of-year-lists were matched on the actual charts – could provoke arenas to sing along. Meanwhile, two of the album’s best tracks are built around music that, geographically speaking, couldn’t be further from Louisiana: Spaces features a gorgeous, rippling synthesiser motif that sounds as if it stepped off a mid-70s Tangerine Dream album, while Jealousy maps out an intriguing space between dubby lover’s rock and DJ Screw.Listening to tracks like that, one wonders if the weirdness of Richard’s work might have been overstated. There is a tendency in some quarters to write about her music in a way that makes it sound avant garde and challenging, as if you have to steel yourself to listen to it. It does her a disservice. The music on New Breed is often hugely inventive but it also functions as pop: you get the feeling she spends as much time bulletproofing her choruses as she does tinkering with the futuristic sound design. The fact that her music exists on the margins (tellingly, the abortive Danity Kane reunion came about after Richard failed to generate enough money on Kickstarter to make her 2015 album Blackheart) seems to say more about how narrow the confines of mainstream pop currently are, than about any lack of commerciality on her part.This fact clearly hasn’t escaped Richard. As well as lyrics about sexuality, or warning a partner’s ex off in no uncertain terms (“I know you feel you have a right to call him – you don’t”), she keeps returning to the subject of how hard she has had to work to forge her musical identity. The spoken-word introductions to Spaces and We, Diamonds offer a list of compelling reasons for why the pop landscape isn’t more densely populated with figures like her, railing against the way the music industry categorises black women and doubts their ability to be anything more than as. You can see why she feels she must reiterate that doing what she does involves real struggle, and not just because it highlights a more general injustice.Adventurous but never abstruse, New Breed sounds effortless, as though transforming yourself from a manufactured pop star into a unique artist is the easiest thing in the world: “This shit is simple, do the math, I’m the answer and the proof,” she sings on the title track. But of course it isn’t: making it seem so is just one of its author’s multitude of talents.This track is a couple of months old, but still sounds fresh. The Bermondsey rapper does her thing over scourging, head-on, industrial beats from Clams Casino, sounding as powerful as anything the UK rap scene has produced of late."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25f1fcae29f154dcc45e782b33d8e5b307460ff9/0_17_4961_2976/master/4961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e44bc411807422415f6b6ad07fa6bda","title":"endless hunt for the perfect influenza vaccine flu jab","story":"We’ve seen off smallpox, polio and measles – so why does a truly reliable flu jab still elude us? By  Jeremy BrownVaccination, the process of infecting a healthy person with a microbe to prevent disease, dates back at least a thousand years. But the start of vaccination as we think of it today is generally credited to the work of Edward Jenner, a British physician born in 1749. Jenner was a keen observer with a deep interest in the natural world, and found time for both serious study and artistic play. He investigated everything from hydrogen balloons to the life cycle of the cuckoo, wrote poetry and played the violin, but smallpox – or rather, the eradication of it – is his legacy. Because of Jenner, this virus is not on our list of worries today.These women then became immune to the deadlier human smallpox virus. There was something in the cowpox that protected against smallpox, and in 1796 Edward Jenner famously took material from the fresh pustules on a milkmaid’s hand and inserted it under the skin of a young boy named James Phipps. After a brief and mild illness, Phipps recovered completely. Jenner then infected him with scrapings from a smallpox lesion, again and again, but the boy never got sick. Jenner named this process “vaccination” after variolae vaccinae, a Latin term for cowpox. His technique quickly spread through 19th-century England and beyond, saving countless people, inspiring modifications to the technique and changing the course of history.Jenner’s smallpox vaccine was improved and modified over the next several decades, and was soon joined by others. Louis Pasteur developed vaccines for animal diseases such as chicken cholera and anthrax, but of these he is best remembered for his rabies vaccine. Rabies was a common and uniformly fatal disease in the 19th century. Once a victim is bitten by a rabid animal, the virus multiplies slowly and infects the brain and nervous system. Pasteur did not know of the viral cause, but this didn’t really matter. He dissected and dried out the spinal cords of infected animals and then injected the remains into test animals, which then showed immunity to rabies. What Pasteur was doing was, in fact, weakening the virus, making it a Goldilocks version. It was not strong enough to kill, and it was not weak enough to be ignored by our immune system.One hundred years ago, during the 1918 flu pandemic, there were no flu vaccines. We didn’t know precisely what was causing the disease, so we couldn’t manufacture a vaccine to protect us. But this didn’t stop scientists and doctors from doing something, anything, to combat the outbreak. In 1919 Edward Rosenow from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, isolated several bacteria from the sputum and lungs of flu patients in Rochester, formulated a vaccine that contained five different kinds of bacteria, and doled it out to 100,000 people. At Tufts College Medical School in Boston, Timothy Leary (whose nephew and namesake would also become a doctor and experiment with psychedelics) produced his own blended vaccine using strains from the Chelsea Naval hospital, a nurse’s nose at Carney hospital and the infected wards of Camp Devens. Leary mixed these samples together, grew them on plates of agar and then sterilised the mixture. His vaccine was sent to San Francisco, where at least 18,000 people were inoculated with it.These and other efforts gave hope to a ravaged nation. One health official at the time wrote that the greatest value of a flu vaccine was that it reduced “fluphobia”. Worry and fear were as quick to spread as the disease itself, and any vaccine that provided at least mental relief was welcome. There was no evidence, of course, that any of these vaccines actually worked. Today, physicians go to great lengths to be sure that vaccine trials adhere to stringent standards, but a century ago these did not exist. Many of the vaccine trials were conducted on survivors of the flu, after the initial epidemic had passed, meaning that the pool was tainted with a degree of immunity.In 1933 the flu virus was identified, and scientists could then confront the culprit rather than the mess in its wake. Russians led the field, weakening the virus by transplanting it between chicken eggs. Around one billion people in the USSR were vaccinated using the live but weakened flu virus, and it was still in use at the end of the 20th century. Although it appeared to be successful, the live-flu vaccine was never tested in a rigorous way, and it remained a constant danger. Since it used a live virus, it could cross with other strains and morph into a more virulent version.Vaccine researchers therefore turned their attention to creating a vaccine containing what they called “inactive” strains. The virus was still grown in chick embryos, but this time it was rendered inactive by dunking it in a bath of formalin disinfectant. Although a higher dose of the inactive vaccine was needed to produce an immune response, there was no concern about the virus replicating.For the first several years the influenza vaccine contained only one strain, the influenza A virus, because, as far as anyone knew, that was the only kind of influenza out there. In 1940 influenza B was identified, which kicked off the perpetual task of calibrating vaccines to deal with multiple evolving strains. By the 1950s we had a vaccine that was effective against both A and B, but the virus, as always, was outpacing us. By the late 1970s we had to make a vaccine to hit three strains. For the 2016-7 flu season, most of the vaccine doses manufactured in the US targeted four different strains. The past 100 years have been a ceaseless arms race against an enemy with whom we cannot negotiate.The key to a good flu vaccine is matching it to the strains that are in circulation during a given season. The challenge is that it takes about six months to produce the vaccine, and so the manufacturers have to base their ingredients on some clever detective work led by the World Health Organization.There are about 110 WHO flu centres in 80 countries that receive swabs from the noses and throats of patients with influenza-like illnesses. These centres identify the flu strains that are circulating, and occasionally they will find a new one. When this happens, they send it to one of five collaborating centres, in London, Atlanta, Melbourne, Tokyo and Beijing, for a more detailed molecular analysis. Twice a year (in February for the northern hemisphere, and September for the southern) the WHO convenes a meeting to collate all the information and recommend a vaccine recipe for the upcoming season. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta provide additional domestic data, and the Food and Drug Administration makes a final decision on what goes into the vaccine. The manufacturers then have about six months to get the recommended flu vaccine to market.Even if the vaccine hits the bullseye, different demographics have different reactions to it. Children have a very good response to the vaccine. The situation is more complicated with elderly patients, who have weaker immune systems overall but also have a lifetime buildup of natural immunity. After withstanding many flu seasons, their immune systems are wiser, you might say, than those of the young.If flu vaccines are indeed mankind’s greatest weapon against the flu, why are they used in wildly different capacities?When my colleagues gave one another the influenza vaccine at the George Washington University hospital, we were following the advice of the CDC. When patients with influenza started to roll into the emergency room a few months later, I would ask if they had received a flu shot. Many had, and yet here they were in the hospital. I knew how they felt. My only visit to the emergency department as a patient – the year I got a nasty case of the flu – was after I had been given the flu vaccine.Despite the regular failure of the vaccine, Americans are bombarded every year with reminders and opportunities to get a flu shot. By the end of August, pharmacies are posting signs and doctors’ offices are gearing up. The vaccine is offered at many workplaces and houses of worship, and hospitals require all their health care providers to be vaccinated.Behind this effort is the CDC, which recommends the flu vaccine for everyone over the age of six months. One CDC poster that caught my attention asked: “Who needs a flu vaccine? a) You, b) You, c) You, d) All of the above”. (In case you were wondering, the correct answer is d.) The poster reminded us that “even healthy people can get the flu, and it can be serious”. The message then got more explicit: “Everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine. This means you.”Recommendations about the use of vaccines in the US are made by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (Acip), a group of more than a dozen experts with backgrounds in vaccination research, public health and health policy. It meets three times a year to review any new evidence and provide advice and guidance to the director of the CDC about the use of vaccines. As recently as 2006, the committee recommended the flu vaccine only for those at high-risk for complications of influenza and adults over the age of 50. But a couple of years later it expanded its recommendations to include everyone over the age of six months. And that recommendation has remained in place ever since.The public health campaign by the CDC to vaccinate everyone is not shared by other countries. Europe and Australia recommend the vaccine only for the very young, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses. Healthy adults are simply not targeted. It’s very difficult to compare death rates from influenza across different countries because the definition of an influenza case varies, as does the way in wahich a country collects its own statistics. Often, deaths from viral influenza and bacterial pneumonia are listed together. It is challenging, therefore, to compare the data we have from the US and the UK. However, in the UK, the death rate from influenza in 2014 was 0.2 per 100,000 people. And in the US, it was 1.4 per 100,000. That is seven times higher than in the UK, a country that vaccinates far less of its population. These numbers must be interpreted with caution, but they do at least suggest that the approach in the UK is reasonable.How can we properly determine whether a “vaccination for all” programme, such as the one in the US, saves more lives and protects more people than the English “vaccination for some”? Perhaps for one flu season we could encourage everyone to get vaccinated, and for the next we would encourage only those at increased risk. We could compare the influenza death rates between the two groups and get our answer. Of course, it’s more complicated than that. Because the mortality rate from influenza is so low, we would need to enroll hundreds of thousands of patients in order to see if the vaccine made a difference. However, an experiment like this might be undermined by the strains of influenza that were circulating in each year. If one year’s strain was more contagious or deadlier than the next, our experiment would tell us nothing.We could instead collect evidence from small trials and look for trends. This method was used by the Cochrane collaboration, an international group of 37,000 medical contributors, in 2014, when they reviewed all the studies that evaluated the effects of the flu vaccine in healthy US adults. It was a large undertaking there were 90 studies that compared giving the vaccine to withholding it, and a total of 8 million patients were involved.It comes down to language. The CDC describes the flu like this in a poster intended for use in doctors’ offices: “The flu may make people cough and have a sore throat and fever. They may also have a runny or stuffy nose, feel tired, have body aches, or show other signs they are not well. The flu happens every year and is more common in the fall and winter in the US. People of all ages can get the flu, from babies and young adults, to the elderly.”Not so bad. But then this is on the homepage of the CDC’s flu site: “It can cause mild to severe illness. Serious outcomes of flu infection can result in hospitalization or death. Some people, such as older people, young children, and people with certain health conditions, are at high risk of serious flu complications. The best way to prevent the flu is by getting vaccinated each year.”At most, according to the British, influenza can be a bit of a nuisance: “Most people will make a full recovery and won’t experience any further problems, but elderly people and people with certain long-term medical conditions are more likely to have a bad case of flu or develop a serious complication, such as a chest infection.” There’s no mention of death as a complication. It’s all very “keep calm and carry on” – just like it was during the 1918 pandemic.Is the flu a killer or an irritant? We know with certainty that each year it kills many people in both the US and Britain. And we know with equal certainty that for almost all healthy people the flu is nothing but a minor annoyance. Both are correct. That’s the nature of influenza. It’s tricky and mysterious, causing discomfort in some of its victims and death in others. It’s just that the US and the UK quantify them in different ways.The British version of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee is called the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). It meets three times a year, reviews the scientific evidence and makes recommen-dations to the secretary of state for health if there is a need to change the vaccination policy. Andrew Pollard, the head of the JCVI, trained as a paediatrician and is now professor of paediatric infection and immunity at the University of Oxford. Pollard is extremely cognisant of the numerous effects of the flu, but for the JCVI, the biggest measure is cost-effectiveness.It may seem cold or callous to fixate on costs when lives are at stake, but money and resources are limited, and reckless or misdirected spending can lead to poor medical practices or greater harm. For example, spending $1m on medications for those who have had a heart attack might save 1,000 lives each year. That same $1m might have been spent instead on screenings for cervical cancer, which would save the lives of 60,000 women each year. What’s more important: saving 1,000 lives or 60,000 lives? It often comes down to who is asking (and which disease it is that you have).Andrew Pollard and his team at the JCVI looked at studies that measured the cost-effectiveness of the influenza vaccine. They concluded that given the vanishingly small number of young, healthy adults who become severely ill or die from the flu, it is not cost-effective to vaccinate this section of the population.Pollard’s committee measures the cost to the health system itself: how much the vaccine costs and how much it decreases the number of days that patients spend in hospital or in intensive care. They also estimate the vaccine’s effect on the number of flu-related visits to doctors’ offices. What they don’t measure is the wider cost to society, which includes lost labour, lost wages or the time a parent must spend taking care of a child. These, too, are burdens on society, but they do not enter into the deliberations of the JCVI. The vaccine is cost-effective to the healthcare system when it is given to children, older people, those with medical conditions and pregnant women. It is not cost-effective when given to young, healthy adults.In the US, the cost-effectiveness of the vaccine is less important. What is more important is whether or not it works. This approach has resulted in another difference in vaccination policy between the US and the UK, this time over the vaccine for chickenpox. The varicella vaccine can prevent both chickenpox and shingles, a later complication of the disease. In the US, the varicella vaccine is recommended for all children the first dose is given at 12 months of age, and a booster shot four years later. In the UK, varicella is not on the list of vaccines for children. In the US, if a vaccine has been shown to work safely, the CDC generally recommends it.At the beginning of the 1976 flu outbreak, President Gerald Ford had to choose between two perfectly sound recommendations. One was to quickly vaccinate as many people as possible, while the other was to stockpile the vaccine and wait to see whether things got worse. Ford rejected the wait-and-see approach. “We cannot afford to take a chance with the health of our nation,” he said. “Better to err on the side of overreaction than underreaction.”This is the overriding approach to healthcare in the US. They are always ready to do more, to try the latest medications or surgical procedures, because, well, why take a chance? Compared with other western countries, the US does more invasive studies of the heart for patients with chest pain, without actually improving their outcomes. We in the US put more of our patients into the intensive care unit, even though they are, on average, less sick than their counterparts abroad. We give more chemotherapy to cancer patients near the ends of their disease, even though it improves neither the quality nor the length of their lives. We do these things because we can, because to do otherwise would be considered giving up – even if doing less would be an extremely sensible and kind decision.Influenza is not cancer, and it is not heart disease. But the US approach to it is emblematic of the way it treats most diseases: doing more is better. If there is an unexhausted option, exhaust it. And because many vaccines have had spectacular success in preventing and eradicating some ghastly infectious diseases, the expectation is that the influenza vaccine will do the same. It’s another hi-tech solution. To most people, the word “vaccine” is tantamount to a guarantee that a disease will leave you alone.It’s hard to make a catchy public service announcement that reflects the subtleties therein. “Vaccinate everyone over six months old” is the current message. It is easy to understand and easy to remember. A more accurate message is much clumsier: “Vaccinate school-aged children and pregnant women and probably elderly people (but the evidence is mixed) and those with chronic conditions, but no need to vaccinate young, healthy adults.” That wouldn’t really fit on a billboard. In this case, nuance may invite danger.The quest for a better influenza vaccine continues. The holy grail would be a vaccine that covers all possible strains of influenza (so there would be no problem of mismatched vaccination) and that needs to be given only once, not every year as is now the case. Dozens of research labs across the world have worked to create this so-called universal vaccine, but so far without success. The influenza virus is just too adept at changing its disguise, remaining one step ahead of our efforts to neutralise it with a one-shot-fits-all vaccine. Although influenza is a common illness, finding an effective vaccine to prevent it remains an exceptionally challenging endeavour.Adapted from Influenza: The Quest to Cure the Deadliest Disease in History by Jeremy Brown, published by Text on 31 January at £12.99.

There is disquiet among some of its MPs and shadow ministers that backing such an option could anger leave-backing Labour voters.Wollaston argued that a second referendum was still the best option to end the Brexit deadlock. “People have a right to change their minds, and the mandate from the first referendum – over two years ago and based on entirely unrealistic promises and outright lies – has expired.”But without Labour backing, she said, “that amendment could not pass, and so with great regret we will not be laying that amendment”.Berger said that with 30 scheduled Commons sittings left before the current Brexit date, there was “an urgent need for leadership”.“Regrettably, the Labour leadership won’t commit to an achievable policy,” she said. “And yet we know that the majority of Labour voters, supporters and members want a final say on any Brexit deal. At a time when Labour should be championing a people’s vote, the leadership avoids answering that call.”More than a dozen amendments have been tabled so far to be potentially voted on next Tuesday, covering areas including extending article 50, holding non-binding, indicative votes in the Commons on the way forward, and dictating an end date for the Irish backstop.Among these is one signed by all of the Liberal Democrat MPs to back a second referendum. The party’s Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake, said: “There is still time to act in the national interest. Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour leadership must stop dreaming up more and more creative excuses for refusing to support a people’s vote, which their members and supporters want.”Not all the amendments will be selected for a vote. The choice will be made by the Commons Speaker, John Bercow. They are officially amendments to the statement made to the Commons by Theresa May on Monday following the overwhelming defeat of the PM’s Brexit plan. Such a statement, officially titled a motion in neutral terms, cannot normally be amended. However, the procedures of the house were changed after an earlier amendment by the Tory MP Dominic Grieve.

Ceredigion farmer Wyn Evans fears trouble aheadWyn Evans’s family has farmed in the hills of Ceredigion, west Wales, for five centuries. This is a remote, wet and often cold corner of the UK, a tough place to live and work but the biggest threat at the moment comes not in the shape of the winter storms.“Brexit is what’s worrying us at the moment. This is a very difficult time for farmers,” said Evans, 55, who rears sheep and cattle with his wife Nicole and son Gwynfor. “It’s a job to plan because nobody knows what’s going to happen. We’re on the cusp of lambing just now. I can’t tell you if I’ll have a lucrative market for our lambs or not. You have to carry on even though you don’t know what’s around the corner.Evans’s lambs initially go to an abattoir across the hills in Llanidloes. The prime cuts – the legs and shoulders – end up on supermarket shelves in the UK. However, the European market is vital for so-called “carcass balance” – the bits of lamb that are not so popular in the UK are exported. The meat from lighter lambs produced by Evans and his colleagues is also popular in Portugal and Italy.Brexit has already prompted Evans to reduce his flock – from around 400 to 370. “We’ve cut down on the sheep slightly,” he said. To try to compensate he has boosted the number of beef cattle he rears. “There’s a lot of young cattle around the place,” he said. The UK is a net importer of beef so Evans is calculating that the beef price may hold up. Brexit follows a difficult 12 months weather-wise for farmers such as Evans. Last March it was cold – the beast from east bit viciously here – and was followed by a hot summer. “Our spare bales went last spring. Then we had that horrendously dry summer. The grass didn’t grow well, the crops were light. We’ve got nothing to stockpile. We are struggling this winter for forage.”The longevity of his family in this area, just south-east of Aberystwyth, means Evans can put Brexit and its possible impact on farming on this spot into a historical perspective.Age-old maps and records make it is clear that grain was grown here in the 19th century when the corn laws imposed tariffs on imported food. When the corn laws were repealed by Tory Sir Robert Peel (overcoming the opposition of most of his party), it was deemed unviable to grow grain on this soggy, steep land.“What we can do very well is grow grass,” said Evans. “The most efficient way of using the land is to graze animals. That is the best way of producing a world-class protein.”Evans voted to stay in the EU. “I was an avid remainer. I’m very frustrated over how things have gone. I would have thought by now we would have had clarification. Are we going to have unfettered access to that very important market that gives my business security moving forward? We need to know. Parliament and so many iniduals within it are so indecisive. Party politics has played too much of a role. We should have had a coalition, a collaboration at the start of this process.”Evans, who votes Plaid Cymru or Liberal Democrat, said he had backed the doomed deal that Theresa May put before parliament. “For agriculture and manufacturing in Wales it was the best deal. It was a good job of a bad job. I’ve got qualms about a second referendum. If it went the same way as the previous one, I don’t know were we’d go then. We’d be in total chaos – ungovernable. No politician would know what to do. At the moment I like the look of a Norway plus deal. I don’t know if she would get that through parliament.”Evans, who is chairman of the NFU Cymru livestock board, says that if the farmers struggle, the rural economy will be harshly hit. “I spend all the money from the farm within a 20-mile radius. The feed merchants, the builders, the mechanics are all local.” The farm is run by the three family members but they also employ outside contractors to shear the sheep and cut hedges. “There are lot of people out there relying on the farmers,” he said.Evans is optimistic the farm will survive whatever Brexit brings. “We’ve been here a long, long time,” he said. “As a boy I remember following my grandfather around the farm as he did his chores. From an early age I wanted to be a farmer. Within this area this is what we do, this is who we are. Farming and the rural community is my passion. We should be proud of what we do and what we produce.”“Last winter when the beast from the east was hitting hard, most of us were about to start lambing. We looked after our animals to the highest standard even though the elements were horrific and within our communities we helped out clearing roads for no monetary gain. We did that because we’re passionate about the communities we live in. Rural communities gel when there’s a crisis. Long may it last.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1453972616579252c1150ddd959af093d18ede77/1593_825_1880_1128/master/1880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=804e207c4a08dff1bae58b355484ec43","title":"how ukip embraced the far right podcast","story":"With Brexit talks stalled and some of its supporters pushing a betrayal narrative, the ’s Peter Walker charts how Ukip has begun rising in the polls again.

Instead it urged MPs to support the various amendments intended to stop a no-deal Brexit. Explaining its position, the pro-European Conservative Guto Bebb said:None of these amendments would, in themselves, bring about a people’s vote and all of them will gain votes from MPs who currently do not support our campaign. But they would give parliament the time and space it needs, without the threat of a deadline or no deal, to make an honest assessment of different versions of Brexit.It is surely right that these are given serious consideration and that they are subject to the same minimal standards of scrutiny that has led so many MPs already to conclude they could not support the government’s plan.We believe there is no form of Brexit that can fulfil the promises made in 2016, represents a better deal than the one we’ve got inside Europe or will prevent this crisis going on forever. When every route to Brexit has been examined and exhausted will it become clear the only way forward is to hand the final decision back to the British public through a people’s vote.Nicola Sturgeon has spoken to reporters on leaving the Holyrood chamber after first minister’s questions, and she said that the news of Alex Salmond’s arrest would be “a shock to many people”. She urged the media and public to understand why she could not comment further on live criminal proceedings. She said: Obviously this news this morning will be a shock to many people but, as Police Scotland have made clear, these are now live criminal proceedings and that means, now more than ever, it would be completely inappropriate for me - or anyone else for that matter - to make any comment on the situation. And I hope both you as members of the media, and the wider public, will understand the reasons why I cannot comment any further at this stage.Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has argued strongly against holding a second referendum, my colleague Larry Elliott reports. Speaking at the CBI’s annual lunch in Davos, Hammond said it was important for trust in the political system for the 2016 vote to be respected.There is more on our Davos live blog.Labour has strongly hinted that it will back the Yvette Cooper amendment next week intended to block a no-deal Brexit if MPs cannot agree a Brexit deal, but Jeremy Corbyn said today the party will take a final decision nearer the time. During a visit to Wolverton, near Milton Keynes, he said:We will decide at the time whether we fully support it or not. I had a very good meeting, a very useful meeting, with Yvette Cooper yesterday. I understand what she is saying, there is a lot of merit in it. We, as a party, will make a decision.Under the bill, if MPs have not approved a deal by 26 February, the prime minister would be required to seek an extension of article 50 until the end of 2019.Some senior Labour figures want the bill to propose a three-month article 50 extension, not a nine-month one. This would reduce the chances of the party being accused of trying to halt Brexit. On ITV’s Peston show last night Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, admitted there was a case for three months instead of nine months. He explained:It’s relatively simple to extend until the 1st of July because the European elections and incoming MEPs don’t take up their functions until the 2nd of July and it is more difficult and legally complicated to do it for longer than that ...As to how long the extension should be, there’s room for discussion and argument. I don’t think anybody’s getting fixated by the date. What people are saying by the length of any extension, what people are saying is they recognise the difficulties if it were to be beyond the 1st of July.The House of Commons library has produced a briefing on the Cooper bill which you can read here (pdf).The Scottish parliament’s presiding officer - the Holyrood equivalent of the Commons speaker - Ken Mackintosh noted the reports of the arrest of former first minister Alex Salmond and warned MSPs that proceedings are now active at the start of this week’s first minister’s questions.Instead Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, was challenged on the record of Glasgow’s super-hospital, where it has emerged a 10-year-old boy died last month after contracting an infection linked to pigeon droppings, which was found to be a contributing factor in his death.Referring to her Brexit discussions with Theresa May yesterday afternoon, Sturgeon said that the prime minister “refused to really listen to any of the concerns we brought”, and reiterated her call for May to pause article 50 and hold a second referendum on EU membership.This is from Christina Rees, the shadow Welsh secretary, on the Airbus warning about a no-deal Brexit. (See 9.12am.)Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, has just come out of Number 10 after his talks with Theresa May. He says she should have talked to the unions earlier, he says he would like to see article 50 extended for about three months, and he backs the Labour position as set down in the amendment it has tabled for next week’s debate.He says May did not indicate that she was open to changing her mind, and he says that vindicates Jeremy Corbyn’s decision not to meet her. He says his position is different he runs a union, not a political party.He says most of the Airbus workers are Unite members. The Airbus warning this morning shows how disastrous a no-deal Brexit would be, he says.Richard Harrington, the business minister, said this morning he was “delighted” when he read the boss of Airbus branding the UK government’s handling of Brexit a “disgrace”. Speaking to an audience of German industrialists, he said that no deal must be stopped and he was prepared to be sacked for saying so. This is a disaster for business and business needs to know where it is, and that doesn’t mean, ‘Oh great, two weeks before we are leaving, now we can rule out crashing out.’I really don’t believe in this idea. I am very happy to be public about it and very happy if the prime minister decides I am not the right person to do the business industry job.Harrington, who has previously said that a no-deal Brexit would be “an absolute disaster” and that he would resign if the government opted for one, was speaking at a gathering of German Industry UK at the German industry in London.He said Brexit was already threatening jobs in the car industry.I do believe time is of the essence here.It is quite reasonable to expect if they know they can bring them in or not. This is not theory, this is real time.Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said Theresa May should delay Brexit until at least July to allow time for further talks. Speaking to journalists after meeting May in Number 10 to discuss the issue, he said:It is in everyone’s interest to extend article 50 until at least the summer.He also said he wanted May to “move away from appeasing the right wing of the Tory party” and considering the interests of the “just about managing” families she spoke about when she first became prime minister. He said:Most of our members are just about managing. They cannot afford for this country to fall off a cliff.Earlier I flagged up an Irish Independent story saying the Irish police had drawn up emergency plans to deploy hundreds of uniformed gardaí at the border with Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit. (See 10.02pm.) It has now been denied.At business questions in the Commons Valerie Vaz, the shadow leader of the Commons, asked if the February half-term recess was still going ahead. There have been repeated reports saying it will be abandoned, because MPs will need more time to pass Brexit legislation.Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, said the half-term recess has not been cancelled - or, at least, not yet. She said the plan for the House to rise on Thursday 14 February and return on Monday 24 February “is and does remain the position”. But she said this would have to be confirmed by a Commons vote, meaning there is still time for the mini recess to be abandoned.Ireland will have 400 new customs officers in place by the end of March as it rushes to put no-deal measures in place to keep trade moving with Great Britain, according to an unpublished document from the Irish tax authority. My colleague Lisa O’Carroll has the story here.In the Commons the Labour MP Chris Leslie asked an urgent question about whether the government would replicate the trade deals that the UK benefits from as a member of the EU in time for Brexit on 29 March.Claiming the government was willing to allow “catastrophic disruption” to UK trade, Leslie said:Will he face reality, slay those fantasy unicorn promises and admit that Brexit is not going well and presents a clear and present danger to the free trade agreements our economy so desperately relies on?In response, the international trade minister George Hollingbery said he could not reveal “confidential conversations” of talks on trade agreements. But he insisted: I believe the majority of those will be in place by March 29th and I continue to believe that is the case.And here is the formal statement that the TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady issued after her Brexit meeting with Theresa May earlier. (See 11.03am.) O’Grady said:The prime minister hasn’t given us the guarantees we need on jobs or workers’ rights. Tweaks aren’t enough - we need substantial change to the whole deal.But even after a catastrophic defeat, her red lines haven’t shifted, and the threat of no deal hasn’t even been taken off the table.And if she won’t change her position, how can we change ours?Speaking to Reuters, Blair said if the country went ahead with Brexit, the choice was “very, very difficult”. There were two options, he said:A Brexit that’s pointless - staying close to Europe’s rules, becoming a rule taker - or a Brexit that’s painful, if you break out of the European system that we’d been trading in for four and a half decades. The reason we’ve got this problem in the British parliament is that the real options have dawned on the members of parliament and therefore there’s not really a majority at the moment for any Brexit proposition. There’s not yet a majority for a second referendum but I think it’s possible there will be.Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said she did not get the assurances she was hoping for on workers’ rights in her meeting at Number 10 with Theresa May. Speaking to reporters as she left, she said:The prime minister should do the right thing and take a no-deal off the table so that genuine dialogue can take place.I was looking for guarantees on workers’ rights now and into the future. We have a prime minister on a temporary contract- she cannot bind the hands of a future prime minister. People wanting her job are on record as saying Brexit is an opportunity to reduce workers’ rights.The prime minister should stop listening to the bad boys at the back of the class. More time is needed for genuine talks.Although the MPs backing the People’s Vote campaign are not going to table their second referendum amendment ahead of the Brexit vote next week, the Lib Dems have tabled an amendment calling for one.Line 1, leave out from “House” to end and add “instructs the government to take all necessary steps to rule out a no-deal scenario and prepare for a people’s vote in which the public will have the option to remain in the European Union on the ballot paper.Commenting on his party’s move, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said:For over two years the Liberal Democrats have been leading the charge for a people’s vote. We know people are increasing concerned about the national embarrassment Brexit has become, which is why we have tabled an amendment that would give people the final say on Brexit.There is still time to act in the national interest. Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour leadership must stop dreaming up more and more creative excuses for refusing to support a people’s vote, which their members and supporters want.The Lib Dems are hoping that other MPs who back a second referendum, particularly from Labour, will support their amendment.But so far the only MPs how have signed it are Lib Dem MPs.Although the Lib Dem amendment is on the order paper (pdf), there is no guarantee that it will be called. John Bercow, the speaker, takes into account the amount of support there is for amendments when deciding which ones to put to a vote and there are already 14 amendments on the order paper (far more than he will call), most of which have more support than the Lib Dem one.A second referendum backed by MPs supporting the People’s Vote campaign would have had a much greater chance of being put to a vote because it would have been cross-party and would, even without the official backing of the Labour party, have received the backing of dozens of Labour MPs.Here is the full statement from Sarah Wollaston on the decision not to table the second referendum amendment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebb573281467845123c913d9421c2a30fed36dbb/0_0_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02c7b6e3c51370d323220fac24c7a5cd","title":"young people how do you feel about your future","story":"With 18-year-olds watching the outcome of Brexit unravel in front of them, we want to hear what you thinkFor years, it has been assumed that young people do not vote, do not take part in politics, and do not care.

This examination was more physical than mental.On a blistering hot Thursday afternoon, she turned back the cooler, more orthodox challenge of Pliskova, an elegant and dangerous foe in tight corners, who was rattled by Osaka’s astonishing onslaught in the first set and, after mounting a fightback to level, could not crack her defence in the third.Pliskova was effusive later in her praise of Osaka: “She played an unbelievable match – to be honest, maybe the best in her life. I don’t think she can repeat a match like this. I don’t think I actually did much wrong. I had some chances, of course I had. But the chances, they were not in my hands at all. There was not much I could do.”Osaka, never less than candid, smiled and responded: “I don’t necessarily think I played the best I’ve ever played. What I take away from this is that I never gave up. That’s something that I’m really proud of.”If Osaka holds her resolve in the final against two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova on Saturday, she will make a statement that would lift her from precocious and interesting newcomer to recognised elite champion.When it became obvious early in their semi-final that Pliskova could not do to Osaka what she had done to Williams, the final, the tournament and the game in general took on a different complexion. Osaka is not just a lovable cross-culture kid with a vigorous, high-level game and nice line in post-match quotes. She has matured into a threat to everyone in women’s tennis, here and across the Tour.In the earlier semi-final, the first reality check of the day kicked in. Danielle Collins had served an acceptable 11 double-faults in her first five matches, but added two in the space of four games, the nerves of a big occasion strangling her best work. Kvitova, bringing bigger weapons in all departments, attacked her second serve relentlessly, but Collins found a way to stay on level terms after four games.They exchanged breaks in-mid-set, but in the clink and shift of gears that control the roof above, an outdoor tournament went indoors at four-all. The beating sun had pushed the thermometer to 35C (it would continue on to near 40C) and into the tournament’s danger zone – but there was still plenty of heat coming off both rackets.It will be hotter on Saturday, Much hotter. But the debate about use of the roof is not as simple as some would suggest. Of course, the health of the players is paramount, as is that of the officials and ballkids – although the latter live in this heat. It is not as novel to them as it might be to visitors from the northern hemisphere. If the roof is to be used, it should be to the guidelines already set, not the emotional whim of concerned onlookers.Kvitova grew up in the Czech Republic and, as they progressed in the protective enclosure created by the roof switch, she looked increasingly more comfortable against the Floridian, who is used to the sunny conditions.Collins was perfectly within her rights to insist later: “It is what it is. That’s what they do, no matter what the situation is. If it’s really hot, they need to start the match the way it’s going to finish. It certainly changed a little bit of the rhythm in the match. Honestly, I like playing in the heat. Don’t get me wrong, it certainly has its challenges. I grew up in Florida and am used to it being really hot all the time. So I embrace that very well. Indoor tennis is a different game.”Collins, who does not hide her emotions, gave the chair umpire Carlos Ramos grief over a legitimate ruling on Kvitova’s serve, but should have trained her frustration at Kvitova, who now punished her short balls to take the first set.Collins’s discipline slipped again at the start of the second, arguing an unwinnable point with Ramos, then changing rackets for no apparent reason with two break points against her. She saved the first but dumped a backhand, and Kvitova started to ease clear.Kvitova brought all her pedigree and experience to bear now on her rattled opponent, racing to then serving out the match."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65eea1e3ee449ac43d567b81587f1385bb4bde76/155_417_2415_1450/master/2415.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6391e61736c99bf64a4f6b1e8769915f","title":"rafael nadal dismantles stefanos tsitsipas to reach australian open final","story":"John McEnroe does not get a lot wrong. However, when he suggested a few days ago that Stefanos Tsitispas’s victory over Roger Federer might represent a changing of the guard, he momentarily forgot the championship heart and pedigree of Rafael Nadal, who will play in his fifth Australian Open final on Sunday after slaying the young Greek on a warm Melbourne evening.Nadal, the 2009 champion, could well win his second title here, drawing him to within two majors of Federer’s 20 slams, and inviting speculation that, if he were to go on to prevail at Roland Garros (one of the safest bets in tennis), he would arrive at Wimbledon staring history in the face again. The guard is not for changing just yet.The 32-year-old Spaniard – who retired injured in the quarter-finals last year – has arrived back in the harsh southern limelight by beating a couple of Australian underdogs in James Duckworth and Matthew Ebden, then set about their fledgling compatriot Alex de Minaur, before trouncing his old foe Tomas Berdych and, to get to Thursday’s semi-final, the ebullient ball of American energy Frances Tiafoe.All of that occupied Nadal less than 10 and a half hours and 15 sets. He spent only an hour and 46 minutes accounting for the tired but willing challenge of Tsitsipas, the player hailed, by McEnroe and many others, as the leader of the new wave.Nadal won 6-2, 6-4, 6-0 and has not looked as dominant at this stage of a slam since Roland Garros last year even on his favourite surface there, he lost a set, to Diego Schwartzman. This is his first run to a slam final without dropping a set since the 2017 French Open.Yet there were reasons to wonder. Three weeks ago, he pulled out of the Brisbane International to rest a thigh strain, a sorry continuation of his wretched run of injuries in 2018, when he played in only nine tournaments as fault lines in his hip, knee, abdomen and ankle threatened to bring his career to a painful close.Yet here he is again, winning a semi-final on a hard court – and persuading McEnroe, in his role as courtside jester, to now praise him as the nemesis of the Next Gen pretenders.“They don’t need any message,” Nadal said. “They are good, improving every month. It is always a big challenge to play against them. There is a new and very good generation coming. They are here now.”He said of Tsitsipas, who has had a remarkable tournament: “He’s brave, goes to the net often. He has everything to be a multi-grand slam champion. I hope to play him again in the next couple of years.”He added: “A few weeks ago in Brisbane, talking to the tournament director there, I had to take a very tough decision. It was difficult to imagine then that I would be where I am now. I feel really, really well.”Tsitsipas, who had taken 15 hours and 31 minutes to reach his first slam semi-final, signalled his intentions early, serve-volleying with brio. But Nadal struck first when he forced an uncontrolled backhand from Tsitsipas that lobbed in the tramlines. He broke again then ground out the points to take the set in half an hour.Tsitsipas, having taken care of business brilliantly against Federer, was discovering that backing up against the player who may go on to secure as many slams as the Swiss genius, was no straightforward exercise.The 20-year-old Greek tennis classicist with the flowing locks and the single-handed backhand was shattered but philosophical later.“I have no idea what I can take from that match,” he said. “It’s not that I was even close to getting to something. I only got six games. I feel very strange. I feel happy with my performance in this tournament but, at the same time, I feel disappointed. It’s a very weird feeling. It’s annoying that I didn’t get close to breaking him. He’s very aggressive from the baseline.“It felt like a different dimension of tennis. He gives you no rhythm. He plays just a different game style than the rest of the players. He has this talent that no other player has. I’ve never seen a player have this. He makes you play bad.”Awaiting Nadal will be either Novak Djokovic, whom he has beaten 25 times in 52 matches, or Lucas Pouille, who has won one of their three encounters. Djokovic and Pouille meet in the second semi-final on Friday.Djokovic, the world No 1 still unless Nadal wins on Sunday, knows better than most that this first major of the season can change careers. He said after Kei Nishikori quit injured in their quarter-final: “This was my first grand slam trophy back when I was 20 years old, and that opened a lot of doors for me. That was a huge confidence boost, a springboard for the rest of my career.”He said of Pouille: “It’s his first semi-final at a slam but he has won against Nadal in New York some years ago, and he’s made a couple of advances at the big tournaments. He’s not afraid to play his best at the biggest stage in sports. I expect him to come out, be very confident – as he always is.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a430250ba6c0bcde7ba5c22baf40e72487e007b1/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e997d2d2a8435cc547a284f0ff410055","title":"five things every aspiring vegan should have in their kitchen","story":"From flax seeds to coconut oil, these ingredients will make your Veganuary easy and deliciousIt’s a common misconception that being vegan is both tricky and dull. The truth is, there are simple food switches we can make to eat fewer animal products, and with the likes of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s introducing non-dairy versions of some of its most popular flavours, being vegan is now easier than ever.Here are five simple store cupboard updates that will help you be a little more vegan …Flax seedsThe sheer number of things you can use flax seeds for is, quite frankly, mind-boggling.First off, flax eggs. One tablespoon of ground flax seeds mixed with 2-3 tablespoons of warm water becomes a mixture that has the same texture and volume as egg white. You can use these flax eggs in place of chicken’s eggs when binding bakes or adding body to things such as pancakes.Ground flax seeds are also a powerful thickening agent for everything from porridge oats to pasta sauces. Adding a subtle nutty taste and a slightly crunchy texture, they work best with deep flavours such as curries.What makes flax seeds even more essential for vegans is that they contain omega-3, the same kind of good fats you get from oily fish. These oils are essential for optimal brain function, blood flow and can even help reduce the risk of heart disease, so if you’re not getting enough flax seeds in your diet, now’s a great time to start.Keep them whole, boil them with some water and you can even make your own glue or hair gel with them – check out the videos online if you don’t believe us.A word of warning: once ground, flax seeds start to lose their beneficial properties over time, so if you buy them whole, grind them up in a smoothie maker and store them in the fridge. That way, you’ll get the most from these mighty, mini seeds.ChickpeasWhen we say chickpeas, you probably think hummus, and rightly so. Hummus has become a firm favourite in the UK over the past decade, enhancing mealtimes as a condiment and serving up a time-saving savoury snack when combined with veggies or pitta bread.If you have a blender and have never made hummus, you’re missing a trick. It’s a whizz – just blitz a can of chickpeas with a tablespoon or two of tahini, olive oil, lemon juice and salt, then add a teaspoon of water at a time until it all turns into that wonderfully familiar, rich, pale, hummusy-textured gloop.Chickpeas aren’t just tasty, though – they’re an excellent source of complex carbs and fibre.And whatever you do with your can of chickpeas, don’t throw away the water. Known as aquafaba, this juice is rich in starch and is a great egg replacement for making meringues or macarons.Pasta sauceWe’re all busy people, and having a staple, cost-effective “meal in minutes” recipe can be the difference between success and failure when embarking on a new diet. What’s handy is that vegan quick fixes can be pretty similar to non-vegan ones, with a piping hot, saucy bowl of pasta being up there with the best of them.Other than puttanesca, which contains anchovies, most jars of tomato-based pasta sauces are free of animal product.Nutritional yeastThe name might make you think of baking and bread, but unlike traditional yeast, nutritional yeast is deactivated, so it doesn’t rise when warmed and wet. It has a distinctly nutty, cheesy taste and looks a lot like fish food flakes.An insider vegan secret for a long time, these tart, deep and earthy-tasting flakes can be sprinkled over pasta as a parmesan replacement, combined with probiotics, ground cashews and agar-agar – a vegan gelatine substitute – to make vegan cheese. They’re also excellent in a crumb coating when whizzed up with some flax seeds.Coconut oilIn a world with no dairy, coconut oil reigns supreme as the most indulgent alternative around. Combined with almond butter and some agave, it’s a sweet, satisfying snack. Melted and ready to get sizzly, it’s the base flavour for the richest stir-fries and curries. And if you’re using cold-pressed coconut oil in baking, it adds a creamy, subtly tropical aroma and taste to everything from brownies to cookies.Melting at around 24C (76F), it tends to stay solid at room temperature in most climates, and in a similar way to cocoa butter, becomes liquid when melted in our hands or mouth.In addition, cold-pressed oil – the pricier variety – can raise levels of good cholesterol. Meanwhile, the cheaper, standard coconut oil carries no coconut flavour, so is an excellent, versatile fat for cooking coconut flavour-free dishes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80e5a1c12521a64d3cea857c1fac9bf31f03c908/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f3c52250fb85d6c5d9ee704d215fa2bb 1400w","title":"from ice cream to nice cream the inside scoop on the ice cream revolutionaries","story":" In 1978, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield set out to make ice-cream with a difference. Here’s how Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s is still pushing boundaries and fighting for change 40 years laterWhen Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield first set up shop in an old petrol station in Burlington, Vermont, in 1978, selling scoops of homemade ice-cream, they wanted to build a company that cared as much about people as profits.Since then, their tiny ice-cream business has become a global brand whose famous flavours, including Cookie Dough and Cherry Garcia, are sold in 35 countries. Yet, Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s ethos remains the same: to “make great ice-cream in the nicest possible way”.It’s a belief that is central to everything the brand does, from its social activism to constant experimentation with new flavours. The ethos inspired Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s line of non-dairy ice-creams that was launched in the UK in 2017 to a rapturous reception from vegans. The flavours – Chunky Monkey, Chocolate Fudge Brownie and Peanut Butter \u0026amp Cookies and the new flavour Coconutterly Caramel’d – are just as inventively delicious as the brand’s dairy creations.For Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s employees, honouring the goals of its co-founders – who remain advisers to the company since being bought by Unilever in the year 2000 – is vital. “Right from the start, Cohen and Greenfield wanted the business to be a force for good,” says Rebecca Baron, the brand’s social mission manager. “Four decades on, we’re still guided by their values.”Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s three-pronged approach – making excellent ice-cream achieving financial success and using the brand to make the world a better place – stems back to ideas developed by Cohen and Greenfield in the company’s early days.The company works with social enterprises, such as Greyston Bakery in New York, which supplies the brownies that make the Chocolate Fudge Brownie flavour so enticing. “They employ people with criminal records, homeless people, recovering addicts and vulnerable women – people who are finding it hard to get a job,” says Baron. “They offer subsidised housing and healthcare to their workers.”Once Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s popularity began to grow, it quickly realised that it could use its platform to campaign on social issues. It was a discovery born of a David and Goliath tussle with its rival, Häagen-Dazs.“Greenfield had the idea to pack the ice-cream into pint-sized containers and sell it in convenience stores, but Pillsbury, who owned Häagen-Dazs, didn’t like this at all,” says Baron. “They threatened all their stores with exclusivity clauses, saying they could stock one, but not both. Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s didn’t have the resources to fight it in the courts, so Greenfield created a one-man picket outside the Pillsbury headquarters. Pictures of him were everywhere. They managed to mobilise hundreds of thousands of people to put pressure on Pillsbury to back down, which they eventually did.”The same principle is applied to its latest campaigns on issues including climate change, marriage equality, racism and refugees. The brand is currently running a company-wide campaign, lobbying the UK government to allow asylum seekers the right to work. “At the moment, they’re banned, which means people can be living in poverty for years,” says Baron. “We’re using every tool we have as a business to mobilise our fans to help us create systemic change.”One area the brand is pouring a lot of effort into is reducing its carbon footprint. Its caring dairy programme has more than 300 participating farms in the US and Europe. “The idea is that the farms that Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s offers support to have to meet high environmental standards,” says Baron. “The company is always working to move into increasingly sustainable farming practices and improve its emissions.”The launch of its almond milk-based non-dairy range – with more flavours set to arrive in Britain in 2019 – is a way to offer a lower-emission alternative to the increasing numbers of people who aren’t necessarily vegan, but want to make more ethical food choices. “So many people want to reduce their personal carbon footprint, so it’s great to give people that flexibility,” she says.And for those who are vegan, or lactose intolerant, the range aims to prove that it needn’t mean missing out. One of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s key principles is inclusion, which its non-dairy range fits into perfectly. “We wanted to offer people who can’t – or have chosen not to – eat dairy ice-cream, an alternative that is just as good as the dairy version,” she says. “We wanted to make sure they get some love, too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8bc71bface7ef6903bde9854f48c8988b922630/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f948dcdbaf8026e4e43892e7df17b71a","title":"theres never been a better time to be vegan","story":"With restaurants, chefs and well-known brands introducing more vegan options than ever, sticking to a plant-based diet is now both simple and indulgent, says Club Mexicana’s Meriel Armitage A decade ago, when I decided to go vegan for ethical reasons, the word “decadent” was one you’d never have used to describe the food available. More often than not, it fitted the joyless stereotype of lentils, quinoa and tofu, with the occasional Linda McCartney vegan sausage to liven things up. Now, though, ask a vegan what they ate last night and they’re likely to say anything from pizza topped with gooey melted “cheese” to crispy fried “chicken” or pulled jackfruit burritos. The vegan scene has truly exploded, introducing food that’s exciting, colourful and indulgent, whether you’re vegan or not.When I launched my pop-up, Club Mexicana, in 2012 I wanted to challenge the boringly virtuous chickpea and chia seed perception of veganism. Inspired by my travels in the US, where vegan food is innovative and delicious, I wanted to prove that being vegan doesn’t mean missing out.I realised the joy of Mexican food doesn’t stem from the meat, but the bold, punchy flavours created by salsas and pickles – the meat is just a carrier for those flavours. We try to be as creative as possible with our dishes, which include tacos with baja “tofish” – tofu fish – and roasted cornbread with pecan mole, smoked soya yoghurt, pickled pear and smoked tomato. When we first started holding supper clubs, a lot of people didn’t even notice the food was vegan, which is what I wanted.Over the past few years, vegan ingredients have evolved rapidly, which has helped vegan cooking to become as exciting as it is. Vegan cheese used to be terrible, but now you can buy everything from vegan blue cheese and camembert to cheddar and ricotta – all tasting as piquant and decadently creamy as the real thing. At Club Mexicana, we serve deep-fried “mozzarella” sticks made with coconut oil, which are crispy on the outside and oozingly melty in the middle.People also often wrongly assume that going vegan will mean depriving themselves of indulgent desserts and treats, but that’s no longer the case either. The naughtiest dish we offer is deep-fried ice-cream doused in chocolate sauce – it really doesn’t get more indulgent than that.More and more restaurants are offering innovative vegan menus. Supermarkets now stock an amazing range of vegan food that’s expanding all the time. Brands, such as Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s, are constantly bringing out new vegan products that are causing a buzz outside, as well as inside, the vegan world.There’s never been a better time to be vegan, or just to introduce more plant-based alternatives into your everyday diet. With so many amazing colours, textures and flavours on offer, you never need to feel you’re depriving yourself of the food you love."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da22c2d97abb78fa84079c25154eb6dd387da884/193_105_1194_716/master/1194.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86c498a7c0126c8f5b84185440829a69","title":"can i buy a monitor for photo editing that shows colour like print","story":"Pa wants the screen image to be true to the print image, but his budget is only £300I read your answer about the best computer monitor for under £200. I’m looking for a monitor for serious photo editing. I want to get as true to what the print will be like (when printing via online printers). My budget is about £300. PaSad to say, prints can never look like screen images. Screens are bright and display colours using combinations of red, green and blue pixels (RGB). Prints don’t light up so they can’t have the same brightness or contrast range, and they’re printed using cyan, yellow, magenta and black inks (CMYK).Colours are also affected by the light under which you view things, which is why smart buyers take clothes and materials to shop doorways to see what the colours look like in daylight. Do you do the same thing when viewing prints? A print viewed under warm room lighting should not look the same as it does on a monitor set to the standard daylight colour temperature of 6500K, even though your brain will automatically try to compensate for the difference.Nonetheless, photographers can learn from experience of how colours are going to be reproduced, as long as the process is consistent. I was obliged to do this in the days before personal computing, when I edited photography magazines. Today’s DSLR cameras produce images that are much like the colour slides we used to view on lightboxes, so happily this skill has transferred. However, the more variables you can eliminate, the better your guesses should be. This is where colour gamuts, screen calibration, printer profiles and, yes, standard light sources can help.I’ve never actually tried this, but I imagine the monitor display would be disappointing. You’d have reduced the brightness and contrast range, and most people like bright, contrasty screens.I’m also not sure how well this would work when using an online printer rather than your own ink-jet. If they do their own colour profiling, their software might try to compensate for yours. You could certainly ask if their printer will respect your colour management profiles (there are “preserve embedded profiles” settings for RGB and CMYK in Adobe Photoshop), but affordable colour printing is based on a high level of automation.If your monitor produces accurate colour and the printer produces accurate colour, then the results ought to be predictable, even though the images are not identical. This is the device-independent solution that underlies the traditional answer, which is to buy a monitor with an accurate colour profile. The main ones are standard sRGB and Adobe RGB. Of course, for this to work, the whole reproduction chain must follow the same standard.The argument for using Adobe RGB is that it’s wider and includes most of the colours that a CMYK printer can print. That should be better. The argument for using 8-bit sRGB is that practically every device supports it well, and some devices don’t support anything else.If you’re producing images for internet distribution and on-screen viewing, I think you are better off sticking to sRGB. If you’re producing images for some form of printing, there’s an argument for using Adobe RGB, as long as you can be sure it will be printed that way. You’d have to check this with your online printing service. The websites I looked at all requested sRGB.Another advantage of using sRGB is that it sets a lower standard that cheap monitors can meet, though better Adobe RGB scores generally indicate a better quality monitor.It’s well over budget, but you could spend several hours a day looking at it for the next five years, or more. The price difference is only £30 a year.DisplayMate Technologies is an industry leader in the business of evaluating, calibrating and optimising displays, and Raymond Soneira – founder, president and CEO – benchmarks some flagship products for colour accuracy. His tests show that the Apple iPhone X and XS Max, Google’s Pixel 3 XL and Samsung’s Galaxy S9 and Note 9 smartphones “all provide close to textbook perfect calibration accuracy and performance that is visually indistinguishable from perfect”. They’re almost certainly better than any TV or monitor you own.Colour-accurate tablets include the Samsung Galaxy Tab S and the Apple iPad Pro 9.7 (2016). The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 also impressed: it was the best ever tablet display when tested, though since surpassed.Today, the simplest way to check a photo’s colour rendering is to view it on one of DisplayMate’s top-rated smartphones or tablets, preferably on an OLED or AMOLED screen.

At the same time it was funded by the British foreign office, the thinktank received substantial funding from three multinational tobacco companies.The actions of the high commission raise questions about whether diplomats went against guidelines to “limit interactions” with the tobacco industry, following previous criticism of diplomatic support for the tobacco industry abroad. Both British and American diplomatic missions funded the thinktank, the Kuala Lumpur-based Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs (Ideas), while it argued against tobacco taxes and plain packaging. The UK enacted plain packaging in 2014. The news follows a  analysis of free-market thinktanks around the world which have taken position aligned with the tobacco industry. Many thinktanks argued they recognize the risks of smoking, were independent and opposed ineffective regulation, not all tobacco regulation. The analysis revealed at least 106 free-market thinktanks around the world took positions aligned with the tobacco industry in the last decade, accepted donations from the tobacco industry or both. Reporting by the Observer last year has also shown how how the Foreign Office championed British American Tobacco’s interests abroad.A spokesperson for the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) told the : “The British high commission in Malaysia has not and does not co-finance or partner in any way with tobacco companies, or support projects which promote tobacco use.“All FCO-led programmes follow the standards set out by HM Treasury. They receive robust scrutiny to ensure that all spend represents value for money for UK taxpayers and advances the UN’s sustainable development goals and our foreign policy objectives.”Mary Assunta, senior policy adviser at the Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance (Seatca), said: “Ideas jumped into tobacco control only recently and was making policy statements that echoed the tobacco industry’s position.“When a group or a consultant uses certain familiar buzz words and pushes anti-health proposals, look deeper, and you will find the link to the tobacco industry.”In response to questions from the , Ideas said it followed “a strict policy of editorial independence”, and “thus no donations influence our research and analytical outputs”.In 2016, Ideas started commenting on tobacco control in Malaysia. In one example, the group’s then executive director, Wan Saiful Wan Jan, wrote a column in the national newspaper the Star criticizing the Malaysian health department’s push for plain packaging.“I don’t smoke and I get annoyed if people smoke near me,” he wrote. “But notwithstanding my attitude towards smoking, paternalistic government behaviour is more dangerous and must be rejected when we see it.”Plain packaging laws remove advertising from cigarette packs to encourage smokers to quit and deter young people from starting. The laws are part of a broader movement to control tobacco use.\u0026nbspAustralia first enacted plain packaging in 2012\u0026nbspand immediately found itself in the crosshairs of the tobacco industry, which argued plain packaging violated international trade agreements, infringed on commercial speech and is\u0026nbspineffective at reducing smoking. This analysis shows tobacco companies also funded free-market thinktanks, many of which opposed plain packaging.Tobacco taxes increase the price of cigarettes, meant to encourage smokers to quit and make cigarettes unaffordable to young people. Taxes are the most effective, yet least utilized, tobacco control tool. The biggest hurdle to enacting taxes, experts say, is the industry’s well-funded opposition.Cigarette makers argue taxes fuel black market smuggling and counterfeit production. In turn, cigarette companies and their allies say increased taxes cause violence, revenue loss and lead to more harmful cigarettes. Tobacco control experts have found companies exaggerate smuggling evidence, and groups such as the Fraser Institute often echo those concerns.In one study, an International Agency for Research in Cancer expert panel found tax avoidance does not wipe out the public health benefits of increased tobacco taxes. Researchers from the International Union Against Cancer also suggested “tobacco manufacturers are the chief beneficiaries of smuggling.Clean indoor air laws ban smoking inside, because secondhand smoke can cause smoking-related illnesses. Tobacco companies oppose these laws on the grounds they negatively impact businesses, infringe on inidual rights and are based on junk science. Although bars, restaurants and workplaces ban smoking indoors in the US and Europe, many developing countries have not.  found several thinktanks used these arguments to oppose clean indoor air laws in places such as Ghana and Hong Kong.\u0026nbspIn June 2016, Seatca warned the British high commission in Malaysia that Ideas was “mouthing the same arguments used by the tobacco industry in the UK”. Nevertheless, the high commission increased funding in 2017. The British government’s contribution grew from £46,552 ($60,299) in 2016 to £72,820 ($94,324) in 2017. That nearly made the British high commission the group’s largest funder, second only to the philanthropic arm of the Malaysian transportation conglomerate Sime Darby.At the same time, Ideas received donations from Philip Morris Singapore, Philip Morris Malaysia and Japan Tobacco International. Between 2016 and 2017, the three tobacco companies donated £42,411. British American Tobacco also said it “supports” Ideas.The British high commission provided funding to Ideas just a few years after British diplomats were criticized for aiding BAT in Pakistan and Panama, according to the Financial Times.As a result, rules established in 2013 forbade diplomats from lobbying “against any local administration’s policies that are aimed at improving public health, or engage with foreign governments on behalf of the tobacco industry”.The new rules stated diplomats “should limit interactions with the tobacco industry, including any person or organization that is likely to be working to further the interests of the tobacco industry”.Ideas received donations from the US National Endowment for Democracy (Ned) and the International Republican Institute (IRI), both groups which receive most of their funding from the American government.Ned, which gave Ideas $80,000, said it was “unaware of the funding from tobacco groups” or Ideas’s “comments on tobacco related policy in local Malaysian media”. Ned no longer funds Ideas. Ned said it provided funding to a number of other free-market focused thinktanks as recently as this year. At least four opposed plain packaging of cigarettes, including the Policy Research Institute of Market Economy in Pakistan, the Samriddhi Foundation of Nepal, the Libertarian Club Libek in Serbia and the Free Market Foundation of South Africa. Ned and IRI said its donations were not related to tobacco policy.In the US, foreign donations to American thinktanks have come under scrutiny as a form of potential lobbying.While Ideas disclosed its donors, many free-market thinktanks do not, including some which received funding from western diplomats. For example, the influential Ghanaian thinktank Imani Centre for Policy and Education argued so vociferously against tobacco control that the nation’s health department quoted local activists as saying Imani was an organization which “fronts for the tobacco industry” in an official report to the WHO. Imani told the  the last tobacco industry donation it received was roughly four years ago.In one 2012 editorial, Imani’s leader argued the link between lung cancer and smoking has “yet to be empirically established”. Imani told the  it no longer denies smoking causes lung cancer. Nevertheless, the Danish embassy made Imani a key partner in an effort to modernize the Ghana Revenue Authority, providing it with more than £656,000 ($849,716).The authority of thinktanks, Barrington said, “lies in, ‘You can believe me, because I have independent research here.’ If that is compromised, people stop listening to you. You might as well go straight to the tobacco company.”In large part, tobacco companies told the  they supported like-minded organizations, like many other businesses.A spokesperson for Philip Morris International said: “We have worked, and will continue to work, with carefully selected organizations around the world who share our desire to promote policies that produce meaningful public health improvements. It is absolutely ridiculous to imply that supporting an organization would result in a group taking action they otherwise would fundamentally oppose.”Sam Cleverly, group head of corporate affairs at BAT, said: “Like many other companies, we support like-minded organizations on issues that are important to our business and our consumers.“We believe publicly elected officials should be allowed to hear all sides of any debate when formulating policy and should be trusted to make informed decisions once they have heard and considered all the arguments.”Jonathan Duce, head of external affairs for Japan Tobacco, said: “It is clear to everyone that there are health risks associated with smoking – we are fully transparent about this.” He continued: “We are not alone in our thinking and various groups across the world share our view that any regulation, tobacco-related or not, if untested and unproven, could have seriously negative knock-on effects.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7438e63d5299a0e7c8acf2b68cd559286d7f9d27/0_67_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9300984925e9cd03cf51aab83105254","title":"military buildup in arctic as melting ice reopens northern borders","story":"As ice melts and shipping lanes open up, geopolitical tensions are growing and old cold war bases are being reopenedThe climate crisis is intensifying a new military buildup in the Arctic, diplomats and analysts said this week, as regional powers attempt to secure northern borders that were until recently reinforced by a continental-sized ision of ice.That so-called unpaid sentry is now literally melting away, opening up shipping lanes and geo-security challenges, said delegates at the Arctic Frontiers conference, the polar circle’s biggest talking shop, who debated a series of recent escalations.Russia is reopening and strengthening cold war bases on the Kola peninsula in the far north-west of the country. Norway is beefing up its military presence in the high Arctic.Last October, Nato staged Trident Juncture with 40,000 troops, its biggest military exercise in Norway in more than a decade. A month earlier Britain announced a new “Defence Arctic Strategy” and promised a 10-year deployment of 800 commandos to Norway and four RAF Typhoons to patrol Icelandic skies. The US is also sending hundreds more marines to the region on long-term rotations and has threatened to send naval vessels through Arctic shipping lanes for the first time.While these strategic moves have echoes of the cold war, the modest buildup falls far short of that era, and there remains a strong spirit of cooperation in many areas. The current tensions are a result of a world warmed by industrial emissions. The Arctic is heating up twice as fast as the rest of the planet, shrinking sea ice and exposing more water and territory to exploitation and access.“Right now, the reasons we are seeing more military activity is that countries are worried by the spectre of open water,” one of the speakers, Klaus Dodds, a professor of geopolitics at Royal Holloway, University of London, told the . “The unique Arctic security architecture has shape and form that come from natural extremities. If the Arctic becomes just another ocean, this breaks down. It’s elemental.”The Arctic’s unique characteristics are under attack from all sides. Below, the once-frozen ocean is now mixed with warmer, more saline Atlantic waters. In the skies above, the polar vortex above is weakening, allowing intrusions of balmy air currents from the south.Sea ice is being lost at a rate of more than 10,000 tonnes per second, according to Tore Furevik, a professor at the Geophysical Institute at the University of Bergen. “We’re heading for a new and uncertain Arctic with ramifications for nature and politics,” he said. “We should strive to be less suspicious, less hostile and more open-minded if we are to deal with a problem that we have so recklessly created.”By 2035, the Arctic is forecast to be free of ice during summer, which will allow ships to sail across the north pole.Business interest is growing. For the first time, last summer, a Maersk container ship navigated the northern sea route from Asia to Europe carrying fish and electronic goods. Energy companies are exploring new oil and gas fields.Once remote regions are becoming geopolitical hotspots. Tromsø, in Norway, which hosted the conference, was once a tiny trading post. Today, it’s a tourism hub and a gateway to the mineral-rich north. “Now we have a historically strange situation with political and economic activity in the Arctic. So many people are knocking on our door, including business and state representatives from China, Pakistan, Singapore and Morocco,” the mayor, Kristin Røymo, told the . “There is also a very obvious increased naval presence.”This concerns many conference participants, who highlight the peaceful history of cross-border cooperation in the far north. Even during the cold war, there were agreements on fishing, scientific research and reindeer herding that continue today.Norwegian politicians were at pains to downplay the significance of the current military buildup. “There is no direct link between climate change and conflict,” the former defence minister Espen Barth Eide said. “It’s not because there is an immediate threat, it’s that, as an area becomes more important, it’s natural to have a heightened military presence.”He compared the situation to the South China Sea, where China, the US and other nations compete, not by firing weapons, but by demonstrating capacity and presence. “To some extent that is happening now in the Arctic,” he said, although he stressed there were no territorial disputes to inflame passions.The build-up is portrayed almost as a form of climate adaptation – strengthening the military presence along with infrastructure affected by melting permafrost.However, there are tensions. In a keynote speech, the Norwegian foreign minister, Ine Marie Eriksen Søreide, complained about communications interference by Russia in the far north. She plans to arrange a meeting with the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, to discuss the allegation. “Most important is to open political dialogue and talk not just about what we agree on but what we do not agree on,” she said.Norway is also contributing to the climate problem and the strategic tensions. It has just approved a raft of new oil exploration licenses in the Barents Sea and one of its citizens has been caught spying in Russia.Russia is uneasy about recent Nato exercises that have pushed deep into the north, according to Teimuraz Ramishvili, the ambassador to Norway. He told the  the military modernisation on the Russian side was overdue after 20 years of neglect and its significance should not be overstated.“In Europe, you have military installations that are used for peaceful purposes. Why it that OK in Europe, but not in Russia?” he asked. He said Moscow put a high priority on the northern region, where the potential was so great that some talk enthusiastically of an “Arctic age”.“For us, this is a matter of sustainable development of Russian territory. This is not open water, it is Russian territory,” said Ramishvili. “The Arctic isn’t a nature resort. It’s a place where Russians have lived for a long time.”Currently, cargo companies that use the northern shipping lanes need to pay Russia. But this will change as the sea ice recedes and Arctic routes open up in international waters. China, which has declared itself a “near-Arctic nation”, is among the countries exploring this area. Last year, it launched a second Snow Dragon ice breaker and released an Arctic white paper that explored the potential for infrastructure investments in a Polar Silk Road.The US, by comparison, is lagging behind. Although its nuclear submarines have operated under the ice for decades, its surface navy is ill-equipped for the Arctic. “Everyone’s up there but us,” the navy secretary, Richard Spencer, complained last month.“The threat is back on. This is an area … we need to focus on,” he said. Spencer has called for a strategic Arctic port in Alaska and US naval vessels to conduct navigation operations later this year in northern shipping lanes so they have the capacity to conduct emergency operations if necessary. “Can you imagine a Carnival line cruise ship having a problem, and the Russians do the search and do the extraction?” he said.The prospect of a US warship sailing near Russia’s vast northern border would certainly amplify unease, as well as highlighting the geopolitical challenges caused by global heating.Lisa Murkowski, a US senator for Alaska, did not expect the US navy to enter Russian waters, but, considering everything else that is going on, she said any freedom of navigation mission in the region would raise sensitivity.“It’s important for the US to project military strength, but there should be no intention to be unduly provocative,” she told the conference. The problem, she said, was that the White House had not updated its strategy to deal with a fast-changing region. “Under this administration, we are not assigning a significant priority to our role as an Arctic nation. There is a void,” she said.Environmentalists at the conference highlighted the dual role of oil in worsening the tension: both as a driver of climate change and of the push for more resource extraction from the still largely pristine Arctic. Norway came under fire for approving 83 new exploration licenses last week, more than a dozen of which were in the Barents Sea. “The false narrative of this conference is that Arctic countries are doing sustainable development,” said Martin Sommerkorn, head of conservation of the WWF Arctic Programme. “You can’t say that just days after you grant 83 new licenses. That’s completely wrong.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/372945a89074db936141667904a522cc51394ac9/0_135_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bf9ec9ef0bd9d5110f94b955891358b","title":"we want an end to tyranny venezuelan diaspora call for maduro to go","story":"From Mexico City to Hong Kong, exiles take to the streets in support of regime change One year ago Albert Molina and his family joined the historic exodus from Venezuela, fleeing to Mexico after his ailing father fell victim to the collapse of its health service.On Wednesday night – after a day of intense political drama in his crumbling homeland – he stood outside the Venezuelan embassy in Mexico City with a placard reading “No more dictatorship” and suddenly rekindled dreams of a homecoming.“The thing Venezuelans most want is to go back to our homeland,” said Molina, a 33-year-old business administrator from Anzoátegui state.Molina was one of thousands of newly energised exiles who turned out to protest outside their embassies on Wednesday, from Mexico City to Hong Kong, each hoping their country stood on the cusp of a new era.“We want the dictatorship out and an end to tyranny – it is more than possible,” said Jhonny Garcia, a 32-year-old accountant from Caracas, who said he had fled to Mexico City two years ago as Venezuela’s economic collapse accelerated.Jessica Solano, who abandoned her home in the city of Los Teques five years ago, carried a poster that read: “Maduro. Murderer. Usurper. Free Venezuela!”“He’s illegitimate. He’s an impostor,” the 28-year-old civil engineer of Maduro, who has accused the “gringo empire” of conspiring to overthrow him in order to steal Venezuelan oil.Solano called the decision of countries including the United States, Brazil and Colombia to recognise opposition leader Juan Guaidó as Venezuela’s interim president “a step towards the hope that the government will change … and we can be with our families again”.“We have been away for so long. All we want is the hope of a change … If Venezuela truly changes and the economy improves I think the best thing will be to go back,” she said.Molina, who was at the demonstration with his mother, son and heavily pregnant wife, said it was time for the curtains to come down on Maduro’s regime. Chavistas were stashing millions of dollars overseas, he claimed: “And Venezuela broken, with no medicine, no food, as if it were a country at war, or perhaps even worse.”Behind him dissenters had plastered the entrance to their embassy with posters that said: “Out Maduro! Down with the Dictatorship!”One couple held a banner that read: “Operation freedom”.Felix Maradiaga, an exiled Nicaraguan activist who was also among the crowds, said he was also rooting for change: “Maduro is not only a problem for Venezuela. He’s a problem for the world.”“The Maduro dictatorship has been a disruptive force for many other countries,” Maradiaga added, pointing to its role in supporting Nicaragua’s embattled president Daniel Ortega, one of its few remaining regional allies.In Colombia’s capital, Bogotá, there were protests too as thousands gathered outside Venezuela’s embassy to celebrate the day’s developments by waving flags and beating drums.“The clamor of the people is felt in every corner of Venezuela and the world: End the usurpation and free elections!” tweeted the exiled opposition leader Julio Borges, who attended the march.As the crowd outside the Mexico City embassy swelled, protesters unfurled a giant Venezuelan flag and began to chant the national anthem of their decaying nation.“Glory to the brave people, who shook off the yoke,” they sang. “Let’s cry out aloud: ‘Down with oppression!’”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Former minister\u0026rsquos son wants to see party run candidates in North within 10 yearsDublin criminal admitted 2001 stabbing outside Abrakebabra and wrote apology to man\u0026rsquos motherOrla Church (54) was 21st woman to die arising out of smear tests controversyBrexiteers incorrect to claim no change will happen, according to Niall CodyDrew Harris says Border reports are \u0026lsquoentirely incorrect\u0026rsquoThe four-year-old girl, an Irish citizen, is living in direct provision with her Nigerian motherStudy turns upside down belief that hole formation could only happen in regions bombarded by powerful radiationJosepha Madigan was due to address meeting at Mercy International Centre in DublinCervicalCheck will be contacting affected women by the end of next week, HSE saysPublic accounts committee to discuss remuneration of senior staff at UL and Sligo ITArtist Siobhan McDonald and scientists from TCD have been studying the volcano\u0026rsquos chemical makeup in hope of unlocking its potential to combat pollution\u0026lsquoWe feel we\u0026rsquore falling through the cracks of the system\u0026rsquoMary-Rose Brady: \u0026lsquoWe are going to fight this.

Mr Martin, however, said Fianna Fáil would be assisting the SDLP in May and that his party planned to “bring extra capacity” to the SDLP during the campaign.Mr Martin declined to go into “hypothetical questions” about whether and when in the future the parties might or would stand joint candidates.Both Mr Martin and Mr Eastwood were asked a number of times were they definitively ruling out a merger at any stage in the future.“This is the journey we are on this is the decision we have taken,” said Mr Martin. He later added that he did not have “a crystal ball” into the future.“We are not talking about a partnership, we are talking about a merger,” said Mr Eastwood, who added, “We want to take this partnership forward we want to evolve it and deepen it.”Eleven of the SDLP’s 12 Assembly members were present with the notable absence of South Belfast MLA Claire Hanna, who has expressed serious reservations about the partnership. Asked about her future within the SDLP Mr Eastwood said he did not want to lose anyone from the party.Mr Eastwood said the partnership would be organised through three central themes: “a politics that works” better public services and “uniting Ireland’s people”.The latter would focus on addressing “practical steps for greater co-operation and the shape of future possible constitutional arrangements should a unification poll be held and passed,” he said.He added that policy proposals will be prepared in seven areas: economic development Brexit “the unity of our people” health services education, housing and reforming institutions.Mr Eastwood said the partnership sought “to deliver an alternative to a government record of mismanagement, incompetence and inertia delivered by the DUP and Sinn Féin”.“The SDLP and Fianna Fáil will agree and deliver joint policies which can be effectively implemented in government across the island. In doing so we will be jointly delivering a credible programme for change across Ireland,” he said.Mr Martin said Fianna Fáil was “very happy to agree the partnership”. He added: “Our absolute focus will be on trying to reinvigorate the agenda for shared peace and prosperity on this island. Through a programme of joint working groups, research and public engagement we will work together on proposing alternatives for critical issues.” Mr Martin said “progress was not achieved by accepting current limits – but by looking for a new agenda”. He added that the “simple fact is that today Northern Ireland has no credible agenda for its economic development, for tackling entrenched poverty and for breaking the cycle of tension and mistrust”. Mr Martin said it was against the background of Brexit and political stalemate “that a discussion was begun a year ago with the SDLP about how we could co-operate”.“Fianna Fáil and the SDLP have shared much and have achieved much over the years. So it was obvious that we should discuss ways that we might work together at this time of crisis,” he said.“The focus of our discussions has, at all stages been on how to develop a new agenda for Northern Ireland and for Ireland as a whole. There is a desperate need to shift the focus away from an obsession with who holds power and onto the much more important issue of what is done with that power.“We need a new agenda for social protection, shared services, NorthSouth bodies and many other areas, and this work will be progressed. At all stages this work will reach out to people of different traditions and none,” he said. Mr Martin said Fianna Fáil had “never for one moment stepped away from our core belief that a united and republican future is the best way of serving the interests of all who live on this island – but equally we have shown how it is possible to disagree on this while working together on other issues”.Mr Eastwood said he and Mr Martin had thought deeply on how best to respond to Brexit and the “deepening ision and crisis in our politics” and how to “act for the generations to come”.The party had agreed a “common proposal on how best to respond to the crisis which consumes our politics”, he added.“That was the starting point of these discussions and it remains our guiding purpose,” he said.“Faced with this deepening crisis our challenge is to think deeper and to look longer,” said Mr Eastwood.“Both the SDLP and Fianna Fail have agreed to work in partnership on an unprecedented programme of public engagement in Northern Ireland which can help frame an ambitious and practical agenda for the future of this island and our people.He and Mr Martin were agreed that the “scale and longevity” of the crisis that was further underlined by last weekend’s bombing in Derry required a “new agenda and a new response”.“Our parties are determined to work together to try and change the failure our politics lie frozen in. We will not do so by gestures or gimmicks or through photo opportunities,” he continued.“Northern Ireland has had more than enough of that kind of party political vanity. Instead we will do this through a focus on policy and issues, not party or sectarian positioning.”Mr Eastwood said he accepted and respected and valued that such change “may be uncomfortable for some in both our parties”.“This is a big change and a big step in the history of both our parties and such change is ever easy,” he added.He said the SDLP would have the final say on the partnership. “We are prepared to take risks to bring about change for our people because we recognise that continuing on as normal is not an option”.Mr Eastwood described the partnership as an “unprecedented and historic response to meet those huge challenges before us”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3767928.1548267546!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cervicalcheck in jeopardy as free tests overwhelm system martin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar said the offer of free smear tests ended in December.

It was never intended to be a permanent offering,” and the free testing ended in December, Mr Varadkar said.Mr Martin said the decision taken by Mr Harris to offer re-testing to women concerned about their smear results was taken against official advice.It was the expert advice that the re-testing would “damage the efficacy of the programme, would delay and cause backlogs and was not clinically warranted”.Some 230,000 smears are checked every year but the decision added an extra 90,000 to 100,000 to that without any additional resources, he said.There was now an enormous backlog. “It is my understanding that the delay has impacted on the quality and efficacy of the tests and rendered a significant number of them invalid.”And he said he had been informed “CervicalCheck is now in jeopardy”.The HSE said both repeat and routine smear tests were experiencing delays due to increased demand. In the past, it took four to six weeks for a result, but currently, results were taking an average of 22 weeks, and some are taking slightly longer.Where samples are not transferred to a slide within six weeks, they can become expired, the HSE said. Between April and June 2018, this happened in a “small number” of cases - 0.32 per cent of all samples. Since August, all samples have been transferred to slides within the six-week timeframe.Women whose samples had expired were written to and advised to go for a repeat smear after three months, when cells in the cervix have regrown.The HSE said any woman with symptoms that may include unexplained vaginal bleeding, bleeding after sex, unusual discharge or pelvic pain should contact aGP without delay.Mr Martin added that Mr Harris “owes it to the House and to the general public to come before the House and make a comprehensive statement on this issue”.Mr Varadkar said he was informed of delays and testing difficulties “a few weeks ago” by his adviser, who had been told by Mr Harris.Mr Varadkar added that he was sure Mr Harris would be happy to address the House on the matter."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3769217.1548335043!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"significant change to cross border trade with hard brexit says revenue chief","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Irish Border between Dundalk, Co Louth and Newry, Co Down. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Brexiteers are “not right” when they claim there will be no dramatic change in Irish cross-Border trade if the UK crashes out of the EU, Revenue Commissioners chairman Niall Cody has said.There will be “significant change” if there is a hard Brexit, Mr Cody told the Oireachtas finance committee. Revenue was focused on ensuring systems are in place to deal with legitimate trade in a no-deal scenario, he said.He warned Brexit would bring “significant cost implications” for businesses engaged in trade with the UK as a result of leaving the EU single market and customs union and that the costs would deepen depending on the sector, notably for the agrifood sector.Other significant challenges “will flow into the future to tackling illegitimate trade,” he said.The State’s highest-ranking tax official, however, stood behind Government policy, confirming that the Revenue was not preparing to set up posts along the Border to check goods coming into the State after Brexit.“Revenue is not planning for customs posts on the land border,” he told the committee.Neither was Revenue looking at posts up to 15 kilometres away from the Border, he said.Mr Cody refused to rule out a hard border emerging from “difficult conversations” that the Government faces with the Commission. Those conversations will work out north-south solutions to protect the EU single market if there is a no-deal Brexit.“I couldn’t possibly speculate about what it is that will have to be done,” he told Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty.Mr Doherty asked Mr Cody whether the Brexiteers were correct when they claimed that a no-deal crash-out Brexit would not result in Irish cross-Border checks and that this was fear-mongering by opponents of Brexit.“The Brexiteers are not right there will be significant change and what we have to do – and are trying to do – is managing the implications of legitimate trade,” the Revenue chairman replied.Mr Doherty raised fears among constituents in Co Donegal that long-derelict facilities at some crossings at the Border with Northern Ireland were being cleaned up. He asked Mr Cody if this was just coincidental.“There is a concern there is more or there is potentially more than what has been laid out in the public,” said Sinn Féin’s finance spokesman.Mr Cody said Revenue were not involved in the cleaning up of any facilities for Border posts and denied that Revenue had access to private State funds that could be used to finance any secret plans.“We don’t have facility to have secret funds and secret expenditure,” he said, joking that “your colleagues” - members on the Public Accounts Committee – would have “great fun with me” if he had access to “magic” funds.“There is no work being done,” he said, seeking to assure Mr Doherty and his constituents.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillUp to 6,000 women will need to undergo a repeat smear test due to delays processing their original smears following the CervicalCheck scandal, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has said.Dr Peter McKenna, clinical director of HSE Women and Infant’s Health programme, said slides from women retaking smear tests would be processed as a matter of “priority” by laboratories.The HSE said both repeat and routine smear tests were experiencing delays due to increased demand. In the past, it took four to six weeks for a result, but currently, results were taking an average of 22 weeks, and some are taking slightly longer.In the immediate aftermath of the CervicalCheck controversy last spring, the Government promised that all women could avail of a free smear test, leading to a large increase in smears to be processed, putting pressure on the system.Dr McKenna said it was a “precaution” that some women would be recalled for a second test, due to the length of time it took to process their first one.He said “evidence shows that HPV tests of this kind are effective outside the manufacturer’s recommended timeframe,” however the HSE would likely be asking some women to take repeat smears, to provide the screening service with “reassurance”.Quest Laboratories, one of the labs contracted by the HSE under the CervicalCheck screening programme, informed the HSE of the issue in late November.The lab told CervicalCheck of “a specific problem in relation to standard HPV tests that have been carried out outside of the manufacturer’s recommended timeframe since secondary HPV screening was introduced,” a spokeswoman for the HSE said.Damien McCallion, interim director of the HSE National Screening Service, said an expert clinical team had been established to review the situation. Mr McCallion said by the end of next week the screening service would be writing to affected women, who will need to attend their GP for a second smear test.“We sincerely apologise for any concern that that may arise as a result of this,” he said, adding the service was committed to communicating openly with all women affected.Speaking in the Dáil on Wednesday, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said the screening programme, which had saved many lives, was “now in crisis mode” and it was his information that the programme was in jeopardy.Demanding Minister for Health Simon Harris come into the Dáil and give a full explanation, he asked Taoiseach Leo Varadkar when he had been told about the delays.Mr Varadkar said Mr Harris’s offer of free smear tests was a response to the anxiety of many women that their tests may have been misread in the wake of the controversy over false negative results.“It was done in good faith for good reasons.

Photograph: Yuri CortezAFPGetty ImagesThe EU called for elections in Venezuela as Russia, China and Turkey condemned the decision by the US and several Latin American nations to recognise opposition leader Juan Guaidó as interim president.Saying the Venezuelan people’s calls for democracy “cannot be ignored”, the EU backed the national assembly headed by Mr Guaidó as the “elected institution whose powers need to be restored and respected”.But Brussels held back from explicitly backing Mr Guaidó as Venezuela’s leader in place of Nicolás Maduro, reflecting many European countries’ reluctance to align themselves fully with what they see as hawkish action by President Donald Trump’s administration.“On 23 January, the people of Venezuela have massively called for democracy and the possibility to freely determine their own destiny,” said Federica Mogherini, EU foreign policy chief, on behalf of the bloc’s 28 member states. “The EU strongly calls for the start of an immediate political process leading to free and credible elections, in conformity with the constitutional order.”He added: “Unlike Maduro, the parliamentary assembly, including Juan Guaidó have a democratic mandate from Venezuelan citizens.”Emmanuel Macron, French president, wrote in a Twitter post: “After Nicolás Maduro’s illegitimate election in May 2018, Europe supports the restoration of democracy. Acclaim the bravery of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who march for their freedom.”The European criticism of Mr Maduro’s regime in Caracas – which is a target of EU sanctions – came as Russia attacked the move by the US, Canada, Brazil, Colombia and other Latin American countries to oust him.Moscow is one of the biggest supporters of the Maduro government through financial aid, defence ties and investments in the country’s oil and gas sector.“Signals coming from certain capitals indicating the possibility of external military interference look particularly disquieting. We warn against such reckless actions, which threaten catastrophic consequences,” Russia’s foreign ministry said in a statement.“We view the presumptuous actions of Washington as another demonstration of its total disregard for the norms and principles of international law and an attempt to play the self-assumed role of arbiter of the fate of other peoples. There is an obvious wish to apply in Venezuela the time-tested scenarios of toppling unwelcome governments,” it said.Hua Chunying, a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, said in comments reported by the AP news agency that Beijing “opposes external intervention in Venezuela. We hope that the international community will jointly create favourable conditions for this.”She added: “We hope that Venezuela and the US can respect and treat each other on an equal footing, and deal with their relations based on non-interference in each other’s internal affairs.”Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged Mr Maduro to resist the pressure to topple him. Ibrahim Kalin, Mr Erdogan’s spokesman, said he had called his Venezuelan counterpart and told him: “Brother Maduro, stand up tall. We are at your side.” Writing on Twitter, Mr Kalin added: “Turkey, under the leadership of our president, will continue to maintain a principled stance against all coup attempts.”Mr Maduro began a second term as president two weeks ago after being re-elected last year in a vote that was widely regarded as fraudulent.Mr Guaidó, the president of Venezuela’s national assembly and the country’s opposition leader, on Wednesday declared himself interim president as his supporters held mass rallies across the country.Developments in Venezuela are particularly awkward for Spain’s socialist-led government. Podemos, the far-left party that supports the minority administration, has been a strong supporter of Venezuela’s socialist revolution. Pablo Iglesias, leader of Podemos, described Mr Guaidó’s attempt to take power as a “coup d’état”.But prime minister Pedro Sánchez is under pressure from opposition party leaders and fellow socialists, including former premier Felipe González, to recognise Mr Guaidó as Venezuela’s leader. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3768294.1548276088!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"venezuela s opposition leader declares himself interim president","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Opposition leader Juan Guaido addresses supporters in Caracas where he declared himself ready to assume power.

Photograph: ReutersVenezuela’s opposition leader Juan Guaido has declared himself interim president, in a dramatic escalation of efforts to force out President Nicolas Maduro, who has overseen the country’s slide into authoritarianism and economic ruin.The move was immediately welcomed by the US, Canadian and a dozen Latin American governments. Mexico said it would continue to recognise Mr Maduro as president.US president Donald Trump said he would use the “full weight” of US economic and diplomatic power to push for the restoration of Venezuela’s democracy.Thousands of protesters clogged the streets of the capital, Caracas, as Mr Guaido, the head of the opposition-run national assembly, raised his right hand and said: “I swear to assume all the powers of the presidency to secure an end to the usurpation.”The 35-year-old lawmaker said his surprise move was the only way to rescue Venezuela from “dictatorship” and restore constitutional order.“We know that this will have consequences,” Mr Guaido told the cheering crowd. “To be able to achieve this task and to re-establish the constitution we need the agreement of all Venezuelans,” he shouted.Security forces fired teargas at protesters blocking a highway in Caracas. Mr Maduro said he was breaking diplomatic relations with the US in response, with US diplomats given 72 hours to leave the country.Oil-rich Venezuela is mired in economic and political turmoil, with hyperinflation rendering the bolivar currency practically worthless. Shortages in food staples and basic medicines are rampant, and crime is widespread. More than three million Venezuelans have fled, causing consternation across the continent.The country’s opposition has struggled to find a strategy against Mr Maduro, however, and analysts warned that Mr Guaido’s gutsy move was potentially dangerous.“It is absolutely clear that the strategy was decided by both the US government and the Venezuelan opposition, so they share the risk,” said Dimitris Pantoulas, a Caracas-based political analyst and consultant. “The government reaction will come shortly and it remains unclear if the people are ready to defend Guaido with their lives.”Relatively unknown until this month, Mr Guaido stepped into the political limelight earlier this month when he declared himself willing to assume the presidency until new elections are held.In a statement, Mr Trump described the national assembly as the “only legitimate branch of government duly elected by the Venezuelan people” and warned Mr Maduro not to resort to violence.“We continue to hold the illegitimate Maduro regime directly responsible for any threats it may pose to the safety of the Venezuelan people,” he said.A dozen Latin American governments – including the right-wing administrations of Brazil and Colombia – quickly backed Mr Guaido, although Mexico said that it would not change its policy on Venezuela “for the time being”.Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, said that Mr Maduro’s government was “now fully entrenched as a dictatorship”, and called on him to hand power to the national assembly until new elections were held.“The suffering of Venezuelans will only worsen should he continue to illegitimately cling to power,” she said in a statement.In Washington, a senior administration official warned that “all options are on the table” for US action if the Maduro government responded with the use of force against the opposition, but the official focused on diplomatic steps and economic measures that could be taken against Mr Maduro and his top officials.“If the Maduro regime chooses to respond with violence, if they choose to harm any of the national assembly members, all options are on the table for the United States to respond,” the official said.“The message is very clear. The US remains resolute in its support for the transition to democracy in Venezuela. The US will not allow an inidual, Nicolas Maduro, and his cronies to continue to loot the Venezuela state.”The sudden developments came as tens of thousands joined marches across the country, and followed two nights of violent protests in working-class neighbourhoods of Caracas – once bastions of support for the government – and the apparent foiling of an armed uprising by members of the national guard.Morelia Armini, an elderly saleswoman from Caracas, could barely contain her joy at the day’s developments. “This is a wonderful thing,” she said, after watching to Mr Guaido take the oath. “Like a phoenix, this is the rebirth of Venezuela.”Wednesday also marked the anniversary of the 1958 uprising that overthrew the military dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez – a symbolism that was not lost on Maria de Jesus, a social worker from Caracas who was born on the day of the 1958 rebellion.“I was born in democracy,” she said on her way to the march in Caracas. “I want my freedom this is a dictatorship.”Across town, several hundred supporters held a rival march in support of Mr Maduro. Though it was dwarfed in size by the opposition protest, those in attendance were in a buoyant mood.“We are here to support our president and defend our resources,” said Ana Media, who works for the state oil company PDVA, as salsa music blasted from loudspeakers. “We know that other countries are against Maduro because they want to take over our resources.”Analysts have long held that Mr Maduro’s survival depends on the backing of the military, who he has rewarded with senior positions in government and the state oil company PDVSA.But it is unclear how solid that support is. Mr Guaido and the opposition-held national assembly have sought to peel away the military, offering an amnesty to members of the armed forces who help bring about a return to democracy. This week, authorities arrested 27 national guardsmen who tried to launch an uprising against Mr Maduro.Mr Maduro has accused the opposition of fomenting violence. “I demand the full rigour of the law against the fascists,” he said on Tuesday night. His allies have also threatened the use of armed pro-government militias – known as colectivos – to quell disturbances.A previous spate of protests in 2017 left at least 120 dead and hundreds more injured, after Mr Maduro dispatched the national guard.Foro Penal, a local watchdog, reported on Wednesday morning that 47 protesters had been arrested since protests began on Monday night. Local journalists alleged that authorities in Caracas had attempted to confiscate their equipment. – "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3769049.1548317451!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"who is juan guaid%C3%B3 venezuela s self declared president","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVenezuela’s Juan Guaido, speaks to the crowd during a mass opposition rally against leader Nicolas Maduro. Photograph:  Federico PARRAAFPUntil very recently, Juan Guaidó, the 35-year-old leader of Venezuela’s opposition-controlled national assembly, was an unknown figure on the international stage. That changed on Wednesday, when the young politician stood before thousands of protesters in Caracas and swore himself in as interim president – a move that was immediately greeted by the US and Canadian governments. Guaidó first signalled that he was willing to mount a serious challenge to the country’s president in early January when Nicolás Maduro, began his second term of office following elections last summer that were widely denounced as fraudulent. The inauguration was met with a chorus of international disapproval, and Guaidó, just six days into his post, told the world he was ready to assume the presidency until free and fair elections could be held – provided he had the vital support of the military. His announcement was a rare open challenge to Maduro’s rule, and won support from the head of the Organisation of American States – but also prompted fears it could provoke a fresh crackdown on the opposition. Maduro, who has overseen deepening economic and political turmoil, made light of his relatively inexperienced challenger. “A lot of people in Venezuela are going to ask what is this ‘Guaidó’?” he joked in a Friday night TV address. But days later, Guaidó was briefly detained by the intelligence services – something Maduro’s administration blamed on rogue operatives. Raised in La Guaira, a port city 20 miles from Caracas, Guaidó cut his political teeth during 2007 student protests against Maduro’s late predecessor Hugo Chávez, who was then seeking to consolidate power. Venezuela’s president Nicolás Maduro after receiving the presidential sash during the ceremonial swearing-in for his second presidential term on January 10th. Chávez put various constitutional amendments, including the abolition of presidential term limits and the ability to unilaterally declare a national emergency, to a public referendum. But the vote handed Chávez his only electoral defeat in a nine-year presidency, and emboldened a nascent opposition movement, including Guaidó’s charismatic but isive mentor Leopoldo López, who has been under house arrest and barred from political office since early 2014. It was López who tapped Guaidó, 12 years his junior, to lead his Popular Will party’s coalition in the national assembly when its mandate began on January 5th. Guaidó had just finished his first full term as a legislator, having been elected in 2015. “Guaidó is a fighter and an eternal optimist . . . he’s humble and sincere,” said Freddy Guevara, an opposition leader and friend of Guaidó, in a telephone call from the Chilean ambassador’s residence in Caracas, where he is seeking asylum. “He gets along with everyone and doesn’t have the typical profile of a politician.” Many in Venezuela thought Maduro had successfully neutered the assembly in 2017, when he sidelined it in favour of a more pliant constituent assembly via elections which were also widely labelled a sham. López, was one of the opposition’s most radical and confrontational leaders, but few had expected his protege Guaidó to mount such a brazen challenge to Maduro. “He was incredibly brave and now runs risks that he’ll be jailed, tortured or need to go into exile,” said David Smolansky, an opposition leader, who was also forced to flee Venezuela and is now living in the US. “However, he decided to go ahead. He’s part of my generation a brave generation that grew up under a dictatorship.” Guaidó is no stranger to adversity. His family survived a devastating landslide in his hometown in 1999 that killed as many as 30,000 people, and he claims to bear scars on his neck from rubber bullets fired at protesters in 2017 in Caracas.On Wednesday, he told the crowd he new he was taking a potentially risky step. “We know that this will have consequences,” he told supporters. “To be able to achieve this task and to re-establish the constitution we need the agreement of all Venezuelans.” – "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

He has just started school in rural Oxfordshire and is eagerly learning to read. “He’s taken to school like a duck to water. He loves it. He’s very sociable and good at making friends,” says his mother, Lydia. In other words, he is a very normal, happy little boy.Yet there is something remarkable about Isaac. His early progress through life has helped to set the standard for other children across the world. Isaac is one of more than 1,300 children in five countries – Brazil, India, Italy, Kenya and the UK – whose growth and neurodevelopment has been tracked and compared from the earliest days in the womb until the age of two.Led by a team at the University of Oxford, the INTERGROWTH-21st Project is set to have a profound impact on the way we view, feed and educate our children. It has shown for the first time that children are born physically and intellectually equal, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Given good living conditions, good food and education, babies thrive, wherever they live and whatever the colour of their skin.Such is the power of the data gathered, the researchers hope it will be used alongside the World Health Organisation’s growth charts worldwide, including its Red Book in the UK. It should finally put to bed outdated notions of racial or class-based superiority.The research tracks both physical and intellectual development to age two. A child’s first 1,000 days of life (from conception to 24 months) is the most crucial because that is when the brain grows fastest, accounting for roughly two-thirds of its adult weight.Isaac\u0026#39s mother, Lydia, says her son took to school like a duck to water. To her left is her 7-year-old son, Ethan.“At every single stage we’ve shown that healthy mothers have healthy babies, and that healthy babies all grow at exactly the same rate,” says Prof Stephen Kennedy, the co-director of the Oxford Maternal and Perinatal Health Institute and co-leader of the INTERGROWTH-21st Project (with José Villar, a professor of perinatal medicine). “It doesn’t matter where you are living, it doesn’t matter what the colour of your skin is, it doesn’t matter what your race and ethnicity is, receiving decent medical care and nutrition is the key.”The assertion that healthy mothers have healthy babies – regardless of where they come from – sounds obvious but demonstrating it in terms of growth and developmental milestones is a first.Until now, it was a commonly held view that some babies were naturally smaller than others due to genetic predisposition: a healthy baby born to a Kenyan mother, say, would be smaller than a counterpart born to a British mother. America’s National Institutes for Health even produced differing foetal growth charts for babies of white, black, and Asian origin.Assumptions have also – though more controversially – been made about the intellectual ability of different races. Only last week the Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory in the US cut its ties with James Watson, the Nobel Prize-winning geneticist who, with Maurice Wilkins and Francis Crick, first proposed the double helix structure of DNA, citing his “unsubstantiated and reckless” remarks about race and intelligence. Watson, the laboratory’s former chancellor, has repeatedly suggested that genes cause a disparity in average scores in IQ tests between blacks and whites.Geneticist James Watson in 1962, accepting the Nobel prize he would later be stripped of.“There’s still a substantial body of opinion out there in both the scientific and lay communities who genuinely believe that intelligence is predominantly determined by genes and the environment that you’re living in and that your parents and grandparents were living in and their nutritional and health status are not relevant,” says Prof Kennedy. “Well, that’s clearly not the case.”The Oxford study took seven years to complete and involved nearly 60,000 mothers and babies in two stages of research, first tracking growth in the womb, before following more than 1,300 of those babies to age two. Its results show that not only physical growth but behaviour and neurodevelopmental milestones occur at the same rate among babies of differing ethnic origin. The findings echo the assertion by Craig Venter, the scientist who led the first draft of the sequencing of the human genome, that “there is no basis in scientific fact or in the human genetic code or the notion that skin colour will be a predictive of intelligence”.Previous research into gestational growth has taken ethnic origin but not living conditions into account. Where mothers of a similar social, economic and health status are compared, the Oxford team has shown, healthy Indian and African babies will grow at the same rate as healthy, well-nourished Britons. The women enrolled into the second part of the INTERGROWTH-21st Project – whether in Brazil, India, Italy, Kenya or Oxford in the UK – were carefully selected to achieve a like-for-like comparison: urban women of similar age with a healthy BMI who were non-smokers and living in a clean environment. “It is important to say these were not superwomen, they were simply well-educated and well-nourished,” says Kennedy. “In the centres we selected, one-third of the women met our criteria for being healthy. So this wasn’t a tiny slice of the population.”Babies were weighed and measured (including head circumference) at birth, then at one and two years of age. The team tracked fundamental motor milestones according to WHO norms, such as the age at which the child first stood or walked alone, but also developed its own, culturally neutral set of tests  for cognition, language, behaviour and motor development.At the age of two, the children were given a series of play-related tasks. “You might build a tower using five blocks, then knock it down,” says Dr Michelle Fernandes, the Oxford researcher who devised the tests. “Will the child respond by building another tower, completely or partially, or make no effort to do so? If you place a number of objects in front of the child – a cup, spoon, sock, shoe and cube – and ask them to put the spoon in the cup, without giving them a visual cue, are they able to do so?”Michelle Fernandes, an Oxford researcher who developed tests to measure a baby\u0026#39s visual acuity, attention  and language development.Cognitive development was also assessed by placing an attractive object under one cloth, then another, then asking the child to find it. If the child immediately lifted the second cloth, it showed they had been able to follow the sequence of moves. “There are no zero scores,” says Dr Fernandes, “because the child is always able to do something, whether it is building a tower, but with only three blocks, or searching for the beads under the first cloth.”Additional information on the children’s behavioural progress, including lavatory training, was obtained by questioning the mothers.In 1995, the WHO decided that human growth and development should be assessed and monitored using international standards. The resulting standards, published in 2006, form the basis of the Red Book familiar to families in Britain whose babies’ growth is assessed in centiles in relation to the graph.The WHO standard applied to children aged 0-5 (born at full-term) but did not study the foetus. The Oxford study fills in the gap, charting children’s progress from the earliest weeks of life. “By assessing not only growth but neurodevelopment at two years of age we have done something the WHO didn’t,” says Prof Kennedy.“Our standards for establishing gestational age, monitoring the growth of the foetus, assessing the newborn size and post-natal growth on preterm babies... all of those overlap and complement the WHO standards. Taken together, they provide a gold standard which should be used by every country in the world.”The INTERGROWTH-21st standards are likely to focus doctors’ – and hopefully parents’ – attention on the quality of food pregnant women and young infants consume. While the study shows all children should grow up equally able, it is a lack of good nutrition in the first thousand days that is likely to make the biggest difference to a child’s future.Across the world, there are estimated to be more than 150 million children (22 per cent) who have become physically and mentally “stunted” because of poor nutrition in their early years. Although largely an overseas problem, recent international data showed that 10 per cent of UK children live in conditions of “severe food insecurity”.Just as problematic, worrying numbers of babies are born overweight, putting them at risk of health problems including diabetes later in life. A report from the Royal College of Paediatricians and Child Health this week flags up concern over child poverty in the UK – a contributory factor in childhood obesity and poor mental health – and the UK’s poor rate of breastfeeding, believed to be among the lowest in the world. The UK infant feeding survey, usually carried out every five years, was cancelled in 2015.The Oxford team is now launching a new study, INTERPRACTICE-21st, to examine the growth and development of preterm babies. It has been normal practice to monitor those babies born below 32 weeks of gestation, but it is assumed those born between 33 and 37 weeks, though early, will “catch up”. It may be that any baby born early is at risk of developmental delay.The INTERGROWTH-21st Project has come to an end but its findings convey a powerful message about what can be achieved worldwide if mothers and babies have access to good food, education and a decent environment. In such circumstances, the attainment of neurodevelopmental milestones and associated behaviours “are likely innate and universal” the researchers say: and that commonality must be good news for us all.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityNewsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleUniversity of OxfordSchoolboy, 10, sums up Brexit as he says it is \u0026#39coo coo\u0026#39 and \u0026#39adult bla bla\u0026#39 in note bemoaning re-moaner motherBest independent schools in the UK: Compare league table results for GCSEsBest independent schools in the UK: Compare league table results for A-levelsBrexit latest news: Remain MPs accuse Jeremy Corbyn of failing Labour voters as they abandon second referendum planBali considering tourist tax to stem rising tide of rubbishIran arrests 7,000 dissents in \u0026#39year of shame\u0026#39Secondary school league tables: White are children the least likely to achieve their potential by age 16Alex Salmond arrested and charged by Police ScotlandEuropean court orders Italy to pay Amanda Knox damages for failure to provide lawyer and translatorHome of Novichok victim declared safeComment: Naive Leo Varadkar has finally clocked that the EU has used Ireland to punish BritainComment: Brexit or Brino?

The group has opened two pubs and sold six since the beginning of the financial year, with plans to open between five and 10 this year.

Any hint of higher costs, including staff wages, is bad news so the news of another £30m in labour costs since November will hurt. With unemployment low, thanks in part to lower flows of workers from the EU, labour costs will continue to be a focus at Wetherspoon.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places.

The chancellor has also announced a £100m investment in UK technology, with the money going towards 1,000 new PhD places to promote research into artificial intelligence.

The new models expected to be released in September of this year are likely to keep much the same design as the current models, and so the LCD display is likely to stick around.Apple\u0027s mysterious new charger might be about to arriveLCD displays have largely fallen out of favour in recent years because they use up more battery than rival OLED technology, which also allows for richer blacks. OLED displays can also be arranged into more unusual shapes, allowing for more radical changes in the phones\u0027 design.The new rumour came from a Wall Street Journal report detailing the concerns at Japan Display, which is being hit not only by the dropping of LCD screens but also the relative lack of demand for the new iPhone XR, which uses its screens.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Anger over poor social conditions grew so intense that it provoked a riot in the late 1990s. A local social activist who objected to youths smashing bottles on the road and handed a bin bag full of broken glass to the mother of one of those responsible\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbsphe had bricks thrown at his house and firecrackers pushed through the letterbox.Outside Westminster, people are becoming numb to the Brexit crisisWhat turned Thanington round was substantial aid from the European Union.Paul Todd, a former resident who works on housing and homelessness issues, says:\u0026nbsp“About 20 years ago it was regenerated when it got a large dose of money out of the European regeneration budget.” The funding was used to make extensive renovations such as putting new roofs on the council houses and renewing bathrooms and bedrooms so the homes of council tenants looked better than those privately owned. In addition, the\u0026nbspregeneration money funded a community centre, known locally as the Resource Centre, which provides space for sports and recreation, as well as accommodation for children doing homework which they could not do at home.Paula Spencer, who has managed the centre since it was built, adds that the EU “spent £2.5m in doing up the estate and getting rid of the rat-runs. It used to be that they would nick your video machine and disappear down an alleyway.” Crime and antisocial behaviour dropped by 50 per cent as the regeneration measures took effect. As a newly arrived council tenant, Heggie says that she had been worried by the crossbow bolt incident but “apart from one broken car window on my driveway I have had no trouble since”.Created with Sketch.

A police officer speaks with anti-Brexit protester Steve BrayPolice surround a pro-Brexit protester after he confronted a pro-European protester Conservative MP David Davies, wearing a gopro camera, speaks to anti-Brexit protester Steve BrayThe EU intervention enabled Thanington – which I previously featured in the first instalment of this series – to lose its nickname of “Little Beirut”, but its residents complain that they have lacked public investment ever since, and that this is beginning to show. The 2,794 people who live there work mostly in low-wage jobs, often as cleaners or in supermarkets in and around Canterbury, or they are on benefits. Educational standards are low, illiteracy is high, and many single-parent families are headed by women. Nevertheless, residents and outside observers agree that Thanington retains a strong sense of communal solidarity.“It’s largely retained its village identity,” says Todd, whose relatives still live there and who has great affection for its people. “Everyone knows everyone else’s business.”\u0026nbspOver the past summer, we had a lot of guys coming down from London and selling drugs. They’d move into a house, take it over and intimidate the tenant. Then there was the shootingThe only state institution to help preserve this small and vulnerable community was the EU, so it is worth asking why so many of those living in Thanington voted Leave\u0026nbspin the 2016 referendum. At first glance, their actions, repeated in many deprived areas receiving EU funds in England and Wales, appear to be an inexplicable example of social and economic self-harm. Nevertheless, it was probably the high Leave\u0026nbspvotes in deprived white housing estates which tipped the balance towards Britain voting for Brexit. So it is important to discover why people from such places voted as they did in such overwhelming numbers. Was it a vote very much determined by opposition to immigration, or was it a more general protest by the “left-behinds”\u0026nbspand the “left-outs”? \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMost people in Thanington voted for Britain to leave the EU, and they did so because they are poor and feel neglected, according to Todd, who has known the area for 30 years. He says that there is an “assumption there that immigration has affected their prospects. I don’t think people are aware of how much Thanington did benefit from the EU. The European regeneration money certainly made a huge impact on the quality of the housing stock up there. It probably gave some of the houses another chance, otherwise they might have been knocked down. Some people want immigration cut and others think that talk of another referendum is an indicator that their concerns haven’t been taken seriously.”Bellas did not mention and may not have known about the EU regeneration effort which happened before he started living on the estate after years of homelessness and holding insecure jobs. In any case, the impact of that funding is running out and there are signs of growing decrepitude and insecurity.\u0026nbsp“It’s quite a deprived area,” he says. “There’s a lot of people with drug problems and\u0026nbspalcohol issues, and they seem to be moving families in who have already been evicted from homes because of antisocial behaviour. Everyone’s got a right to live anywhere but it doesn’t do great things for the estate.“Over the past summer, we had a lot of guys coming down from London and selling drugs. They’d move into a house, take it over and intimidate the tenant – ‘you’re going to sell this for us’\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspa lot of guys in Mercedes,\u0026nbspreal high-end saloons,\u0026nbspwho don’t fit on the estate. Then there was the shooting in the summer, which was a direct result of these guys coming down from London and that happened just around the corner from us.”Created with Sketch.

Only the sleeping bag is left as a sign of what might have been“It’s a lack of funding and a lack of police. You only ever see police when these things happen and it’s after the fact. Our kids don’t play out on the street. I know all my neighbours and I know all their kids, but it’s really difficult because there are people from off the estate come to sell their drugs that I don’t know. We had a heroin dealer set up in the house next door to us and for about six weeks, we had people knocking on our door coming to pick up their drugs up and it took 50 phone calls to the police to get them to sort it out.”The shooting Bellas refers to took place on 19 July last year when\u0026nbsptwo men in balaclavas shot and seriously wounded Danny Mobey in Thanington’s Godwin Road.Bellas voted Leave in the referendum, denying that this had anything to do with immigration and saying that his decision was more to do with democracy and resistance to power being devolved to a centralised European government and unelected officials making decisions on his behalf. He says: “I just feel that there is something quite sinister and secret about a federal government.”About the economic consequences of departure from the EU, he is optimistic, arguing that the Germans, French and Spanish will want to go on selling goods to Britain. He says that a lot of people he knows had voted Leave influenced by “the Brexiteers’ promise that there would be £350m\u0026nbspextra for the NHS”.\u0026nbspHis two biggest concerns are the lack of policing and the decline of the NHS, where his wife works as a nurse, and which he fears the government wants to privatise.Even in a place as small as Thanington, perceptions of violence vary markedly from street to street and person to person. Di Hutchinson agrees that things are getting worse: “I was ill last Christmas and I saw a drug deal going down and I was shocked because it was the first time I’d ever seen it.” Overall, however, residents and outside observers say that Thanington is no worse than other housing estates and other areas of deprivation anywhere in UK. (There are more affluent parts of the district away from the estate.)People came to me and said that there were rats in their kitchens, rats in their children’s bedrooms, running over kids’ feet, and under bathrooms so there was raw sewage seeping everywhereFinancial aid from the EU and other advantages stemming from membership had little effect on poor Leave voters in 2016. Either the EU’s achievements were under-publicised, or – and this is probably the crucial factor – whatever the EU did was not enough to counterbalance a pervasive sense among millions of voters that their lives are getting more pressured and insecure. This was as true in east Kent as it was in Cornwall, an example of ingratitude for EU largesse often cited. That county has a population of 530,000 and received €654m\u0026nbsp(£574m) from the EU between 2007 and 2013. It was due to receive another €600m before 2020, yet 54.5 per cent voted Leave.Fear of immigration was probably the most important factor in the way people voted, but so too was the privatisation and outsourcing of utitlities and services, job insecurity, decline in real wages, high rents, deindustrialisation and a lack of cheap transport. The EU and its supporters can justly complain that Brussels is being unfairly scapegoated for failings that it has\u0026nbspnothing to do with, and which\u0026nbspshould be blamed rather on globalisation, privatisation and the austerity policies pursued by Conservative governments.Yet, even if the EU is not responsible, this does not mean that the deep discontent\u0026nbsprevealed by the referendum result is\u0026nbspnot real. Simply put, Brexit is a symptom as well as a cause of the crisis which has enveloped Britain and envenomed its politics. The ill-considered Remain slogan of 2016 – “Better Together” –\u0026nbspwas never going to resonate with those whose standard of living had stagnated or deteriorated over the past decade despite Britain being in the EU. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAusterity may have driven homelessness rise, minister admitsTransport is already scarce: according to Spencer, it takes two bus trips to get to the nearest doctor, while there is only one bus every two hours in the evening. A planned new exit from the A2, which is being contested by local residents, will make Thanington even more isolated from the rest of Canterbury than it is at present. And as houses become more expensive and cost far more than the present population on their low-paying jobs can afford, the traditional community will break up as parents find that their children have to move off the estate if they want find anywhere cheap enough to live.Even more seriously, the insecure low-paid work done by many in Thanington does not provide enough to pay rent and food. The result is reliance on food banks and free school meals. Caroline Heggie says that people are becoming more and more indebted “because now you’ve got companies giving out credit cards to people with low credit ratings”.A telling sign of the growing deprivation in Thanington – and the sort of event which may explain why people there failed to endorse the status quo in 2016 – is a recent plague of rats.“People came to me and said that there were rats in their kitchens, rats in their children’s bedrooms, running over kids’ feet, and under bathrooms so there was raw sewage seeping everywhere,” says Spencer. The origin of the rat infestation is unclear: it may be that rats were disturbed by the new housing construction in nearby fields, or that the council no longer deals with rubbish that has been left to pile up. Cuts in public services of all kinds have hit Thanington hard, and services dropped include pest control.A rat catcher charges £60, which tenants must now pay themselves though there may be 10 or 12 rats to be disposed of, necessitating more than one visit.\u0026nbspHeggie says: “You used to have council ‘rat people’, but because of austerity, you don’t have them anymore.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Annie Hall offers the New York based comedian’s familiar angst and also has a superlative performance from Diane Keaton as the free spirited, preppy heroine he falls in love with.210 9. The Best Years of our LivesWilliam Wyler’s film about three veterans coming home at the end of the war still has a huge emotional kick. They’re from different classes and backgrounds but struggle terribly to readjust to civilian life. Some accuse the film of being pious and self-righteous but it deals frankly and very movingly with both the soldiers’ problems and those of their families and friends in understanding them. It won its best picture Oscar in the year in which It’s a Wonderful Life was also nominated.310 8. An American in ParisThe best MGM musicals showed extraordinary artistry. This is one of the greatest. It’s not just the choreography or Gene Kelly’s wildly energetic performance as the aspiring artist in postwar Paris but the use of colour and sound. The ballet sequence at the end of the film stands alongside that in Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger’s The Red Shoes as a perfect example of filmmaking in which every element balances perfectly.Producer Hal Wallis at Warner Bros had a knack for overseeing films that were both mainstream and had a social conscience. Not only did Casablanca have Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains, but it also dealt with refugees, betrayal and wartime politics. The script by Julius and Philip G Epstein provided lines of dialogue about gin joints, rounding up the usual suspects and playing “As Time Goes By” that are still quoted today. Few other best picture winners are as engrained in the public consciousness as Casablanca.510 6. On the WaterfrontElia Kazan’s On the Waterfront can be read as the director’s attempt at justifying his own craven behaviour, naming names in front of the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities, during the communist witch hunts. Its politics are complicated and contradictory. It is also magnificently acted. Marlon Brando gives arguably his greatest performance of all as Terry Molloy, the dockworker and pigeon fancier who could have been a contender in life and in the boxing ring if only his brother had stood by him when he needed him most.610 5. Lawrence of ArabiaEasy to dismiss as a jingoistic widescreen epic, David Lean’s film about TE Lawrence makes astonishing viewing seen in 70mm. It also offers a probing and subtle portrayal of Lawrence (Peter O’Toole), the masochist who is both the quintessential English hero and the quintessential English outsider.Joseph L Mankiewicz’s drama about a young actress on the make and the established star whose career she wants to usurp boasts some of the most caustic dialogue in any Hollywood best picture winner. The brilliance of Bette Davis as the star and of Anne Baxter as the seemingly ingenuous but utterly ruthless young pretender is matched by George Sanders’ wonderfully acidic performance as the theatre critic, Addison DeWitt.Still the greatest sequel in Hollywood history, this film emulated its predecessor The Godfather, in winning the best picture Oscar and out-stripped it in the brilliance of its craftsmanship and performances. Everything here, from Gordon Willis’s cinematography to the parallel stories of Al Pacino’s Michael Corleone as the crime family boss in the late Fifties and Robert De Niro as his father Vito many years before, works near perfectly. The rival Best Picture nominees in 1974 included Lenny, Chinatown and The Conversation (also directed by Francis Ford Coppola). All would have been worthy winners in other years.The western was considered an anachronism and so was Clint Eastwood himself when Eastwood made his blood soaked masterpiece. Eastwood played Will Munny, first encountered as a farmer and family man. Gradually, we learn about his past as a gunman.  “I\u0027ve killed women and children. I\u0027ve killed just about everything that walks or crawled at one time or another, and I\u0027m here to kill you, Little Bill,” he tells old rival Gene Hackman. This brutal and elegiac film was always a shoo-in for its Oscar.Only Billy Wilder could have made a romantic comedy based around infidelity, drudgery and office politics and turned it into a film as delightful as this. Academy voters are sometimes accused of self-righteousness and prudery, but thankfully that didn’t stop them giving the best picture Oscar to The Apartment.These days, it sometimes seems heretical to admit to an admiration for Woody Allen but his best films stand up as well as ever.

Ours is the first scenario that can explain the timing and delivery in a way that is consistent with all the geochemical evidence.Dr\u0026nbspDasgupta said the study could allow humanity to understand more about how the ingredients for life might form on other rocky planets like our own.This study suggests that a rocky, Earth-like planet gets more chances to acquire life-essential elements if it forms and grows from giant impacts with planets that have sampled different building blocks, perhaps from different parts of a protoplanetary disk.The research is published in the journal Science Advances.Additional reporting by Press AssociationOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The central rule of the club is that no country can impose tariffs on another country’s imports that are higher than those imposed on imports\u0026nbspfrom any other country\u0026nbsp– unless it has established a broad free trade agreement with that country. So if country X gives country Y a reduced tariff,\u0026nbspthat same favour must be granted to all other WTO members.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentThis is the “most favoured nation” principle. Its purpose is to prevent ad hoc discrimination on tariffs by countries and the risk of tit-for-tat trade battles.But that does not mean that, in the absence of a free trade agreement, trade between two states can be assumed to be governed only by WTO rules.Take the EU’s trade with the US.How badly could Brexit disrupt farming exports from Northern Ireland?“All 164 of them have negotiated better access to at least one market through some kind of bilateral agreement in addition to their WTO relationship.”So if the UK suddenly left the EU its trade with the US, at least initially, would still be disrupted because we would lose the coverage over those 100 sector agreements too.The point is that WTO rules are not some kind of tried and tested landing place for a country crashing out of a trade bloc.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

They say it is a breach of sovereignty and are voting down the entire Brexit deal in opposition to it.The policy is set to automatically trigger in 2021 if there is no trade deal between the UK and EU negotiated by then – or if the trade deal does not allow for frictionless trade.\u0026nbspBut the EU says that prime minister’s red lines of leaving the single market, customs union, jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, and ending free movement mean that frictionless trade for the whole would not be possible, and there would therefore be checks – which would require a backstop. The PM’s current plans for the future relationship effectively make the backstop’s use inevitable.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

According to the logic of the parliament\u0027s statement, with\u0026nbspthis in place, the backstop would not be used.Ministers ‘meeting in secret to discuss stopping no-deal Brexit’Netherlands says 250 firms in talks to move from UK because of BrexitEU will never accept Theresa May’s Brexit ‘plan-B’, Barnier saysBut the prime minister is partly locked in to her red lines because changing or dropping them would likely further incense Tory eurosceptics – who are already pushing for a no-deal Brexit despite the prime minister steering a course for a hard Brexit.The statement from the cross-party Brexit steering group says: “The Brexit steering group reiterated that the withdrawal agreement is fair and cannot be re-negotiated.\u0026nbsp This applies especially to the backstop, since it is the guarantee that under no circumstances will there be a hardening of the border on the island of Ireland while at the same time safeguarding the integrity of the Single Market.\u0026nbsp“The EU remains clear, firm and united on this even if the negotiated backstop is not meant to be used. Therefore, the Brexit steering group insists that, without such an ‘all-weather’ backstop-insurance, the European Parliament will not give its consent to the Withdrawal Agreement.“The Brexit steering group also reiterated Parliament’s long standing position that it is open to a much more ambitious future relationship, would the UK consider this.\u0026nbsp This would not only allow for a closer EU-UK future partnership but could also avoid deployment of the backstop. It expects greater clarity next week from the UK on its position on the EU-UK relationship for the future.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They are likely to back alternative motions that simply call for a public vote.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn has so far refused to agree to\u0026nbspMPs\u0027 and party members\u0027 demands that he\u0026nbspback a Final Say vote, but said the option should be considered by MPs.\u0026nbspHe said:\u0026nbspThe prime minister is both refusing to change her red lines or take the threat of a no deal exit off the table.

Ben Bradshaw called it important progress and David Lammy tweeted: This is a big step foward. I hope this amendment can be the beginning of the end of years of argument over Berxit in this country.But while more than 70 Labour MPs have publicly called for another referendum, dozens of\u0026nbspothers are strongly opposed, including shadow ministers who would likely resign in order to vote against any proposal for going back to the public.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentSoon after the party\u0027s motion was tabled, shadow housing minister Melanie Onn announced that should would step down if she is ordered to vote for another referendum.In a letter to constituents, she wrote: I am not in favour of a People\u0027s Vote and will not vote for it. If it comes before parliament as it is expected to in the next few daysweeks, I will instead vote for a better \u0027Labour\u0027 deal.This may mean that I am required to step down from my frontbench housing role if it is a whipped vote. I would be very disappointed if this were the case, as I am very proud of the work I have been doing alongside John Healey and Sarah Jones, but recognise that I cannot vote against the frontbench and remain a part of it.Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour\u0027s\u0026nbspshadow business secretary, said the amendment would simply\u0026nbspwiden the debate and put all options on the table to avoid a no-deal scenario but that the party\u0027s priority remained securning\u0026nbspa different Brexit deal, including a customs union with the EU and a closer relationship with the\u0026nbspsingle market.\u0026nbspAsked if\u0026nbspLabour\u0027s motion\u0026nbspmakes a second referendum\u0026nbspmore likely,\u0026nbspshe told Sky News: Well, no. In line with our conference policy...our priority is to secure a deal\u0026nbspbut obviously all options need to remain on the table and that includes a public vote.She added: There\u0027s no\u0026nbspguarantee that it will pass even if our amendment passed\u0026nbspand certainly right across the Conservative Party\u0026nbspand in the Labour Party there\u0027s ided opinion as to whether a second referendum should be a preferred option at this stage.Ms Long-Bailey\u0026nbspsuggested that, even if its amendment passes, Labour would not necessarily instruct its MPs to vote for another referendum, saying: That\u0027s something that the party would need to decide at the time.\u0026nbspWith parliament still deadlocked over Brexit, former Conservative leader William Hague said a fresh public vote was now quite likely.Writing in the Daily , he said: It will probably produce only a narrow victory for either side despite a long struggle, and leave a wounded country to limp on afterwards.But it\u0027s coming, unless some extraordinary turn of events prevents it. It\u0027s coming by a process of elimination, not because it\u0027s a good idea in itself.MPs will vote on 29 January on amendments to Ms May\u0027s proposed plan.Commons home affairs committee chair Yvette Cooper has tabled a motion that would delay Brexit until the end of the year if no deal is in place by the end of February. With significant cross-party support, the motion is likely to pass if Labour agrees to support it.Hilary Benn, chair of the Brexit commitee, has put down a separate amendment calling for MPs to hold a series of indicative votes on various Brexit outcomes.And Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, is expected to propose giving parliament to right to seize\u0026nbspcontrol of Brexit if the government cannot pass its deal.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I understand what she is saying, there is a lot of merit in it. We, as a party, will make a decision.Mr Corbyn reiterated his call for Mrs May to remove the threat of a no-deal Brexit, adding: We are not calling for an extension of Article 50 but quite clearly if Theresa May runs the clock all the way down MPs are going to recognise the dangers of leaving with no deal.Mr Corbyn said that his priority was the Labour amendment he had tabled. Asked if he would whip his MPs to support the Cooper amendment, he said: We haven\u0027t decided what exactly we are going to whip on yet.We clearly will be whipping in support of the amendment that I have tabled, which is one that has broad support, not just among Labour MPs but amongst the wider MPs in Parliament on this. That is our priority.Asked how long an extension to the Article 50 process should be, he said: It has to be, obviously, limited.But we are not calling for that, what we are calling for is the Government to take no deal off the table, negotiate seriously with other parties and with the European Union in order to move in the direction of an agreement which gives us the customs union, the market access and protection of rights.Theresa May has echoed Donald Trump by throwing the UK’s weight behind Venezuela’s opposition leader – rather than its controversial president.Juan Guaidó, the head of the national assembly, declared himself president during mass protests against rule by Nicolás Maduro, which has plunged the country into economic freefall.The US president has recognised Mr Guaidó as interim leader and urged the military to intervene against the elected president, the protégé of firebrand socialist Hugo Chávez.Asked about the crisis, the prime minister’s spokesman said: “The 2018 presidential election in Venezuela was neither free nor fair, so the regime’s basis for power is deeply flawed.“We fully support the democratically-elected national assembly with Juan Guaidó as its president.”However, Downing Street stopped short of the US move of recognising Mr Guaidó as president, saying: “The UK position is to recognise states rather than governments.”The spokesman also criticised Caracas for expelling US diplomats, saying: “In relation to the United States, we think it’s totally unacceptable for Venezuela to cut off diplomatic ties.“The solution to this crisis lies in working to find a peaceful and diplomatic solution not in expulsions.”And, backing Mr Guaidó, he added: “The Venezuela government needs to respect the authority of the national assembly.”Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, has also been into No 10. He said the PM she should delay the Brexit leaving date until at least July to allow further talks.It is in everyone\u0027s interest to extend Article 50 until at least the summer, he said outside Downing Street.We want Theresa May to move away from appeasing the right wing of the Tory party.Mr Prentis said the UK should remain within a customs union because it would be a nonsense to leave.The PM was very pleasant during the talks, according to Mr Prentis, who said he hoped Ms May was listening.He warned against the brinkmanship of a no-deal Brexit, adding that March 29 was a real barrier.Leadsom\u0026nbspsaid the House will\u0026nbsprise on Thursday 14 February and return on Monday 24 February - this “is and does remain the position” -\u0026nbspamid speculation it could be cancelled to give MPs more time to pass Brexit legislation.But this would have to be confirmed by a Commons vote, she said. Nervous MPs may be less than reassured about their holiday plans.TUC general secretary Frances O\u0027Grady said they did not get the guarantees we need after meeting the PM in Downing Street this morning.She said: I think she needs to shift gear, stop playing to just the bad boys at the back of the class and listen to others for a change. We\u0027ve been very clear with the PM that our priorities are protecting people\u0027s jobs and making sure workers\u0027 rights are protected now and into the future.Ms O\u0027Grady said the PM needed to offer a sign of good faith that she was serious about listening to other voices and she needs to ask for more time.Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who\u0027s succeeded Angela Merkel as leader of Germany\u0027s CDU, has said it is not clear what Great Britain wants on Brexit.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHere\u0027s the clip of her speaking to Bloomberg in Davos:Theresa May is due to meet trade union bosses today, as part of efforts to\u0026nbspbreak the Brexit deadlock. Len McCluskey, the powerful Unite boss and ally of Jeremy Corbyn, will be among the left-wing union leaders meeting the PM.A Downing Street spokesman said: The PM\u0026nbsphas said that this is a process of engagement across the House of Commons but also with other interested sectors.She has spoken to business leaders and she will be talking with union leaders.Issues I expect to be discussed will be around employment rights, environmental standards and those sorts of things.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company reported like-for-like sales growth of 7.2 per cent for the first 12 weeks of the second quarter, while like-for-like sales in the year to date have risen 6.3 per cent. However, costs in the first half have been “considerably higher” than the previous year, particularly for labour, which is up by around £30m.

The group has opened two pubs and sold six since the beginning of the financial year, with plans to open between five and 10 this year.

Any hint of higher costs, including staff wages, is bad news so the news of another £30m in labour costs since November will hurt. With unemployment low, thanks in part to lower flows of workers from the EU, labour costs will continue to be a focus at Wetherspoon.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Seen by satellite and on foot around the city, officials warn that what they call land subsidence poses a grave danger to a country where protests over water scarcity have already seen violence.Land subsidence is a destructive phenomenon, said Siavash Arabi, a measurement expert at Iran\u0027s cartography department. Its impact may not be immediately felt like an earthquake, but as you can see, it can gradually cause destructive changes over time.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHe said he can identify destruction of farmland, the cracks of the earth\u0027s surface, damage to civilian areas in cities, wastewater lines, cracks in roads and damages to water and natural gas pipes.Tehran, which sits 1,200 meters (3,900 feet) above sea level against the Alborz Mountains on a plateau, has rapidly grown over the last 100 years to a sprawling city of 13 million people in its metropolitan area.Man-made drought threatens to ravage IraqAll those people have put incredible pressure on water resources on a semi-arid plateau in a country that saw only 171 millimeters (6.7 inches) of rain last year. Over-reliance on ground aquifers has seen increasingly salty water pumped from below ground.Surface soil contains water and air. When you pump water from under the ground surface, you cause some empty space to be formed in the soil, Mr Arabi told Associated Press. Gradually, the pressure from above causes the soil particles to stick together and this leads to sinking of the ground and formation of cracks.Rain and snow to recharge the underground aquifers have been in short supply. Over the past decade, Iran has seen the most prolonged and severe drought in more than 30 years, according to the United Nations\u0027 Food and Agriculture Organisation. An estimated 97 per cent of the country has faced some level of drought, Iran\u0027s Meteorological Organisation says.That has caused the sinkholes and fissures now seen around Tehran.Iranian authorities say they have measured up to 22 centimetres (8.6 inches) of annual subsidence near the capital, while the normal range would be only as high as 3 centimetres (1.1 inches) per year.Even higher numbers have been measured in other parts of the country. Some sinkholes formed in western Iran are as deep as 60 metres (196 feet).Those figures are close to those found in a study by scientists at the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam previously discussed by the journal Nature and accepted by the journal Remote Sensing of Environment. Using satellite images between 2003 and 2017, the scientists estimate the western Tehran plain is sinking by 25 centimetres (9.8 inches) a year.Either way, the numbers are alarming to experts.In European countries, even 4 millimetres (0.15 inches) of yearly subsidence is considered a crisis, Iranian environmental activist Mohammad Darvish said.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Demonstrators hold a huge banner reading \u0027Madrid\u0027s taxi demands that the law has to be enforced\u0027 as drivers protest outside IFEMA Convention and Congress Center, against the regulation of ride-hailing and car-sharing services such as Uber and CabifyFrench President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel shake hands after signing a French-German friendship treaty in the town hall of Aachen, western Germany.

Cracks run down walls and below windows, and water pipes have ruptured. Residents fear poorly built buildings may collapse.The sinking also threatens vital infrastructure, like Tehran\u0027s Imam Khomeini International Airport. German scientists estimate that land under the airport is sinking by 5 centimetres (1.9 inches) a year.Tehran\u0027s oil refinery, a key highway, automobile manufacturing plants and railroads also all sit on sinking ground, said Ali Beitollahi, a Ministry of Roads and Transportation official. Some 2 million people live in the area, he said.Masoud Shafiee, head of Iran\u0027s cartography department, also acknowledged the danger.Rates (for subsidence) are very high and in many instances it\u0027s happening in densely populated areas, Mr Shafiee told AP. It\u0027s happening near sensitive infrastructures like airports, which we consider a top priority.Geopolitics play a role in Iran\u0027s water crisis. Since the country\u0027s 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran has sought to become self-sufficient across industries to thwart international sanctions. That has included agriculture and food production.The problem, however, comes in inefficient water use on farms, which represents more than 90 per cent of the country\u0027s water usage, experts say.Already, the drought and water crisis has fed into the sporadic unrest Iran has faced over the last year. In July, protests around Khorramshahr, some 650 kilometres (400 miles) southwest of Tehran, saw violence as residents of the predominantly Arab city near the border with Iraq complained of salty, muddy water coming out of their taps amid the years-long drought.The unrest there only compounds the wider unease felt across Iran as it faces an economic crisis sparked by President Donald Trump\u0027s decision to withdraw America from Tehran\u0027s nuclear deal with world powers.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long opposed Iran\u0027s theocratic government, even released an online video in June offering his country\u0027s water technology in a jab at Iran\u0027s leaders.The Iranian regime shouts: \u0027Death to Israel,’” Mr Netanyahu said. In response, Israel shouts: \u0027Life to the Iranian people.’”Iranian officials shrugged off the offer. But solutions to the water crisis will be difficult to find.Iran impatient to go to war with Israel, says head of air forceWill America’s sanctions against Iran actually sink the regime?US plan to host Iran conference in Poland angers authorities in TehranUS struggles to find footing on Yemen, as Iran increases influenceThe crisis stems from decades of sanctions and compounding political mismanagement that is likely to make it very difficult to alleviate the emerging crisis before it wreaks lasting damage upon the country, wrote Gabriel Collins, a fellow at Rice University\u0027s Baker Institute.\u0026nbspIranian authorities have begun to crack down on illegal water wells. They are also exploring using desalinisation plants along the Persian Gulf as well, though they require tremendous energy. Farming practices also need to change as well, experts say.We need to shift our development model so that it relies less on water and soil, Mr Darvish, the activist, said. If we don\u0027t act quickly to stop the subsidence, it can spread to other areas.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.“The role did not involve client advice on any issue. Keir resigned as a consultant to the academy when he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.”A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is a bid for power without a mandate.Shty Dominic Grieve fancies himself as a Remain superhero, outwitting the Government to rob .million voters.He doesn’t give a damn about the little people, of course, being a grand QC and former Attorney General.But Grieve is doing catastrophic harm to his party, to Parliament and our democracy.

The Borough of Culture is about inspiring people who might not have considered a career in the arts and unlocking their potential.“The Borough of Culture also forms part of the Mayor’s work to tackle the root causes of violent crime, as it will create cultural activities specically designed to be easily accessible to disadvantaged young Londoners."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000463397365.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sob stories ruined sas who dares wins","story":"A political decision that was clearly designed to distract voters and get an easy round of applause.Two things that were never going to stop Channel  enforcing the same rules at its own brilliant version of selection, SAS: Who Dares Wins, evenit was the last show on television that needed any fixing.Its three series have been close to works of art, in fact, largely thanks to their breathtaking settings and four instructors, Ant Middleton, Jason Fox, Matthew Ollerton and Mark Billingham, who gave it such an air of authenticity you could suspend disbelief and imagine you were watching the real thing.As the show’s introduction would have it, though, everything’s changed and they’re a band of brothers no more.The fourth run has  female recruits including a mole called Petra who’s served, for nine years, with Swedish Special forces, on their “front line”.A place which — full ignorant disclosure — I didn’t think extended much beyond the first day of Ikea’s January sales when it all kicks off on Malmo High Street, but actually involved several tours of Afghanistan.Her job here was to spy on all the contestants, and Petra’s certainly done a better job than the production team, because I’ve been watching it for three weeks and can only name three men.First to show, in Chile, was a Muslim called Qash, who voluntarily withdrew after discovering he’d have to share bathroom facilities with the women .  There’s also been no avoiding mentally fragile Nathaniel, or Milo, who’s so camp he makes Alan Carr sound like Lee Marvin.The rest of the  blokes, though, have just become anonymous blips on the horizon while the camera fixates on the women.Among their favourites have been: Saranya, who became the first candidate ever to shout “WHEEEEEEEEEE!” during the ft abseil, tattooed Tracey, blunt Aberdonian Lou, with the voice that goes through you like a rusty bayonet, and television natural Louise, who was the only woman bold enough to challenge a man in the boxing round, and suffered an uncomfortable beating for her troubles.Standards y, but the brutal, straight-down-the-line approach of the four instructors rarely wavers on screen, no matter the gender or how much noise they make.“You having a baby ”“No staff.”“Then shut the f*** up.”This is why you’d probably trust Ant Middleton and the other three with your lives.Politicians and TV people, on the other hand, I trust about as far as I could piggy-back them up the Andes.Almost no encouragement is needed, butyou give them any they will try to reduce every show on TV to one long procession of box-ticking contestants with a crowd-pleasing, right-on ­conclusion.That’s why the most over-worked recruit on this series is the pianist on sob story duties.It may always have had an element of this, of course, but the point when the scales really fell from my eyes was Sunday’s voluntary withdrawal of Nathaniel, who left a letter for the other weeping recruits announcing: “This is just the start of my journey.”You wish him well, obviously, but use of the dreaded J-word wasn’t just the moment I could no longer suspend disbelief, it was also the moment I started to think television was turning SAS selection into Bootcamp on The X Factor.Andthat’s the case, Channel  can have my badge. I’m voluntarily withdrawing from their process.DANCING On Ice viewers can’t say they weren’t warned.“After the break,” said host Phillip Schofield, “Gemma Collins is Marilyn Monroe. Don’t go away.”A big ask. But then so’s stling a fit of the giggles when Richard Blackwood describes himself as “the king of cool”, and trying to look at Ryan Side-bottom’s Beauty and the Beast make-up without thinking of Terry Waite chained to a radiator in the Lebanon.The Gemmasaurus, though, performed at least three television miracles at Sunday’s Musicals-themed night.The first was being hoisted into the DOI rafters, on  board a giant ring, within  seconds, by the same team who got the London Eye upright.The second involved claiming the moral high ground, from Jason Gardiner, during a spectacular toddler tantrum at the end of her Diamonds Are A Girl’s Best Friend routine.And the third, but biggest of all, was somehow getting voted through to next week’s show despite re-writing the entire history of musicals. Gentlemen, it transpires, no longer prefer blondes.They can’t  stand them, in fact.QUIZ show doughballs of the week. The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “The Burger And The King is a documentary about which singer’s eating habits ”Gianluca: “Billie Jean King.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “If I meow, what animal am I ”Poppy: “A goat.”Celebrity Mastermind, John Humphrys: “In an  poem, what season of the year does Keats describe as ‘the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness’ ”Monty Panesar: “Oliver Twist.”Joe Lycett: “The fictional Champion the Wonder Horse is actually a what ”Ben: “A zebra.”. THIS Morning handover of the week. Holly Willoughby: “Love against the odds is the subject of the phone-in today. Vanessa Feltz, what kind of calls are you hoping for today ”“We’re looking for calls from people who think their love is against the odds.”And that’s why it’s about to win a National Television Award for the ninth year in a row. ANOTHER week brings another incompatible pair of reality TV gimps, with an E title that also sounds suspiciously like their viewing figures.Spencer, Vogue and Baby Too, a fly-on-the-wall documentary, about Matthews and Williams of that ilk, which is based  on the classic misapprehension of every first-time parent: The world is simply full of people who give the slightest toss about their newborn.It’s not. Nor is anyone listening when they bang on about the “tiredness, sleepless nights and blah blah blah”.The only reason I kept watching this one, in fact, was to try to establish exactly how Spencer and Vogue earn a living, as they’re one of those independently wealthy couples who give very little clue as to why they’re always so “busy, busy, busy”.It took a couple of episodes, but eventually Vogue muttered some- thing about her own fake tan range and Spencer said something even less convincing about cooking, before adding: “We bring dferent things to the table.” The urge Spencer really wants to milk, it turns out though, is a creative one. So, at the climax of episode two he’s striding into London’s Soho Theatre for an audition, with the defiant announcement: “I’m going to open or shut the door on my childhood dream of becoming an actor.”And how’s that going Make sure it bangs your a*** on the way out, Spencer.TV GOLD: The Paras: Men Of War, on ITV. BBC’s Revolution In Ruins: The Hugo Chavez Story detailing exactly how socialism, with Jeremy Corbyn’s connivance, destroyed Venezuela, the most oil-rich country in South America.Sky Atlantic repeating series one of The Sopranos.

Ah, oui, Dominique. Not as British as you might think, Grieve.Which may explain why he  is now doing such terrible damage to our national interest and to the future of our parliamentary system by trying to block Brexit. Over the two decades since he became an MP in , this pukka, posh-suited, punctilious figure has been a pedantic regular in House of Commons debates.He would crook one of his little fingers at an angle, give his neck muscles a creaky tweak and insist, with a shot of the cuffs and a shuffle of minimal notes, that ministers and officials must always comply with statute and precedent and time-honoured procedure.When giving these lectures — they were seldom short — he would touch the rim of his glasses, give a little mallard-style cough and allow a patronising smile to inhabit his broadening bill.He would explain that raw political instinct and passion, of the sort voiced by the Nigel Farages and Jeremy Corbyns of this world,  were not by themselves good enough in politics. He looked down on such things.Politicians whose demagogic brio reflected the public’s molten anger  Puh-lease, how vulgar. They did not accord with Grieve’s gods of logic.“With respect,” he would say — and it is one of the older truths of Westminster that when people say “with respect” they mean the sneery opposite — “with respect, we have to do things according to the rules, for that is the way this Parliament works and those are the sort of people we are.”I paraphrase him but that was very much Grieve’s position. He was a creature of propriety.He could cite legal sub-section and addendum and annex and codicil that proved, we were told, the unarguable merits of his position.With Monsieur half-French Grieve, the ancient principles of English law were our majesty. Our mainstay!Plenty of us clocked that Grieve was a bit of a prune, an oddball, the fogeyish son of privilege. His dad Percy, wouldn’t you know it, had also been a Tory MP of the gusset-and-sock-suspenders old school.Percy once worked as a liaison officer for French wartime hero Charles de Gaulle, who hated the British . It was said that Old Man Grieve agreed with de Gaulle.“The trouble with Percy  is that he likes foreigners  a great deal better than his own people,” concluded an acquaintance.Dominic, in childhood, worshipped his father and once won a school oratory contest by making an admiring speech about de Gaulle.Does “Dominique”, too, like continentals better than his fellow countrymen  It sure looks that way. In June , in one of the greatest thumpings our elite was ever given by the people, we voted to leave the EU. Dominic Grieve, newly decorated with France’s Legion d’honneur for his political work, was horried.Indignant. You could even say he was ag-Grieved. And so he touched the rims of his glasses, did some ducky quacking and set to work to block Brexit.The trouble, as has often been pointed out to him, was that the democratic vote had gone against him.At first he said, through gritted teeth , that he would respect the result of the referendum.In  he was re-elected as MP for prosperous Beaconsfield, Bucks,  on a Tory manesto which said exactly that.Every Tory MP promised to get us out of the customs union and single market.Labour MPs also promised to honour the referendum result. What lying bastards these people are. When the new Government started to get into political dficulties, the once-principled Grieve saw his chance. He stopped saying he would respect the referendum result. He wanted us to stay in the customs union. He wanted a second referendum.Most startling of all, he plotted to bypass all those rules and time-honoured procedures he used to say were so vital for our political safety.After a secret meeting with the appallingly biased John Bercow, Grieve got that anti-Brexit Commons Speaker to chuck out centuries of accepted debating rules.Propriety was smashed like plates at a Greek wedding. Legal advice was ignored.This former Attorney General’s campaign against Brexit, which will next week see him and a minority of MPs attempt to remove law-making from the elected Government, took on a wild, crazed aspect.The possible upshots for our democratic system are terrying. When MPs stop even bothering to pretend they will honour their election promises, why should anyone vote Why not just seize power by force  It’s a recipe for anarchy on the streets.At the moment, Corbyn’s Labour Party is going along with Grieve and Bercow but Corbyn will surely eventually realise that warping parliamentary rules to stop an elected Government from governing will do him no favourshe himself becomes Prime Minister.  It always takes time for the penny to drop with dozy Corbyn.Meanwhile, we are left  with the bizarre spectacle of one-time legal details nerd Dominic Grieve going back  on everything he ever stood for, overturning ancient parliamentary conventions.All along, it seems, his loyalties were not to a rules-based system but to the blue flag of a European Union that is now, increasingly, our rival and our deadly threat.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Every time rent control has been tried, in every place, it has had disastrous consequences.Rent control will make London’s housing crisis worse by decreasing the availability and quality of housing.Its not backed by a single competent economist and Londons mayor shows hes not serious by suggesting such an economically illiterate policy.Polls show that most renters back the policy and believe it would help ease the housing crisis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000463793125.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit mess political party rod liddle opinion","story":"So I tell you what — let’s have a party.Thing is, I don’t mean a shindig where we all get copiously rat-a***d.I mean a political party. A new political party, which represents what a lot of us want.Because you’ve got to say — the parties in Westminster aren’t doing that, are they Whatever happens at the end of this awful Brexit mess, one thing is clear, our politics have to change.The isions between our current parties no longer reflect the isions in the country. If Brexit has told us anything, it’s told us that.And there is a growing anger out there that the views of millions and millions of people are simply not represented in Parliament.That’s obvious from Brexit — more than a third of Labour voters wanted us to leave. Including a majority in some northern constituencies. Almost two thirds of Tory voters wanted us to leave.Nigel Farage, the former leader of Ukip, has already said he fancies creating a new party. A Brexit Party.Good luck to the man — I might even join it, because I have the horrible feeling our Parliament is going to betray the people, and we’ll end up staying in. That would be a travesty of democracy.The very reasons which convinced more than million of us to vote for Brexit were the same as those which are causing isions across Europe. And as a result we’ve seen the huge rise of populist parties. In Italy, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Greece, France and even Germany. Oh — and, of course — the USA.These parties are sometimes right wing, sometimes left wing. In Italy there is an alliance between the two.What they are all, though, is dferent to the politics we have now. They are parties which listen to the people. Populist is just another way of saying popular, really.Most agree on a whole bunch of issues. We need to control immigration, number one. Especially immigration from Islamic countries.We need a bit more respect for the nation state: People feel proud of the countries in which they live. Yes, even some Belgians.A lot are socially conservative. By which I mean they do not have much time for gender neutral toilets, LGBTQI protests, political correctness and so on.Instead, they have a respect for traditional values. For the family, for the Christian faith, on which our countries were founded. For our histories. And they are sceptical of the European Union.But they also recognise that there are deep economic isions within our countries which need to be addressed. In our own country a terrible chasm between the affluence and influence of London, versus the rest of the country. Between rich and poor.We have no political party right now which covers those bases.But that is where the real ide in society lies. So, as January drags on — how about a party  One that represents US Labour MP Diane Abbott thinks that the BBC Question Time programme discriminated against her because she is:a blackAbbott got a rough ride and the audience spent most of the time laughing at her or booing.Diane, listen. It’s not your skin colour. It’s not your gender.It’s something  altogether.We are used to politicians speaking down to us.And we are used to politicians being thick.But when both occur at the same time, that’s when the rest of us decide we’ve had enough.Stuff the BBC won’t tell you.Number One – The International Monetary Fund has admitted it got its projections wrong.The UK economy is not stagnating. Economic growth for the next year will be every bit as strong as in France and Germany.And meanwhile all the other indicators – investment, employment, growth in wages – are MUCH better than those in the European Union.Someone tell Huw Edwards.Yet again I’ve accepted a Facebook friend request from a woman without checkingshe’s a proper woman, rather than a porno sock-puppet.Sure enough, within the minute, I was invited to view intimate photographs of the lady.And she ended her invitation with the words: “Slap my frog, cowboy!”Why would I want to slap her frog  I hope her frog has a long and happy le. And why am I a cowboyTheres nothing funnier than slebs making idiots of themselves while politically grandstanding.Gary Lineker, for example, does it every week. His intellect is about as radiant as a candle flame in an aircraft hangar. But he still gives it large, ranting about Brexit. And praising Europe’s worst leader, France’s Emmanuel Macron.The latest slebs to fall foul are the Spice Girls. They posed for photos in “edgy”T-shirts reading: Gender Justice. Now it’s been revealed those shirts were made in a workshop by women who are paid p per hour.There’s gender justice for you.The memorial to Bomber Command in London’s Hyde Park has been defaced by scumbags.They threw paint over the sculpture – and also vandalised statues of Winston Churchill and US President Franklin D. Roosevelt.Our pilots in World War Two won a battle against all the odds to protect this country from fascism. More than , of them died doing so.The filth who vandalised the memorial know nothing of that. Nothing of personal sacrice, of hardship, of discipline.And they know nothing of history, full stop.What kind of people are we raising in this country So, huge congratulations to Ant McPartlin.The perpetually smirking Geordie munchkin won “best presenter” at the National Television Awards, despite not having been on television for a year.People have criticised the decision, but I’m all in favour.Andhe promises to stay off the screens for another  months, I’d give him next year’s award, tooDid you see the shots of the babes turning up for the National Television Awards I call them babes because it was minus ten or something out there. And they rolled up to stand on the red carpet outside in flimsy dresses slit from ankle to lady garden.

They only have interests, guts and the ambition to take Venezuelas oil, gas and gold.Guaido issued a rival statement urging foreign embassies to ignore Maduro’s threats and keep their diplomats in the country.A few hours later, Pompeo confirmed the US would ignore Maduro’s threats to withdraw their embassy staff.The Secretary of State warned the “the Venezuelan military and security forces” against attempting to force US diplomats to leave the country.He warned America would take “appropriate action”US nationals were “endangered.”Pompeo said: “The United States will take appropriate actions to hold accountable anyone who endangers the safety and security of our mission and its personnel.”Trump branded Maduro’s government “illegitimate” and said that America stands with Venezuela.Maduro destroyed the oil-rich South American nation’s economy sparking rampant inflation which wrecked its health system and left his people starving.Charismatic Guaidó - a -year-old lawmaker scarred by rubber bullets in street demos - has boosted stalled efforts to finally oust limpet-like Maduro, .He has also won the crucial support of neighbouring nations Brazil and Colombia and Donald Trump’s US.The march and further unrest in the capital, Caracas followed two nights of violent protests in working-class neighbourhoods of Caracas where Maduro support was once firm.Other protests were planned across the country and outside embassies around the world.Guaidó warned notoriously brutal Maduro: “The world’s eyes are on our homeland today.”Guaidó - head of the countrys National Assembly - earlier described the president as a “usurper” and declared himself ready to assume the presidency until fair elections.He went on to bravely call on armed forces keeping Maduro in power to disobey the government.Venezuela - whose hard-left regime was saluted by Jeremy Corbyn in  - sits on the biggest oil reserves on earth.But its rulers have presided over rampant hyperinflation rendering the Boli currency worthless and sparked food and medicine shortages while crime rocketed.Street unrest boiled over amid spiralling economic turmoil after three million Venezuelans fled triggering a refugee crisis across the continent."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000463981748.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"malaysia king sultan abdullah pahang","story":"He had spent a few days back on his royal duties, as he had been away for two months on medical leave.In a statement, the palace said the king was grateful for the opportunity given to him by the Council of Rulers and thanked the prime minister and government.A statement from the palace said: His Highness has worked towards fulfilling his responsibilities entrusted to him as the head of state, serving as a pillar of stability, source of justice, the core of unity ... for the people.But while the official reason is not known, the -year-old King had just married Oksana Voevodina, , who converted to Islam last April just so she could wed him  last November.Rumours had linked the so-called secret marriage to the abdication.It is not known how the pair met and it is unclear whether she has been married before.The palace did not respond to requests for comment on the photos or reports of a marriage.But previous newspaper reports shown Oksana on a reality TV show taking part in a steamy scene in a swimming pool.Pro-Kremlin newspaper Komosomolskaya Pravda reported the royal we clutched a Champagne glass as she surprised the participants of a reality show by having sex on her first date."},{"url":null,"title":"huntsman spider beer aussie heatwave","story":"This chilling clip shows a giant Hunstman spider cooling down on an icy bottle of beer.The lager drinker told on YouTube how she shot the chilling video at her home.It’s been so hot here in Australia and the only solution is a cold beer, she wroteThis huntsman crawled onto my hand so I turned on my phone camera and recorded it.I’m sure he was just thirsty and looking for some relief from the heat.And the fearless females cool approach to her creepy encounter has won her plenty of fans.One wrote: When the world ends Im finding this lady and joining her team.Anyone who could relax with that thing on their hand is someone I would blindly follow in an emergency.Another added: If I was president of Australia I would nuke my own country to kill all those spiders.Australia has been experiencing a record-breaking heatwave since the start of the year.Temperatures in southern Australia touched  degreestoday shattering previous records.In Adelaide, it got so hot one pub doled out FREE BEER to customers scorching in the heat.How more Aussie can you get then that, one patron told media inside the pub. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We’d have a week to try to persuade the Commons not to back the bill or Brexit would be delayed and the pressure would come off the EU.The pound soared yesterday on rising hopes that Brexit will end up being postponed.Senior Downing Street officials are currently trying to work out a way to ignore the amendmentit does pass.No is expected to back an alternative amendment, tabled by Tory Brexiteer Andrew Murrison, which deals with the Irish backstop.Brexit-supporting MPs want to impose a time limit on the backstop to avoid Britain being trapped in the EU customs union indefinitely.The Murrison motion is supported by Tory grandees from all sides of the Brexit spectrum, including Sir Nicholas Soames, Sir Graham Brady and Damian Green.A source close to Mrs May said she wants to see MPs vote for it next week.That would give her the ammunition she needs toto Brussels and request a legally binding change to the backstop.PM Leo Varadkar said: In order to honour our commitment to the people of Ireland that there be no hard border, we would have to agree on full alignment on customs and regulations.And his deputy Simon Coveney claimed keeping the UK in the customs union is the only way to uphold the Good Friday Agreement.He wrote in the : We will continue to require solutions to avoid a hard border that are rooted in regulatory alignment and legal certainty and not just wishful thinking.The backstop - intended to keep the Irish border open - has been roundly rejected by Brexiteers.And the UK Government is adamant that it can only be acceptableits time limited.Irish police have reportedly drawn up plans to send  police to the border in case of a No Deal outcome.This week the EU admitted for the first time that it will enforce a hard border on IrelandBritain leaves without a deal.Matt Hancock said today: The thing is that Parliament needs to come together and approve a deal to stop No Deal Brexit, and so far that hasnt happened.The EUs Brexit envoy Michel Barnier warned that a delay wouldnt be enough to ensure that both sides can reach a deal.He said: I personally believe that we do not need so much more time, but that we now need to make decisions.Today the PM has been hosting trade union chiefs at No in a bid to get more support for her deal.But Frances OGrady, general secretary of the TUC, said after her meeting: The Prime Minister hasnt given us the guarantees we need on jobs or workers rights.Even after a catastrophic defeat, her red lines havent shted, and the threat of No Deal hasnt even been taken off the table.Dave Prentis of Unison added: It is in everyones interest to extend Article  until at least the summer. We want Theresa May to move away from appeasing the right wing of the Tory party.NEXT Tuesday, the Commons will debate Theresa Mays Plan B for Brexit - which is identical to her Plan A.Although the debate will be on a so-called neutral motion, stating only that the Commons has considered her statement, MPs will have the power to table amendments dictating what should happen next.Speaker John Bercow - known for his pro-EU sympathies - will choose which ones MPs can vote on.COOPER - NINE-MONTH DELAYYvette Cooper is tabling a bill to stop Britain leaving the EU without a deal on March .She proposes thatthere isnt a deal by February , MPs could delay Article  for nine months - giving ministers until the end of the  to secure a withdrawal agreement.The bill is a standalone law, but an amendment to the PMs statement would see it catapulted to the top of the Commons agenda.Jeremy Corbyn is likely to support the move, which would give it a good chance of passing.GRIEVE - WRECKING BREXITDominic Grieve has proposed an amendment which would effectively transfer power from the Government to the Commons.Under the terms of his proposal, MPs would get the power to decide which bills are debated in Parliament, a privilege usually held by ministers.The amendment would tear up centuries of precedent by limiting the Governments ability to govern and so is unlikely to succeed.MURRISON - PMS LIFELINETory Brexiteer Andrew Murrison has an amendment which could help the PM make her case in Brussels.It takes the form of a demand for a time limit on the hated Irish backstop plan, to stop Britain being trapped in the EU customs union permanently.If Conservative backbenchers support it, Mrs May could then use that as proof that all she needs to get the deal through Parliament is a tweak to the backstop - putting the ball in Brussels court.CORBYN - MORE FUDGELast night Jeremy Corbyn and his frontbench allies tabled an amendment laying out Labours policy.The non-binding motion would see Britain seek to reopen the withdrawal agreement - something the EU insists is impossible.It also suggests that the Government should allow MPs to vote on whether or not to back a second referendum.BENN - NONSTOP VOTESSenior backbencher Hilary Benn wants ministers to stage a series of indicative votes on what to do next.That would allow MPs to have their say on their preferred outcome - from No Deal to a second referendum.CREASY - CITIZENS ASSEMBLYAn amendment from Labour Remainer Stella Creasy is a bid to secure a citizens assembly on Brexit.It would force the Government to delay Article , then convene an assembly of  representative voters to discuss the way forward.REEVES -

It is hard-nosed realism.Signicantly, it bears the ­signature of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Angela Merkel’s chosen successor as Germany’s next Chancellor.Her appeal can be seen as a rebuke to Mrs Merkel, who rejected David Cameron’s plea for help to curb immigration, tipping ­Britain towards Brexit.Brits might have chosen dferentlyshe had responded to voters’ dismay not just in Britain but across the EU.She later signed her own political death warrant by flinging open Europe’s borders to a million Syrian migrants.But voters’ resentment towards arrogant EU leaders — recorded by their own Eurostat polling system — long predates immigration.Embattled French President Emmanuel Macron recently admitted he had dared not offer his voters a “Frexit”  ­referendum — because they would leave in a flash.Weeks later, his fears were confirmed as “yellow-vest” anarchists set Paris ablaze.French observers believe the gilets jaunes riots have their origins in another referendum crisis.In , France voted overwhelmingly against the European Constitution — only to see it renamed the Lisbon Treaty and slyly introduced against their express wishes.The European Constitution, like the disastrous euro, was a crucial but unpopular step towards a federal European superstate.Ireland and ­Denmark have also voted down EU moves to ever-closer union.They were told to vote again until they said Yes.Brussels’ arrogant contempt for ordinary voters — dismissed by one French president as “scum” — is what politicians blithely describe as the “democratic deficit”.It sowed the seeds for Brexit. Immigration simply brought it to a head.Germany’s letter to The Times reads like a plea from a deserted lover.“Without your great nation, this continent would not be what it is today — a community defined by freedom and ­prosperity,” writes Germany’s next Chancellor.“Should Britain wish to leave the European Union for good, it will always have friends in Germany and Europe.”This is precisely what British voters hoped for as they ­teetered on the brink of Remain but opted to Leave.They wanted a civilised orce between economic and diplomatic allies.This is still possiblethe border issue can be resolved.If we can persuade the IRA to decommission deadly weapons, surely we can decommission a backstop that nobody wants Theresa May’s rejected deal is not a total failure. Without this problem it could still fly.Germany holds the key.If Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer means what she said about friendship, now is the time to prove it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I wish wed been involved in the discussions way back then.Britains biggest union boss rebuffed calls from cross-party MPs for Labour to swing behind a second EU referendum. Instead he said the date of Brexit should be delayed, for around three months,proper further negotiations can be held.

The Prime Minister was meeting union bosses just as one of Britains largest manufacturers, Airbus, issued a stark warning of the potential damage to jobs from a no-deal departure. The aerospace giants chief executive, Tom Enders, branded the Governments handling of EU withdrawal a disgrace and warned the company could pull out of the UKBrexit undermines its ability to compete.  Chancellor Philip Hammond was preparing to tell leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos that post-Brexit Britain will still be a great place to do business. But Mr Enders said the UKs multi-billion pound aerospace sector was standing at a precipice. Brexit is threatening to destroy a century of development based on education, research and human capital, he said.  If theres a no-deal Brexit, we at Airbus will have to make potentially very harmful decisions for the UK.

But out of the ashes, a string of radically dferent Plan B options are taking shape - and will wrestle for control in the Commons. The Prime Ministers own Plan B will go head to head with plans from Remain-backing MPs that could delay Brexit or stop it altogether. Labour wants to leave with a customs union, while other Remainers want to force a second EU referendum. Importantly, MPs will hold a vote on some of these options at pm on Tuesday  January - giving Theresa May a mandate toto the EU. So what are the biggest amendments that have been proposed so far and what will they do  Heres our rolling guide, which well continue to update as the vote draws near. The key plans Theresa Mays Plan B: Rework the Irish backstop and go back to EU in February  Theresa May ed to MPs on Monday  January to outline her own Plan B. She suggested she simply wants to tweak her -page Brexit deal - including a backstop that could trap the UK under EU customs rules - instead of ripping the whole thing up. The PM did not categorically rule out the customs union demanded by Labour - or, crucially, extending the  March date of Brexit. But she tried to rebuff calls for a customs union, a second referendum, ruling out No Deal, or revoking or extending the  March date of Brexit. Mrs May said she will continue with further meetings this week and consult this House on its negotiating mandate before ing to the EU to try and agree a further Plan B. She also offered confidential briefings to MPs on the way forward, guarantees on workers rights, and consultation with parliaments committees. Yet key figures in the EU savaged Mrs Mays Plan B pleas as party politics. And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told MPs: The Prime Ministers invitation to talks has been exposed as a PR sham. Contrary to what the Prime Minister just said there was no flexibility, there were no negotiations - nothing hadchanged. WILL IT SUCCEED  Unlikely. Itd need to EU to reopen talks on the backstop - a red line for Brussels. Itd also need around  Tory Brexiteers to cave in and decide Mays deal is the only way to prevent Brexit being stopped.  The key amendment would force Theresa May try to delay the  March date of Brexit - and take No Deal off the table. It is being led by Labour MP Yvette Cooper and Tory MP Nick Boles, both Remain-backers. And crucially it appears it will be backed by the Labour frontbench and Jeremy Corbyn - giving it enough support to pass. The amendment would allow MPs to vote on a motion directing Mrs May to request an extension of the Article  date from EU chiefs,there is no new deal by February . Officially No are against the amendment, but Remain-backing ministers secretly support it because it will allow her to delay Brexit without getting her hands dirty. Ms Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said: I think sheknows that she should rule out no deal in the national interest because it would be so damaging. Shes refusing to do so and I think shes hoping that Parliament will do this for her - that is not leadership. WILL IT SUCCEED  It has a very good chance. Tory Remainers Oliver Letwin and Nicky Morgan already back the bid, and now it looks like the Labour frontbench will join in, it has a reasonable prospect of passing. Jeremy Corbyns party has tabled an amendment which calls for Parliament to have a say on all the options. Theyd include Labours own Brexit plan - a Norway plus style agreement - and also the option for a second referendum. Party sources say the amendment is in line with the partys conference motion, which called for all options to be on the table. Labour believes its version of Brexit which would include a permanent customs union, relationship with the single market and alignment on rights and standards could get a Commons majority. But a growing number of Labour MPs want a second vote - and more than % of the partys membership also back another poll. Peoples Vote supporters hailed the amendment as a major step forward to a public ballot. But shadow minister Rebecca Long-Bailey denied it made a second referendum much more likely. Jeremy Corbyn said: Our amendment will allow MPs to voteon options to end this Brexit deadlock and prevent the chaos of a No Deal. WILL IT SUCCEED  Unlikely. Tory Remainers signalled early on they would not side with Labours motion.   Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve had proposed a radical plan to let backbenchers take control of the Commons timetable - MPs, including five parties and  Tories, backed the proposal. But this was controversial because itd allow MPs to seize the timetable without a majority. No branded it a coup. And its since been watered down. A much less exciting version of Mr Grieves plan now outlines plans to let MPs take control of parliamentary business one day each fortnight between now and March . It is backed by MPs from across Parliament, including fellow Tories like ex-ministers Justine Greening and Sam Gymiah, plus Phillip Lee, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston. For Labour, those signed up include Chris Bryant, Chris Leslie, Chuka Umunna and Ben Bradshaw while Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake and Green MP Caroline Lucas are also signatories. The amendment states that on February  and , and March , ,  and , the first item of business in the Commons would be a Motion in the name of the Chairman of Ways and Means That this House has considered the United Kingdoms departure from, and future relationship with, the European Union. Tory MP Anna Soubry said she will back a combination of the Cooper and Grieve plans, because put together, they can ensure No Deal is blocked and Parliament takes back control. WILL IT SUCCEED  It seems more likely now the most alarming elements have been removed. But its still a slight unknown. Hilary Benn: Let MPs choose between four ways forward  A separate amendment by Hilary Benn, chairman of the Commons Brexit Committee, would give MPs indicative votes on the way forward. MPs would choose from dferent options to see which would come out on top. They are:Another vote on Theresa Mays deal A No Deal Brexit Renegotiate the deal with EU to achieve a specic outcome A second EU referendumWILL IT SUCCEED  Its chances of success are not yet clear. Andrew Murrison: Demand an expiry date on the Irish backstop  Tory MP Andrew Murrison tabled a short and sweet amendment to set an expiry date on the Northern Ireland backstop. He claimed it could help get Theresa Mays deal over the line by appealing to moderate MPs who just want Brexit sorted. But the EU has repeatedly ruled out putting an expiry date on the backstop. Brussels says the entire point of the clause is its an insurance policy forthe worst happens, so it wont workit has an end date. WILL IT SUCCEED  Not in the long run. It could win over some Tory MPs. Butit passes it would then create a huge headache in talks with the EU. MPs pulled a straight vote on a second EU referendum after confessing it would not have enough support in the House of Commons. The cross-party group had wanted MPs to vote on an amendment calling for a new public referendum. But five days before the vote they announced they will not table the amendment - admitting not enough MPs support it. The group, including Labours Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie, blamed Jeremy Corbyn - saying he should do the right thing and give unequivocal backing to a second referendum to ensure it can pass. Tory MP Sarah Wollaston said: We could have the numberswe had the unequivocal backing of Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour leadership. I think that is where we will get to eventually.   Plans with less chance of success John Baron: No Irish backstop The Tory MP goes further than his colleague Andrew Murrisonand seeks to rule out an Irish backstop completely. His amendment seeks to avoid any arrangement at the Irish border that would tie any part of the UK to EU customs rules until a formal trade deal was in place. Needless to say the EU wont accept this. And Mr Baron tried to pass a similar amendment before which failed by a landslide. Stella Creasy: Delay Brexit and let a Citizens Assembly take charge Labour MP Stella Creasy has proposed forcing the government to delay Brexit, with EU permission, and set up a Citizens Assembly. This new body would have a representative sample of  people to consider next steps. With help from the supergroup Liaison Committee, this Assembly would make recommendations to the House of Commons within  weeks. The government would have to respond within two weeks and set out how it will ensure the recommendations can be implemented in full.Rachel Reeves: Delay Brexit Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP, also has an amendment to extend the March  date of Brexittheres no agreement by the end of February. Again, this would need the EUs approval. Frank Field: Indicative votes The former Labour MP has joined forces with Tory Ed Vaizey to give MPs a say on a iety of options. Their amendment would mean the Commons would have to allow time for a series of votes to act as a powerful guide to the government. The options would include:Reforming the Northern Ireland backstop Leaving the EU without a deal Delaying the UKs exit from the EU Canada-style future relationship Norway-style future relationship Customs union Holding a new referendumCaroline Spelman: Prevent no deal The cross-party amendment, which also has the support of Jack Dromey, Heidi Allen, Dr Sarah Wollaston and Anna Soubry, attempts to simply reject the UK leaving without a deal. Tom Brake: cross-party committee The Liberal Democrats amendment would create a cross-party committee to take charge of the Brexit process. It would have power to decide when parliamentary time should be made available for Brexit debates and legislation, including on a fresh referendum with Remain on the ballot paper, to appoint special advisers, and to travel within the UK and to Brussels. Vince Cable: Call for a second referendum The Lib Dem leader wants to “instruct the Government to take all necessary steps to rule out a no-deal scenario and prepare for a People’s Vote in which the public will have the option to remain in the European Union on the ballot paper. Plus - how the Queen could get dragged in   Theresa May could drag the Queen into a showdown with Parliament,MPs try to cancel or postpone Brexit. Former top government lawyer Sir Stephen Laws said trying to change the law in this way through an amendment, without the Government’s participation, could create a constitutional crisis. In a paper for the Policy Exchange think tank, Sir Stephen said: “It could raise a question whether the Government would be entitled or might feel required to reassert its constitutional veto by advising the Queen not to grant Royal Assent to the Bill. “How should the Monarch react to such advice  The answer is not straightforward and the prospect of it needing to be considered in a real le political crisis is unthinkably awful. “It is a sacred duty of all UK politicians not to involve the Monarch in politics. They have a constitutional responsibility to resolve dficulties between themselves in accordance with the rules, and so as not to call on the ultimate referee.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brexit whsmith stockpiles six months","story":"NewsBrexit: WHSmith stockpiles six months of pens and notebooksThe stationers, who source most of their products from Asia, normally hold between three and four months worth of pens and notepadsShareCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsWHSmith want to avoid disruptions to the supply of stationery \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email WHSmith have said they are stockpiling six months worth of pens to guard against chaos at the border caused by Brexit .The stationers, who source most of their products from Asia, normally hold between three and four months worth of pens, diaries and notepads.

Since last year, Brits have been warned to have at least six months left on their passportthey want to travel to the EU in a No-Deal. But now officials admit some people will need to renew much earlier than that. Its because between  and September , some UK passports were issued with more than  years lespan. Yet those extra months - awarded when people carried over time from their old passport - wont countyou are entering the EU.  Soyou have a passport that is valid for longer than  years, you should not just count six months back from the expiry date to find out when it wont be valid. Instead you should count  years and six months forward from the date it was issued to find out when itll no longer be valid in the EU. Before the scheme ended in , Brits were able to get up to nine months added to the usual -year lespan of their passport.That means, as a maximum, some people will have to renew their passports  months early - nine months that dont count in the EU, plus another six months before the expiry date. Government guidance explains: Since , some adult British passports were issued with a validity longer than  years.If you renewed your passport before it expired, you were allowed to have the time left on your old passport added to your new passport.The maximum validity period possible was  years and  months.  This means you can’t use the expiry date to checkyour adult passport will be valid under the new rules. These rules will only applyBritain leaves the EU on March  without a Brexit deal. That is looking less likely as MPs plot to delay the date of Brexit. But the fact remains that, with just  days to go, the UK has still not agreed any final Brexit deal with the EU.

A complainant accused Mr Mercer of using taxpayers’ money for “electioneering” after his constituency office phone bills went up from an average pound a month to pound in March , just before the local elections. But Mr Mercer denied the lines were used for canvassing said the increased cost was due to his phone system being “hacked” and used to make phone calls to Albania. Following a probe, MPs expenses watchdog IPSA found absolutely no evidence to find the breaches were anything other than genuine oversights. However, Mr Mercer was told to repay pound. to the watchdog, which he has now paid back.  Those sums included:pound due to increased phone bills in March  as a result of Mr Mercers phone network being hacked. pound. for submitting the April  phone bill later, in September . pound. in relation to a duplicate claim for a phone bill in January .A complaint to MPs expenses watchdog IPSA also questioned why Mr Mercer had six phone lines installed in his office, when he does not have that many staff. Mr Mercer told IPSA he made an assessment that six lines would be necessary when he was first elected, but the report says “he realises that in reality he probably only needs four.” The IPSA report said: “There were around  callsto the same Albanian number on the th and early hours on the st of March. “There is insufficient information to determine the purpose of these calls, but it is certainly unusual and we suggest there may be merit in including these as part of an investigation into high telephony costs”.” IPSA said there was “absolutely no evidence to suggest any of the breaches are anything other than genuine oversights which could have been avoided with better administration and supervision.” The watchdog did not uphold a series of claims surrounding Mr Mercer’s website. Questions were raised about why Mr Mercer had claimed for several domain names, which include “johnnyforplymouth”, “Johnnyforplymouth”, “Johnnymercermp.uk”, “Johnnymercermp”, “and Johnnymercermp”. Mr Mercer told IPSA he bought the domains, at a cost to the taxpayer of more than pound, to prevent others setting up “duplicate sites”. IPSA said: “It could be argued that this may not be a good use of taxpayers’ money, but it is not technically against the Scheme.”   The watchdog also investigated the cost of setting up Mr Mercer’s website, which ran to pound,, and was set up by a firm called Smallporate, run by the husband of a member of his staff and based in the same building as his constituency office. Their report reveals invoices relating to setting up the site “lacked detail and transparency in relation to the web designer.” The complainant said it was “excessive and not value for money.” But IPSA did not uphold the complaint. Mr Mercer told IPSA: “I just looked at what I was looking for, what the market value of those things were, how I could get value for money for the tax payer, have a professional operation as a Member of Parliament and then I made the decision to go to Smallporate and build the website”. He added: “In terms of nepotism or favouritism or anything like that, people like me are acutely aware of that, but the reality isyou have the best person for the job, the fact that they are your friends we is irrelevant, it’s irrelevant because it’s all about service to the people who voted for me and the people who pay those wages and that is the tax payer.” Mr Mercer repaid pound. to IPSA in respect of the phone bill costs.

The former Prime Minister sparked fury after the picture of him with Jair Bolsonaro emerged from the World Economic Forum in Davos. The snap provoked anger among online commentators who branded it utterly inexcusable and branded Bolsonaro a neofascist thug.Labour MP Chris Williamson tweeted: Bolsonaros domestic agenda for Brazil and his plans for environmental degradation should make him an international pariah. Left-wing columnist Owen Jones added:Tony Blair does PR stunts with racist gay hating fascist Bolsonaro, when will his last apologists stop defending him, and when will he be expelled from the Labour Party. But Mr Blair hit back today in a statement attacking pundits who only speak to people who already agree with you on Twitter .  A spokesman for Mr Blair told the Mirror: It is possible to be civil towards someone who does not share your world view, dialogue is important. Unless you think you should only speak to people who already agree with you on Twitter. The spokesman said there was no formal or pre-arranged meeting between Mr Blair and Bolsonaro at the elite Swiss gathering.

Bolsonaro was sworn in on January  as Brazils first far-right President since a military dictatorship ended three decades ago. The ex-army officer dubbed the Trump of the Tropics has previously been charged with inciting hatred by Brazils attorney general.

Jeremy Corbyn cherry picked the best questions put by his backbenchers and put them again to the Prime Minister. They were all reasonable issues to raise with Mrs May but they lacked any sense of originality. So for the second time he asked why she would not rule out a no deal. And for the second time he askedher mind was closed to a customs union.  Mrs May kindly colluded with the Labour leader by giving the exact same responses as she delivered three days earlier. Like her opposite number, she also lacked spontaneity and crowdsourced her answers from observations on Twitter. She pointed out, with a mock sense of hurt, that Mr Corbyn had been willing to talk to Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA but was unwilling to meet with her. Mr Corbyn responded by borrowing Hilary Benn’s observation that the PM’s door may be open but the “mind was closed.” Mrs May then chose the curious tactic of following her renewed invitation to the Labour leader for talks by insulting him over his knowledge of Brexit. “I don’t think he knows what these phrases mean or what these phrases are,” she said. Mr Corbyn was on stronger ground by noting that Labour’s plan to stay in the customs union was backed by both the TUC and the CBI.  He perhaps missed an opportunity by not raising the exodus from the UK by countries such as Dyson and Sony. Brexit Kremlinologists will have noted that Mrs May did not rule out membership of a customs union in answer to Corbyn’s questions. But as whole this PMQs did not take us much further forward other to remind viewers that both leaders are wedded to intransigence. It took questions from Labours Sarah Jones on Grenfell and John Mann on mental health to remind you that Prime Ministers questions is not a completely wasteful exercise.

Shaun Smiths Essex flat is covered in pictures of the ex-Girls Aloud singer after a pound, makeover. He shelled out the cash on pictures, canvases, ceiling decorations and even a lesize cardboard cut-out of the celeb - best known as Cheryl Cole. Shaun, , told Essex Live: I have a big cardboard cut-out of her and its on my cupboard door as I dont have enough space because I have so much stuff in my front room. I have Cheryl Cole carpet which I had made, I have got three rugs and I even have a dog bed.  I spend so much - I love her. I watched a video on YouTube from Girls Aloudand I was told one of the members was Cheryl Cole and I didnt believe them. But I got the video of Fight For This Love up and I realised it was her, explained the fanatic.   She is a lovely person, shes caring, shes good and has a good voice and personality. She is not rude and appreciates what people do. Also, it doesnt bother her what people say and that is what I like about her. Shaun began his collection seven months ago in the summer of , and has decorated his home top to bottom.  When he looks at his ornaments and custom designs it makes him happy. He said: I feel happy that she is here and I feel content in my le. I feel I have got someone. She is someone I could look up to as a role model. He also claims that the star liked a photo of his collection when she was tagged on Twitter. The superfan has only become fixated on the star, when another actor and character he liked fell off his radar. Shaun previously spent years collecting photos and items with the face of Eastenders Ben Mitchell, played by Harry Reid, between  and .  He had hundreds of pictures of the star in his home, including clothing and cushion covers made to decorate his home. He spent around pound, to cover his flat in his favourite character that he says helped him come out proudly about his sexuality. I have more stuff of Cheryl than I ever had of Harry and Im really happy with having Cheryl, I have picture frames, photos and Im made up and really happy. Shaun fell out of love of the actor and character and admitted he stopped watching the soap. However, he did manage to see one of the last episodes Harry Reid played hardman Phil Mitchells son, in the scene where he flees on a boat.  It has since been announced that the character will be making a comeback to the show with another face and the sixth actor to attempt the role, Max Bowden. Shaun revealed what he thought about the new Ben: I will be very intrigued what the new Ben will be like and how the new guy will play him - I still like the character of Ben Mitchell. But what happened to all of his collectibles  I sold some of my Ben Mitchell stuff and the rest I gave to charity shops, he said.  I have still got my two cardboard cutouts in plastic bags in the shed, as the charity shop said they couldnt take them as they were too big. One of my friends also bought a lot of things from me, such as a laptop case and a lighter. Shaun also became a local star when his Ben Mitchell collection was featured in the press, but he also received unwanted and hurtful comments about his clothing and collection back in . The -year-old was also the victim of theft at kne-point after someone stole pound cash, a mobile phone and a hard drive. The shocking incident occurred on March ,  and left the Basildon nativedevastated as the hard drive held irreplaceable photos of his late mother. Online trolls hit out at Shaun and left hurtful comments about him on social media.  After Shaun became famous locally, people even stopped him to ask for his autograph. Now his attentions are focused on Cheryl, and he says she is here to stay. Thinking about how others react to his obsession, Shaun carries on confidently. Some people said I have gone over the top on Cheryl, he explained, But it has nothing to do with them - its up to me.

The mum-of-one, who lives in Buckshaw village near Chorley, has since given up drinking and is utterly mortied to have wound up in court,Manchesters magistrateswere told.  On Tuesday, Rose-Gorrell admitted driving with excess alcohol and was fined pound,, plus pound costs and surcharges. She was also disqualied from driving for  months. She said her business and marriage would suffershe was banned from the road, and would not be able to drive her son to school four miles away. The court heard the incident occurred on December , last year, after Rose-Gorrell had cancelled a business meeting following what she described as a stressful morning. Whilst working from home she drank some wine and was arrested later as she pulled into Rivington Services off the northbound carriageway, the court heard. Prosecutor Martin Brogan said: A police officer was on duty and received messages regarding a motor vehicle on the M. The officer pulled the car over and asked them to stop in a service station. The officer spoke to the defendant and could smell intoxicant on her breath.   They asked her to perform a Breathalyser test, which they had some issues with but the officer felt there was sufficient alcohol on her breath. She was taken to the police station. She has no previous convictions. Tests showed Rose-Gorrell had  micrograms of alcohol in  millilitres of breath. The legal limit is mg. Sarah Gruffydd, defending, told the bench: She is utterly mortied and ashamed to be here. She is  and has been in no trouble whatsoever. What happened behind this,  months ago she began finding it dficult to manage her stress and was having panic attacks - she soon found out these were symptoms of the menopause. She did not speak to people but started drinking wine to calm down. On th December she had had a stressful morning and was suffering with anxiety. She cancelled a meeting she was due to have for work and worked from home whilst having some wine. She made the foolish decision to drive thereafter, and as a result of that decision, she has caused consequences to her family.   She has a  year old son who attends school four miles away and drives him there. She is struggling to work out how to get him there with no buses in the area. For  years she has run a business with her husband, building up a reputation for the company. Her role is to meet clients and secure projects for her husband in the north west. She is now limited in the role and her husband is in turn limited in his role, meaning the business is going to suffer. This has caused huge problems within their marriage. She in no way underestimates the seriousness of what she has done. She feels very ashamed and it has been a scare for her. She has said she will not drink ever again and has been to the doctor about her menopause and stress symptoms. She is now on medication and feeling much better for it. Sentencing, chairman of the bench Jane Whittington rejected the prosecutions suggestions for a community penalty and said: We are going to give you a fine as we believe you have tried to help yourself.

Stephen Waterson is accused of deliberately ramming his electric seat onto the three-year-old after he was placed in the back footwell of an Audi A convertible by his mum, Adrian Hoare. Alfie died three days later after suffering a cardiac arrest at home in Croydon, south London. Both Waterson, , and Hoare, , deny charges of manslaughter at the Old Bailey. Jurors have been shown the Audi A after it was brought to a court car park as evidence. They were instructed to remain silent as they inspected the car and made notes, while an officer carried out a brief demonstration.  Mr Justice Kerr, presiding over the case, told the  jurors: The purpose of the exercise is for you to see the car. It is not a reconstruction of any kind of what happened. The jurors then took turns peering into the car, inspecting the passenger sear and back footwell.

Alfie was kicking the chair, asking him to move it forward.  Waterson said no because he said he had to stretch his legs right out, Miss Williams said. Prosecuting, Mr Atkinson said: Until he got into that vehicle with his mother and those others, CCTV showed that Alfie had been fit and well. It follows that during that car journey something happened to Alfie to compress his chest and abdomen so that he went from an active toddler, to a very seriously ill and brain damaged one.

Carl McConville, from Newcastle, was diagnosed with lung disease at the age of , with doctors telling his mum Lyn he may only live to see one more Christmas. But, Lyn, , said her little fighter of a son defied all the odds to reach his st birthday. Carls condition is now dramatically deteriorating and a lung transplant could save his le, reports Chronicle Live. But mum Lyn says NHS Blood and Transplant have been unable to put him on the list while the type of lung disease he has remains a mystery. Now his family are determined to make the most of their time with Carl and grant his final two wishes - to go on a cruise and to take Carl to an away match to watch his beloved Newcastle United.   Speaking about Carls diagnosis as a child, Lyn described how the original signs something was wrong was his persistent cough. She said: It was more in winter than in summer, he would just have this cough. He got put on steroids at one point which helped him at the time, but then it started all over again. Carl was checked for asthma at , which was when doctors discovered he had a far more serious lung condition. Lyn said: It was around Christmas time we found out. We cant forget that day - December .   They said take him home and enjoy Christmas because we dont know how long hes got left to live. Initially we were told he wouldnt make it to his th birthday without a transplant. But hes just turned  - I call him my little fighter. Lyn says the type of disease is still a mystery, and Carl is the only person in the world with his particular condition. She said: Hes just not breathing properly and hes now had to go on -hour oxygen. Hes been in hospital now for just over a week.   His doctor says he needs a double lung transplant but he cant go on the list yet because we dont know what disease hes got or why hes got it. Its just a catch- at the minute, we cant do anything. Its infuriating but Carls doing okay - he always just gets on with it. Family friend Emma Stockman-Brown has started to fundraise to make Carls two wishes come true. Emma said: When he got put on oxygen I thought the time was right to go ahead with it and let him do what he wants to do.   He wants to go on a cruise but with his condition we dont know how far theyll let him travel, so we were thinking just a little cruise to Paris or something - I think he wants to go on the boat more than anything. And he wants to go to see Newcastle United play away - he goes to see them all the time but hes not been to an away match. Emma is hoping to organise a fundraising event in April or May for Carl, and has set up an online crowdfunding page in the meantime. To help with the appeal visit the JustGiving page here .

Kelley Robinson, , put on eight stone - weighing st at a size  - after giving birth to her son Kylo. She began to feel her knees buckling under the pressure of her enormous frame and even started taking diet pills. But she found that combined with working out, she could actually control her calorie intake much more effectively with the microwave meals. She now weighs a healthy st for her ft frame and is a comfy dress size , Cornwall Live reports.  Her chest and cup size also slimmed down - from a F to a more proportionate E. Kelley said: The ready meals made it so easy for me to keep track of exactly what I was consuming calorie wise. They were quick and easy too. It may not sound healthy but I chose low cal ones and it really helped me get started on my weight loss journey. It has got to the point now where people dont actually recognise me on the street. An old friend of mine did a double take the other day when I said hi as she didnt notice it was me at all. My whole outlook on le is dferent. Before all I did was sit about on the sofa and order takeaways whereas now Im super active and have tonnes of energy all the time.  Kelleywas a size  before having Kylo, now three, but after he was born she developed unhealthy eating habits. She typically had white toast for breakfast, followed by sandwich and crisps for lunch, a takeaway for dinner, while snacking on more crisps, fizzy drinks and chocolate. She piled on eight stone, but soon got fed up, and when she got desperate she tried diet pills. They were dreadful, I had no energy and couldnt stop pooing the whole time, she admitted. It was around this time that her fitness fanatic fianceacute, Ryan Lake, stepped in to help. She said: Ryan was amazing, he could see how depressed I was and just gently took control but by coaxing me to the gym. Id never have had the confidence to do it without him. At first I found it so hard, I wanted to give up, I really hated it but I kept at it and with the changes in my diet too I found that I was actually losing weight! She also started eating ready meals, which were typically between  and  calories a meal. Her favourites were Morrison’s Chicken Tikka Masala, Beef Hot Pots or Macaroni, and she started eating Weetabix and fruit for breakfast, with wraps for lunch. The new mum stopped snacking between meals and started swapping sweet drinks for water.  In the first three months of her new regime she lost a whopping three stone. Kelleysaid: It was after that when I got really strict with myself because I realised that I actually I could do it. I cut out carbs, dairy and even quit the ready meals eventually. In a year Kelley had lost NINE stone. She admitted: Im such a gym bunny now its unreal I go whenever I have a second and absolutely love it. I even get up super early before the kids wake up to go and workout for an hour. I go at least six times a week and make sure to do a mix of cardio and weights. Doing the weights have meant that the saggy skin has really toned up, which is one thing I was worried about losing quite so much. Dedicated Kelley, who is also mother to -year-old Tamzin, has noticed far more than just weight loss benefits from her new regime. Her knees are no longer a problem and her down days are well behind her. The mum-of-two said: I was quite low before as I felt so under-confident but these days I really do feel like a new person. One thing I know is that I couldnt have done it without the support of my amazing family, especially Ryan, who loved me whatever size I was but always wanted the best for me.

Terried mum-of-two Laura Bonney, , was injured after a long-running feud turned violent outside her home. Tony Lloyd, , admitted carrying out the broad daylight attack. The court heard she needed four stitches and will suffer permanent scarring as a result being punched and spat at by the defendant. Relations between Lloyd, Laura and her husband Daniel Bonney boiled over on June  last year, a judge was told.   Prosecuting, Philip Lee said there had been a background of bad feeling between the parties and the violence was sparked by comments said to have been made by Lloyd to the Bonneys young son. Mr Lee said: The argument escalated and the defendant approached Laura Bonney shouting abuse. They came close and the defendant was calling Laura Bonney trying to goad Mr Bonney. The defendant told police that Laura Bonney kicked him in the groin causing him to stumble back.   The defendant then struck Laura Bonney with a hard punch to the side of the face and as a result she fell to the ground. A neighbour, Emma Matthews, describes Laura Bonney stumbling back and slumping down the side of a car like a cartoon character. It is possible she was knocked unconscious. The two men continued fighting on the floor, the defendant telling police he got a kicking, while Laura Bonney was bleeding from the face. The defendants partner came out to prevent further trouble but he continued to shout and gesticulate. Mr Lee added how the defendant then approached the Bonneys car and kicked the car door against them, also spitting at them while the two young children sat in the vehicle. Mr Lee said: The defendant was arrested at his mothers house and told police he went out to confront the Bonneys about the abuse when Laura Bonney kicked him in the b******. He said that he then hit her without thinking but was kicked in the head by Daniel Bonney while on the ground. In an interview outside court Laura said she suffered physical pain and anxiety as a result of the attack and claims she was forced to move out of the area of St Columb Major, Cornwall, where she had been brought up not long after the fracas. Sentencing Lloyd, Judge Robert Linford said: Neighbourly disputes can become most acrimonious.  Ive got no idea what lay behind this and the truth probably lies between what the prosecution say and what you told the police. Lloyd, who pleaded guilty to affray, was made subject of an -month community order, consisting of  rehabilitation activity requirement days to address his anger problems and  hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay Laura Bonney pound compensation as well as being made subject of a three-year restraining order preventing him from contacting the Bonneys, who have since separated. Speaking outside court Laura said she had suffered a lot of trauma over the incident. She said: Its been going on for a while. Initially we got on well but when I got back together with my partner things changed. Its been absolute hell. Laura said she was getting the children in the car in preparation for visiting her mother when she was attacked. She added: My son wandered off into an alleyway and I heard him shouting at my son calling him a f****** rat. He was absolutely petried. He goaded me, calling me a slag and a whore so I rushed the kids into the car then he started on me. I put my arms and legs out to try and keep him away and thats when he punched me in the face. There was blood everywhere and then he started kicking the door while my children were getting into the car. Of course they were absolutely terried.

The fact that Wembley Stadium, the Angel of the North and Sydney Harbour Bridge were all constructed with UK girders is a testament to the excellence of our steel industry. But the industry has been constantly betrayed by Tory governments. Ministers are responsible for spending millions on major infrastructure and defence. But less than half of the steel bought by the Government comes from UK firms. At this time of Brexit uncertainty you would think it is more important than ever to buy British. So why do departments ignore the Government’s own guidance by handing out lucrative contracts to overseas’ firms  They put jobs at risk in a sector already struggling because of high energy costs and unfair foreign competition. The Government should use its purchasing power to support our manufacturers.

Keio Nei, , had become obsessed with the woman, sending her disturbing emails loaded with sexual content even after she had contacted police, who warned him via Estonian authorities to leave her alone. He had threatened to come to Merseyside to kidnap, torture, rape and kill her, the court was told. One email said he would make it my le goal to find you and kill you, the Liverpool Echo reports.Nei eventually flew to the UK in April last year and sent the young woman tweets including photos of her home in Liverpool, before speaking to her dad. He convinced Nei she did not live there - after spotting the stalker had both his and his wes names written down in a notepad - then called police. Yet when officers came round the next day to drop off panic alarms on May , , they spotted Nei, who fled and got into the back of a nearby car. Nei, whose own dad was sitting in the drivers seat, struggled with police, who managed to drag him out of the Skoda and arrested both men. Inside the car they found a bag containing parcel tape, a screwdriver, brown gloves, an eye mask, a torch, a belt, a hip flask containing an ammonia solution, a syringe and needle, opera glasses, plastic flowers and an item described by police as a gold coloured dildo. Liverpool Crown Court heard Nei sent the emails, in which he talked of fate wanting them to be together, between March and June , then mostly bizarre tweets until November that year.  Kenneth Grant, prosecuting, said one email, sent on March , , said he would fly to the UK the next year and make it my le goal to find you and kill you. He said he would sneak into her home in the early hours of the morning, drug and kidnap her, wait until she woke up, then shave you bald and strip you naked. Nei said: I will rape you and make you pregnant and then Ill tie you up and will torture you for hours, which is basically me using my whip and other tools I brought with me, to make you suffer and hopefully feel what I felt all these years. Then I guess Ill just end it all and stab you in the chest with a kitchen kne and watch you slowly die. Neis dad was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, but the London-based businessman was released without charge. His son confessed to telling the victim he was going to find her and saw her legs off and that he might be a bit of a psycho, but told police it was a joke. He denied sending death threats, but accepted telling her he was a troll and asking her not to get engaged or to marry anyone. The stalker told officers his dad had offered to take him to Liverpool as part of a holiday, but was unable to give any explanation for items including the tape, syringe or hip flask, before claiming the dildo was a face massaging tool. Nei, who agreed he made a lot of effort to find his victim, admitted stalking, but denied it was with intent to commit a sexual offence. He stood trial, but after police told the jury they did not think he was carrying the bag when chased, prosecutors dropped the charge. They accepted had he intended to commit a sexual offence he would not have been with his dad, an international furniture dealer.  Nei, of no fixed address, instead admitted a second count of stalking and sentencing was adjourned for psychiatric reports. Doctors found he had a combination of Aspergers syndrome, autism and ADHD, and was not deemed suitable for hospital treatment. Jonathan Savage, defending, accepted some emails were extremely distressing, but said in others Nei fantasised about them being a couple. Neis mum claimed he had the syringe for injections for a medical condition and that she bought the ammonia to bring him around after epileptic fits. Mr Savage suggested the item described as a dildo by police was a battery-powered muscle relaxer and the blindfold was bought for the flight. Neis mum explained he had carried a screwdriver around with him since childhood and wore gloves because of his dislike of touching things. Mr Savage denied his client smuggled these items on his flight and said possessing them had to be viewed in the context of his mental state. He said his client was socially isolated and came to the UK not to cause her any physical harm, but to progress what he believed to be a relationship and persuade her, dficult as it might be to believe, that he was actually quite a nice person. Mr Savage said once Neis prison sentence was finished it was understood he would be repatriated to Estonia. Judge Clement Goldstone, QC, said Nei caused the woman untold distress and fear and described the March  email as graphic and terrying. He said Nei saw a golden opportunity when his dad was visiting Liverpool to seek out his victim and was caught with very sinister items. The judge accepted there might be an innocent explanationthe items were each taken in isolation. But he said: I have no doubt that their location together was devised by you because there was, within a very warped and sick mind, something that could have led at some stage to something far more serious than that for which you face sentence. Judge Goldstone accepted the last person in the world Nei would have had with him,intending to commit a sexual offence, was his dad. But he told Nei it was no joke to her and it was utterly terrying when he travelled halfway across Europe with his victim in your sights. Judge Goldstone said cyber stalking was a plague of the st Century and his victim was left unable to sleep, with her trust shattered. He jailed Nei for  months and made an indefinite restraining order.

Hannah Taylor grew up with “scary” stories about childbirth from her own mum and wanted a serene experience for her son Koa. The -year-old yoga teacher decided the best option for her and her son - now aged three months - was a freebirth without a medical attendant or professional present. Hannah and her partner Tyler Couchman welcomed lb oz baby Koa in an outdoor bath with no-one telling her to push, describing it as an incredible, blissful, experience. Just Tyler and best friend Shea Zamarra were in attendance. Hannah, from the US city of Sacramento, Calornia, said: “My mum had traumatic births with me and my sister and it didn’t sit well with me. “Growing up I had only heard scary stories of birth and when I heard about my friend’s experience with unassisted birth. It felt right to me.  “A unassisted birth is one without medical intervention. You give birth unhindered and without medical interference.“No one telling you when to push, you just completely listen to your own body. “During my pregnancy I did a lot of research and I read a lot of books. I listened to podcasts focused on women and their unassisted birthing stories.  She added: “I went into labour in early morning at about am on October  and my active contractions started around .am. “I was just home with my partner and my best friend Shea. I hadn’t planned to move to the outside to the tub, I just wanted to use it as somewhere to take a break during labour. “I was on the floor of my room when I decided to move outside to the tub. It is connected to the warm water mains from our house.  “It was an incredible, blissful, experience and I was ecstatic. Meeting my little boy for the first time was incredible.” Hannah and her sister, Jessica Taylor, were born by Caesarean section which left her keen to explore other options during her own pregnancy. Unassisted birth is the process of having a baby without the presence of a medical attendant or professional, which Hannah believed was the best option for her family. Hannahs partner Tyler, , a chef, added: So far it was the most amazing experience of my le. I had never heard of free birth before, but catching my son in my arms was the most amazing thing. Holding him brought tears to my eyes. It felt like a dream.  While Hannah’s birth was unassisted, the mum did attend regular prenatal appointments with a midwe to make sure her pregnancy was healthy. Hannah said she would have rethought her plans had there been a health issue or potential danger for Koa. She said: “I had a healthy pregnancy and I visited a midwe all along. I had prenatal care. “There was no sign that anything was wrong, andthere had been I would have had to think about changing my plan.  “Depending on the severity I would have had to consider a hospital birth in that case. But I really made sure I had done a lot of research. Hannah has described her first three months as a mom to be “blissful” and she will always feel blessed to have had such a serene birthing experience. Tyler said the couple feel lucky that their friend was there to capture the moment on camera.  He added: Its really special that we have those pictures. They captured the moment so perfectly. Hannah said: “The sun was out and it was beautul. I felt extremely powerful. “A few days afterwards he was checked out and everything was great. “I think all people should follow their hearts. I did what I thought was the best thing for my baby. “An unhindered birth allowed the experience to be sacred and it was incredible. I have never felt so connected to my body. I felt very blessed. “He’s so wonderful.

Nathan Sutherland, , used the stage name SLS or Sleeplessouljaz when he performed for churchgoers in the US city of Phoenix, Arizona, his former pastor says. Footage has emerged showing the adopted siblings performing and describing their upbringing in an interview that was awkward at times. Dad-of-two Sutherland allegedly raped the -year-old quadriplegic woman at Hacienda HealthCare, a long-term care facility where he had worked since , but his lawyer claims there is no proof he committed the act. His second we filed for orce shortly before the woman gave birth.   Hacienda staff had no idea the woman was pregnant until she suddenly went into labour and gave birth just days after Christmas on December . Sutherland has been charged with sexual assault and vulnerable adult abuse in a case that has shocked veteran police officers. The nurse and his sister were a Christian rap duo years ago, and he performed under the name SLS or Sleeplessouljaz, said Marie Mosley, his former pastor.  Ms Mosley, of the Faith Center West Family Church in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa, told NBC News: “That was back in the early days, him and his sister had a rap act. “I haven’t seen him since . He’s been in a lot of churches since then.” A video posted on YouTube by Dog Entertainment Ministries in July  shows Sutherland and his sister, who used the stage name D#G, performing their songs.  In the video, Sutherland says he and his sister were born in Haiti and moved to Arizona after being adopted when he was seven and she was four. He says: My parents, they split up in Haiti, my mum couldnt take care of us so she brought us to an orphanage. One meal a day was a blessing. Thats, basically, how we got adopted, through the orphanage.  He adds: We grew up really, really strict. There was no hip-hop music, not evenit was gospel, but you cant stop what you were made to do. Later, when hes asked to give a positive message to youth, Sutherland says: Its up to you to decide which way you want to go. Try not to make excuses for the way youre behaving. Just keep it real, man. You know you can do it. Sutherlands second we filed for orce on December , about three weeks before the incapacitated woman gave birth, the Arizona Republic reported. They got married in , shortly after he and his first we orced.  Sutherland has two children from his first marriage. Phoenix police arrested and charged Sutherland after a court order allowed detecties to obtain DNA samples from male staff members. The force said Sutherlands DNA sample was a match. His lawyer, David Gregan, told NBC News: “There’s no direct evidence that Mr Sutherland has committed these acts. I know at this point there’s DNA. But he will have a right to his own DNA expert.” Mr Gregan said Sutherland has lived in Arizona since  and does not have a criminal record. Sutherland and his sister have been living in the US since  and he became a naturalised citizen in , according to reports. Hacienda said it performed an extensive background check on Sutherland before he was hired. Sutherland, who was sacked after he was arrested, was released on bail after appearing in court on Wednesday.

The cargo, thought to be  years old, was discovered byEdoardo Sbaraini and Gabriele Succi, from Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy, in late November last year. They were surveying waters of the coast of Portofino when noticed  Gallic amphoras, or pottery, half submerged in the sand. The ers immediately informed the local Soprintendenza Archeologica , and the first ceramic jug was picked up from the ocean floor on January , .   Footage taken by the ers shows the ancient jars, of inestimable value, lying  metres under the surface. While most of them are perfectly intact, one is shattered and its remains provide shelter to all sort of sea le, including two lobsters. Edoardo said: Thanks to our underwater scooters we were able to conduct a wide survey of the waters outside of Portofino, and we found the amphoras in a place ers dont normally get to.  The first thing we noticed was the necks and flat bottoms of some of the jars popping out of the sand. When we realised what wed found we were shocked, its every ers dream to find historical relics and for us it was an incredible experience, he continued. We told the Soprintendenza about the jars and they were on the place basically on the same day.   According to Edoardo, new statements from the Department of Antiquities are expected to come out in next weeks to shed more light on the precise origin of the relics. He said: The archeologists are as excited about these findings as we are. They have said its a very unique occurrence, and they took one of the amphoras out of the water to use it as a sample and study it.

An international team of conservators spent  years bringing the ,-year-old, decaying tomb - once said to be cursed - back to its former glory. Over the last decade, experts stabilised wall paintings that decorate the boy-kings chamber, installed barriers and set up a ventilation system to reduce damage to the site. They also spent time investigating mysterious brown spots that were growing on wall paintings inside the tomb where the pharaohs mummied body was discovered by British Egyptologist Howard Carter in  - and it is now known what they are.   The restoration work, carried out by the US-based Getty Conservation Instituteand Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities, was unveiled on Wednesday as the tomb reopened to tourists. The brown spots were feared to be growing like a fungus, but conservators confirmed that the spots were microbes that were long dead, Live Science reported. The microbes had not spread since Carter opened the tomb almost  years ago, and they had already grown into the paint layer and could not be removed because doing so would damage the intricate artwork.  The dark spots - once thought to be caused by human interference from visitors bringing bacteria and dust into the tomb - remain on the walls. The nearly intact tomb in the Valley of the Kings in Luxor has fascinated the public - sparking mysteries and theories about a curse against those who enter it - since it was discovered by Carter. The opening of the tomb gave rise to speculation of the “pharaoh’s curse” - a myth fuelled by the death of Lord Carnarvon, who had bankrolled Carters work.  He died of blood poisoning in  after he cut himself shaving. After the discovery, Carters team removed artefacts and the site became a huge draw for tourists. Last year, researchers at Italy’s Turin Polytechnic University found no evidence that hidden chambers exist behind the tombs walls. King Tut died in about  BC at around , having reigned since he was just nine years old. The cause of the boy-kings death is disputed. Theories range from an assassination to an accidental or natural death. Zahi Hawass, Egyptologist and former minister of State for Antiquities in Egypt, said of the -year restoration: Conservation and preservation is important for the future and for this heritage and this great civilization to live forever. The tomb stayed open to tourists through much of the conservation.

Controversial strongman Rodrigo Duterte has sparked outrage by pushing for the age of criminal responsibility to be lowered from  to nine.The Philippines leader - who last month admitted sexually assaulting a maid when he was a schoolboy - has come under fire over the plans.He claims drugs gangs are using young children because they cannot be thrown in jail. But activists claim the policy - which still needs Senate approval - would target youngsters from poor backgrounds.   Eule Rico Bonganay, secretary general of Salinlahi Alliance for Children’s Concerns, said: Children are in a situation where they have to commit crime for survival. Because even government data shows that the profile of children in conflict with the law are mostly … from poor families, they obtained a low level of education and they live in a community where there is a high rate of crime. The law change would see children who commit drug offences - as well as serious crimes including murder - facing mandatory confinement.   Senator Antonio Trillanes, one of Dutertes biggest critics, said: It is anti-family, anti-poor and simply unjust. Moreover, it will promote a heartless and ruthless society that has no regard for its own people. Groups including UNICEF and Save The Children have hit out at the plans, saying children should be protected from criminals, not punished for things they are forced to do. Since July , when Duterte took power, authorities claim , lives have been lost during the presidents war on drugs. But activists claim the real number is far higher, with Duterte accused of turning a blind eye to extrajudicial killings. After his election, Duterte said he would happily exterminate three million drug users. Noting that Hitler had murdered millions of Jews, Duterte said, “There are  million drug addicts . I’d be happy to slaughter them. “If Germany had Hitler, the Philippines would have ...,” he said, pausing and pointing to himself.

They say it will eventually mean less live monkeys having to be used in lab experiments around the world and could give fresh insight into killer diseases such as cancer.The groundbreaking quintet were born at the Institute of Neuroscienceof the Chinese Academy of Sciencesin Shanghai.Cells from a donor monkey were used to clone the five using the method of somatic cell nuclear transfer . Thats the same method that last year generated Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua, the first two cloned monkeys, and Dolly the sheep back in . Chinese scientists say the advance, reported online by the journal National Science Review, shows that a population of customised gene-edited macaque monkeys with unorm genetic background will soon be available for biomedical research.   They said the cloned quintet showed signs of a wide-range of circadian disorder characteristics - including reduced sleep time, elevated night-time locomotive activities, dampened circadian cycling of blood hormones, increased anxiety and depression, as well as schizophrenia-like behaviour. Study senior author and investigator Dr Hung-Chun Chang said: Disorder of circadian rhythm could lead to many human diseases, including sleep disorders, diabetic mellitus, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases.  Our monkeys thus could be used to study the disease pathogenesis as well as therapeutic treatments. To create the monkey clones, Chinese researchers removed the nucleus from a monkey egg cell and replaced it with another nucleus from a fibroblast, a dferentiated somaticcell. The reconstructed egg then developed into an embryo that carries the genes of the replacement nucleus.   The embryo was then transferred to the womb of a surrogate female monkey that later gave birth to the cloned monkey. Previously, Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua were generated by using cells from an aborted fetus. The five clones were created using cells from a young adult gene-edited donor monkey. Dr Qiang Sun, director of IONs Non-human Primate Research Facility, said: Our approach is to perform gene-editing in fertilised embryos to first generate a group of gene-edited monkeys, and then select one monkey that exhibits correct gene editing and most severe disease phenotypes as the donor monkey for cloning. We believe that this approach of cloning gene-edited monkeys could be used to generate a iety of monkey models for gene-based diseases, including many brain diseases, as well as immune and metabolic disorders and cancer.   The researchers plan to continue improving the technique to increase the efficiency of cloning. They are expecting more macaque clones carrying disease-causing gene mutations to be generated in the coming years. But they said the Institute of Neuroscience follows strict international guidelines for animal research. Co-author Professor Mu-ming Poo, who directs the Institute of Neuroscience and helped to supervise the project, said: This work required coordinated efforts of many laboratories, and serves as a clear example of the efficient team work that is highly emphasised by CAS.  This line of research will help to reduce the amount of macaque monkeys currently used in biomedical research around the world. He added: Without the interference of genetic background, a much smaller number of cloned monkeys carrying disease phenotypes may be sufficient for pre-clinical tests of the efficacy of therapeutics. Since Dolly was cloned in Scotland back in , more than  species of mammals have been cloned around the world - including cattle, cats, dogs, horses and rats.

For him, the bottom line is Dundee should have been better than this.“It was very frustrating on Saturday. I think our performance first half, we should be thankful we are still in the cup really,” he said.“It wasn’t good enough. They’ve got the goal to go ahead and then Jesse has done brilliantly just before half-time to get it back and have us level.“It was a good time for us to score and then we did definitely play better in the second half. On the whole, though, it was not good enough.“I suppose it does happen in the cup, we saw that with some of the other results, and the big thing is we are still in there and have a replay where we can make it into the next round.“So we maybe shouldn’t be too hard on ourselves over it but we’re still not happy with the performance.”Like most players after a bad game, now the -year-old just wants to get out on a pitch again and try to put things right.That’s why he breathed a sigh of relief on Sunday when Hearts’ televised clash with Livingston produced a result.Had the Jambos not edged past the Lions, a replay would have been tonight and Dundee’s Premiership visit to Tynecastle would have been postponed.“We have another game right away and that’s good. The one thing we didn’t want was no game this week because Hearts had drawn their cup-tie.“The thing you want to do after the winter break is get back into playing regularly again right away and you don’t want to be missing games because of things like that. You want to get points on the board as soon as possible.”Turning to the subject of the new arrivals, Ralph believes they will signicantly boost the chances of top-flight survival.So far, he’s been impressed by what he’s seen.He added: “I thought the new lads looked sharp and direct.

That, unfortunately, is something they’ve largely failed to do in three seasons down in the Championship.Past glories, some of them recent, mean United start every campaign as favourites for promotion.And any team walking into Tannadice on a Saturday sees a club geared for football in the Premiership.Too often, however, any edge that’s given United has disappeared because of performances.Even when they’ve lost, in the last two-and-a-half years sides have come out of games against them feeling reputation and expectation have not matched the sum of the parts of the team they’ve faced.Results like two defeats away to Dumbarton the season before last, a - loss at Falkirk last term and two five-goal home losses in this campaign, have led to opposition throughout the ision believing they always have a chance when facing United.In truth, even the draw with Partick Thistle this month and the win over Dunfermline that closed the gap at the top to those three points, were not as convincing as was expected.That’s repeatedly been the case during the two failed attempts to get up. In the big games, too often United have come up short.They did beat Hibs at Tannadice near the end of  but lost heavily to them soon after and quickly dropped off the pace at the top.Andthey won twice at Tannadice against last season’s table toppers St Mirren, the first time came before the Buddies were regarded as their main rivals and the second after Jack Ross’s team were out of sight at the top.This time round, the best so far came up in Dingwall in November when County were beaten -.Without taking anything away from that success, after Paul Watson’s early goal put them ahead, the three points were secured via a gritty rearguard action.Yes, it was the kind of performance that is needed at times in a successful league campaign.So, too, do emphatic victories that tell the rest of the league you are a team to be feared. There would be no better time for such a statement than Friday in Ayrshire."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"dennys-bosses-slam-unforgiving-customers-after-being-bombarded-with-terrible-reviews","story":"DENNYrsquoS bosses have hit back at ldquounforgiving customers who have left negative feedback after visiting the dinerrsquos newly-opened branch near Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"gin-bouquets-have-arrived-and-theyre-all-we-want-this-valentines-day","story":"SCOTS distillery Edinburgh Gin is set to launch gin bouquets in time for Valentinersquos Day."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-author-angela-proctor-i-started-to-write-and-i-didnt-feel-so-sad","story":"IT WAS the most bizarre phonecall."},{"url":null,"title":"iona-turner-when-getting-some-retail-therapy-actually-leaves-you-needing-therapy","story":"ldquoWhy donrsquot you go and get some good old fashioned retail therapy, I smiled, but my grin slowly disintegrated when I saw the look on her face. ldquoTherapy !

But with games coming up in mind we changed it.”Aberdeen’s firepower has been bolstered further during the January transfer window with the loan signing of Birmingham’s Greg Stewart. And McInnes insists the Reds have rediscovered their killer touch in front of goal.He said: “We weren’t a threat in the earlier stages of the season.“There is a goal at the end of the pitch for a reason and we weren’t really doing enough to score more goals.“Now we seem to have grasped the importance of that.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/01/Britannia-940x534.jpg ","title":"po britannia magic of life on the ocean wave","story":"Sailing down a moonbeam at midnight is never guaranteed.But from the moment you step aboard the Britannia you sense this is going to be a magical experience, a transcendent journey that will take you into the heart of the Caribbean and beyond.This majestic ship – the jewel in the crown of PO’s cruise fleet – oozes sophistication with its plush five-star surroundings.The spectacular Star Burst sculpture, the centrepiece of her atrium, signals the magnitude of her beauty.And yet the ship underplays its excellence in a restrained and very British way.Under the steady command of Captain Wesley Dunlop, the , tonne vessel was to be home for my mum and I for  nights.Our sea passage was to take us a distance of , nautical miles, departing Bridgetown, Barbados, and on to Curacao, Aruba, Grenada, St. Vincent, St. Lucia, Dominica, Antigua and St Maarten.Within an hour of embarking the ship, warmed by the legendary Barbados rum punch, our cares blew away in the breeze as we chilled out for the sail away party on the lido deck, soaking up the heat beneath the Caribbean sun.It was very easy to get our Caribbean groove on thanks to the talented Lady B and her band, Steele, who had the sun-lounging crowd singing along to the classic hits of the late, great reggae maestro, Bob Marley.When it comes to choosing the right cruise line company to travel with, I’m looking for great value, great destinations and even greater food.And I can confidently say you would be hard pushed to find any to top this one.Britannia serves up the ultimate posh nosh.No matter where you choose to dine on board, whether it be the ultimate fine dining experience in the art deco-inspired Epicurean or the self-service Horizon buffet, the selection and quality of food and produce on offer is first class.From dining at Sindhi, where east meets west, with just the right twist of spice, to the lighter bites and hearty mains in the Glass House, the gastronomic experience is ied but always sublime.But you don’t have to take my word for it.Three-times Michelin star chef, Marco Pierre-White is patron of The Cookery Club, and when on board he hosts cookery masterclasses.The waters of the Caribbean Sea are warm and welcoming.Is it any wonder that Aruba, where it never rains, is known as the happy place  Grenada, with its lush green forests, is the island of spice,On rugged but picturesque St Vincent I found myself dipping my toes in a blue lagoon where the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise is filmed, while – you guessed it – sampling again some very good rum punch.

When did two players from Mid Argyll help Rangers win the Scottish Cup The answer is # . Local girls Jasmine McPhie and Carla Todd were both key players in Rangers Girls triumphant run in the Girls Under  Scottish Cup.In their run to the final, Rangers played the top four under  girls teams in Scotland beating Aberdeen - in the first round, then Hamilton - and Central Girls - in rounds two and three. A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league. At the end of that season they joined Rangers Girls where they are in their second season playing mostly in the Paisley League against boys teams but also in national girls# competitions.Both girls have also been involved in Scotland national squads for their age group and the Soccer Centre is delighted to see them thriving with a big club.With more than  girls now playing football through the Soccer Centre, the success of Jasmine and Carla should be a real inspiration for local girls.So girls, you may live out in rural Mid Argyll but with talent, hard work and the right attitude you could be creating your own football opportunities."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 9","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDrawn on Monday January , Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery numbers were ,  and .

It was written for Count Friedrich Wilhelm, supposedly simplied for amateurs to play. However, Jamal and Jâms being master musicians showed the power of this often disregarded piece, to be immense. One of the first works to make piano and cello equal musical partners, it is full of ingenious dialogue between the instruments. The structure is unusual, but with such expert performers it delighted the audience who were moved by every turn and twist of this deeply emotional work.Jâms, from North Wales, after remarking on the three ferry crossings required to get to Ardrishaig via Bute, introduced the next piece, Ernest Bloch’s work ‘From Jewish Le’. In a style close to Jamal’s heart and heritage, having been born in Baku Azerbaijan, its three elements, ‘Prayer’, ‘Supplication’ and ‘Jewish Song’, are full of the pathos and sorrow felt by the Jewish nation and also full of the signature augmented intervals and minor key tonality of much of middle eastern musics. How beautully these pieces demonstrated the lyrical qualities of the cello. Jamal’s bow searched for all possible nuances of tone and dynamic as his instrument sang from its lowest notes to a seductive soprano register.The concert continued after the interval with a second Beethoven work. The audience may have noticed a minor kerfuffle at the piano as many pages were rapidly turned before starting. Would it be the ‘Seven Variations’ for cello and piano or the ‘Twelve’, both based on themes from Mozart’s Magic Flute  The ‘Seven Variations’ won, being on the theme from the ‘Pamina’ and ‘Papageno’ duet entitled ‘In men, who know the feeling of love’. This work exhibits Beethoven’s practised ingenuity in the iation form and brought a lighter mood to the programme.Jâms Coleman introduced the final work, Frank Bridge’s Cello Sonata. He told of the four years of torment for the composer as he struggled to express his feelings about the First World War, finally finishing the composition in . The adagio in the piece caused the composer the most dficulty as he struggled with ambivalence about his own pacist views. Jâms and Jamal dealt with the challenges of this complex work which tracks huge changes in the world of music composition that were under way at that time. Again, the lyrical powers of the cello came to the fore as did the virtuosic requirements heaped on the pianist. Despite its undoubted innovations, this piece generously reaches out to its audience. Bridge uses the new musical freedoms only when justied, being happy toto more traditional tonal stability in the lyrical sections.Fulfilled, but not overburdened by the weightiness of the final piece, the audience applauded Jamal and Jâms back to the concert room to perform the ‘Swan’ from Saint-Saens ‘Carnival of the Animals’ as encore. This piece so beautully confirmed the excellence of Jamal’s playing and the superb quality of his quite special instrument.PIC:Jamal Aliyev and Jâms Coleman. no_aJamalandJam"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray carpet bowling club festive pairs competition","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Inveraray Carpet Bowling Club held its annual festive pairs competition.The first prize of turkeys was won by George Morrison and Alan Cameron.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13896898.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS171494552.jpg","title":"coventry city signing michael rose","story":"NewsCoventry City signing Michael Rose can be future Scotland star, says Ayr United boss Ian McCallThe Ayr United centre half has completed a pre contract switch to the Ricoh Arena and will join the Sky Blues in the summer.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsMichael Rose, left, in action for Ayr United \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIan McCall reckons Coventry have bagged themselves a future Scotland star in Michael Rose.

And Somerset boss McCall reckons the defender could even go on to eclipse goal king Lawrence Shankland - who is wanted by a string of top English clubs. He told the Ayrshire Post: You never want to lose players but Im delighted for the boy on a personal level. Everyone talks about Lawrence but, in my opinion, Michael Rose could go on to achieve just as much -not more -he wants to.  He is that good a player and Ive no doubt he can be a future Scotland international. For my money hes been the best centre half in the Championship this season. Of course wed have loved to keep him, but we have to be realistic. Rose is one of a number of players to reinvent their careers under McCall following his failure to break through as a youth at Aberdeen. And McCall said: It is further proof to boys thatthey come here and develop themselves, they will get their reward.

Gaenor Hardy,, has assumed control at Heathfield in Ayr, complete with its  pupil roll and  child nursery. And the shining star of the region’s education system confesses she is now “living in a bubble waiting for it to burst”. Gaenor, who joins Heathfield after heading up Dalmilling Primary for five years, said: “I was very happy there and only Heathfield would have pulled me away. “It is always the school I have aspired to. My twins came here and I feel that level of affinity. “All I see is potential. I’ve never been at a school where the surroundings in the community are so rich.” Gaenor cut her teaching teeth in south London before ing north after her sister suffered a severe stroke, aged just . She said: “It made me review my le and decide what was important so we relocated back up to Scotland. “I’ve been back here for  years now and always had one eye on Heathfield as I knew it was such an exciting job. “Part of that excitement is that I live in the catchment and my children went here so it feels like coming home. “But I’m also excited about making this the flagship school. “However, we also need to make this the hub of the local community.” Fitness fanatic Gaenor admits an “open and frank exchange of views” took place during the first meeting with her new parent council last week. It follows concerns over the previous management’s approach to alleged bullying within the school. But she insisted: “I’m all for honest, vibrant and lively dialogue. “None of it was a surprise to me as a parent myself. “I would hate to think I’ll be a comparison to previous management in the school. “What I can bring is my own unique experience to the role. “I want to be open and visible and have parents approach me. “This has to be us together on the journey.” And she added: “I don’t have to grow a passion for the school. It is there within me already. “I feel like I’m in a bubble of looking forward to coming to work and being so motivated – and I’m still waiting for it to be burst.” Now Gaenor, who is often seen walking to school, is planning to get her pupils into shape as part of a new physical and mental drive. She said: “If I want the children to be fit and healthy then I have to model that. “Health and wellbeing has to underpin everything we’re doing. “The local junor parkrun is an example of something I’d like to see encouraged. “We’ve also rolled out more than  after-school and lunch clubs from this month. “I’ll be doing a homework club and the clerical team are doing a running club so we’re all very hands on. “But ultimately the children are my inspiration. “We have a fantastic new building in which to work and I’ve never experienced anything like it during my career. “Now the challenge is to make the most of it and enjoy what we have.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"new super school riddled structural","story":"NewsNew super-school is riddled with structural problemsLeaks, faulty automatic doors and sensory lights are among a string of issues at Invergarven’s marquee campus in Girvan.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsInside the school \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new pound million super-school is “riddled” with structural problems, it can been revealed.

I had a lot of balls left because Georgie loved them and my other dog doesnt so I put them in the box at the Gattonside end of chain bridge.\"Since then someone has attached it to the gate and people have been borrowing the balls and putting them back and even adding new ones.\"I just want the box to remind owners to enjoy every moment with their dog.\"Georgie passed away in May last year after contracting Alabama rot, also known as Cutaneous and Renal Glomerular Vasculopathy .Only appearing to affect dogs, the disease damages the lining of blood vessels in the skin and kidney, resulting in ulceration of the skin and kidney damage.The condition can affect any breed or age of dog and a proportion can go on to develop severe, acute kidney failure, which is often fatal.Lynsay and her dogs Georgie and Taffy used to walk along the river most days and it was after one of these walks that she noticed Georgie had lesions on her legs.\"It was after a walk in Gattonside one Saturday that I saw that she had sores on her legs so I took her to the vet on Monday and she was given some cream.\"But she went downhill fast and by Wednesday her poo was black, which I later learnt was a sign that her kidneys were failing.\"I took her to the vets again where she was given a cone to stop her licking the sores but by Friday the vets suspected it was Alabama rot and put her on a drip and kept her in overnight hoping that she would improve.\"But on Saturday we were told that her kidneys had stopped working and she wasnt going to get better.\"I took Taffy with me to spend some time with her and then she got put to sleep.\"Alabama rot was first recorded in the UK in  and the number of cases has risen each year. Georgies was the first confirmed case in the Borders.Lynsay said: \"The only way that you can be sure it is Alabama rot is to have a post mortem so Georgie was then taken to the Dick Vet in Edinburgh where it was confirmed that she had had Alabama rot. My other dog was tested for it but thankfully the results were clear.\"The Kennel Club is warning dog owners to be extra vigilant at this time of year as the peak season for the disease is between November and May.Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary said: ldquoAlthough the disease is very rare, affecting an extremely low percentage of dogs in the UK, the condition is very serious and potentially le-threatening. It is therefore vital that owners understand and recognise the warning signs, especially as time plays a signicant part in successfully treating the disease.ldquoWe are asking owners to look out for any signs of Alabama rot during the winter months and to remember to take action right away. Any dogs with unexplained or concerning skin lesions which typically look like sores, ulcers, or red, swollen, bruised areas, commonly with an infected appearance should be taken to their vet as soon as possible. These skin changes are usually found on their paws or lower legs, but may also appear on their head, face or lower body. Dogs who have contracted the disease may also become tired, disinterested in food, or present other signs of illness like vomiting or diarrhoea.ldquoAlthough these signs may not necessarily mean your dog has Alabama rot, acting quickly and speaking to a vet to determine what is wrong is the best course of action to protect your petrsquos health.While large amounts of research have been carried out over the last six years, the cause of the disease remains unknown. As yet, no evidence has been found to suggest that CRGV is caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, toxins, or radiation. There is speculation that it is related to mud or water, due to the higher prevalence in winter and spring, and relatively low case numbers seen in the summer.Caroline continued: ldquoTo lower any risk of your dog contracting Alabama rot, itrsquos also advisable to keep your dog away from very muddy areas, wash wet or muddy dogs straight after a walk and regularly check your dogrsquos body for anything thatrsquos dferent.,params: .pushldquoWhile a distinct seasonal pattern is suggested, we must continue to research this deadly disease and ensure all dog owners are aware of the signs and symptoms so they are able to seek veterinary advice immediately.Despite what happened, Lynsay still s to walk Taffy along the river in Gattonside.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the

My own wish would be for MPs to seize the moment and vote to revoke Article  altogether. MPs have the power to stop the clock for good, thanks to the good works of legally-minded MPs like the SNPrsquos Joanna Cherry.Staying in the EU is the only sure way to stop the endless arguments about Canada plus, Norway plus, customs union, Irish backstop, regulatory alignment, maximum facilitation and all the rest of the gubbins thatrsquos been occupying our addled brains for the last two-and-a-half years. However, this isnrsquot going to happen.And Irsquod have to agree that it would be undemocratic for MPs to simply reverse the result of the  referendum by revoking A. It may be that Parliament has the power and the constitutional right to do so: referendums are only advisory. But it would leave so much unpleasantness that British politics would be soured for decades. There would have to be a referendum.This is where my unease turns to genuine anxiety. I have a horrible feeling that Labourrsquos Diane Abbott was right on Question Time this week when she said: ldquoBe careful what you wish for. She agrees with Nigel Farage that a repeat referendum is likely to endorse no-deal Brexit, perhaps by an even greater margin than in .Evenit left us with a mirror-image result, with say % Remain against % Leave, that would itself be a disaster because it would have no legitimacy. Yes, some opinion polls say Remain would win a comfortable majority, but they said that last time.The Brexiteers are already field-testing their slogans on social media. The frontrunner is ldquoTell Them Again, which may not be as resonant as ldquoTake Back Control but is still pretty hot. It surfs on the very widespread disgust and alienation that many ordinary people feel about the political elite. It appeals to democratic injustice: how dare the globalists ignore the result of , which David Cameron promised would be for keeps What would Remainrsquos slogan be  Itrsquos likely to be a repeat of the Project Fear line which failed dismally in . ldquoDonrsquot put your childrenrsquos prosperity at risk, perhaps, or ldquoThink Twice Think Jobs. But what many pro-Europeans fail to grasp ndash and this applied to the Unionists in the Scottish independence referendum ndash is that it ISNrsquoT the economy, stupid. Brexit voters donrsquot just make their decisions on the basis of economic rationality, as seen from the CBI and corporate Britain.People are always motivated more by emotion than numbers ndash on what they believe to be morally right. The sense that working-class people have lost control is a very potent mobiliser.As in war ndash and it is remarkable how much Brexit mythology harks back to World War Two ndash people are quite willing to sacrice some comfort for what they believe in.I may think they are mistaken. As with the people who supported Donald Trump because he promised to Make America Great Again, and bring back the jobs, I think Brexit voters have been sold a  prospectus by politicians who do not have the best interests of working people at their hearts.But that isnrsquot really the point. I can well understand the sense of injustice felt by people who have been left behind by global capitalism. They want to kick the system, and the referendum gave them a chance to do it. They need a very strong reason not to kick the metropolitans again. Only Labour can provide that reason, and Jeremy Corbyn has been singularly reluctant to do so.His refusal even to meet Theresa May was irresponsible in this climate. It may have allowed him to avoid coming off the fence, but it looked petty and weak. Corbyn should have gone in guns blazing, demanded that she drop the red lines, and then mobilised Labour for either rejoining the single market or for a referendum.Single market membership has always been the logic of Labourrsquos position, even though Corbyn usually refers to a ldquopermanent customs union. Only by joining the European Economic Area could Labour deliver friction-free trade, and protect environmental standards and workers rights. People say that Norway has blocked the UKrsquos entry to the European Economic Area, but this is not true. The Norwegian PM, Erna Solberg, has repeatedly made clear that Norway would have severe reservations ndashwho wouldnrsquot  ndash but would not block UK membership.This is because the EEA is essentially a Brussels creation. It was set up as a halfway house to membership of the EU back in  when a number of countries were uneasy about joining the political institutions of Europe. The EEA is just the European Single Market under another name.Brussels endorses British membership of the EEA, and this economic arrangement has a number of advantages over Mayrsquos deal. Therersquos no need for an Irish backstop no membership of the CAP and the Common Fisheries Policy no direct jurisdiction of the European Court and it costs less than EU membership. Of course, it does not bring the full benefits of EU membership. Britain would become a ldquorule taker on trade. But the EEA does not preclude future membership of the European Union. Norway, or any other member of the EEA, can opt for full membership at any time. And unlike the backstop, countries can leave the EEA after one year.Membership of the single market also means accepting freedom of movement, which is why it may well be rejected by Parliament. But it is the only option that has a snowballrsquos chance of getting a majority,Labour were to seriously support it. ldquoNorway plus, as itrsquos called, has more support than a repeat referendum. Fewer than  Labour MPs have called for a Peoples Vote, and only  Conservatives. The SNP has decided to throw its lot in with a repeat referendum, despite having argued convincingly for the single market for the last two years. But that isnrsquot enough.To repeat. Were it left to me, I would revoke Article  tomorrow. I just want this madness to stop. But given the metrics in Parliament, we have to look at the least worst options, as the Labour-supporting commentator Owen Jones put it last week. Mayrsquos deal is dead. MPs owe it to the country, and to themselves, to find some compromise that works. Perhaps that can only be achieved with a referendum. ButMPs fail this week, they risk destroying respect for parliamentary democracy, and opening the way for a more authoritarian form of political leadership."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-policy-of-free-university-tuition-vindicated-says-expert","story":"Writing in The Herald, Professor Sir Peter Scott said an increase in the number of poor students at university proved the policy was working.Sir Peter went on to issue a warning over the charging of tuition fees of more than pound, in England, saying the system there was ldquocollapsing.Last week, it emerged that record numbers of students from Scotlandrsquos poorest backgrounds have secured a place at university.Statistics from the Higher Education Statistics Agency showed . per cent of entrants to Scottish universities in   were from the most deprived areas.The Scottish Government has set a target for the sector of having  per cent by  and  per cent by .Sir Peter said: ldquoWhat makes the latest figures particularly encouraging is that they follow three years when there was little improvement in the proportion of full-time first degree students from the most deprived areas.ldquoThis led some critics of the Governmentrsquos red-line policy of free higher education to argue that England was doing more for fair access despite charging students high fees.ldquoThe latest figures vindicate Scotlandrsquos policy of free higher education, which of course has other aims apart from making universities more socially inclusive -

In no previous era of British politics could such a calamitous prime minister have survived such a weight of defeats, including the humiliating historic loss she recently suffered over the Withdrawal Agreement.In the past, losing a vote of confidence on a key piece of legislation was considered sufficient to stand down. For example, having split his party over the Corn Laws in , Sir Robert Peel resigned as prime minister after the defeat of his Irish Coercion Bill. Gladstone was also forced to resign in , again after a defeat on the Irish issue.In terms of the modern era, four prime ministers resigned and four stepped down on alleged grounds of ill-health. Indeed, two quit office even after winning key votes because their margins of victory made them seem moral defeats. Neville Chamberlain resigned in May , despite having won the ision on the disastrous Norway campaign, and Margaret Thatcher famously resigned despite her victory over Michael Heseltine in the first round of a Tory leadership contest.Realising the game was up, even David Cameron resigned after losing the Brexit referendum.It is a damning indictment of Mrs May and her party that she can even contemplate staying in office.

I disagree, we deserve so much better than this humiliating shambles.Alex Orr,Flat ,  Marchmont Road, Edinburgh.THOUGH Northern Ireland Secretary, Karen Bradley, is adamant that there is no link between the recent unrest in Derry and the Brexit process, she is guilty of underplaying the threat this poses to the short and long term security of the country she represents at Westminster .Our current Brexit impasse continues to distress many iniduals and communities throughout the UK and nowhere more so than Northern Ireland. The uncertainty that permeates our economic and political system at present, allied to the fact that the people of Northern Ireland have been without a devolved assembly at Stormont for more than two years, provides an opportune climate that dissident factions, such as the New IRA, will exploit for their own ends.Transport and postal services have been suspended to some Republican areas of Derry as fears of terrorist violence and disruption continue to grow. Mark Hamilton, Assistant Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland , views the current terrorist attacks as \"the most signicant in recent years\". Yet Ms Bradley would have us believe that the present political climate in the UK, with the possibility of a no- deal Brexit and therefore a hard border in Ireland, does not influence the recklessness of terrorists and their ability to drag Northern Ireland back to sectarian violence and chaos.A recent Amorach poll in the Irish republic found that  percent of people asked would fear ato violence in Ireland following Brexit. It is now more than  years since the Good Friday Agreement brought comparative stability to Northern Ireland, in which time there has been undoubted economic progress and changes in social,not political attitudes.

Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour leadership must stop dreaming up more and more creative excuses for refusing to support a Peoplersquos Vote, which their members support and want.At present, the two amendments attracting most attention are those tabled by Labourrsquos Yvette Cooper and the Conservativesrsquo Andrew Murrison.Ms Cooperrsquos seeks to extend the Article  process to the end of the yearTheresa May cannot agree a new deal with the EU by February . The aim is to prevent a no-deal Brexit.:Theresa May - The last thing we need is a second Scottish independence referendumWhitehall appears to be particularly concerned about this one as it will involve a new bill and so,passed, would be legally binding, which is not the case with the other amendments. The Yorkshire MP has used this route because the end of the Article  process, Brexit Day on March , is enshrined in law, so to change it another law has to be passed.It is thought Ms Cooper and her allies,the amendment is passed in next Tuesdayrsquos Commons vote, are seeking to rush the new bill through the Commons in one day. However, procedurally, a problem could occur in the Lords, where there is no guillotine the mechanism to curtail a debate. So, in theory, peers hostile to the Labour backbencherrsquos proposal could continue talking until a time it would cease to have an effectpassed.The Governmentrsquos focus seems to be on defeating Ms Cooperrsquos amendment in the Commons. One argument will be that her measure sets a dangerous precedent whereby Government is no longer in control of parliamentary business, which could hobble this administration and future ones.Mr Murrisonrsquos amendment to time-limit the Irish backstop is expected to be backed by the Government. If passed, it would enable the Prime Minister to go back to Brussels to demand changes as the only way of getting a deal through Parliament, thus avoiding a no-deal outcome.Of course, it is up to John Bercow, the Speaker, to decide which amendments he will allow to be debated and voted on. Last week, he rejected Mr Murrisonrsquos amendment in favour of two others relating to the backstop, neither of which succeeded.The SNP has yet to table its own amendment but will do so to put down a ldquomarker. However, it is also supporting the Cooper amendment. It believes there should be an extension to Article  to stave off a no-deal Brexit and provide time for a Peoplersquos Vote, which should include the option of staying in the EU.By Thursday lunchtime, there were  amendments.*Labour frontbench.Backed by Jeremy Corbyn and his senior lieutenants, this would require time to be provided for Parliament to vote on options to prevent a no-deal Brexit, including Labours preferred outcome - a permanent customs union, a strong single market relationship and alignment with the EU on rights and standards - and a second referendum.*Second referendum.Tabled by Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable and backed by all  of the partys MPs, this would require the Government to rule out a no-deal Brexit and make preparations for a second referendum, with Remain on the ballot paper.*Citizens assembly.Tabled by Labourrsquos Stella Creasy and signed by a total of  Labour, Lib Dem and Green MPs, this would extend the two-year Article  negotiation process to allow the creation of a -member Citizens Assembly to debate Brexit and make recommendations. This idea was championed by Gordon Brown, the former PM, last week.*Indicative votes.Tabled by Labourrsquos Hilary Benn, who chairs the Commons Brexit Committee, this would require a series of votes in Parliament on dferent options for Brexit to test support among MPs.*Article  extension.Backed by committee chairmen and women, including Mr Benn, Ms Cooper, Labourrsquos Rachel Reeves, and the Lib Demsrsquo Norman Lamb as well as senior backbenchers including Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, and Sir Oliver Letwin, the former Tory Cabinet minister, this would require the Prime Minister to seek a delay to the planned Brexit date of March no deal has been approved by February .*Power to Parliament.Considered one of the proposals most likely to succeed, the plan tabled by Ms Cooper and former Conservative minister Nick Boles would force a vote on a bill giving Parliament control over the Brexit processthe PM fails to secure a deal by February . The bill would give MPs a vote on preventing a no-deal Brexit and extending Article .*Grieve amendment.Tabled by Dominic Grieve, the former Conservative Attorney General with cross-party backing from MPs, including former members of Mrs Mays Government Justine Greening, Phillip Lee and Sam Gyimah, this would set aside six days in the run-up to March  for debate of Brexit proposals put forward by MPs.*Free votes.This proposal from Labours Frank Field and Tory Ed Vaizey would require free votes on options, including the Irish backstop, a no-deal Brexit, Canadian and Norwegian models for relations with the EU, a customs union relationship and a second referendum to act as a \"guide\" for Government in future talks.*Stop no-deal.Drawn up by Midlands MPs Dame Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, with cross-party support from more than  MPs, this amendment rejects Brexit without a Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on future UK EU relations.*Time-limited backstop.Tabled by Mr Murrison and thought to be viewed sympathetically by the Government, this would put a deadline of December   on the backstop arrangement required by the EU to avoid a hard border in Ireland. It is designed to give Mrs May additional negotiating clout by indicating to Brussels that this step might be enough to win parliamentary support for the Withdrawal Agreement reached last November.*No backstop.An amendment proposed by Conservative backbencher John Baron states that Parliament will not approve a Withdrawal Agreement which includes a backstop. Two further separate amendments tabled by the Basildon MP offer alternatives of a six-month time limit on the backstop or a requirement for the UK to have unilateral power to end it.*Business Committee.An amendment tabled by Mr Brake would establish a Business of the House Committee to govern the provision of parliamentary time for Brexit debates and legislation, including on a second referendum with Remain on the ballot paper.

Discussions on the future of the service were scheduled to take place in November but were delayed to allow extra time to take residentsrsquo views into account - proposed service changes have been amended as a result.Proposals to close the Insch Household Waste and Recycling Centrehave been removed as a result of public feedback. It is proposed that the centre would stay open two days a week, with the cost to be covered by slightly shortening opening hours at other recycling centres.Changes to kerbside services have also been proposed and, out of the two options consulted on, councillors are recommended to choose the option which will give residents a  litre non-recyclable waste bin to be emptied every three weeks. Paper card and metals, cartons and plastics recycling bins would also be incorporated into the -weekly collection cycle, together with a weekly food waste collection. Although a dferent option was more popular in the consultation, professional advice is that the alternative is most likely to encourage residents to recycle more and send less waste to landfill.By increasing recycling the proposed change is expected to reduce service costs by at least £, per year, money which will be reinvested into other essential council services.It is also proposed to double the number of seasonal garden waste collection points, with new facilities in locations including Balmedie, Kemnay, Kintore, Mintlaw, Newmachar and Oldmeldrum.Aberdeenshirersquos current recycling rate is only .%, but the services currently available to residents should allow over % of waste to be recycled.

For too long, the Berriedale Braes has acted as a pinch point for travellers on the A north of Inverness, disrupting business and jeopardising investment in the region.\"It has been good to see other work on A improvements and repairs going to local companies in recent years, and we hope the principal contractor will engage closely with our highly skilled local supply chain as these works progress.\"Ms Morris added: \"Now that the contract has been formally awarded, we hope to see clarication on exact start dates and expectedof works very soon.

The names of the companies involved have however, not been released.Minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: “Issuing the Invitation to Tender marks the next stage of the process to award the new contract to operate the Northern Isles Ferry Services.“The contract will run for eight years, allowing us to build a strong working relationship with the successful bidder, and all the routes within the network are being tendered as a single bundle.“The Scottish Government remains fully committed to high quality ferry services to the Northern Isles. A key benefit of this new contract is the in-built flexibility, allowing the ferry services to be amended to reflect future changes in demand across the important sectors of the islands’ economies – tourism, fishing, food and drink, aquaculture and farming. Scottish Ministers will also retain control of all of important issues, such as fares and timetables, through the public service contract.“We are committed to a fair, open and transparent tender which aims to get the best possible deal for the communities that depend on these ferry services.”• Commenting on the issue, Northern Isles MSP’s Liam McArthur and Tavish Scott said: “The Scottish Government have finally issued the tender. The timescale is very tight indeed given the operator needs to be up and running the North Isles leline ferry services in  months’ time. It is essential that companies make constructive bids with improvements to the existing service. It must, in particular, recognise the growing freight volumes that are being exported south to the Scottish mainland.“So the tender bids must be properly assessed to ensure the service moves forward and not backwards. And the endless saga of RET must come to an end, otherwise how can bidding companies submit a proposed fare policy ”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

OIC Leader James Stockan has notied Ministers that the council will hand over responsibility for running the service to Transport Scotland, unless sufficient funding is provided.A year ago, a similar level of support was secured, after a y campaign by OIC for fair funding. Of this, £. million was allocated to fully fund Orkney’s internal ferry service during the current financial year, with £ million awarded to Shetland Islands Council for its ferry operations.“But this time there is no specic amount allocated to Orkney or Shetland. The government recognises that it will cost £. million to operate our ageing fleet of ferries during - — and that is what we are asking the government to provide.”OIC is also looking to the government to fund the replacement of the current inter-island fleet. The council has been working with the government on this for a number of years and is currently developing a business case setting out the service levels local communities require, and the engineering options needed to achieve these.Councillor Stockan added: “We would object in the strongest possible termswe end up with a reduction in our ferries funding. This would place a wholly disproportionate and unfair burden on the smallest council in Scotland and would mean us having to make cuts to other vital services.“The ferries are a leline for remote and fragile communities across our islands. Orkney has the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — an inequality we cannot address without proper financial support from the Scottish Government.We are calling on the government to take an honourable approach to fulfilling the will of the Scottish Parliament that we should receive fair and equitable funding for our inter-island ferry service. The principle of transferring Orkney’s internal ferry service to the Scottish Government, at no net detriment to OIC, has already been approved by the council. That is a route we will have to take unless we are provided with the funds to run the service over the year ahead.”For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She agreed to look at ways the Scottish Government may be able to help in identying potential options.Commenting after these exchanges, Mr McArthur said: “It remains a concern that Orkney continues to be without a local abattoir. I am very conscious that the longer this remains the case, the more dficult it will be to find a solution.“I welcome the cabinet secretary’s willingness to re-engage with the Council and other local stakeholders in Orkney in an attempt to make sure that all possible options are fully explored.

However, health chiefs have been accused of dragging their feet over helping to find a sustainable future model to deliver the scheme, which many of the users have said gives them a reason to get up in the morning.The project leader, who is employed by High Le Highland, has been told funding will end this month. According to Cllr Smith, garden users are ldquodevastated but adamant they wish to continue.She wants to see NHS Highland play a full role plotting the way forward, including carrying out self-directed supportassessments, a tool that aims to ensure people who are eligible for support are given the choice and control over how their inidual budget is arranged and delivered to meet their agreed health and social care outcomes.Tain-based Mike Herd, whose son has happily attended the scheme in Invergordon, said: ldquoNHS Highland made a commitment to me last year that they would try to help the garden project continue through a dferent funding formula. However, the reality is that letters asking for SDS funding have been ignored. It seems that NHS Highland have just abandoned the gardeners to a bleak futurelong-term funding cannot be agreed.Cllr Smith added: ldquoI make a plea, especially to big businesses locally, to contact me and offer some funding towards this worthwhile project that gives the adult users with learning disabilities pride and a reason to get up in the morning.ldquoIt is only a one-off payment I am seeking, not continual funding.NHS Highlandrsquos head of service for learning disabilities and autism, Arlene Johnstone, said: ldquoDue to financial pressures NHS Highland is no longer able to contribute funding to the Garden Project in Invergordon.

Tourists visiting Scotland may also have some fun by using the haggis emoji as part of their messages to friends and family at home. If haggis is given the distinction of being granted its own emoji then the wider message is strong that the product is moving with the times, appealing to the masses and continuing to make our nation proud of its food heritage all year round as well as on Burn’s Night.\"Graeme Sharp, spokesman for Quality Meat Scotland, said: “Scotland is internationally renowned for its iconic national dish so what better way to spread the word and inspire people to buy haggis this Burn’s Night than a haggis emoji \"Originally developed in Japan, emojis have been in international use since , hitting the mainstream in  when the Oxford English Dictionary named an emoji one of its ‘words’ of the year.Haggis-lovers can support the campaign by using the hashtag #haggisemoji or by signing the petition.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4861653.1548326516!/image/image.jpg","title":"mike russell scots have right to consider independence as brexit alternative","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...People in Scotland #have the right# to consider independence as an alternative to Prime Minister Theresa May#s worsening Brexit #crisis#, a senior member of Nicola Sturgeon#s Cabinet has said.Mike Russell, the Scottish Constitutional Relations Secretary, added that, while “everybody will have an opinion” on the timing of another Scottish referendum, he trusts the First Minister on the issue.He spoke out after the SNP leader accused Mrs May of “running scared” of a second vote on independence.Speaking after talks with the PM in Downing Street on Wednesday, Ms Sturgeon said: “I think the Prime Minister fears that she would lose another Scottish independence referendum so she’s running scared of the verdict of the people.: Nicola Sturgeon: Theresa May ‘running scared’ over independence“It’s probably the reason she doesn’t want another EU referendum, because she thinks she might lose that. People that are confident in their arguments don’t run away from the verdict of the people.”But Mrs May insisted it is the SNP that is “out of touch” with the people of Scotland, who she said do not want “another isive Scottish independence referendum”.The two leaders clashed at the same time as Ms Sturgeon faced growing calls within her own party to call for a fresh vote on Scotland’s future place within the UK.Former first minister Alex Salmond has argued that there is “not likely to be a better time to force the issue” following the PM’s Brexit deal defeat.Similarly, SNP Western Isles MP Angus MacNeil has argued that it is time for calls for a fresh independence vote “to come to fore”, urging Ms Sturgeon to prioritise this over demands for a second European referendum.However, SNP MEP Alyn Smith said supporters of holding another independence vote in the near future should “ca’canny” as uncertainty over what will happen with Brexit means practical questions over independence remain unanswered.Mr Russell told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme that “everybody will have an opinion” about the timing of a possible second referendum.He added: “There are clearly many interests to be taken into account and I absolutely trust the First Minister’s judgment on these things.”Ms Sturgeon has already pledged to set out her views on this in a “matter of weeks”.But with the UK facing a Brexit “crisis” which he said was “getting considerably worse”, Mr Russell said Scots should “look to ourselves and our own future”.He stated: “It is absolutely the right moment to say that these are very, very serious concerns we are facing and the people of Scotland have the right to say ‘Do we have to go through this  It is something that we did not vote for’.“That is the truth at the heart of this. Scotland did not vote for Brexit, we’ve spent two-and-a-half years trying to negotiate the best possible outcome of this, compromising all the way, and we are incredibly within weeks of the supposed end date without anything firm in place.“Now the people of Scotland have the right to say ‘That is unacceptable, that is damaging and we must look to ourselves and our own future’.”Following Wednesday’s meeting between the First Minister and Mrs May, Downing Street revealed that both Ms Sturgeon and her Welsh counterpart, Carwyn Jones, had been invited to sit on a new Cabinet sub-committee which will “work on preparations for the UK’s exit from the EU, spanning both deal and no-deal outcomes”But Mr Russell said he had previously found promises of more involvement and consultation from the UK Government “to be hollow”.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4860727.1548235277!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit how the british public can take control ian murray","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Labour can force a second referendum on Brexit and put control back in the hands of the British public, writes Ian Murray.There are just over  parliamentary sitting days left in the Commons before we are due to leave the EU.While Theresa May denies she is “running the clock down”, the reality tells a very dferent story.Nearly two years since Article  was triggered, what happens next remains unclear. What an extraordinary situation we find ourselves in as we hurtle towards the March  deadline.This week, the Prime Minister put forward her ‘plan B’ after her withdrawal deal was comprehensively rejected last week. You may have noticed that ‘plan B’ looked remarkably similar to ‘plan A’. In fact, it was nearly identical. The only dference was the letter describing it.If the Scottish independence referendum taught us anything, it’s that politicians who fail to produce genuine plan Bs are found out by the public – as Alex Salmond discovered when he failed to outline an alternative to using the British pound in .Theresa May is treating parliament and the public like fools. That’s why she is almost certain – once again – to lose the next vote on her withdrawal deal this coming Tuesday.It’s worth reminding ourselves why there is such opposition to Downing Street’s proposal.First of all, this isn’t even about our future relationship with the EU post-Brexit. This is merely the orce agreement – the terms in which we would leave the EU.It doesn’t cover what happens after we leave and that is why there is a ‘backstop’ to the issues with the border on the island of Ireland. That explains why Number Ten appeared to be floating the dangerous idea of reopening the Good Friday Agreement, before realising that was a complete non-starter. It is an international treaty underpinned by the United Nations and ratied by referenda in the north and south of Ireland.Nobody voted for a Brexit that would see Britain giving away control and leaving people poorer. It means paying a near £ billion orce bill but getting nothing in . It is the worst of all worlds, which is why it has united both Remainers and Leavers in Parliament.: First Minister warns Theresa May must drop hardline Brexit stanceThe Prime Minister has insisted she will continue making tweaks to win over MPs, but the EU has made it clear that the withdrawal agreement cannot be renegotiated. It is a legal text.That is not the EU being intransigent – the Prime Minister’s red lines make this the only option for the other  member states. To get any movement, she would have to loosen those red lines.Her red lines include leaving the customs union and the single market, ensuring that freedom of movement can end. That’s the freedom of movement which has allowed Brits to travel freely and live and work in European countries, and allowed the British economy to grow by addressing worker shortages in key industries.So we’re in an almighty mess. As things stand, the default scenario the country faces is a ‘no deal’ Brexit. I fear the full impact of this catastrophic option is still misunderstood.It means leaving the EU with no withdrawal agreement in place, falling back on World Trade Organizationtrade rules. That comes with tarfs on imports and quotas, for example cars would be taxed at  per cent every time they crossed the UK-EU border, and dairy products would be hit with a  per cent tarf – hence the stockpiling of key goods. As the EU confirmed only yesterday, it would also mean a hard border with Ireland.: Poll: Two-thirds of Scots believe Brexit makes independence more likelyA ‘no deal’ Brexit would wipe tens of billions of pounds off the UK economy, including around £bn in Scotland, according to the CBI. A hit of that magnitude would have a devastating impact on jobs and living standards, plunging public services into crisis. And who would be the worst affected  The poorest people in society. So that’s why those of us who care about our constituents talk about taking no-deal “off the table”. The fear is that the Prime Minister runs the clock down until March, and we automatically fall off that no-deal clf-edge because time has run out or she bribes MPs to back her botched plan.There are ways to prevent that happening, however.The Article  timetable can be altered – either extended with the agreement of the EU or unilaterally revoked. That has to happen now regardless of the way forward.If the Prime Minister allows us to leave the EU without a deal, her Government will be deliberately choosing to inflict untold damage on its people. That would be unforgiveable.Fortunately, while the Government flounders, many MPs are rising to the occasion. A series of amendments have been submitted, including a Labour frontbench amendment which legislates for the holding of a People’s Vote. Others seek to extend the Article  process.There is, of course, little point in extending Article  in an attempt to tweak the withdrawal agreement, because the negotiations are over.It should, however, be extended so that we can go back to the people of the United Kingdom and offer them a vote to decide our future.I am open-minded about what should appear on the ballot paper, but the most obvious solution is to give voters a choice between the clear measurable propositions of Theresa May’s Brexit deal – which would confirm that the people of the UK still want to leave the EU – and keeping the best deal we already have by remaining a member state of the EU.The Prime Minister claims that a People’s Vote would be damaging to democracy, yet it’s the devastation her deal will inflict on the country that will irreparably damage our democracy – and a ‘no deal’ more so.It’s time to let democracy flourish and put control back in the hands of the British people. Next Tuesday gives parliament an opportunity to do that andthe Labour Party supports a People’s Vote amendment and whips to support it, we can achieve this goal.When that time comes, I know I will put our national interest first and campaign tirelessly for the UK to remain in the EU.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4861273.1548262308!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit sees scots tories mask slip over devolution joan mcalpine msp","story":"After Scottish Conservative MPs warn the UK Government not to give the Scottish Government a formal role in post-Brexit trade negotiations, SNP MSP Joan McAlpine says it shows they are putting #extreme unionist ideology# ahead of their constituents.The Scottish Tories were against the establishment of a Scottish Parliament in the first place. They stood alone, of all the major political parties, in their pig-headed opposition to Holyrood being allowed to exist. They campaigned against self-government in the  referendum and were roundly defeated. Democracy for Scotland was never their strong point.Ironically, the Scottish Parliament’s proportional representation system gave the Tories their best representation in decades. They even tried to re-invent themselves as a pro-devolution party.Many of us were unconvinced.Now the mask has slipped. The Scotsman has revealed the Scottish Tories actively lobbied to block the Scottish Government having any say in post-Brexit trade policy. : Scottish Conservatives to block post-Brexit trade role for Scottish GovernmentOnly last week, the UK’s Department of International Trade was exposed as having failed to renegotiate a single one of the  EU trade deals with other countries. Yet the Scottish Tories believe decisions affecting our export business, and public services such as the NHS, are best left with this incompetent department.This confirms the Conservatives are as opposed to the notion of Scottish self-government as they ever were.It undermines attempts by Ruth Davidson and other Scottish Tories to detoxy their brand. : Theresa May says independence referendum the ‘last thing we want’Just look at Ms Davidson’s oscillating stance on Brexit. At first, she was an ardent remainer. Immediately after the EU referendum, she insisted that Scotland and the rest of the UK must stay in the single market.And now  Now, the Scottish Tory meekly accepts whatever chaotic and shambolic version of Brexit Theresa May proposes. Scotland will just have to lump it, despite voting  per cent against leaving Europe. In what other country would elected politicians lobby against having a say over key decisions affecting those they represent That fact alone exposes the utter bankruptcy of the Tory vision for Scotland. They have put extreme unionist ideology before the needs of their constituents.It is further proof,it were needed, of the case for Scotland taking decisions for itself as an independent nation.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4861299.1548330747!/image/image.jpg","title":"first minister s questions live as nicola sturgeon faces questions from msps","story":"Nicola Sturgeon will face her weekly grilling from opposition leaders and MSPs this afternoon as she attempts to bounce back from what has been a dficult start to the year for her Government and her partyThe growing scandal surrounding the Scottish Government’s flagship NHS project, the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, is certain to feature, as are the First Minister’s recurring demands for a second independence referendum.[]js  djs.id  idjs.src  \"embed.playbuzz \"fjs©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4859536.1548063717!/image/image.jpg","title":"snp heavyweights there is no appetite for a second independence referendum","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Alex Salmond heaped further pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to demand a second independence referendum yesterday as senior figures within the SNP warned her against seeking another vote.The former first minister called on his successor to seize on the turmoilover Brexit engulfing Westminster by pushing for a second poll, while other leading figures within the party urged caution.Mr Salmond also pledged to end the “uncivil war” with Ms Sturgeon’s camp that has developed amid the fallout from sexual misconduct allegations against him. A police investigation is taking place into the allegations made by two women and dating back to when he was first minister. But Mr Salmond won a legal challenge against the Scottish Government over its handling of the claims.The Scottish Government is carrying out a review of what happened and Ms Sturgeon has referred herself to independent advisers to consider whether she breached the ministerial code during meetings and phone calls with her predecessor. Mr Salmond said Ms Sturgeon’s focus should be on the drive to bring about independence. He said: “Nicola should be concentrating all her energies on the independence agenda where we will never have better circumstances. As far as I am concerned Westminster’s Brexit dficulty should be Scotland’s opportunity.” Ms Sturgeon is to give an update to the Scottish Parliament on her plans in the coming weeks. A formal request for a Section  order which would give Holyrood the authority to stage a referendum was rejected by the UK government last year, with Prime Minister Theresa may insisting “now is not the time” to revisit the Scottish constitutional issue amid the Brexit uncertainty. It is understood that a further request by the Scottish Government would also be rejected by Westminster.Writing in the Sunday National newspaper yesterday, Mr Salmond said: “One of our features in the national movement has been our inability to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of our political opponents. We have tended to concentrate on the shape we’re in.“However, right now the Westminster political establishment is at its weakest point in my letime while the national movement is in good heart. There is not likely to be a better time to force the issue.”However former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars warned there is “no appetite” for a second independence referendum. He said: “There is no national Yes organisation in place – a prerequisite to success as many Yes activists and voters are not SNP.“No policy work has been done on the post-Brexit situation and thus we are not in a position to deploy then new policies in that post-Brexit new paradigm that will be needed to convince No voters to vote Yes next time.”Polls indicate there has been no rise in support for independence among Scots since the last vote in  and Perth and North Perthshire MP Pete Wishart said a vote should be held when it can be won.He said: “We are already making progress towards that with Brexit as the catalyst. But it will be dficult to secure the conditions to make a referendum happen before the next Holyrood election.”Alex Bell, a former SNP government adviser also called for a more considered approach.He said: “The SNP and Yes have to stop seeing independence as a sneaky prize to be won when everyone  is messing up and instead base their campaign on the reality of what Scotland can achieve through an honest understanding of the world.”Ms Sturgeon had pledged to hold a second referendum in the immediate aftermath of Brexit but “reset” her plans after the SNP suffered heavy losses in the  UK election.At First Minister’s Questions last week, she said: “Given the catastrophe that Scotland faces in our economy, our society, our living standards, the prospects for the next generation and our reputation in the world, it is essential that the option of independence is open to people in Scotland.“When people in Scotland have the ability to choose independence, I believe that the country will opt to be an independent one.”The Scottish Parliament has already voted in favour of a second referendum following the Brexit vote as the SNP combined with the pro-independence Greens.\u2028Scottish Secretary David Mundell has written to Mrs May to urge her to maintain her refusal to grant Holyrood powers for a second independence referendum.If the authority to hold a second referendum through a Section  is rejected, as expected, by the UK government, it has been suggested that the Scottish Government could make this the central issue of the next Holyrood election in , as it seeks to build the case for a independence in the years ahead.\u2028Tory constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins suggested Ms Sturgeon will seek a Section  order in the knowledge it will be rejected by in order to “stir up as much grievance and bad feeling as possible”.Scottish Liberal Democrat Leader Willie Rennie urged the SNP to abandon plans for another referendum. A Scottish Labour source added: “The last thing Scotland needs is more instability and chaos of yet another independence referendum, what our communities need are Labour governments here and in Westminster to end austerity.”An SNP spokesman said: “With the clock ticking down to Brexit date - and with the Tory government incapable of governing and Labour incapable of effectively opposing - the SNP will continue to focus on standing up for Scotland’s interests in the face of a disastrous Tory-driven Brexit and further austerity.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4861492.1548279551!/image/image.jpg","title":"psychologist reflects on apollo moon landing","story":"As a psychologist, I have spent much of my career examining why some people and organisations are especially successful. A few years ago, I became interested in the Moon landings. For most of us, mention of the Apollo landings conjures up images of white-suited astronauts carefully making their way across the lunar surface. While these brave and heroic iniduals are obviously essential to the success of Apollo, they are far from the full story. Watch any documentary about the Moon landings and you will soon see images of Mission Control # a huge room packed with consoles, giant screens and people wearing headsets. This impressive set-up lay at the heart of the space programme. The mission controllers never donned a spacesuit or travelled to a distant world. Instead, they wore everyday clothes, kept their feet firmly on the ground and often hid away from the public gaze. Nevertheless, they were central to the success of the entire enterprise.Most of the controllers came from modest, working-class backgrounds, and were often the first in their families to go to college. Perhaps most surprising of all, they were astonishingly young. In fact, when Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon, the average age of the mission controllers was just  years. The group had few of the qualities that we commonly associate with success and yet, somehow, they managed to accomplish the seemingly impossible.I wanted to discover why, from a psychological perspective, Mission Control was such a hotbed of success, and I was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity to interview several key controllers. Now in their seventies and eighties, they were all remarkably generous with their time and thoughts. I eventually discovered that their breath-taking achievement was due to a unique mindset partly inspired by the charisma and determination of President Kennedy.In , the Eisenhower administration established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , ploughing millions of dollars into science education. Two years later, John F Kennedy went head to head with Richard Nixon for the American Presidency. The space race took centre stage, with Kennedy pledging that he would do his best to ensure that America would be first across the finishing line. Kennedy won the day, beating Nixon to the presidency with one of the smallest margins in American history.Kennedy had energy and determination and spoke to a post-war generation that seemed to have lost its way. The young President encouraged every American to reflect on how they could help others and emphasised the value of public service. His inaugural speech ended with a phrase that beautully encapsulated Kennedy’s bold vision: ‘Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.’The President knew that he needed a vision that would engage the hearts and minds of millions of people. He wanted to think bigger and bolder. After many months of meetings, the President eventually supported an idea that resonated with his grand sensibilities: the world’s first manned mission to the Moon. Mindful of the Russians beating America to the punch, Kennedy added a tough time frame, declaring that he wanted a man to walk on the lunar surface before the end of the decade. It was an astonishingly audacious aim.On  September , Kennedy travelled to Rice University’s football stadium to announce his dream of humans reaching the Moon before the decade was out. The event attracted an audience of over , people. Sitting up in the stands that day was a -year-old schoolboy named Terry O’Rourke. Now in his seventies, Terry still remembers seeing Kennedy: “You live thousands of days in your le, but I still have a vivid memory of those few hours.” Terry remembers the stadium being energised by Kennedy’s sense of passion and enthusiasm: ‘I had  per cent confidence in him. He said we were going to go to the Moon and I totally believed him. We all believed him. You can call it optimism, or arrogance, or innocence, but it seemed aseveryone in that stadium really thought that America could pull it off.’Standing a short distance away from Terry was Rice University student and ace basketball player Jerry Woodfill. Originally from Indiana, Jerry had developed a childhood fascination with basketball and eventually won an athletics scholarship to Rice University. Jerry went along to hear Kennedy speak and, like O’Rourke, can remember the blistering heat. At the time, Jerry’s le was not going especially well. He hadn’t obtained great marks in his exams and his basketball training was proving tough. As Kennedy started to speak, Jerry felt something inside him stir. By the end of the speech, he was a changed man. Energised by Kennedy’s passionate vision of being the first to go to the Moon, Jerry ed to Rice University and dropped his basketball career, instead devoting himself to studying electrical engineering. When he graduated, Jerry applied to NASA and was invited to help develop the safety systems on the spacecraft that would attempt to land on the Moon. On  July , just seven years after seeing Kennedy speak at Rice University, Jerry was working in the Manned Spacecraft Center, and helping Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin set foot on the lunar surface.Millions of people across America were inspired and enthused by Kennedy’s vision of going to the Moon, and soon it seemed asthe whole nation was suffering from space fever. Like Kennedy, Americans believed that heading into the heavens would promote freedom and democracy, and so help create a better world for future generations. The same sense of passion motivated many of the scientists and engineers who would eventually transform Kennedy’s vision into a reality, and it was essential to their eventual success. When Flight Director Glynn Lunney was asked about how he felt about being part of the team that eventually put Neil Armstrong on the Moon, he responded: “We loved it. We loved the work, we loved the comradeship, we loved the competition, we loved the sense of doing something that was important to our fellow Americans.” Similarly, Flight Controller Steve Bales said that being part of the Apollo missions was so exciting and so much fun, that he would have worked on the programme evenhe had only been paid enough to cover his living expenses. The controllers’ comments are supported by a wealth of scientic evidence. Robert Vallerand, from the University of Quebec, has produced hundreds of academic papers on the psychology of passion. After studying the lives and minds of thousands of passionate people, Vallerand has discovered that this often-overlooked factor is one of the main secrets of success. When people do what they love, their work feels more like play and they are more likely to keep going when the going gets tough. As a result, they end up being especially productive and successful. In the same way that Kennedy energised an entire nation by announcing his intent to go to the Moon, passion has the power to propel people to incredible heights in both their personal and professional lives. Discovering and unlocking your passion is the key to finding satisfaction in all aspects of your le.

He said: “At one stage it took ten months to get a reply from them.“In the end, we received an apology for the delay from the planning department. However, I am delighted all of these hurdles have been overcome and I can’t wait for the work to get underway.”Originally submitted in  and , a spokesperson for Mr Ali said that the two applications pertaining to the development were delayed due to theof time the Portree planners took to reply to his architect#s letter regarding the ratication of the Conditions in the Listed Building Consent and Planning Permission.In response to those comments, Councillor John Gordon said: “Planning for the proposal was granted on th September , and Listed Building Consent was given on th September .“Given this, I am disappointed at how long it has taken for these plans to be taking forward since then, but I welcome the progress that is now being made.” that work on the ‘Poseidon’ hotel will begin in March.Article by Adam Gordon"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/KEEP-TO-THE-LEFT-SHARON-ANSLOW-1-Copy.jpg","title":"skye womans keep left campaign gathers","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineStickers in hired cars, improved signage and leaflets in tourist accommodation have all been suggested as practical moves to encourage visitors to the Highlands to remember to drive on the left.An awareness campaign on the issue has gathered recent momentum thanks to the efforts of a Skye woman who was involved in an accident near Sligachan at the end of last month.Sharon Anslow was injured in the crash on the th of December – an incident which she says happened after she moved to avoid an oncoming car on the same side of the road.In the wake of the incident Sharon, from Carbost, launched a ‘keep left’ petition and her work has been backed by local politicians.Last weekend Sharon met with MSP Kate Forbes, Skye Councillor John Finlayson and Skye police Sergeant Bruce Crawford to discuss ways to bolster the awareness campaign.Calls have been made for Transport Scotland to install extra signs and paint new road markings, while Visit Scotland are being asked to support a leafleting campaign.Dashboard stickers are also being organised for local car-hire companies, with the target being to pressure national firms to follow suit and install similar notices inside all their vehicles.Police plan to aid support to the campaign by stopping and issuing advice to drivers as they cross the bridge.Kate Forbes MSP said: “It was a very constructive meeting with Councillor John Finlayson, Sergeant Bruce Crawford and Sharon Anslow.“We had a robust conversation about road safety in Skye and Lochalsh and what further actions we could take to change this.“Sharon is a remarkable woman as it’s only a few weeks since she was in a traumatic accident and already she’s campaigning and working to ensure there are fewer accidents.“Her ‘Keep Left’ campaign has galvanised people across the world, some of whom have been to Skye on holiday.“I will be organising the next meeting with Transport Scotland to discuss signage, road markings and other things.“In the meantime, I’ll be writing to VisitScotland and all the car hire companies to ask them to ensure there is information for visiting drivers.“There’s a lot we can do and I’m delighted to be working with Sharon as well as John and Bruce.”Councillor John Finlayson added: “It was very useful to meet up with Sharon, Kate and Bruce to exchange ideas and plan how we can move forward support for Sharon’s Keep Left campaign and hopefully improve road safety on Skye and across the Highlands generally.“We will continue to liaise to move forward the actions we agreed and organise a meeting with Transport Scotland and council personnel.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/THAI-BOXING-PORTREE-1.jpg","title":"wanted man could be in skye","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA -year old man wanted by police in connection with a “serious incident” that took place in Inverness last August could be on Skye.Donald Stewart Snr is described as being white, approximately ’” tall, with fair blonde hair cut very short.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/homeinthehighlands17-2-360x100.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players from throughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams from Bun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1380213.jpg--.jpg?1547207055000\n","title":"57 job losses confirmed by administrator jbe not feasible","story":"The Administrator for JBE Mechanical.Electrical Ltd, the Ballymena based electrical and mechanical firm, has announced that following a review of all options in respect of the business, that it is not feasible for the business to continue to trade.Speaking following a meeting with all staff at the firm’s headquarters at Braid River Business Park in Ballymena, the Administrator Gerard Gildernew said: “Unfortunately, following our review of live contracts and the company order book, I have concluded that it is not feasible to continue trading the business in administration.

But unfortunately it is the residents who are suffering from the impact of all of this.“Depending on the direction of the wind the smell can be so bad it makes me feel nauseous and sometimes you just want to get out of the area to get some fresh air.“You cant hang out clothes, open your windows or sit in your garden. It affects your well-being because you are always thinking how long am I going to have to live with this or will I have to sell-up, leave the home that I have put a lot of effort into and have lived in for many years  The possible health implications are also a major concern.”She continued: “It is not just me there are residents in the area who have farms or homes that have been in their families for generations.“There are other issues as well as the odour and I feel like we are the guinea pigs in all of this.“The company have told us they are working to fix the problem and we are meeting with them again on February .”One man who has lived in the area all his le but does not wish to be named, said he will have to think about movingthe situation does not improve.He stated: “The smell at times is terrible. It is a gassy smell but there is also a rotten smell to it, its hard to explain.“We cant open our windows even during the warm weather. We tried to have them open but I had to get up in the middle of the night to close them the smell was so bad.“Last summer when the weather was good everyone was out enjoying their gardens and having barbecues but we had to either sit in the house or go out to eat somewhere.”He continued: “We were told at the start that we would hear, smell or see nothing but that is not the case. “When the smell gets into the house it takes a long time for it to go. I have even had people saying they can smell it when they are driving along the Craigadoo Road and they ask me how do you stick it .“My we loves to garden but she cant because of the smell. I have lived in the area all my le andthis doesnt improve we will have to consider moving.”TUV MLA, Jim Allister, called on the company to “take urgent action”.Mr Allister led a delegation of residents to a meeting with senior management at the plant on Tuesday, January .He said: For several months these residents have been afflicted with unbearable odours from the plant which processes poultry litter.“When seeking planning permission the plant owners assured everyone they were installing state of the art technology which would ensure no smells. The supposed super efficient technology has failed and now local residents are paying the price.”Mr Allister has vowed towith the residents for a further meeting.He said he would also be pressing the Northern Ireland Environment Agency “to step up its supervision and action”.“The present intolerable position cannot continue,” he concluded.Meanwhile, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs said the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, NIEA, was aware of odour complaints relating to the Anaerobic Digestion facility at Moorfields Road, Tully Quarry.A spokesperson for the Department said: “This facility is regulated by NIEA under a Pollution Prevention and Control Permit and the permit holder is Anaerobic Advantage Ltd.“NIEA agrees that odour management at the facility has not been acceptable and the facility is currently not in compliance with its permit. In response NIEA has been working with the operator in recent months resulting in the operator taking numerous steps attempting to mitigate and resolve the problems. “NIEA staff have visited a number of the residents during this time and we have also worked in close co-operation with the local council Environmental Health officer to obtain information on the odour impact from local residents.“As a result of investigations NIEA issued an Enforcement Notice on  October  requiring the operator to provide detailed proposals to fully resolve the odour problem. The operator has now provided their proposals for additional odour treatment and it is expected this work should be completed by end of January .“NIEA will continue to inspect the site on a regular basis, maintain pressure on the operator to take all necessary actions to minimise odour nuisance and liaise with local residents to keep them updated on progress.”In a statement Stream BioEnergy Ltd said: “We acknowledge and respect the concerns raised and we are continuing to work hard to resolve these as quickly as possible.”  "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8771209.1547630975!/image/image.jpg","title":"coffee morning to raise funds for samaritans","story":"On Saturday January , from am to .pm, a coffee morning will take place in Banbridge#s Old Town Hall, to raise much needed funds for the Samaritans.Ian Burns, one of the organisers of the event, said: “It is very concerning that Northern Ireland has the highest rate ofmale suicides, within the United Kingdom. This is an issue which needs addressing and one which requires a Strategy, to be put in place.Whilst I like the idea of our local Assembly producing a strategy, it is vital that this statistic is reduced, drastically.”Ian’s we Beverley lost a family member over  years ago, through suicide. Beverley commented: “our family knows only too well the pain and heartache which family and friends endure, following such a tragic loss. For many years, you ask the question why.You also wonder,only they had engaged with someone, and that person had been able to offer some glimmer of hope, which resulted in them not pursuing their course of action. “There have been a number of suicides in our town recently and since the Samaritans are a wonderful organisation, who offer a tremendous telephone helpline service, we thought that it would be worthwhile to try and raise some funds, for this great charity.”The Samaritans’s vision is that fewer people die by suicide. They believe that it is time to look beyond the statistics and into the real lives of these people, so that they and others, can find ways, to reduce any unnecessary deaths. The Samaritans know that when people are in crisis, talking can help that person.Beverley added: “ the money raised at this event, can fund just one phone call to the Samaritans and the Samaritan at the other end of the line is able to provide some hope and results in one person not proceeding with their plan to take their own le,then this event will have been very worthwhile. “I would appeal to anyone who is facing dficulties, no matter what they are, to call the Samaritans on  .

We regard this as the most important constitutional gathering in a generation,” he said.The conference comes as uncertainty continues to remain over the issue of the Irish border backstop along with the need to ensure EU rights are protected after Brexit.Last November one thousand prominent nationalistsportspeople, artists, actors and leading business heads put their signatories to an open letter to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar outlining their concerns.

The Belfast playwright’s scripts have a reputation for their intense humour, but at the heart of this play are the stark realities of working class le, isolation, and the emotional labour of mothers. The story gives the audience a veritable look into the lives of two overworked and underpaid care workers, Francesand Loretta , who look after the housebound -year-old Davy Magee, whose sole joys in le are horse betting, reading the Daily Mirror, and the music of Frank Sinatra.What turns out to be a catastrophic Monday for the pair begins with a small personal disaster for Loretta her son has forgotten his PE gear – she has to double back home and is late for work. In her absence, Francis has already helped Davy to the bathroom. Loretta arrives at Davy’s bungalow and chats to her friend about their respective family lives – Frances lambasts the education system for failing her entrepreneurial son, who has recently found success selling knock-off DVDs, while Loretta worries about her out-of-work husband and their inability to pay for their daughter’s school trip to Alton Towers. All the while Davy hasn’t emerged from the bathroom.When their charge fails to respond to repeated knocks at the door, Francis and Loretta panic, fearing the worst. As it turns out Davy has, in fact, died. Hilarity ensues as the women come to grips with his death and are presented with a further dilemma whatthey waited a few hours before reporting his demise, allowing them to withdraw his pension from the ATM and collect his winnings from the bookies  It would surely solve their money woes.Fearing the consequences of their petty crime, Frances and Loretta scheme up more and more elaborate ways to cover their tracks. Whatthey were caught  Whatthey were blamed for his death – could they be “up there with Myra Hindley and Fred West ”Theatrical comedy often treads a fine line between being side-splittingly funny and desperately exaggerated, but Fly Me To The Moon undoubtedly falls into the former camp. Despite the unfolding madness and slapstick antics, Tumelty and McGibbon manage to retain a level of realism in their fantastic performances. These two absurd characters could easily be ordinary Belfast women.Jones has written and directed a truly magnicent piece of comedy in Fly Me To The Moon but, crucially, the humour is punctuated, at critical moments, by important social commentary. Like many pensioners, the lonely Mr Magee, whose phonebook only contains the number of his bookie, lived a le in isolation – “a le of misery” as Frances says. The protagonists struggle with the daily problems of impoverished Belfast mothers, their crimes paling in comparison to the grand-scale corruption of politicians and bankers often mentioned in pages of their charge’s Daily Mirror. Loretta’s admission that her husband “even seemed smaller” since losing his job almost presented itself as a moment of comedy on the night, drawing a few solitary laughs before its signicance sank in. The preceding paragraph should leave readers in no doubt as to the hilarity of this play – there wasn’t a person at the Grand Opera House whose cheeks weren’t sore by the end.However, audiences will also go home, having had some laughs, with something more to ponder."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"hoax device alert sees residents evacuated in sub zero temperatures","story":"A number of residents from the Springfield Road area in West Belfast have been allowed toto their homes following the discovery of a suspicious object last night.The Springfield Road and Lanark Way were closed for a time as a controlled explosion was carried out by army technical officers on the suspicious object, which was later deeclared to be an elaborate hoax.

authorisation as a last resort for a hard Brexit.“In addition, a number of applicants are bringing new types of businesses to the Irish market and operating complex business models.“At this stage, a

British Irish Chamber of Commerce hosted the Brexit conference with Ulster Bank and KPMG to address the implications surrounding Brexit on the financial services sector.Simon Barry, chief economist at Ulster Bank, said Irish businesses are pursuing alternative sources of market growth outside the UK.He added that Ireland can tap into opportunities as UK firms try to cope and manage Brexit uncertainties.But he said that the bank has started to see the effects of Brexit uncertainty on their customers and businesses, who are triggering contingency plans and scaling back investment proposals for the UK economy.“The stakes for Ireland are so high given our close ties to the UK,” he continued.“The UK political system still hasn’t landed on a settled point around where it wants to be and pitch its new future relationship.“It really is a remarkable feature of how the way politics has unfolded.“If you want full independence from EU institutions, rules and structures, then you are moving further away from access to the Single Market.“The more access you have to Single Market, the less damage Brexit will do to your economy.”Michael D’Arcy, Ireland’s Minister for Financial Services and Insurance, described Brexit as an “overarching challenge” for Ireland.“Britain’s exit from the EU will be the defining moment between our relationship both with the UK and the rest of the Europe,” he added.“In light of the ongoing uncertainty in the UK, we continue work to prepare for the UK’s exit from EU, and the European Council has asked for this work, at national and EU level, to

We need to grow our working age population.“So as well as what the UK Government is doing being wrong in principle, it’s practically damaging for Scotland and that’s why the sooner we get these matters into our own hands and are able to take decisions here in Scotland, rather than have them taken in Westminster, the better for all of us”.Labour MSP Pauline McNeill said: “The approach of the UK Government to European citizens, who’ve made their home in Scotland and the UK, is a slap in the face to their commitment to the United Kingdom, many of who have lived here longer in Scotland than in their country of birth.“What the UK Government don’t seem to recognise is the rejection that those EU citizens feel.”"},{"url":null,"title":"possibility of a second brexit referendum has somewhat increased says blair","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The resulting m scrum led to a succession of drives for the line and when the ball was recycled a loose pass missed its intended target, but Rory Campbell took the ball smartly on the bounce to score in the corner for an early Malone lead.After Paddy Wright missed a long-range penalty, Ballynahinch earned an excellent attacking position with a m line out following an excellent Ross Adair touch-finder. The line out was won, but Malone forced a crucial turnover and the chance went begging.Both sides continued to be careless in possession in a niggly match, which was low on quality.On  minutes a Malone breakdown penalty gave lsquoHinch a chance to drive for the line and as they progressed, Malone blatantly killed the ball and could count themselves lucky not to receive a yellow. Wright slotted the penalty to close the gap to two points.Following a Malone penalty miss, lsquoHinch botched their own line out allowing the home side to pile into the . Zack McCall was penalised for offside as Malone looked to sweep the ball wide and was given a yellow card. Malone then scored from a tap penalty to take a - half-time lead.The second half followed a similar pattern to the first with Ballynahinch going further behind to another try from the prolic Campbell after another lsquoHinch mistake on their own line out.Ross Adair reduced the arrears on  minutes with a converted try to put lsquoHinch in bonus point territory and the away side belatedly roused themselves to pile the pressure on Malone during the final ten minutes.However, the home defence held and lsquoHinch had to settle for a point, earned largely through the woes of the Malone place kicker, who failed to land any of his attempts on goal.A disappointing start to  for the locals and they will need to be more accurate this week as Ballymena come to Ballymacarn Park.Malone Ballynahinch AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygowan’s Emma hoping to make waves at Abu Dhabi Special Olympics  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN swimmer is hoping to make a big splash when she goes to the Middle East in March.Twenty three year-old Emma Carlisle will be going for gold when she swims for Ireland at the  Special Olympics World Summer Games in Abu Dhabi.Emma is one of seven athletes from Co Down included in the -strong Team Ireland squad for the Games which take place over March -.Newry is well represented with four athletes selected.

She suffered from the heart condition Tricuspid Atresia.Mrs Trainor has described the decision to send babies to the Alder Hey Childrenrsquos Hospital in Liverpool after the provincersquos paediatric pathologist retired as ldquoinhumane.She believes thatpriority was given to funding and enticement for the training of pathologists, post-mortems could continue to be carried out on a regional basis.In addition, Mrs Trainor believes the possibility of pathologists travelling to Northern Ireland periodically from England, Scotland, Wales and further afield could be considered.Addressing last weekrsquos meeting, Mrs Trainor described the decision to perform post-mortems in Liverpool as ldquosickening and immoral and argued health officials should have done more to continue the service, knowing that a senior pathologist was retiring.ldquoFor women who have had a miscarriage or whose baby dies, it is the single worst thing that is ever going to happen in your le, she said.ldquoYou will lose parents, aunts and uncles, husbands and wives, but you will never experience the pain and heartbreak of losing a child. For health officials to suggest that a child is wrapped up like a package and sent across the water for a post mortem is cruel.ldquoI am not sure what provision would be in place for parents to accompany the child, but to send them on such a journey is heartbreaking.

Local people have sought a meeting with Department of Health officials on this matter and I will be happy to pursue and facilitate this.ldquoThere is a need for such a crucially important service for parents and indeed the wider family circle to be delivered regionally.Three weeks ago, local politicians called on the Permanent Secretary to reduce the ldquoalready enormous burden from parents suffering from bereavement and come up with a better solution than sending babies to Liverpool.Politicians said they were not averse to an all island service, insisting the reinstatement of the Belfast-based paediatric pathologist who retied is also vitally important moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New £217k play park welcome boost for Meadowlands estate  ","story":"MEADOWLANDS estate in Downpatrick is at last to get a new play park costing pound,.Work on the park should start within weeks and be ready by the end of March.A proposal to proceed with the scheme was approved by Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee on Monday night.The new park is a joint project with the council and Downpatrick Neighbourhood Renewal with % funding from the Department of the Communities.The council will be responsible for managing its construction and its maintenance.The new park is to be located in front of Drumcloon Walk and adjacent to the Quoile Crescent housing development.According to the Northern Ireland Neighbourhood Information Service statistics, Meadowlands is ranked th out of  areas of high health deprivation.The need for the park has also been supported by statistics from the Northern Ireland Research and Information Agency which show that there are  children under the age of  living in the Quoile Ward area who could avail of the park.It is also hoped that the park will help with the regeneration of the area and improve its overall look.The siting of the park was moved after some local concern was expressed that it would too close to pensionersrsquo homes in Drumcloon Park.Meadowlands Community Association, which was formed with help from local councillor Cadogan Enright, last week welcomed the move and the fact that the council listened to its representations.At Mondayrsquos meeting, Cllr Billy Walker proposed that the committee agree to go ahead with the park.He said: ldquoI really welcome this play park, as will the residents, he said. ldquoBeing the last chairman of the old district council, I know that a park for Meadowlands was a legacy issue.ldquoThere is real need for this as Meadowlands is one of the most deprived areas in the Downpatrick DEA and itrsquos to good see that that hard work is at last bearing fruit.Cllr Cadogan, who seconded the proposal, added: ldquoI am delighted that this play park can go ahead as I have been working with the residents for years and itrsquos at last getting over the line..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New amenity centre set for spring opening  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new ultra-modern civic amenity centre could open as early as the spring, council officials have confirmed.The new facility at Flying Horse Road will replace the existing centre at nearby Cloonagh Road, which continues to struggle with the increasing demands being placed upon it.Over the Christmas and New Year holiday period, the centre was forced to close early due to the volume of waste.The early closure annoyed many ratepayers with council officials confident the new centre mdash which is signicantly larger mdash will be able to handle more recyclable material.Over recent years, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has invested signicant sums building new civic amenity sites in Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with the Flying Horse Road facility set to be one of the most modern of its kind.Confirmation that the new Downpatrick centre could open as early as the spring will be given at this eveningrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.There was a delay in building the new facility as a suitable site could not be identied and when work did eventually get underway, progress was temporarily halted as equipment belonging to contractors was targeted by vandals.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed news then the new centre could open for business as early as the spring.The local authorityrsquos lease of the Cloonagh Road facility has been extended until the end of March but it has been recognised for some time that this facility has passed its sell-by-date.Cllr Curran said it was important Downpatrick had a recycling centre which was fit-for-purpose and could meet the needs of ratepayers across a wide area.He said the facility was not solely used by people in the town.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We need to grow our working age population.ldquoSo as well as what the UK Government is doing being wrong in principle, itrsquos practically damaging for Scotland and thatrsquos why the sooner we get these matters into our own hands and are able to take decisions here in Scotland, rather than have them taken in Westminster, the better for all of us.Labour MSP Pauline McNeill said: ldquoThe approach of the UK Government to European citizens, whorsquove made their home in Scotland and the UK, is a slap in the face to their commitment to the United Kingdom, many of who have lived here longer in Scotland than in their country of birth.ldquoWhat the UK Government donrsquot seem to recognise is the rejection that those EU citizens feel..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Nicola Sturgeon says Scotland must be given control over immigration article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before her move to London she had worked for Paul Rankin at Roscoff’s.Mary-Anne said she had always intended to come home from London and her original intention was to open a café deli. She said the market stall was designed to be a stopgap while she looked for premises but she ended up spending ten years there until she had her twins three years ago.“I was self-employed so I couldn’t take maternity leave from the market for more than eight weeks or I would lose the pitch,” she said.“I was already doing some midweek cookery classes at home in Moy, so I decided to expand on that and convert the garage into a state of the art facility. I really enjoy it and it allows me to work from home.”Courses cost from £ and include tea coffee and scones. Mary-Anne delivers savoury cookery classes as well but explained that baking is far and away the most popular.“I wasn’t actually trained as a pastry chef but there has been such a resurgence in the popularity of baking. That is where the demand is. I would love to do more cookery classes where people can learn to do savoury foods too, however the majority of bookings are for those sweet treats we all love. I like to combine traditional recipes and new flavours. Local, seasonal and organic ingredients are key.”Each course can accommodate - people and are booked out weeks in advance. All recipes andequipment are provided and you get to take home what you make.“My style is informal, it’s all about having fun. I do hands-on and demonstration classes and cater for all levels from complete beginners to more experienced cooks. The aim is to get stuck in.

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/steve_web.jpg","title":"the catalyst to putting northern ireland on the global map","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Ulster Business speaks to Catalyst Inc chief executive Steve Orr about his hugely ambitious plans for growth, expansion and moulding NI into a world-leader in tech ‘We aren’t going to follow anyone , and we need toto becoming leaders in the world.’It’s immediately clear that Steve Orr has big ambitions for Catalyst Inc. He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed.

The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come.

It’s still lovingly referred to as the Swiss watch stalwart’s sister brand.From there, following the Second World War, he decided now was the time to expand and give the brand an identity of its own.The primary dference between the brands back then, was that Rolex watches carried in-house movements, and that Tudor would offer familiar watch styles, such as the Oyster and Submariner, at a more affordable cost, while its big brother would guarantee the technical, aesthetic and al characteristics, along with distribution and after sales service.But the brand back then, and the company now, has changed radically. Just a few years ago, it tore up the rulebook on its traditional line – moving away from historically similar watches to Rolex, and a few changes from its classical lines, towards a tight range of watches, bringing in the old and the new.The core model is the Black Bay. A millimetre larger than the Rolex Submariner, it’s a slightly chunkier affair, without treading into the excessive sizes of some other brand’s modern timepieces. It also offers a new ‘’ –  a smaller mm watch, which fits right in as a cheaper alternative to the Submariner, a Black Bay Chronograph and the Pelagos – a larger, more modern affair made out of titanium.The brand also comes in at a time when Rolex prices have shot up, considerably. Many of the most desirable models in the Rolex line have a waiting list – with second-hand prices outpacing the new book price.Tudor itself has also embraced this burgeoning demand, releasing its own GMT watch – with so-called ‘Pepsi’ blue and red bezel. Currently, Rolex’s own model – aside from the sizeable price dference – will mean joining a waiting list. A WEEK ON THE WRIST Tudor Heritage Black Bay Sitting as Tudor’s poster-boy or flagship in its range, the Black Bay is a e watch which melds the styling and inspiration of, possibly the most recognisable watch in the world, the Rolex Submariner, with a larger case, while adding patina on the hands and markers.There’s no crown-guard, ala Rolex. This time, it’s a larger, screw-down, with an etched Tudor rose – formerly the brand’s logo.Overall, the Black Bay’s case is brushed, including the caseback, with the finish smoothly transitioning into a polish around the sides and crown.The sapphire crystal glass is slightly domed, sitting around a millimetre off the face off the watch. Around the edge, the bezel is a solid, thick and satisfyingly sold -click version, with red triangle and lume dot.This version is on a steel bracelet, but is also available on a leather or fabric band, along with red dial and blue – the latter without the patina on the markers and hands.The bracelet is a stand-out characteristic of the piece, certainly in terms of build quality. The three-piece links have a lug width of mm, tapering to around mm. It’s brushed, but polished and riveted along the side. On the clasp, there’s a double-locking system, with a thoughtful inclusion of the Tudor shield logo into the mechanism, along with three points of micro-adjustment.This watch, available from jeweller Lunn’s, spent several days on my wrist – from the office, to out-and-about and around the house. It’s a comfortable piece to wear – balanced between a bit more heft than its more expensive sibling, but never straying into the realm of gaudy or garish.After a few hours, it felt very much like one of my own. I did miss the date, however, but those after additional complications or ality could look to the chronograph version, or the larger Pelagos.The Black Bay is a well-balanced piece – easily sitting at the centre of a Venn diagram between casual and formal.The brand itself is firing everything at the new range, with endorsements from David Beckham and Lady Gaga, aimed at a younger generation with disposable income to spare. While that may not appeal or speak to the horological purists, with the in-house movement, attention to detail, provenance and mixture of the traditional and modern, it’s likely to build a fresh reputation as a ‘watch fan’ timepiece, and for those who have no issue explaining to those admiring the chunk of steel on their wrists, that it isn’t a Rolex.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
