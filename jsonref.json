He added: \u0027So I think they have to relax slowly and we\u0027re going to have to be patient. \u0027And we need a very high uptake in order to have this effect.\u0027The modelling, which helps to explain why Boris Johnson is so reticent to end the third national coronavirus lockdown, comes amid renewed pressure from Tory backbenchers for a \u0027roadmap\u0027 out of lockdown.So far the government\u0027s route out of the cycle of shutdowns initiated last March would see schools closed until at least March 8, with hospitality businesses including pubs and restaurants to reopen as far away as April.  But with Rishi Sunak mulling increases to capital gains tax to pay for the massive £400billion blackhole in public spending accrued during the pandemic and warnings that the economy could take a decade to recover, Tory MPs are likely to be rattled by the new graphs.   St Austell GP practice vaccinates 1,000 people against Covid in 48 hours after unexpected Pfizer delivery - Cornwall Live"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2264d06b1c1cea16b4238b9d7eca5b3492cd64d8/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63401de50e23f774755b658df2b5996d","title":"original observer photography","story":"Phoebe Dynevor, Camille Cottin, flooding in York and sledging in Glasgow - the best photography commissioned by the Observer in January 2021"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1df870cca5494a87aa8bdb37267448519dec2ad9/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=4ef892a832077dd3b25ee4f19e974102","title":"tabitha lasley sea state interview oil rigs","story":"When the journalist set out to write about the men who work on the North Sea oil rigs, she didn’t expect to fall for one of them. She talks about how her memoir Sea State came aboutA certain kind of journalist will sometimes ask herself: how far would I go for a story? Is there anything I wouldn’t do, or say, or be? For a long time, Tabitha Lasley was definitely not that kind of journalist. The frustrations of her job at a London property magazine were never enough to cause her to throw off what she regards now as her lassitude the feeling that at least she could pay her share of the rent reined her in. But then, overnight, everything changed. In the course of a single phone call, she understood that it was time to leave her boyfriend. “I’m quite a coward,” she says. “I think most people are. But at a certain point, the prospect of staying in that relationship became more scary to me than the prospect of jumping into the unknown.” Newly homeless, it was perhaps inevitable that her relationship with risk would also change. Having handed in her notice, she packed up her meagre possessions – how sad they looked how reproachful – and moved to Aberdeen, to research a book she had long dreamed of writing, about North Sea oil rigs and the men who risk their lives working on them.It was a serious project. She was fascinated by the rigs, their isolation and danger. She wanted to know what men are like “without women around”. But she was also, inwardly, a mess. She and the very first man she interviewed, an oil worker she now calls Caden (this is not his real name), began seeing each other, and soon after this – minutes after this, if we’re honest – he left his wife and children in Stockton-on-Tees, and moved into the flat she’d rented in one of Aberdeen’s edgier vicinities. “I think if he’d been number 42, it wouldn’t have happened,” she says. “But if you come out of a punitive relationship, and a man is nice to you, it’s like getting into a warm bath after years of cold showers.” She knew it was a catastrophe. She and Caden were like tourists in one another’s lands, each of them only half-fluent in the other’s language. Both were on the run from disaster at home. But that isn’t to say that she didn’t love him. She did, and so she clung on – until, that is, he went back to his wife. Then she could only cling on to her mobile phone, and wait, and hope, and in the meantime, work (the only balm, unless you count drink).What happens when a journalist crosses a line? This is another question some of us sometimes ask ourselves. Lasley knew her relationship with Caden had muddied the water in which she wanted to swim. It wasn’t only that her judgment might be shot (weren’t they all the same, these men, sleeping with women who were not their wives as they waited for the helicopter to take them to the rig?). Aberdeen is a small city, and the oil workers, itinerant and needing to let off steam, frequent the same bars and hotels. People would talk. They would know about her and Caden, and this would get in the way of the confidences she wanted them to share (as if these weren’t hard enough to come by already oil companies do not look favourably on workers who speak to journalists). How would her practised semi-flirtatiousness – journalistic determination disguised as pliancy – look to them now? She kept going: she spoke to more than 100 men before she finally packed up and left. But in the end, there seemed only one thing to do with her transgression. Somehow, it would have to be incorporated into the book. Her love affair, and the assignment she had set herself, would have to be as inseparable on the page as they were in the long, lonely months she spent in Aberdeen.She went back home to her family in the Wirral, and got a job in a chicken shop in Ellesmere Port – the only one she could find – and when she wasn’t shovelling chips, she worked on her manuscript. “I didn’t have a choice,” she says. “I had no backup plan. I’d ripped up my life.” After three years, she had a book. The first agent who saw it told her it didn’t work. Either she should write about oil rigs, or she should write about her sex life, but this weird hybrid really wouldn’t do. “I went home and cried after that. I was 37. I’d committed hara-kiri on my career.” But then the novelist Jon McGregor, whom she has never met but who happens to be her best friend’s brother-in-law, sent a chapter to his agent, and she got it immediately: its rawness and its power its inordinately firm hold, at once fiery and cold-eyed, on such matters as class, money and masculinity its singular setting. Soon, Lasley had a publisher, and enough cash to put the fried chicken behind her. “I can live on it for a while,” she says now, uncertainly, fiddling with her hair. (She is talking to me via Zoom from the north-west.)Sea State will be published this week, almost six years to the day after she first arrived in Aberdeen, and by any measure it’s extraordinary. It takes you to places so few books do: to Aberdeen, a city made of “Louisiana avarice and Protestant thrift” to the rusting hulk of the rigs, their atmosphere “somewhere between a prison and a school” to Ellesmere Port, where the poor go “round and round, always owing nine out of ten”. It gets inside the kind of heads that are mostly ignored by publishing: Caden, with his devotion to box-fresh trainers and every kind of children’s party food, is not the sort of man you meet often in hardbacks.Lasley writes unapologetically, describing all of these things just as they are, no pussy-footing around. If she’s sympathetic to her subjects and the lives they’ve no choice but to lead – the deprivation in their post-industrial, mostly northern communities leaves them with no option but to take work offshore – she’s not about to patronise them by making excuses for their bad behaviour.Not, of course, that she’s an angel herself – or even, sometimes, any more sensible than they are. Alone in a dark alley with another half-cut bloke she’s only just met, you worry for her. You want to tell her to ring for a taxi. To run. To phone a friend. “This is what men often fail to grasp about women,” she writes. “We are scared of them, especially when they drink.” But only rarely does her fear send her scurrying home. She is so brave, and never more so than when abandoned. How exactingly she writes of heartbreak: the strange humiliation that comes with rejection, though you know you’ve done nothing to deserve it the abjection that cannot be eased, irrespective of the fact that he’s not, and never will be, worthy of you. (Every woman will recognise these things.) She has no self-pity, but nor does she fall back on the platitudes of self-help, telling herself to move on, as if love were just another item on a supermarket conveyor belt. There is no quick route to recovery. Going on a date would be like “trying to treat a heroin addiction with Calpol”. Like the men on the rigs, aching for home as they begin their three-week stints offshore, their monotonous 12-hour shifts, she must butch it out. Just like them, she is deracinated, all at sea.How does she feel about the publication of her book? Is she nervous? “When I was writing, I made a decision just to put down what was in my head,” she says, her words tumbling out (she sits, cross-legged on a carpeted floor, in a grey sweatshirt, her eyes as big as teacups). “I didn’t think about the consequences. But now I’m starting to worry: what if everyone thinks I’m awful?” Who has read it so far? “My mum finished it the other day. I wouldn’t let her read it for ages. She cried. She thinks it’s really sad.” What about Caden? “My primary concern is that his identity is protected. He’s got a family to support. That’s important to me. But he’s not a reader. I don’t imagine he will read it. It’s not an airport novel.”The best thing about Sea State, she says, is that it has given her back the time she wasted on him. “I’ve made it into something. I didn’t lose it, after all.” The pain of his going was terrible. It left her reeling it was a bereavement. But it makes her sense of wellbeing now seem extreme, like those days after illness when you feel as if you’re Wonder Woman, practically able to fly.The true subject of her book, she believes, is money. Those with it have power, those without it have none. If she hadn’t learned this when she left her boyfriend, the lesson soon stuck in Aberdeen. The offshore men have no choice but to work in extremely dangerous conditions: the coal and steel industries having largely packed up in the places where they were born, the shoddily maintained rigs, now coming to the end of their lives, are their only option. And the same goes for the women they leave behind. All they can do is wait, and then put up with whatever kind of man it is who knocks on the door a month later (Lasley’s interviewees repeatedly tell her how hard it is for them to acclimatise the shabby reality of home never lives up to the dream of doll’s house perfection). “For a middle-class woman, not to get married might be a feminist statement,” says Lasley. “But in a working-class marriage, the dynamic is different. The men, often, still control the money, and if you control the money, you control the marriage. Working-class women are not waiting on a ring because they’re dreaming of a big, fairy princess day they’re waiting on it because they’re not protected financially otherwise.”So what did she learn about how men are when there are no women around? She smiles. “Nothing good,” she says. “Men and women become more similar when they have similar economic power. The more money a man has, the more entitled he’ll be, while a woman whose work has no financial value is going to be seen as worth less – we all live by the index of capitalist society.” Though oil workers are not so well paid now as in the past, they’re still, relatively speaking, cash rich. But they’re also institutionalised, and this turns them into stereotypes. “I was a bit of an innocent a serial monogamist. The trip was an education. They said the same things over and over again, the same lines. They were like hurdy-gurdies. I’ve become, belatedly, quite good at unpicking what men say. Every time a man approaches me now, I think: what’s in it for me? Usually the answer is: not enough.” In her book, she offers translations. “My ex is controlling: I am a cheat. My ex is bitter: I am incapable of linking cause and effect. You’re different to other birds: I believe women are more or less interchangeable.”She was the only journalist she knew who wasn’t shocked by the EU referendum result. In Aberdeen, where the oil industry was contracting, the men were all worried for their future, and felt abandoned by the Labour party, too busy waging a culture war to advocate for them. Places like Teesside once had mining and steel now it was all call centres and zero-hour contracts. Offshore, European workers were prepared to do the same jobs for a third of the money.In Sea State, Lasley’s account of life on the rigs is threaded through the story of her and Caden, a process so lightly done you hardly notice all the jargon she has picked up, the insider information. She knows the Brent Charlie is three hours by helicopter in an oncoming wind, and that no one likes working on it (too many men, too small a gym), while the Ninian Central is notoriously hard to get off (flights home could be cancelled for any number of reasons, including geese on the runway at Scatsta in the Shetlands). She’s cognisant of the complex tension between production and safety on the rigs, and of the ever-present fear of explosions. The course employees take before they go offshore, in which they’re strapped into a simulator that’s submerged in a swimming pool, is about as useful in reality, she writes, as an air steward’s safety demonstration. In the old days, the men played darts and pool after their shift. Now they retreat to their cabins to stare at their devices – and it drives them mad. One man headbutts his iPad because his girlfriend is going out, and he can’t stop her. They live two lives, one offshore and one on land, and in the aftermath of Caden she understands what this feels like, for even as she’s working, her mind is always somewhere else.For a long while, Lasley’s life felt precarious, as if she might just fall clean off the edge of it, like a man from a rig. But a lot of time has passed since. All this was before she signed with the Wylie Agency, the home of Martin Amis and Sally Rooney before a long and admiring review of Sea State appeared in the London Review of Books. If such precariousness helped her, she doesn’t mourn its passing one bit. What is she going to do next? Is she off to – I don’t know – sail the high seas with Somalian pirates? She shakes her head. No. She’s working on a novel now. “It’s set in a girls’ school, on a marsh, and I’m very pleased with the setting,” she says. For a second, I’m disconcerted. Then it occurs to me. Isn’t this her territory all over? An enclosed, single-sex world. Water, water, everywhere. Only this time it’s women, with no men around. In both senses of the word, a quagmire.• Sea State is published by Fourth Estate on 4 February (£14.99). To order a copy go to bookshop.

The US president bumped elbows with his newly appointed climate tsar, John Kerry, who he called his “best buddy”, then gave a short speech before perfunctorily signing a small stack of executive orders, donning his mask and striding out without taking any questions.The vision laid out in the actions signed by Biden on Wednesday, however, was transformative. A pathway for oil and gas drilling to be banned from public lands. A third of America’s land and ocean protected. The government ditching the combustion engine from its entire vehicle fleet, offering up a future where battery-powered trucks deliver America’s mail and electric tanks are operated by the US military.Biden may eschew the politically contentious framing of the Green New Deal but there was even an echo of the original New Deal with his plan for a civilian climate corps to restore public lands and waterways. “The whole approach is classic Biden working-class values, putting people to work,” said Tim Profeta, an environmental policy expert at Duke University.The dizzying list of actions demonstrated the breadth and depth of the climate crisis. Biden’s administration will spur new climate-friendly policies for farmers while also devoting resources to the urban communities, typically low-income people of color, disproportionally blighted by pollution from nearby highways and power plants. In all, 21 federal agencies will be part of a new, overarching climate body. “This isn’t time for small measures,” Biden said. “We need to be bold.”“It truly is a new day for climate action,” said Carol Browner, former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Bill Clinton. “President Joe Biden is taking unprecedented actions and sending an unmistakable message to the world that the United States is back and serious about tackling the climate crisis.”Biden is yanking every possible governmental lever, it seems, to lower emissions but is also cognizant of attacks from Republicans, and unease among some unions, that ditching projects such as the Keystone XL oil pipeline will kill jobs. Battle lines have already formed – Republicans are trying to prevent any halt to drilling, with Greg Abbott, the Texas governor, vowing to “protect the oil and gas industry from any type of hostile attack launched from Washington DC”.The counter to this backlash will be framed around jobs. Those who know Biden say the president views the climate crisis as a destabilizing threat to American might and national security but also an opportunity to create employment in a Covid-ravaged economy. “When I think of climate change I think of jobs,” has become a Biden slogan.The president argues a $2tn clean energy plan will bring millions of new jobs by refashioning the power grid to run on carbon-free sources such as solar and wind within 15 years, building a new generation of energy-efficient homes and electric cars and mopping up pollution from oil and gas wells. “People have been in pain long enough,” said Gina McCarthy, Biden’s new domestic climate adviser, in reference to the pandemic. “We are not going to ask for sacrifice. If we fail to win the heart of middle America, we will lose.”But emissions won’t get to zero via presidential action alone and Democrats’ hopes of sweeping climate legislation appear remote in a finely balanced Senate where climate denialism is still rife, as demonstrated on Tuesday by the Republican senator Rand Paul promoting a baseless theory that global heating is caused by the Earth’s tilt rather than human activity. Joe Manchin, a key Democratic vote who represents the coal heartland of West Virginia, once shot a climate bill with a rifle in a TV campaign advertisement.“Congress seems to be the last bastion of climate denialism left in America,” said Todd Stern, the lead US negotiator of the Paris climate agreement.There will probably be bipartisan agreement in certain areas, such as tax breaks for wind and solar and upgrades to ageing infrastructure that is being increasingly battered by floods, storms and wildfires. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader, is confident some climate spending can sneak into overall budget bills. Biden could do more unilaterally if he declared a state of emergency over climate, Schumer has suggested. “Trump used this emergency for a stupid wall, which wasn’t an emergency. But if there ever was an emergency, climate is one,” the New York senator said last week.The Trump years may well have been the death rattle of influential denialism. The American public’s concern over the climate crisis is at record levels, with even a majority of Republican voters supporting government intervention in the wake of a year of unprecedented wildfires and hurricanes that cost hundreds of lives and tens of billions of dollars. The question is now whether the US is able to change quickly enough to avert further disaster, rather than if it will change at all.“We are already spending the money, folks,” Kerry, the former secretary of state who is now Biden’s climate envoy, said of the recent climate-fueled disasters. “It’s cheaper to deal with the crisis of climate than to ignore it. This is life or death, a challenge to the fibre of our society. The stakes on climate change couldn’t be any higher than they are now. Failure is literally not an option.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/949ed0dff9a0a4ecd4fd4004675d1f647489cffc/0_382_5736_3442/master/5736.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a6ad5a2bcbdb6572e433b7a0055f9758","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The best of the week’s wildlife pictures from around the world, including a Eurasian lynx and rescued caymans"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdcb303aba7a5bdae2d5b3c0c2ec55eb25d13a4b/240_144_3359_2016/master/3359.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57b77f31f4f04d8d7f8f330395d6e475","title":"animals of the far north in pictures","story":"The BBC series Stormborn, which is narrated by Ewan McGregor and begins tonight, charts the breeding seasons of reindeer, seals, otters and foxes across Scotland, Norway and Iceland"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9102e7c71ce63b3c28c389d3667f62a0d6cf9c67/166_0_2394_1438/master/2394.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTIucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=ee5d95d2bbce99a527eadc58aa6df56d","title":"leicester city leeds united premier league live","story":"Patrick Bamford scored one and supplied the third as Leicester missed out on the chance to go second despite Harvey Barnes’ early goalBig day for Bamford. Big season for Bamford.Rick Harris is excited: “You can forget Villa putting 7 past Liverpool, Burnley beating Liverpool at Anfield, and United losing to the Blades – this has to be the shock of the season Leeds thrashing Leicester or should I say RAILROADED by El Loco.”Leicester will not go up to second. Leeds still in 12th but the top half is in reach. That was something of a mugging for Leicester. Leeds’ goals all came from forcing the ball from Leicester and then breaking at pace. Bamford’s goal and assist were outstanding. Leicester have collected one point from a possible six in the two games they have been without Vardy. 90+1 min: Liam Cooper almost made Perez’s day even worse with a clattering tackle but the Spanish striker gets up and keeps chasing. He’s worked hard, just not been Jamie Vardy. Three minutes were added on. 89 min: Ayoze Perez has not had a good game. Getting in the way of Evans for what might have been the equaliser was perhaps the worst moment of a series of misfires. 87 min: Leeds’ quality on the counter has done what Leicester did to them earlier in the season. Leicester pushed on for the equaliser and got caught out. Without Jamie Vardy they have lacked an attacking threat. Leeds score a superb goal on the counter. Justin is knocked over by Costa. Maddison whips in a free-kick. Leeds break and it goes all the way down the other end. Bamford charges on alone from his own half. Leicester have gambled and lost. Bamford steadies himself and plays in Harrison who plays it into an empty net. 82 min: Actually, it was Ricardo’s intervention that led to Struijk swinging at fresh air. Credit where it’s due. 81 min: Oof, Leeds close. This time it’s Leicester struggling at a set piece. The ball drops and Struijk is waiting, only to swing at fresh air. 80 min: Raphina is down with another of those muscle injuries. On comes Helder Costa for Leeds. Under is on for Fofana for Leicester. 78 min: Leicester pushing on for their equaliser. They had previously won every game they had been ahead in. 76 min: Evans gets a chance to make instant amends but Meslier manages to claim the ball after Fofana’s grubber of a shot. 75 min: Panic in the Leeds ranks at a set piece. Fafana’s shot deflected over. Then Maddison takes, Soyuncu heads down and Evans misses what looks an open goal. In mitigation, he’s put off by Perez having unsighted him.74 min: Klich is booked for a tackle that Mendy didn’t enjoy at all. 71 min: It looks like Leeds shifted their tactics there. They pushed up on Leicester when they had a throw and then worked it well with Raphina’s pearler of a pass. Leeds press the ball out from Leicester, great ball from Raphina, even better finish from Bamford with his left foot. Schmeichel had no chance. It dips over and Bielsa celebrates. Angrily. 68 min: Perez ploughing a lone furrow. He doesn’t have the speed of Vardy or the telepathic link with Barnes or Maddison. Vardy is distinctly better at unsettling opposition defenders too. 64 min: Leeds penned back, nowhere to go. Brendan will be enjoying out-tacticing El Loco, as he undoubtedly calls Bielsa, having read all those Jonathan Wilson books and that. 62 min: Tielemans has a dig from distance when a ball to Barnes might have been the more expedient option. 60 min: Justin Kavanagh now: “The Peacocks have been displaying their finery to good effect, but such fancydanery is always dangerous with the Foxes sniffing around. Speaking of nicknames, shouldn’t Leeds really update to “the Librarians,” what with all those man buns?”59 min: Paulo gets in touch: “I see Marc Albrighton is playing. Are there any other footballers who has a rival team’s name in their surname? Is there, somewhere, a Luke McBlackburn for example?”There was Gary Leeds, though he was actually a member of the Walker Brothers rather than a footballer. 58 min: Ricardo fancies a run, turns on himself and gets a shot in. Brendan’s tactical tweak has opened up space for Leicester and stopped Leeds swarming all over them. 56 min: Leicester going longer, and sitting off Leeds a little? Dallas is stuck like a limpet to Maddison, who has been negligible in this game. 55 min: Bielsa is doing a lot of shouting from his squat position. Looks like he left his bucket back at Thorp Arch. He will be stiff in the morning. 54 min: Leicester free-kick, from the right, but Maddison can only knock the ball off the head of Bamford. 53 min: Leicester pushing on harder this half. Meslier has to come out to stop Perez in his tracks. Ayling, bandaged up, comes back on. 51 min: Luke Ayling requires treatment on a head wound. His hair has come out of his top knot and that could be painful. 49 min: VAR alert. Cooper and Fafana in the Leeds box were all over each other. So no penalty for Leicester as they were both attempting to disrobe their opponent. Mike Dean, who is the virtual assistant robot today, says no. 48 min: Leicester fashion a chance. Tielemans plays in Justin but the wing-back - his new position this half - cannot direct the ball past Cooper, who comes across to block. 47 min: Brendan has gloves on. It must be cold. Did Bill Shankly or Jock Stein wear gloves? 46 min: A bit of in-game management there as they get back underway in the second half. A Leicester change: Soyuncu is on, and Albrighton is on, suggesting that Brendan is going to a back three to combat the Leeds wave of pressing, perhaps flood the midfield. Mary Waltz has been in touch. “Leeds is always on the razor’s edge of giving up multiple goals only to instantly flip to chances for their own scoring chances. Unpredictable yet so thrilling.”Agreed. There was a quick exchange of goals but Leeds will be happier. Leicester and particularly Maddison have struggled to cope with their opponents’ pressing. There’s been a couple of moments where Kasper Schmeichel has been called into action and been forced to make excellent saves. Harvey Barnes, the Leicester scorer, has been dangerous. 45+1 min: Three minutes added on to the half. 45 min: Tielemans makes a hell of a yowl when he is tackled in the corner. Alioski’s tackle goes unpunished and the Belgian is OK to continue. Perhaps the yelp got the endorphins flowing. 43 min: Leeds chaos, and the ball comes out to Albrighton who plays the ball into a position of maximum opportunity only for Meslier to claw the ball into his grasp. Perez was lurking. But he ain’t no Jamie Vardy. 42 min: Leeds corner conceded by James Justin. That’s unconvincing too from Leeds. 40 min: Maddison whips in a corner. It’s cleared but Evans, still up for Leicester, holds it up there. Maddison whacks the ball off the post but there had been an infringement. Leeds unconvincing at set pieces. 38 min: First booking, Ayling’s topknot slows his down as he chases after Justin and he is forced to do a bit of shirt pulling. 36 min: Leicester sub, on comes Pereira for Castagne, who has a groin problem, like Leeds’ Rodrigo. The heavy workload is taking its toll on players.

Liverpool begin the second half.Peep peep! No goals and not many chances. Liverpool have dominated possession, but West Ham have defened admirably. See you in 15 minutes for the second half.45+1 min Salah shoots straight at Fabianski from 20 yards.45 min: Chance for Liverpool! An ingenious pass from Thiago is poked just wide by Origi. Thiago cut infield from the left and waved a stunning angled pass behind Dawson towards Origi. Fabianski came out and Origi, who was ahead of the near post, could only stab it wide from six yards. It was a tricky chance because of the angle, and a quite outrageous pass from Thiago.43 min This is West Ham’s best spell of possession. 42 min Benrahma’s deep, dipping cross from the left is headed straight at Alisson by Antonio. It was a difficult chance as he was running backwards and the angle was fairly tight.41 min That header from Phillips probably saved a goal. None of the other Liverpool defenders ran back towards the ball, and Dawson was waiting behind him to score.39 min Thiago commits a needless foul on Benrahma on the right wing. Coufal’s excellent free-kick is headed away brilliantly by Phillips, who was facing his own goal but managed to twist his neck and get the ball away. It drops to Benrahma, whose volley from the edge of the D is blocked.38 min West Ham are working so hard defensively. For all their possession, Liverpool still haven’t had a shot on target.36 min “Shaqiri is a terrific attacking player but quick thinking in tight spaces is not necessarily his forte, is it?” says Phil Podolsky. “He was so much better at conducting counterattacks at Stoke than he is against the kind of defending Liverpool are up against.”35 min West Ham win a corner on the right. They are very good from set pieces, the best in the league this season, but they make a mess of this opportunity. Bowen works a short corner with Benrahma and then crosses straight into Alisson’s arms.33 min Liverpool continue to dominate possession - we haven’t seen a graphic but I’d imagine they’ve had around 65 per cent - without creating any clear chances. It’s unusual to see such sterile domination from a Jurgen Klopp team.30 min It’s not a classic.27 min Henderson’s long ball into the area finds Salah, who controls it with his shoulder. Cresswell pokes the ball away from him but only as far as Shaqiri, whose stinging shot hits Dawson and flies behind for a corner.24 min: Chance for West Ham! That was much better. Fornals played Cresswell in down the left, and he cut the ball back sharply to Benrahma at the near post. He took a touch and was about to shoot when Thiago poked the ball away from him. It came to Fornals, whose shot took a deflection off Milner and was headed off the line by Robertson. Alisson had that one covered I think. 23 min Thiago’s hanging cross is headed wide by Salah, 12 yards from goal. It was a difficult chance, with no pace on the ball for him to work with.22 min “I find Liverpool games tense at the best of times,” weeps Matt Dony. “Now, though, the eternal pessimist in me can’t help but analyse every single movement the defenders make, looking for any tiny sign of discomfort or potential problem. They’re one defensive injury away from me sending a CV to Klopp (CBRB, probably lacking a yard or two of pace). As many have commented over the last few weeks, thank goodness Henderson is such an intelligent footballer.”21 min West Ham have been quite poor in possession so far, sloppy and lacking in ideas. On the plus side, Lukasz Fabianski has had nothing to do in goal.19 min “Weird that Robertson is on corner duty and not the Swiss Charlie Adam,” weeps Niall Mullen. 17 min Alexander-Arnold’s free-kick is headed away as far as Thiago, who whistles a left-foot shot that is blocked by Antonio. I think it was going wide anyway. He then stops a possible West Ham break by handling the ball while on the floor. He’s a bit lucky not to be booked for that.16 min Thiago’s cross towards Origi is headed away well by Dawson. Liverpool are starting to turn the screw.14 min Liverpool win their first corner. Robertson’s outswinger is headed away at the near post by Coufal.12 min It’s all a bit cagey. You’re welcome!9 min Antonio beats Alexander-Arnold on the left and stands up a good cross towards Soucek at the near post. Henderson does well to get in front of him and head the ball away.8 min Wijnaldum shoots over from long range after nicking the ball off Soucek.7 min “What’s wrong with the excellent Mané?” says Ruth Purdue. “Also if Liverpool are drawing near the end of the match, (which I doubt) do you think they will pass it around slowly around at the back with little or no urgency like another team we know?”That’s a bit harsh on West Brom. Mane has a “minor muscle injury”, it says here. 5 min Liverpool are having most of the ball. Shaqiri plays a good pass down the inside-left channel to Origi, who ks a shot wide from a very tight angle. That was a poor decision, not least because he had Salah in the middle.3 min A slow start. Meanwhile, here’s more on Leeds’ thrilling victory at Leicester.2 min Liverpool have started with a diamond formation, not the usual 4-3-3. Shaqiri is playing behind Salah and Origi, and this is the revised team.1 min Peep peep! West Ham, in the usual claret and blue, kick off from left to right. Liverpool are in their black change strip.It’s a grim afternoon in east London, and a few of the players are wearing gloves as they stroll onto the field. It’s time for business.“Other things being equal,” begins Niall Mullen, “Liverpool’s first XI is Alisson, Trent, Van Dijk, Matip, Robertson, Henderson, Fabinho, ThiagoGini, Mané, Salah, Firmino. Do you reckon we will ever see them line up together?” Probably not. It’s surprising how infrequently famous XIs actually play together. Arsenal’s Invincible XI, for example, only started two or three league games.In the 2pm game, Leeds have come from behind to lead 3-1 at Leicester. If it stays like that, Liverpool will move above Leicester into third if they win today. Klopp out!West Ham are unchanged from the team that beat Crystal Palace in the week - not just the first XI, but the nine subs as well. Their new signing Jesse Lingard was not registered in time for this game.Liverpool make three changes from their win over Spurs: Nat Phillips replaces Joel Matip in defence, while Xherdan Shaqiri and Divock Origi come in for Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane. Firmino is on the bench Mane has a minor muscle injury.Hello and welcome to the latest chapter in Liverpool’s bizarro season. Thursday’s majestic victory at Spurs - a performance that was both familiar and unexpected - has re-energised their title challenge, although they need to keep winning just to stay in Manchester City’s slipstream.This season, Liverpool have generally been excellent in the big games and vulnerable against the weaker sides. I’m not sure which category West Ham fit into - they’re not in the Big Six but they are in the top six, and will go above Liverpool into fourth if they win today. Southampton and Aston Villa had good claims earlier in the season, but at the moment West Ham are the premier overachievers of 2020-21."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/603d35919212781446ba57a6e1ff650e336192bc/0_0_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3e8692a0b667717e2be326dd2941024","title":"caffeine dehydrates you and other common hydration myths busted","story":"We all know that a healthy intake of water is crucial for our health, but there is still a lack of clarity around how we give our body the fluid it needsLack of hydration is often the culprit when it comes to fine lines and dullness, as well as other skincare concerns. London-based dermatology registrar Dr Cristina Psomadakis says skin hydration is absolutely paramount to maintaining a healthy skin barrier and ensuring that skin cells shed at a normal pace. Adequate hydration is one of the key elements of a fresh-faced glow and minimises the appearance of cracks, flakes or wrinkles in the skin.This is true for all skin types and all skin tones, which is why hydration is so important. Oily skin and dry skin can both be dehydrated. Drier skin types are usually classified by having fewer oil-producing glands compared with oily or combination skin. However, dry skin can be thirsty with a lack of water as well as oil. By the same rule, oily skin types can also be dehydrated with a lack of water and not oil.But drinking eight glasses of water isn’t the only way to get hydrated. You should also aim to consume water through food too. Eating foods rich in water helps the body to absorb the water more slowly, which means the water we get from foods such as cucumbers, watermelon, bell peppers, strawberries, celery and iceberg lettuce keeps us hydrated as well as giving the body a boost of minerals, vitamins and fibre.There is also a myth that caffeine excessively dehydrates you. It is true that caffeine can act as a mild diuretic, but according to a study by the University of Birmingham, where 50 men habitually consumed three to six cups of coffee a day, there was no evidence to show that they were more dehydrated than those who drank water alone.But when it comes to drinking water, you can get too much of a good thing. Overhydration – or hyponatremia – is a condition where sodium and electrolyte levels can become dangerously low due to drinking too much water. This can cause headaches, nausea, muscle weakness and can even be fatal in extreme cases. So finding the right balance is key.Stress, pollution, blue light from devices, exposure to UV and a lack of sleep can all affect the skin and its ability to retain water and stay plump. Staying hydrated is great for the body and helps to regulate mood. As our brain is mostly made up of water, drinking the right amount of it helps keep headaches at bay. Water is also great for helping us stay more focused. But how can the skin also get a drink of water to help boost its function?Hyaluronic acid – due to the “acid” in its name – might sound a bit scary, but it’s known as a souped-up skincare wonder ingredient for its hydrating properties. ”Hyaluronic acid is a sugary substance that we make naturally in our body – it is found in the skin, eyes, joints, even the umbilical cord,” says Psomadakis. “Hyaluronic acid is classed as a humectant, which basically means it’s a hydration magnet – it helps draw moisture from the environment and surface of your skin.”Whether it’s upping your water intake by drinking it, consuming food with high water content, or slathering on great skincare to help boost hydration, water is definitely key for bouncy, radiant and plump skin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19b616cbd50e4d69d434649fd135693336e1ad19/0_20_1731_1039/master/1731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d8b6e0e39fbe0132fe230e98ab26292","title":"dry patches tightness and redness signs your skin is dehydrated and how to fix it","story":"Dehydration can leave your skin looking dull and lifeless – but luckily it’s totally fixable. Here’s expert advice on how to get glowing skin no matter what time of year it isWhen skin suddenly feels tight and looks dull, with fine lines and wrinkles more apparent than ever, it’s easy to panic. But, while it might be easy to assume that the stress of the past year has irredeemably accelerated the ageing process, it’s far more likely that such skin issues are simply down to dehydration. And while that’s not ideal, the good news is that it can be put right.Unlike dry skin, which tends to be a long-term issue caused by your skin not producing enough oil, dehydrated skin is down to lack of water and is usually temporary.“Skin hydration is absolutely paramount to maintaining a healthy skin barrier and ensuring that skin cells shed at a normal pace,” says Dr Cristina Psomadakis, a London-based dermatology registrar. “Adequate hydration is one of the key elements of a fresh-faced glow and minimises the appearances of cracks, flakes or wrinkles in the skin.” In other words, hydration is key to maintaining skin is in tiptop condition. So what causes dehydration in skin?We lose about half a litre of water through our skin on a daily basis. But that varies greatly with climate and exercise. And while it stands to reason that if you’re getting your sweat on, you’re losing water, cold weather – and the sort of lifestyle that goes with it – can be just as much of an issue as hot weather, when it comes to drying out your skin.“Cold weather, indoor heating and hot showers can all wreak havoc on our skin and cause it to lose moisture and become dry and flaky,” says Psomadakis.“It is really important to be proactive and try to protect our skin before it suffers from seasonal assaults. This usually means swapping to a richer moisturiser – or moisturising more frequently.”The top layer of the skin – known as the skin barrier – is the body’s defence against everything the outside world has to throw at it. It not only stops stuff getting in, but it’s also the layer responsible for protecting your skin and holding in moisture, and it has to put up with a lot of abuse in daily life.Stress, pollution, blue light from devices and infrared radiation can also compromise our skin barrier. When the barrier is damaged, the mechanisms that usually help keep skin hydrated and plump don’t work as effectively, resulting in dry patches, tightness, redness and dull skin tone.And it’s worth remembering that skin health doesn’t just work from the outside in. What you eat and drink can also have an impact – as you’ll know if you’ve ever felt desiccated after a big night out. Alcohol – and caffeine too – can take moisture out of your body, and that will show on your skin too.Psomadakis recommends swapping to a richer moisturiser (or using moisturiser more frequently), making sure to wear sunscreen even on cold days and limiting the amount of active or exfoliating ingredients and swapping them for gentler ones instead.Drinking a few more glasses of the stuff isn’t going to do anyone any harm, but there’s no guarantee that all of the H2O you drink is going to make it to your skin. So what’s the answer? Putting water on the skin doesn’t seem to make much sense, either, given how tight skin can feel without body lotion after even a lukewarm shower.Crucially, Vichy Minéral 89 pairs this mineral-rich water with hyaluronic acid, which is increasingly being viewed as the secret ingredient when it comes to radiant, hydrated skin.“Hyaluronic acid is a sugary substance that we make naturally in our body – it is found in the skin, eyes, joints, even the umbilical cord,” says Psomadakis. “As people grow older, they lose some of the hyaluronic acid found on the epidermis, the upper layer of our skin.”Hyaluronic acid, which is a very safe ingredient for all skin types, can be natural, or synthetic, and comes in different sizes. While smaller molecules with lower molecular weights can penetrate the skin, higher molecular weight hyaluronic acid is a larger molecule that sits on the surface drawing water to it, helping to smooth and plump the skin.The hyaluronic acid in Minéral 89 is of natural origin, and is a larger molecule, perfect for counteracting the sort of winter dehydration that your skin is likely to be suffering from. As such, Minéral 89 is the only serum to get the British Skin Foundation stamp of approval, which means the foundation has checked over its research and agrees that it stands up. No wonder beauty editor Funmi Fetto described the easy-to-use serum as being “like a glass of water for your skin”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94e5c5b14b518c644178e963b0bc9ff38ea3349c/0_0_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a498d586dc5ff29d892ecfdccfa63b34","title":"me and my water bottle my journey to drinking eight glasses a day","story":"Drinking the recommended amount may seem like an easy target, but many of us find ourselves consuming less water than we should. Writer Anna Fielding describes how she met her hydration goalsThis is by no means a heroic journey, I’m aware of that. Hydration shouldn’t be hard: eight glasses of water a day – sounds pretty simple, right? It comes out of the tap, ready to drink, right there in your kitchen. You don’t even have to leave the house for it.It should feel miraculous, if you think about it in a historical and global context – all this available water, but its abundance works against it. After all, when choosing what to drink, the taste of water doesn’t quite compare with the bite of a short, sharp coffee, or the sugary funk of pineapple juice.Don’t get me wrong, I’m not against water – that would be ridiculous, like being against land or air. I love to mix it with rose oil and bathe in it. I swim in it. I get mesmerised by fountains. I even enjoy drinking it most of the time.Water, when I have enough of it, makes me feel more fluid. My thoughts flow. My skin is plumped up and glows. My eyes are less tired. My online yoga class is easier and, without sounding like a yoghurt advert evangelist, digesting food is easier too. And this personal experience is backed up by medical advice: staying hydrated improves everything from concentration to kidney function. We’re better, all around, with water and we all know that.The problem I have is that I’m easily distracted, which leads to me not drinking enough water throughout the day. Every time I make the conscious effort to hydrate myself, something gets in the way. It might sound ridiculous to you, but it’s true. Even working from home, a measly 15 steps from the kitchen sink, I get caught up in something else – the news, social media, a message from a friend, something interesting on the radio. In non-Covid times, the distractions were even greater.So I finally made the decision that in order to drink more, I’d have to make a very conscious effort to make drinking a part of my daily routine. I started putting a pint glass on the kitchen counter before going to bed. In the morning, I fill it up and drink it while waiting for the kettle to boil. One pint down without even thinking about it – win! I also keep my water bottle in my bicycle basket now. Even if I’m not cycling, the size of my flat means my bike functions as a hallway table and the bottle sits by my keys, purse and gloves. It’s no longer a kitchen object, it’s a leaving-the-house object.There are times, however, when I still need more – and my skin is the first to tell me. As I get older, hangovers increasingly leave me looking like a dried apricot. Coming in from a cold, windy walk to the central heating pinches my face. Some years ago, I discovered hyaluronic acid. It’s a substance we produce in our bodies, found mostly in our skin, eyes and connective tissues, and its main function is to draw and hold water. It’s a key ingredient in Vichy’s Minéral 89 Serum and designed for daily use. But the Minéral 89 Serum also works wonders for when the skin needs an extra boost: when you’ve spent too long in the sun, or when you’re red-faced post-exercise. When my body needs more hydration than I’ve given it, this serum means that at least it won’t show on my skin.One of the main issues I have with drinking the recommended amount is the fact that I have been told so often to drink more water – usually by a strangely serene person on Instagram or a magazine page – and that it has turned into a chore. There’s something to be said about approaching water drinking in the same way as changing the duvet cover or filing a tax return: not bad once you start and you feel better when it’s done.Adding a mild element of fun to the equation can help too, as I’ve discovered. I now fill a blue glass jug to keep on my desk, with ice and some mint in the summer. For colder days, I fill an old teapot with herbal tea, or slices of ginger to flavour my water. We take our pleasures where we can these days, so using my grandmother’s china or the glass I bought in Venice does give a small lift and certainly makes me drink more.We all want easy fixes – and luckily they are available: apply the product, get the good china out, put things where you can see them, and marvel at how quickly you can drink it all in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/008fde4de742d95b8ac40136d6fa89751880d6a6/0_190_5123_3074/master/5123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0834da4def5a06979e43c4e93780c76","title":"prioritise beauty sleep five tips to help boost skin hydration","story":"Even mild dehydration can leave skin looking dry and lacklustre, energy levels depleted and our mood low. Luckily, it’s easy to boost your hydration levels with these quick fixesAlong with temperatures sneaking to frosty lows and an optimistic to-do list for the months ahead, January tends to arrive with a clutch of familiar niggles dull, dehydrated skin, sporadic breakouts and flaky patches, not to mention a general lethargy that can seep from the brain to the body. Sound familiar?But for a truly solid hydration routine, it’s important we don’t stop at the external. Water, after all, is crucial fuel for the whole body, not just a glowy complexion. Muscles can cramp up when we teeter towards dehydration – water keeps clicky knees at bay by ensuring joints stay lubricated and flexible, while the kidneys need plenty of it to remove toxins from our bodies.Optimum water levels also help our mental health studies show that even mild dehydration can dampen moods, increase irritability, make focusing on tasks far trickier, and leave our motivation for just about anything seriously flagging. So if your hydration routine is somewhat lacking, these easy tips can deliver the boost you need …Drink eight glasses of waterNothing beats getting your hydration straight from the source. Official advice recommends we drink six to eight glasses (around two litres) of water a day, sipping on small amounts often. You can take it one step further by opting for electrolyte-infused drinks such as coconut water or watermelon juice, which are natural sources of minerals including sodium, calcium, potassium and magnesium.Helping to regulate the fluid balance in your body, electrolytes are essential for sparking healthy cell function and are thought to help speed up recovery after exercising too, particularly if you’ve gone all-out during a sweaty session.Look to smart skincareJust as certain foods deliver key hydration from the inside, smart skincare powered by ingredients that draw in moisture and protect your skin’s natural moisture barrier can work wonders on the outside. “Skin hydration is absolutely paramount to maintaining a healthy skin barrier and ensuring that skin cells shed at a normal pace. Adequate hydration is one of the key elements of a fresh-faced glow and minimises the appearances of cracks, flakes or wrinkles in the skin,” says Psomadakis. “Key ingredients to look for are glycerin and hyaluronic acid.”Vichy Minéral 89 Hyaluronic Acid Hydration Booster, aptly described by beauty editor Funmi Fetto as “a glass of water for your skin”, combines both of these hydrators with the brand’s signature mineralising water to plump up tired skin and protect its barrier function.Calm your mindOur state of mind can have wide-reaching effects on the body, and during bouts of stress or anxiety our skin – the body’s largest organ – can bear the brunt of it. Hormones such as cortisol, which increase in the body when we’re stressed, can lead to inflammation, and flare conditions such as acne, eczema and psoriasis. They have also been shown to impair our skin barrier and increase transepidermal water loss (when moisture is lost through our skin). Daily mindfulness and meditation can help to break the cycle if you’re feeling overwhelmed. Try it with the meditation experts at Headspace, who are currently offering three months of free membership with every Vichy Minéral 89 purchase made on lookfantastic*. “With as little as three minutes practice a day, people can experience the benefits of science-backed meditation, helping the mind to be calmer, clearer, kinder, and more resilient,” says Eve Lewis, director of meditation at Headspace.Prioritise beauty sleepDuring sleep the body repairs itself and replenishes moisture levels in the skin. But studies show that about a third of us don’t get the recommended seven hours of sleep each night. “There is actually some scientific basis to the concept of beauty sleep,” says Psomadakis. “Sleep deprivation leads to increased production of stress hormones and decreased production of antioxidants. This imbalance impairs our skin’s natural defences against external aggressors. This can contribute to loss of hydration, also known as transepidermal water loss, making moisturising all the more essential.”Creating a relaxing bedtime routine can help your mind to switch off before sleep, making good quality rest easier to come by. Try avoiding electronic devices for an hour before bedtime, enjoy an evening meditation to clear your mind, or incorporate a few minutes of relaxing massage into your skincare routine with a hydrating serum to replenish tired skin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93e7b00fedd1eb076f3ddcc95e6dc16bbc3ad87f/0_0_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e99c20a8419cd94bf5956abf257ff6ef","title":"behind closed doors filipina workers trapped by the pandemic","story":"Journalist Corinne Redfern discusses the impact the pandemic has had on the Filipino women trapped overseas, including Mimi (not her real name) who works for a wealthy family in London for just £5 an hour. Mimi was asked to keep working through the first lockdown with the family coaching her on what to say if the police stopped her. In her spare time, Mimi helps other overseas workers escape situations where they are being abusedAnushka Asthana talks to the journalist Corinne Redfern from The Fuller Project about the impact the pandemic has had on the thousands of Filipino women who are stranded overseas. The Philippine government says that approximately one third of its 10 million citizens overseas are women working in “elementary” jobs – a term widely interpreted as referring to domestic workers who are paid low wages to clean homes, cook meals and care for wealthy families, often under horrendous conditions. Human Rights Watch has long described migrant domestic workers, thousands of miles away from home and hidden out of sight in strangers’ houses, as one of the world’s most vulnerable demographics.  The UK issues approximately 23,000 visas to foreign domestic workers every year, half of whom come from the Philippines, according to reports. In the first two months of the coronavirus outbreak, more than half of the Filipino migrant workers surveyed in the UK had lost their jobs, according to a report compiled in June by Dr Ella Parry-Davies and the Kanlungan Filipino Consortium – a London-based consortium of grassroots organisations advocating for Filipino migrants’ rights. Corinne tells Anushka about Mimi (not her real name), a Filipino woman who works for a wealthy family in London who pay her just £5 an hour and asked her to continue to work during the first lockdown, which was illegal.

I think it will very much be a case of Jos is No 1.“After getting dropped last time, you don’t really know if you’re gonna play again or get another chance to wear the shirt so I think I am approaching it more as I’ve got a potential chance to play more Tests for England and see where it goes.“I know the strength of competition with the keepers is so high, so there are going to be times I’m not playing. That’s something I have to accept and be at peace with. If I do get a chance at any stage just try to enjoy it and embrace it.” Jack Russell recently told the Cricketer magazine that Foakes is “the most naturally gifted wicketkeeper in the world” when stood up to the stumps but the man himself, while flattered by the praise from a former master, is not getting carried away.“I really struggle to see the positives or let those comments in. It’s just trying to not mess up basically, do the best job I can and put the work in.” Not that his batting is shabby either. Of all the England players to make their Test debut since Joe Root in 2012, only Haseeb Hameed (on the India tour in 2016) and Foakes average over 40. It begs the question as to whether a specialist batsman who started so brightly would have got longer, not that the man himself is looking into this.Foakes added: “I am a keeper and in terms of going down the route of a specialist batter, there are other guys ahead of me. It’s a case of when there is a keeping slot available.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a73cff2e9c7d2bc052e81f2215b1a755ef53dc1/0_1172_5906_3544/master/5906.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=020c83a236dde415b2d813d67c871baa","title":"bernie sanders mittens for sale meme jen ellis","story":"Jen Ellis, a Vermont elementary school teacher, joins forces with the Vermont Teddy Bear Company to meet demandThe teacher who created the recycled wool mittens that Bernie Sanders wore to the presidential inauguration and which triggered endless social media memes is now partnering with the Vermont Teddy Bear Company to meet soaring demand.Some of the proceeds will go to the Make-A-Wish Vermont charity.“I can’t be more thrilled, because I personally can’t make 18,000 pairs of mittens,” Jen Ellis said on Saturday, estimating how many people had contacted her. “Everybody will get their mittens – everybody.”Ellis, a Vermont elementary school teacher who has a side business making mittens out of recycled wool, gave Sanders a pair as a gift and he wore them to Joe Biden’s inauguration.His fashion and huddled, frozen appearance then sparked countless memes, as superimposed photos of the former presidential candidate taking a seat on the subway, the moon, the couch with the cast of Friends, and other creative locales became a social media sensation.It’s not clear when the first mittens will be available for purchase.

It revealed that out of 163,000 Israelis given both shots, only 31 were infected, compared with nearly 6,500 infections among a control group of unvaccinated people.Israel’s government has capitalised on its ability to run a rapid vaccination campaign, and analyse its impact on infections in real time, to persuade Pfizer to keep it steadily supplied with doses.Earlier this month, the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he had secured a commitment from the pharmaceutical company to bring forward deliveries in return for Israel providing “statistical data” – in effect making the country a mass test case to see how vaccines might halt the pandemic.The country hopes to have vaccinated all over-16s by the end of March, and possibly earlier. Experts have said, however, that data from Israel is preliminary and could be misleading. With its vast variables and constantly changing scenarios, an entire society cannot act as a petri dish for a vaccine trial, they say.“When you vaccinate nationwide, there’s lots of confounders,” said Eran Segal, a computational biologist at the Weizmann Institute. “This is not a trial. That’s the problem. We should be very cautious.”Israel is up against a debilitating third wave of infections, with a national lockdown unable to significantly push down death rates. The government blames high infection rates on the more transmissible British variant of the virus. There has also been local resentment towards certain sections of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community that have defied lockdown rules.Yoav Kisch, the deputy health minister, said on Sunday there would be “a few weeks’ delay” to a national plan to reopen the economy, previously envisioned for early February.Vaccine data could be influenced by both the lockdown, which may decrease infections, and the British variant, which likely has the opposite effect, in confusing and contrasting ways.Meanwhile, the first people to receive the vaccine mostly come from vulnerable populations, who may have been more likely to take precautions, which also could skew the data. Preliminary research might show different results at different times as the number of people being vaccinated is continually changing, and hospitalisation usually occurs days after infection.An intense global focus on signals from Israel has already led to controversy. Several million Palestinians living under Israeli occupation have not been vaccinated. On Sunday, Israel’s defence ministry said it had agreed to send 5,000 doses to immunise frontline Palestinian medical workers, a move that followed international pressure.Separately, earlier this month, the country’s “coronavirus tsar” raised concerns that one shot of the Pfizer vaccine might be less effective than originally thought. The comments made news in the UK, where the government faces concerns that a policy to delay administering their second doses could backfire. However, Israel’s health ministry later said the comments had been taken out of context.While acknowledging the limitations of data coming out of Israel, Segal does see possible hope in one potential indicator – the percentage of people over 60 who have become critically ill. As a fraction of the total population, that group, which has largely been vaccinated, is decreasing, a trend not seen during previous lockdowns when inoculations were unavailable.“There are definitely some positive indications,” he said. “We should begin to see numbers going down, both critically ill and infections. Definitely the critically ill.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a0a7d7c443305d59f273cd34982b6774b918e7a/0_63_1838_1102/master/1838.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e931e346a984b3ac247c16e15af90a6c","title":"just 12000 of 40m fund for displaced chagos islanders has been spent","story":"MP representing most of UK’s Chagossians says failure to use compensation money to help those facing hardship is outrageousLess than £12,000 of a £40m fund set up to compensate Chagos islanders who were forcibly evicted from their homeland by the British government has reached those living in the UK.The English council tasked with assessing how to allocate the money has abandoned the work, according to documents seen by the Observer, and returned funds to the Foreign Office.Thousands of Chagossians were forcibly removed from their home on the Indian Ocean archipelago by the British government in the 1960s. The government has since admitted their treatment was wrong and a matter of “deep regret” but continues to allow the largest island, Diego Garcia, to be used as a strategic US military airbase.On Thursday, the United Nations maritime court ruled that Britain had no sovereignty over the Chagos Islands, a judgment that will damage Britain’s international reputation if it refuses to comply.It criticised London for its failure to hand the territory back to Mauritius and follows the international court of justice announcement last year that the UK’s ongoing administration of the islands was “unlawful”.The limited Foreign Office funding used so far has been spent on interpretation services for Chagossians, many of whom depend on French creole translation, and modest support for community groups.Money was also spent on scoping visits to the islands by government officials, with several hundred thousand pounds used for “heritage trips”, granting Chagossians short stays on the islands, often to tend to relatives’ graves. Chagossian charity groups have, however, described this use of the support fund as “disingenuous”.The Conservative MP Henry Smith, whose constituency of Crawley in West Sussex is home to most of Britain’s 3,000-plus Chagossian population, said: “The £40m support fund was announced almost five years ago and it has been tortuous to extract money from it ever since.“While there’s some uncertainty among the Chagos community about engaging with the UK government over these funds, it’s outrageous that next to none of this funding has actually been utilised. The fact that this sort of funding hasn’t been deployed is another failure of Foreign Office promises over half a century to the Chagossian community.”Louis Amadis, whose mother was born in Diego Garcia, moved to the UK in 2004, and until the pandemic hit was working at the check-in desks in Gatwick airport. When the first round of furlough came to a close, he was made redundant and he had to give up his flat.Talking about the unspent support fund, Amadis said: “It’s really painful to be honest, knowing that we’re supposed to have this support, but we don’t have any of it, haven’t seen any of it.”Chagossian charities have been handing out crisis grants of £50 to families who are struggling to buy food or pay for funeral costs but have expressed frustration that the multi-million pound support fund is not being utilised.The vice-chair of the UK Chagos Support Association, Stefan Donnelly, said: “It seems ridiculous that we’re giving out such meagre amounts, raised from small inidual donations, when such a large fund committed to helping Chagossians is going unused.”In 2017, the Foreign Office signed a memorandum of understanding with Crawley borough council over work to assess where these funds would be best allocated. But the council abandoned the needs assessment the following year and returned almost £40,000, citing strains the research was putting on the council’s relationship with the community.A Foreign Office spokesman said: “In 2016, the UK announced an ambitious and significant package of support for the Chagossians.“We remain committed to working with the Chagossian community including through funding for visits to the Chagos Islands and language training.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e3e828dd51ff1b819505eaefd09b72f9fa023cf/0_229_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=dea7a38d41a6eac0aa52ea62f77ef54f","title":"the little island of procida prepares to shine as italys capital of culture","story":"The backdrop for the films Il Postino and The Talented Mr Ripley braces itself to balance tourism with traditionChurch bells chime and children play freely in the square named after the late actor Massimo Troisi. A restaurant serves fresh fish to the smattering of customers eating outside, and fishermen mend their nets. With clear blue skies, it seems like a typical afternoon in mid-summer.But this is late January in Corricella, a 17th-century port in Procida, and the scene pretty much sums up the pace of life on what is the smallest and least known island in the bay of Naples.Parts of Troisi’s 1994 Oscar-winning Il Postino were filmed in Corricella, and the area shot to fame again a few years later as the fictional village of Mongibello in The Talented Mr Ripley. Both films helped raise Procida’s profile, but not enough to keep the majority of visitors from overlooking it in favour of the glamorous Capri or Ischia, popular for its natural hot springs.Now the colourful Mediterranean island has been thrust back into the limelight after recently winning the coveted accolade of Italy’s Capital of Culture for 2022, fending off competition from nine other candidates. It is the first time that the title has ever been granted to an island.The prize was a moment of celebration among the island’s 10,000 inhabitants and gave a glimmer of hope for the future amid Italy’s ongoing struggles with the coronavirus pandemic. Giuseppe Conte, the country’s caretaker prime minister, said: “Let’s get ready to visit Procida,” while culture minister Dario Franceschini said the island “would accompany us in the year of rebirth”.But some residents, wary of the pre-Covid mass tourism that has blighted so many other cultural treasures in Italy, say a balance must be struck between developing the island and maintaining its cherished characteristics.“It’s a good thing for the island and important for the generation who will come after us,” said fisherman Francesco Scotto. “But we need to be cautious. Tourism is OK but if it becomes too frenetic, like Capri or Ischia, we risk losing our traditions.”Those centuries-old traditions are closely tied to the ocean. Scotto is among the many islanders who would be at sea for months on end, working in commercial shipping or, in more recent decades, in the cruise ship trade.“Whoever works at sea always has a desire to return to Procida,” said Scotto, who was born and raised on the island. “It is here we find tranquility.”Luigi Esposito, who runs a furniture restoration shop, said many seafarers have long resisted tourism. “They would come home and want peace, not to see crowds of people,” he said, while describing Procida as “a magnet you never want to leave”.“The community is close, like one family,” he added. “But Procida is also an island that needs to progress – with balance and care.”Raimondo Ambrosino, the mayor of Procida, said the island is ready for the challenge as leaders work up a rich calendar of events for 2022 that will draw on its history, art, music, food, architecture and natural beauty.Procida is just 4km-wide and made up of pastel-coloured houses, several beaches and narrow alleyways that wind through the main town. Overlooking Corricella harbour is the old walled town of Terra Murata, home to a disused prison that until 1988 hosted some of Italy’s most violent criminals. Guided tours of the prison began in 2016, and leaders are now trying to establish how to make best use of the vast building.Procida is also home to a maritime academy, attracting students from beyond the island.A key element of the island’s winning bid was its development of “slow tourism”, Ambrosino said.The island gets busy in the summer, especially with Neapolitans, but the visitor numbers have so far been sustainable. Ambrosino expects this to continue as foreign visitors return after the pandemic.“Procida is not an amusement park,” he said. “You won’t find nightclubs or big luxury hotels with spas. What you will find is a particular experience – people don’t come here to be entertained but to get to know the community and its traditions.”In Corricella, Giuseppina Nasti is clearing tables at La Locanda del Postino, a restaurant that in its previous life was the storage space used to create the bar and restaurant in Il Postino. Procida is part of the Campania region, which is currently under “yellow zone” Covid restrictions, allowing bars and restaurants to open until 6pm.“My dad travelled all over by sea and used to say that Procida was the most beautiful place in the world,” Nasti said. “When he retired, he didn’t want to leave again. Procida is much more authentic than Capri or Ischia.”Ambrosino doesn’t believe that Procida’s recent victory will diminish that authenticity.“There is a risk that the island could change, but it’s also true that for centuries it’s had a strong maritime identity … it’s difficult to imagine that this would suddenly be turned upside down by the fame,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Reductions \u0026lsquodo not negate the need for targeted\u0026rsquo action, says environmental bodiesUS president says climate crisis \u0026lsquoone of the most pressing threats of our time\u0026rsquo"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Government and its agencies finally taking threats of storms seriously"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4472384.1612107526!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no major reopening of economy likely after march 5th says taoiseach","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Micheál Martin said the priority was to reopen primary schools on a phased basis with special needs schools first. Photograph: Julien BehalThe hospitality sector will have to wait for an increased rollout of the Covid-19 vaccination programme before it can open, the Taoiseach has said.Micheál Martin said he did not “see major reopening of the economy on March 5th” – the date that Level 5 curbs are in place until – and that the Government would take a “cautious and conservative approach” to lifting restrictions.Stating that the hospitality sector’s reopening would be delayed until the inoculation programme was much further progressed, he added, “I’m not looking at the whole of hospitality – there can be different approaches”.But he said he believed “we will have a critical mass vaccinated by late summer”.“And I anticipate that as we move into quarter two and quarter three, the issue will become vaccine administration as opposed to a supply issue.”Speaking about the rollout of the vaccination programme in a wide-ranging interview on RTÉ’s This week programme, Mr Martin said, “we have to be careful about giving precision decisions” around vaccine dates because “it does depend on supply”.He said the Government had so far fulfilled the commitments they made to having nursing homes residents and staff vaccinated, bar those with Covid-19 outbreaks.They were moving to vaccinate those over 70, he said. The target date for completion of vaccination of that cohort was the end of March and Mr Martin said “we have a back-up plan” if the AstraZeneca supplies do not materialise, with other vaccines.“We’re getting increased volumes from Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna and the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine was expected in April,” he said. The Taoiseach said he was being straight with people. He could not give precise numbers given the volatility in supply. Ireland was down 300,000 doses that were expected from AstraZeneca, from 1.4 million to 1.1 million but he said “we may pick it up again”. “I do believe the rollout so far has been in line with commitments made”. He understood people’s impatience but said, “we don’t control the external environment around the manufacture of the vaccine”.He reiterated that the priority was to reopen primary schools on a phased basis with special needs schools first, and the construction sector, if virus cases get down below 1,000 daily.Mr Martin also said “there may be news this week” about options for the Leaving Certificate.The examination advisory committee had been meeting but they wanted to ensure that when an announcement is made that “all the Is are dotted and Ts crossed”.“I do get the point that Leaving Certificate students do not have classroom time – that is a very important consideration in terms of the options.”The Taoiseach said there were differing views from the wider student body but “what is clear that we do need to bring clarity and reduce stress”.He also said he did not anticipate a leadership contest within Fianna Fáil when the his term as taoiseach finishes at the end of 2022.Mr Martin also said he did not believe there would be a Border poll within the next five years and he deflected suggestions that he was softening the party’s opposition to coalition with Sinn Féin.Sinn Féin is a “party of ision” he said and wanted “to force a isive debate” in the State, adding that he was taken aback about “the degree to which they’re playing politics with Covid-19”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: Half a million people received a vaccine in England yesterday, new figures showCaptain Tom Moore in hospital with Covid-19Rusty pilots admit they are making mistakes because of a lack of flying timeComment: Social spontaneity has died under lockdown, and nowhere more so than at the pubComment: The EU\u0026#39s vaccine blunder has exposed major flaws in the Northern Ireland protocol Covid crisis to bring \u0026#39radical changes\u0026#39 to Church of England, report suggestsBritain opens visa scheme to Hongkongers fleeing oppression in ChinaComment: Celebrating more than three decades of helping victims get justiceCoronavirus returns to Australia as Perth enters five-day lockdownComment: Ursula von der Leyen\u0026#39s irresistible rise shows the democratic deficit at the heart of the EUFrance\u0026#39s \u0026#39HR killer\u0026#39 arrested and charged with two murdersBritain could share Covid vaccines with neighbours and developing countries, Liz Truss saysCarrie Symonds\u0026#39 first project in new role revealed - rewilding cheetahs to ZimbabweComment: Is nagging Keir Starmer really the man to save Labour?Comment: Elon Musk should be seen as a hero by all of us who want to keep the joy in drivingRussia engulfed by pro-Navalny protests despite 3,000 arrestsVideo: French police use water cannons, batons and tear gas on protestorsDonald Trump impeachment: when is the Senate trial and what are his chances of a comeback?Oregon set to decriminalise heroin and LSD as Joe Biden eyes opportunity of federal cannabis legislationComment: Welcoming Hong Kongers shows Global Britain is willing to do more than virtue signalComment: Keeping primary schools closed is asking children to pay too high a priceBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"calls ursula von de leyen resign tried ram irish border plan","story":"Motivated by her hatred of Brexit, Ursula von de Leyen overruled her top trade advisers with a plan for a new Irish border, The  has learnt.The European Commission president was warned that she would cause uproar but pressed on regardless as part of what one of her own employees called an increasingly vindictive attitude towards the UK Government.On Saturday, furious Brussels-based diplomats were piling pressure on the commission chief over her disastrous handling of the affair amid suggestions of waning confidence in her abilities.Her aborted decision to force through a border without even notifying either Ireland or the UK was considered highly damaging for the reputation of the Brussels executive, which had promised over years of Brexit negotiations that this was precisely what it was trying to avoid. She needs to go. Now, one diplomat told The . She told f------ no one, after four years of tedious skullduggery over the backstop.  Surely the commission could have thought of the optics?The Brussels regulator is quite successfully undermining its own credibility on the rule of law, the diplomat continued, saying: Do they really think this will improve their credibility as contract negotiator? It\u0027s not like you couldn\u0027t see this coming… Was there no one to protect her from going here? Everyone has just gone stark raving mad.The fiasco added to growing dissatisfaction with the commission\u0027s management of the vaccine rollout in a number of EU capitals, including Rome and Madrid. Pressure on Mrs von der Leyen was said to be huge and increasing.The commission\u0027s trade ministry or directorate-general, known as DG Trade, is headed by Sabine Weyand, who played a key role in the Brexit talks and the Irish backstop negotiations.Given that Ms Weyand is said to be perfectly aware of the Irish sensitivities, there was much head-scratching in Brussels when the border proposal was published on Friday, then hastily retracted amid condemnation from across the political spectrum in both Ireland and the UK.This was all about health, not trade, so there\u0027s no point blaming trade officials, said one EC insider. No one in DG Trade, including Weyand, liked it, but on the health side they were worried about vaccine leaking into the UK via Ireland.The commission is thought to have identified the Pfizer plant at Grange Castle, on the outskirts of Dublin, as a site for possible transshipment of vaccines into the UK. Pfizer\u0027s Covid vaccines are given quality control checks at both the Grange Castle site and the Puurs site in Belgium before being released to the market.Asked who in the EC was responsible for pushing the border proposal through, the source said: You know who is in charge of Covid policy at the moment. She is getting increasingly vindictive because of this Brexit thing.Mrs von der Leyen is said to have taken personal control of the commission\u0027s vaccine policy over the last two weeks. Her spokesman, Eric Mamer, said: We never comment on internal drafting and decision-making processes in the commission.While the border proposal has now been dropped, the threat of EU vaccine export controls (referred to by the EC as export licences) remains.Acting on the EC\u0027s request, Belgian health authorities last week raided the Seneffe plant in Wallonia to ensure vaccines had not been been shipped to the UK. The plant, part of the AstraZeneca supply chain though not owned by the Anglo-Swedish company, produces vector, a substance that facilitates the vaccine\u0027s circulation in the body.The AstraZeneca shortfalls that have angered the EU are due to slower than expected vector production at Seneffe rather than any sneaky UK shipments, Belgian media has reported since the raid.Also at the EU\u0027s behest, the Belgian health ministry was this weekend drawing up plans for enforcing the export ban across the pharmaceutical sector, one of the largest in the EU. There is, however, resistance within the industry itself, which fears tit-for-tat protectionist measures that could backfire.We understand the frustration caused by recent reports of reductions in the supply of Covid-19 vaccines to the European Union, Caroline Ven, the chief executive of Pharma.be, Belgium’s industry body, told Belgian newspaper De Tijd.But the production of billions of doses for the world\u0027s population remains an unprecedented challenge. We are working around the clock to refine that process. It is therefore vital that the proposed measures do not adversely affect the export of vaccines or the import of important resources necessary for vaccine production.It came as the German media rounded on Mrs von der Leyen, accusing her of shifting the blame for the continent\u0027s vaccine fiasco onto the pharma companies.Most of Germany\u0027s major media houses lined up to fire shots at Ms von der Leyen, a member of Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats, who was promoted from a position as the German defence minister to run the commission in 2019.She is accused of failing to obtain cast iron guarantees from the pharma concern AstraZeneca on a delivery schedule for its vaccine. The British-Swedish company has argued that the contract, which was signed in the summer, only commits the company to best efforts to deliver 100 million does of the vaccine in the first quarter of 2021.But Mrs von der Leyen took the German airwaves on Friday to claim that the contract was crystal clear on the obligations AstraZeneca had made to stick to a delivery time-frame.After a redacted version of the contract, which referenced best efforts on the part of AstraZeneca, was published by the commission later on Friday, some media outlets turned on her.She either told an intentional lie to the 447 million citizens of Europe or she didn\u0027t know what was in her own contract, wrote national daily Bild in an editorial. The tabloid said Ms von der Leyen was a failure as defence minister and now bore the blame for the vaccine fiasco due to the fact that she took over everything in Brussels.Ms von de Leyen, 62, was dogged by controversy during six years running the German defence ministry. She became entangled in allegations of irregular hiring of outside contractors to the tune of hundreds of millions of euros.When she announced this week that the pharmaceutical companies bore responsibility for the vaccine disaster, there are those in the defence ministry who likely felt a sense of déjà vu, Spiegel magazine commented.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dinosaur footprint found four year old girl welsh beach hailed","story":"A dinosaur footprint found by four-year-old girl on a Welsh beach has been hailed as the “finest found in a decade” by experts.Her mother said that after making the find, she uploaded a picture to Facebook and was shocked to receive a “huge response” from fossil hunters.Mrs Wilder then contacted National Museum Wales, who advised her to take down the post to avoid a \u0027stampede\u0027 of fossil fans descending on the protected section of land.The 110-mm trace fossil has now been legally removed, after permission was granted by the landowners and Natural Resources Wales, and is currently in safe-keeping.Palaeontology Curator of National Museum Wales, Cindy Howells, who arranged for the legal removal of the footprint, said: “This is a spectacular discovery.“It’s the best-preserved trace fossil that’s ever been found in South Wales – normally they’re hollow or less well defined, but on this one you can see the claws and the points at the end.Karl-James Langford, of Archaeology Cymru said: “It’s so perfect and absolutely pristine, it’s a wonderful piece.”“I would say it’s internationally important and that is why the museum took it straight away.

Yet, even then political rallies in Vladimir were much smaller.“I don’t remember this size of protests here in my lifetime,” Mr Kosygin, 37, told the  in his office in a snow-covered street, dotted with two-storey wooden cottages.“Maybe there was something like this in the 1990s, but I was too young.”It all began with a near-fatal poisoning of Mr Navalny, the Kremlin’s most formidable critic, who fell into a coma last August before recovering weeks later.He accused the Kremlin of trying to kill him and embarrassed Russia’s intelligence agencies even further by prank-calling one of the FSB agents suspected to be behind the attack and getting him to confess.Defying the Kremlin’s threats of prosecution, the 44-year-old anti-corruption crusader flew back home on January 17th for the first time since he was airlifted to Germany. He was detained passport control and arrested for 30 days for allegedly violating the terms of his suspended sentence that ran out a month earlier.Public anger was also whipped by Mr Navalny’s latest investigation about President Putin’s alleged palace that got more than 100 million views on YouTube since it came out the day after Mr Navalny’s arrest.Authorities have warned protesters across the country against what they called illegal gatherings, threatening with arrests.That did not stop Vladimir Usachev, a soft-spoken businessman from Vladimir who said he was inspired by Mr Navalny’s daring return to a certain incarceration, from joining the rally last Saturday .“It was a very brave thing to do,” he said of Mr Navalny’s return to Russia.“I would have felt ashamed staying at home after he did that thing.”The protest crowd, chanting “Putin is a thief,” rallied on the main square by the grey modernist cube of the local theatre and marched up the main street past Vladimir’s 12th century Golden Gate before the police moved in and arrested several dozen, including Mr Usachev.The 45-year-old, who recently shut down his furniture store after nearly 15 years due to a steady decline in his clients’ disposable incomes, spent 48 hours in custody before he was released and fined 15,000 rubles (£145) for taking part in an unauthorised protest.Mr Usachev bonded with some of his fellow cellmates who, for the most part, were first-time protesters with university degrees and good jobs.Over a pizza to talk about plans for the next rally on Sunday, the three men said that they all had been patient for too long, waiting for the Kremlin to deliver.The zeal to protest is still there, but one of the men, Vasily Grauer, a 38-year-old engineer, is ambivalent after being told by his boss that he would risk losing his job if he were caught by the police at an opposition rally again.“People are scared of losing the little that they have: People at work came by and shook my hand after the protest. Many say they would have come out too but they were too scared,” Mr Grauer, who works in a private water purification company, said.“We all want to be seen and heard and included in the decision-making.”Russian authorities earlier this week double-downed on their crackdown on the opposition, placing four prominent activists including Mr Navalny’s close ally and his brother, under house arrest and searching a dozen homes in a broad criminal probe into violations of coronavirus restrictions.The opposition raised the stakes earlier this week by announcing the Sunday rally on Lubyanka Square near the headquarters of the FSB intelligence agency.The Moscow City Hall responded by ordering to shut down eight underground stations, ert a dozen buses and close off several central streets on Sunday in a security lockdown not seen since civil disturbances in the Russian capital in 1993.Back in Vladimir, Mr Yevseyev, the retired officer who now works in banking, took the next week off at work so that he would not worry about getting arrested again.“Of course, I’m going to go out.

At 60 per cent efficacy, daily deaths would approach 1,500.While the novel vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 offer a potential exit strategy for this outbreak, this is highly contingent on the infection-blocking (or transmission-blocking) action of the vaccine and the population uptake, both of which need to be carefully monitored as vaccine programmes are rolled out in the UK and other countries, the authors say.Dr Sam Moore, a post-doctoral research associate at Warwick and one of the authors, said a number of non-obvious factors were driving the numbers.He said that because the natural \u0027R\u0027 rate of the virus was so high – above three – even vaccines that provided very high infection blocking would struggle to get the \u0027R\u0027 number below one in the absence of continued social distancing measures.There is definitely a sort of threshold, he said. If we get very high infection blocking then this could almost be what delivers us from it, but it would have to be very high. Even vaccines with 85 per cent infection blocking are insufficient to drive \u0027R\u0027 below one on their own.Unless \u0027R\u0027 falls below one, the incidence of the virus continues to grow exponentially.The number of people who remain vulnerable to disease will also remain high for much longer than might be immediately obvious, said Dr Moore. The efficiency of the vaccines in preventing severe disease, the time between doses and overall vaccine uptake all add up.The vaccines are not going be 100 per cent effective at stopping serious disease. So if you manage to get, say, 85 per cent of people to take it and it turns out to be 90 per cent effective, that\u0027s still 25 per cent of people who could die from it, which is a lot of people, he said.Nadhim Zahawi, the vaccines minister, said he had not read the Warwick paper but was aware of the issue. Ministers had prioritised work through Public Health England to understand the impact vaccines would have on transmission, he added.We\u0027re probably another four weeks away from getting some of that data back but it should be able to then allow us to make plans… we\u0027ll be able to see the impact of vaccines on transmission and also on hospitalisation and serious infection, Mr Zahawi said.The Warwick paper models different scenarios for unwinding social distancing. Which one is ultimately chosen by ministers will hinge on the efficacy of the vaccines in preventing transmission, something likely to differ between products.If the vaccines provide an average 60 per cent block on transmission, which experts hope, then ending lockdown at the end of May and reverting to the social distancing measures that were in place in early September produces the fewest deaths in the Warwick model.However, those restrictions – which included a prohibition on large events – would have to be maintained until the end of the year.A Government spokesman said: At this early stage in the vaccination programme, scientists do not have sufficient data to advise how the vaccine may affect onward transmission.  As large numbers of people from at risk groups are vaccinated, we will be able to gather the evidence to asses the impact on infection rates, hospitalisation and reduced deaths. It\u0027s important to continue following the national restrictions, instructions from NHS Test and Trace and to self-isolate if you are instructed to do so, even if you have had the vaccine.Read more: Why we must not pin all our hopes on Covid vaccines aloneMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pressure mounts von der leyen shortcomings brutally exposed","story":"Ursula von der Leyen was sitting in her converted flat next to her office in the EU\u0027s palatial HQ in Berlaymont when the phone started ringing.It was Friday evening, around 9.20pm, and on the line was the British Prime Minister.Boris Johnson was demanding to know why the EU had invoked Article 19 of the Northern Ireland Brexit protocol, effectively blocking imports of Covid vaccines through the Irish Republic to the UK.At 9.50pm - about half an hour after the call had concluded - Number 10 issued a damning account of that call, saying that the PM expressed his grave concerns about the potential impact which the steps the EU has taken today on vaccine exports could have.An hour after their call - around 10.30pm London time - Mrs Von der Leyen called back making clear to Mr Johnson that the EU would not disrupt vaccine supplies into the UK.Number 10 stressed there were no raised voices on the calls, but it was a torrid end to what had been a dreadful few days for the EU - days had seen the Commission accused of trying to bully the UK and drugs companies into giving up Britain’s share of precious vaccines.Mr Johnson and his team in London had caught wind of the Commission\u0027s plans earlier last week, but chose to adopt a low key approach, arranging for a call between Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, and his counterpart in Brussels on Wednesday.By Friday morning the talks had gone up a notch and the emerging crisis was discussed at the Prime Minister\u0027s 8.30am meeting in Number 10.Although officials had been gaming what the Commission might do and how the UK would respond the response from the Commission to invoke Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol still came as a shock.Following a meeting between Mr Johnson and his senior officials Number 10 made public the concerns in London, saying they did not expect the EU - a “friend and ally” - would do “anything to disrupt the fulfilment of these contracts.Mr Johnson decided to call Micheal Martin, the Irish Prime Minister, to discuss the Commission\u0027s actions. Again concerns about peace in Northern Ireland were raised and the PM stressed the UK’s enduring commitment to the BelfastGood Friday agreement.Mr Johnson then phoned Mrs von der Leyen.By now the warnings about threats to the Good Friday Agreement had been heard in Washington DC, where sources said the White House was urgently trying to clarify what the move would mean.In the face of such raw anger and growing international concern, Brussels backed down.Just before midnight UK time on Friday Ms Von der Leyen posted a message on Twitter saying she agreed with Mr Johnson not to add restrictions to vaccine exports.It was a week that began very differently. Brussels had been determined to force AstraZeneca to its knees. It ended, however, with the European Union humiliated.Mrs von der Leyen was facing calls to resign on Saturday, and fierce criticism in her home country of Germany.It was after all the Commission President who, having taken personal charge of the AstraZeneca issue, and was now seen to have badly botched the response to the pharmaceutical company’s failure to fulfil EU orders of jabs.By moving to impose a “vaccine border” on the island of Ireland she was seen as having trashed the bloc’s reputation worldwide and sacrificed the moral high ground the Commission had taken over the Irish border during the Brexit negotiations.Her decision to trigger Article 16 of the Brexit treaty’s Northern Irish protocol, achieved the once unimaginable feat of uniting an unimpressed Michel Barnier, Irish prime minister Micheál Martin and Boris Johnson against her.Mrs von der Leyen may have ordered a U-turn late on Friday and blamed the crisis on “an oversight”, but the damage was done.It should have been very different. Brussels had planned for the first AstraZeneca jabs to be rolled out across the bloc once the European Medicines Agency approved the vaccine on Friday.The European Commission, which negotiated the supplies on behalf of the 27 member states, would use the delivery as a symbol of the benefits of EU unity.The inconvenient fact that the EU’s vaccination roll-out was lagging far behind Brexit Britain would soon be forgotten in a flood of up to 400 million jabs enough to vaccinate about half of all EU citizens.The day couldn’t come soon enough for the EU’s heads of state and government, who had decided not to use the emergency authorisation procedures Britain used to fast-track the approval of the AstraZeneca vaccine.Commissioners in Brussels sneered that this was a safer, more responsible route than that taken by Boris Johnson.Many EU governments had chosen not to buy doses of rival vaccines, preferring to wait for the cheaper and easier to store jab from the British-Swedish company.The slower pace was, however, exacting a political price on the bloc’s national leaders.Polls in France showed Marine Le Pen trailing Emmanuel Macron by just 48 to 52 in second round voting intentions for next year’s presidential elections.While the UK has distributed 11.86 jab doses per 100 people, France, where anti-vax beliefs have taken root, has only managed 2.08.European newspapers were reporting that Mr Johnson’s vaccine gamble had paid off, which they said was a source of great frustration to the French.Perhaps that is what motivated Mr Macron to trash the AstraZeneca vaccine, saying it was almost ineffective for those over 65, and some say over 60.The cynical ploy came on Friday, the same day that the European Medicines Authority approved the vaccine for all ages, despite an earlier decision by German regulators to restrict it to the over 65s.The German government was also facing questions about why it was lagging so far behind the UK, US and Israel.The strain was showing elsewhere in Europe as well. The normally docile Dutch erupted into days of rioting, their worst in 40 years.The Italian government was tearing itself apart over the handling of the second coronavirus wave. On Tuesday, Italy’s prime minister Giuseppe Conte resigned as his coalition government collapsed.The pressure was on the European Commission to deliver, which explains the furious reaction after AstraZeneca broke the news that there would be a shortfall in the supply.The company would only be able to deliver a quarter of the jabs promised in the first quarter of the year, it said. There would be about 75 million vaccines missing because of production problems at its Belgian plant.Mrs von der Leyen was determined that the member states would not point the finger of blame for the delays at her commission and so the decision was made to launch a full frontal, and unprecedented, attack on AstraZeneca.Suspicions grew in Brussels that AstraZeneca may have sold reserved EU vaccine stock to countries such as Britain, which they claimed had paid a higher price for the jab.Despite the fact that AstraZeneca was providing the vaccine at cost price, the story was given legs by the Brussels spin machine. Their message was clear this was not our fault.Diplomats from the EU’s capitals in the Belgian capital began circulating news stories from last year, when the UK signed a deal with AstraZeneca first.AstraZeneca had imported millions of vaccines from its EU plants to compensate for a delay in production of UK supplies of the jab. Perhaps these were jabs meant for the bloc, the anonymous briefers suggested.The commission, which prides itself on its legal expertise and respect for the rule of law,  turned the screws on AstraZeneca, accusing it of breaching its contract with Brussels.Mrs von der Leyen gave Pascal Soriot, the CEO of AstraZeneca, a dressing down in a morning phone call. It was the first of three grillings for the boss, who was summoned to further two video conference meetings with the EU and national officials later that day.Then Stella Kyriakides, the European commissioner for health and food safety, dropped a bombshell. Brussels would introduce an “export transparency mechanism” by the end of the week, Ms Kyriakides said.  Cyprus’s EU commissioner said that manufacturers in the EU would have to ask Brussels for permission before exporting vaccines out of the bloc.The threat of an EU export ban was clear. Britain, less than a month out of the Brexit transition period and expecting almost 3.5 million vaccines from Pfizer’s Belgian plant, was in the firing line.It was the first of many signals that, as far as the commission was concerned, British public opinion of Brussels simply no longer mattered.On Tuesday, AstraZeneca’s CEO hit back. There was no contractual obligation to supply the vaccines beyond an obligation on the company to make “best reasonable efforts” to provide it, he said.The company’s two production plants in Britain could help with the EU supply but, under the terms of the supply contract with the UK, only after a British order of 100 million jabs had been supplied.An infuriated Brussels hit back hard on Wednesday. It demanded that AstraZeneca ert supplies of millions of UK-manufactured vaccines to the bloc and accused Mr Soriot of breaching confidentiality by revealing details of the contract.Ms Kyriakides said the firm had contractual, societal and moral obligations to use all its facilities to make up the shortfall, and that there was no hierarchy of factories.MEPs began to talk of a vaccine trade war unless the pharma company caved to the demands. Meanwhile Mr Johnson was looking like the only adult in the room.On Thursday, Belgian authorities, acting on a European Commission request, raided AstraZeneca’s plant in the French-speaking region in Wallonia.The reason was to see if the company’s explanation of production problems was genuine but another motivation was to keep the pressure on the company.Having secured AstraZeneca’s permission to release a redacted version of its contract with the EU, Mrs von der Leyen had a salvo planned for Friday.After the contract was released, the commission pointed to clauses it claimed supported its arguments.In one, AstraZeneca appeared to confirm that no other agreement would interfere with its supplies. Another clause said that, for the purposes of the deal, the two UK factories should be considered part of the EU.But eyebrows were raised as Mrs von der Leyen had, that very day, said there were no “best endeavours” clauses in the contract. The published deal, which in another sign the wheels were coming off, was accidentally released unredacted. It had those clauses.She either told an intentional lie to 447 million people or she didn\u0027t know what was in her own contract, Germany’s Bild Zeitung said on Saturday.As EU officials demanded Britain publish its contract with the pharma company, there was growing disquiet among some member states the commission was going too far.But despite the warnings of her own trade experts over the triggering of Article 16, Mrs von der Leyen was set on imposing the hard vaccine border on the island of Ireland.Among the voices arguing against the move was Sabine Weyand, the EU’s top official on trade and former deputy Brexit negotiator. She was the woman who designed the Irish border backstop during the Brexit talks, which was ultimately ditched in favour of a regulatory and customs border in the Irish Sea.In an astonishing gaffe, Mrs von der Leyen only informed Ireland she was triggering one of the most sensitive clauses in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement after the announcement.She also did not give notice to Britain about the move, which was meant to prevent Northern Ireland becoming a backdoor entry of vaccine supplies to the UK.Considering that the European Commission had spent the previous four years preaching the importance of open borders and peace on the island of Ireland, as well as criticising any suggestion from Britain of using the clause, it was an astonishing move.It wasn’t long before both the Irish and British prime ministers were on the phone to Mrs von der Leyen, both urging a change of tack.So it was that at 11.45pm local time, about eight hours after the announcement, a statement was released saying that Article 16 , the so-called safeguard clause, would not be triggered after all.What Mrs von der Leyen planned as a show of strength and a reassertion of control had demonstrated anything but.The European press was unforgiving, describing it as the “Brexit own goal” and potentially Mrs von der Leyen’s greatest failure.As one EU diplomat told the : “The pressure on von der Leyen is huge and increasing. This is not a good look.”The question for Britain this weekend is how will Mr Johnson use the moral high ground he has gained in the row over vaccine supplies, perhaps to improve Brexit relations with Brussels?One Government source said: There is a window of opportunity and we want to work together, we want things to get better.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sunday telegraph reader discovers treasured charles dickens","story":"Peter Lawson did a double-take when he read a Sunday  report on the unmasking of a Charles Dickens letter as a forgery earlier this month.The retired lawyer realised the letter looked suspiciously similar to one that he has treasured over some 25 years. He contacted the expert in that report and was dismayed to hear the verdict: his own letter is also a forgery by the same forger.“I thought mine was genuine,” Mr Lawson said. “It is painful. It isn’t the money because it cost me, I think, £1,400 and I’ve had a lot of pleasure out of it. But, by the same token, if it was genuine and it was worth £10,000, well, it would be very nice, wouldn’t it?”The Sunday  reported on January 10 that Dr Leon Litvack, an expert analyst of Dickens\u0027s letters, manuscripts and handwriting, had dismissed a two-page letter offered by the Ideal World TV website for almost £10,000 as “definitely not Dickens’s handwriting or prose style”.Mr Lawson, 79, from The Fylde, near Blackpool, is a retired solicitor, specialising in crime. As an avid reader of Dickens, he had been tempted to buy a two-page letter offered by Gorringe’s, an auction-house in Lewes, Sussex.He said: “When I started bidding, it was only on a whim that it would be quite nice to have a Dickens letter. When the estimate was £400, I thought… I might get it for £250. In the heat of the moment, I eventually paid £1,400, I think, which wasn’t going to break the bank.”After the sale, though, the auctioneer informed him that they had received a “mysterious” letter saying it was a forgery, prompting Mr Lawson to research the letter and its previous owner, the daughter of a former editor of a Brighton newspaper who had found it in his desk.Mr Lawson recalled: “I did phone her. She was a nice elderly lady and I couldn’t imagine her being part and parcel of a fraudulent forging ring.”He added: “She said her father was the editor of the paper. I checked that he was… He was a Justice of the Peace and… all sorts of things that were very respectable and I had no doubt that it was genuine.”He framed the letter, hanging it in his study. After retiring, he gave talks on cruise-ships, including on this letter, presenting the case for whether it was genuine.Like the Ideal World letter, this one suggests that it was addressed to William Henry Wills, Dickens’s close friend and sub-editor, and features a letter-head of an engraved view of Brighton. Apparently sent from a hotel, in this case the Bedford in Brighton, they both refer to Gad’s Hill Place, Dickens’s country home near Rochester, Kent.The earlier example, less easy to decipher, is dated 8 June 1868 or 1869, long after Dickens had written Oliver Twist and A Christmas Carol, among other masterpieces.This one is dated 8 June 1869. It suggests that Dickens took a cruise on a vessel called the “Skylark”, under the command of a Captain Collins.With barely any punctuation, it reads: “I am not returning to Gads Hill for another week, as the weather conditions here are so encouraging… I had a most amusing conversation with our friend that Capt Collins… he persuaded me to take a trip in his famous Skylark and it was a lark.”Dr Litvack said: “Dickens did occasionally stay at the Bedford in Brighton from 1845 onward, but clearly not on 8 June 1869, the date on which the letter was written. His last documented visit to the hotel was on 8 November 1861… Dickens never knew a Captain Collins and never mentions either him or the vessel Skylark in his letters. He could not have been staying in Brighton on 8 June 1869. In a letter of 1 June…he says that his American friends… are coming to Gad’s Hill on 2 June and staying for a week.”He added: “When Dickens dated letters on the 8th of the month he always wrote ‘Eighth\u0027 rather than ‘eight\u0027, as here.He also questioned the absence of punctuation: “Dickens was very particular – even idiosyncratic – about punctuation. In the body of this letter there are no full stops, commas, or semicolons – all of which would be expected in a genuine Dickens letter…“In the last line, the incorrectly spelled word ‘definately’ occurs Dickens never spelled the word incorrectly or idiosyncratically as ‘definately’.”Mr Lawson might well ask for a refund from the auctioneer, although he is still not completely convinced that his letter is a forgery. In the meantime, he will continue to hang it: “It’s still a talking-point, even if it’s wrong.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nagging keir starmer really man save labour","story":"Sir Keir Starmer makes me recall a story boys at my comp used to tell about the mythical Fake Kissing James Bond that there was actually a man who was paid for the arduous task of snogging the Bond girls to make sure the lighting was right, ConneryMoore being too special to hang about for hours.

On the contrary, with his clean-cut good looks (taking into consideration the old saw about politics being show-business for ugly people) and his transparently happy private life, he appears to be that exotic beast the politician who sees his family as something to cherish rather than an alibi he wants to spend more time with after he gets caught doing dirty deeds between ision bells.It was his commitment to family that gave him perhaps the brightest spell he has enjoyed in this pandemic when, a few weeks ago, he struck upon the idea of building his pitch to voters around the importance of family values. As he wrote for the : The importance of family hasn’t been talked about enough during this crisis. In the last decade – and during this pandemic in particular – families have too often been let down or forgotten.

It is the strength of the people we care about the most that has helped many of us cope during this dark and difficult period … under my leadership, Labour will be the party of the family.It was never going to be easy being leader of the opposition during the pandemic criticising the Government at a time like this can easily make one look a rotter, and the fact that Boris Johnson has become a ghost of his former self, knocked from pillar to post by teeming hospitals and a teething baby, makes criticism look suspiciously like kicking a man when he’s down. Thus Sir Keir has generally relied on the more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger angle, like one of those teachers who aren’t cross, just disappointed. The downside to this is that he has only one note whether he\u0027s attacking Boris or applauding Captain Tom, it\u0027s always that same reedy nag.The reasons the polls are only slightly going Starmer’s way is that people are already tiring of his routine of calling for things the Government is going to try anyway opportunity can look like opportunism held a beat too long. Tread water in the shallow end and you won’t offend – but you won’t inspire loyalty either.Goodness knows I’ve voted for some useless Labour leaders over the years, from Kinnock to Miliband, in more general elections than I care to remember. Brought up in a Communist household, I voted Tory for the first time at the last election only to get Brexit – and now we’ve got it, in theory I should be trotting back to the fold. But with Sir Keir there, I find that I just can’t.In recent years the Tories have understandably not wanted to draw attention to the fact that they like the family so much that many of their MPs have at least two, while the much-married Corbyn would have found the espousal of Family Values (which, to be fair, does sound like a low-priced supermarket) a bit bourgeois for his taste. Sir Keir, however, with his domestic copybook utterly un-blotted, was well placed to use the F-word to good effect.To the lost Labour heartlands of the Red Wall, where votes were lost because the People\u0027s Party was perceived as caring more about Gaza than Grimsby, this sort of thing is exactly what plays well. But, predictably, the Woke wing have reacted with surly incomprehension. Fresh from the Biden victory by proxy, our Wokers don’t see why they should have to care about the sort of things that most voters do. A case in point can be found in the party\u0027s attitude to all-women shortlists. According to Labour\u0027s website, the Labour Party’s All Women Shortlists are open to all women, including self-identifying trans women. Similarly, women’s officers and minimum quotas for women in the Labour Party are open to all women, including self-identifying trans women. The continuing prevalence of these woke ideas, squeezing out anything sensible suggested by Sir Keir, anathema to many of Labour\u0027s old supporters including myself. The thought remains that Starmer is simply standing in while Labour gets the lighting right, waiting for the real thing to step up and seal it with a kiss – albeit a Judas one and not the Fake James Bond kind.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"national trusts scheme children educated workers colonial history","story":"The Trust arranged for staff and volunteers to be told about the impact of the British empire by so-called child advisory boards at a number of selected properties.

I started pressing him to rest but his workload was increasing again, with the Prime Minister keen to launch new thinking on how the government could help the lives of the poorest and saying that, if he managed to negotiate a new settlement for Britain in the run-up to the European Council in mid-February 2016, he would call the in-out referendum that he’d promised in his manifesto. In anticipation, one Remain and two Leave campaign teams had already been set up, with Vote Leave activists disrupting the Prime Minister’s speech to the CBI in November.Within days it became clear how ferocious this throw of the constitutional dice was going to be. Michael Gove, the Prime Minister’s hitherto ally and friend, had declared his intention to campaign against the government even before the Prime Minister arrived back from Brussels. More unexpected was Boris Johnson’s decision to join Michael, since Boris’s position on the referendum had until then been unclear. In total, five Cabinet ministers and over a hundred Tory MPs decided to campaign for Britain to leave the European UnionI got home that evening to find Jeremy already immersed in practicalities. “We have a massive amount to do. For a start, we need to get ready to negotiate agreements with every trading bloc in the world. And the pound has plummeted, so we need to find a way to reassure the markets. But do you know what the most difficult issue is?’The Brexit negotiating challenge became even tougher after the Prime Minister’s next speech, which she gave in the gold-leaf-embossed long gallery in Lancaster House in mid-January 2017. This time, she added another red line – there should be no new barriers within the United Kingdom.The political rationale for this new pledge was clear. A hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would jeopardise the Good Friday Agreement, which had allowed the previously heavily guarded military checkpoints between them to be removed. Many members of the Conservative Party were shocked by May’s decision – including her Cabinet, which was only told on the morning of her announcement. But, since the Conservatives were twenty points ahead in the polls, there seemed little doubt about the outcome...The 10 pm exit poll changed all that – suggesting instead that the Conservatives had lost their majority. After watching some of the media commentary, Jeremy texted Jeremy Corbyn’s office in case they needed to talk later and then went to bed to try to get some sleep.On the same day, after completing his third and final round of immunotherapy, Jeremy had another scan. It had been a difficult week, he told me. He’d spent hours on the phone after the DUP had rejected the original version of the backstop, which had only included Northern Ireland. It had taken days of negotiation before they’d found an acceptable compromise – broadening it to include the whole of the UK – though the DUP still didn’t like it.On 22 March, the other member states broadly endorsed the Prime Minister’s thinking and confirmed that the next stage of the negotiations could begin. The following day, Jeremy put out his quarterly blog to the Civil Service. ‘There are few, if any, peace-time precedents for the scale and complexity of the constitutional and organisational challenge of withdrawing from the EU,’ he wrote.He looked at me, his eyes puffy. ‘No. Not now. But I worry about where we’re going. We have a referendum result and we have what our elected MPs want. And, in the gap between the two, our democracy is ripping itself apart.Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, had used an informal summit of heads of state in Salzburg to attack the Chequers plan.*Witney was Cameron’s constituency in Oxfordshire.Jeremy told himself to stay calm, a message he knew he would soon be repeating to his colleagues. His next step, though, was clear – he needed to give the Prime Minister the best possible advice on the issues that concerned her, and to keep doing that until all her questions were answered and she was ready to make a decision.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"brits should enjoy happy free","story":"NewsBrits should enjoy a happy and free summer in six months, Matt Hancock declaresThe Health Secretary declared he hoped there will be a happy and free Great British summer - minutes before his Cabinet colleague Liz Truss said it was too early to tellmirrorShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video matt-hancock-pledges-happy-free-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

The Health Secretary warned we’re going to have a tough few months before lockdown can be eased in England. And he refused to put a date on when restrictions can start to lt - with schools not due to open until at least March . But he struck a rare optimistic note when asked how Britain will look at the start of the school summer holidays. He told regional TV show BBC Politics East: In six months weaposll be in the middle of, I hope, a happy and free Great British summer.  It comes despite Cabinet minister Liz Truss saying - half an hour later - that it was far too early to knowBrits will be able to go on summer holidays abroad. Brits ing from aposred listapos countries will soon have to quarantine in expensive guarded hotels, while others will have to quarantine in their homes on arrival. Asked when the policy would end, she told LBC the virus was unpredictable and it would be very dangerous for a government minister to go on your show making promises about peopleaposs summer holidays. Ms Truss was also unable to say whether pubs , restaurants and theatres would have to remain shut over the summer. The Trade Secretary told the BBC: I donapost think any of us have a crystal ball where we know what is going to happen in the autumn. What we need to do is work really hard now rather than speculating into the medium and long term. When he was asked about July , Mr Hancock did not talk about and was not asked about foreign holidays specically. But he said: I have a high degree of confidence that by then the vast majority of adults will have been vaccinated. “That’s not just the clinically vulnerable groups but then going to all groups, people like me, I’m in my s and healthy and we’ll have got through everybody. “That will give a high level of protection. The more people take up the vaccine the more we’ll be protected as a society… “So I think we’re going to have a great summer but we’re going to have a tough few months between now and then.”  It came as the UK vaccine rollout rose by more than , first doses in a single day for the first time. NHS England had given first doses of a jab to ,, people as of yesterday - up , on the day before. That was more than % of the entire adult population of England, according to NHS statistics. Englandaposs figures alone mean the UK has broken the half a million barrier on one day for the first time. The previous record for the UK was , first doses on January . The figures represent when people were recorded as getting a first doses. They do not always exactly match the date when people had the jab.  Britain has already given first doses of the Covid vaccine to more than million vulnerable people and NHS and care staff. Scientists are waiting for data to show whether getting a jab will stop people passing Covid on to others - rather than simply preventing them getting sick themselves. Dr Susan Hopkins, Incident Director for COVID- at Public Health England, told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “What we’d like to see is a ergence in the case rates in the over-s and over-s who’ve been vaccinated from the younger age groups, to show they’re declining faster. “We’ve now hit % of the over-s being vaccinated and really fast numbers climbing in the under- age group as well. “So we expect over the next two weeks to start seeing that impact of that vaccine in that age group, and also an impact on hospitalisation.” Confirmed cases are also coming down - the rolling average of confirmed new daily cases in the UK has dipped from , on New Year’s Day to , by January . But the Sundaytoday reported social distancing may be needed for the rest of the year despite the vaccine rollout. Government scientists have warned that unless a vaccine is % effective at stopping Covid being passed on - as well as preventing severe illness - they wonapost be able to abandon other restrictions. Modelling by SPI-M, a subgroup of Sage, suggests the UK will suffer a third huge spike in deaths unless the jabs cuts transmission dramatically. It comes as figures show that cases of both the South African and Brazilian iants, which are thought to be more contagious, have increased in the last few days. The vaccines are thought to cut transmissions by around % but it is unclear. Ms Truss declined to rule out that some social distancing measures will have to be in place for the rest of the year. The autumn is a very long time away. We need to concentrate on getting the proper policies and measures in place now, so we can exit the virus crisis as soon as possible, she told the BBC. She added: We can only open the economy, open schools, when it is safe to do so and when we have reduced community transmission. At each decision point we will decide... what steps itaposs safe to take."},{"url":null,"title":"eu covid 19 vaccines explained","story":"NewsEU Covid- vaccines row explained: Will supplies to the UK be affected We want the Pfizer vaccine from the EU - and the EU wants the AstraZeneca vaccine from the UK.

Then it simmered over into a full-blown diplomatic incident threatening peace in Northern Ireland. The EU triggered an almighty spat on Friday night by restricting vaccine exports after its vaccine supply stuttered. That threatened supplies of jabs to the UK, which has given first doses to more than million people. And the EU looked set to impose a hard border in Northern Ireland, overriding the Brexit deal, before Brussels backed down amid fury on Friday night. We want the Pfizer vaccine - which is produced in Belgium. And they want the AstraZeneca vaccine - which is produced in the UK.But what are the actual details of the row  Why did it involve the UK and Northern Ireland  And will supplies actually be hit  Here we take you through the basics of what on earth happened.Whataposs it all about The row kicked off when AstraZeneca revealed it would deliver % fewer vaccine doses than hoped to the EU by March. Due to a production glitch - said to be at a hub in Belgium - it will supply only million doses rather than million planned. That prompted fury from the EU, which complained AstraZeneca continued to supply other buyers at the same time. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday: “There are binding orders and the contract is crystal clear.” She is worried because the EU’s vaccine rollout is slipping behind, while the UK is far ahead of any inidual EU country so far. Why was the UK dragged into it Because we’re home to one of the factories where the AstraZeneca jab is produced, and are using it in very large numbers. The EU believed our factory is one of those from which it had a contractual right to demand doses of Covid vaccine. That meant it was hoping to lean on AstraZeneca - possibly with legal action - to sht UK-made doses to the EU. At the same time, the EU is also home to the Belgian plant where doses of Pfizer vaccine are made and shipped to the UK. Brussels officials on Friday announced tighter export controls on doses of vaccine that leave the EU - including those headed for the UK. So as well as demanding doses of vaccine made in the UK, EU chiefs were trying to restrict the number of vaccine doses we get from Belgium. That exploded within hours into a diplomatic incident.  How did Northern Ireland get dragged into it  The EU sparked fury by triggering part of the Brexit agreement as part of its export control on vaccines from the EU. The bloc said it would invoke Aricle  of the Northern Ireland Protocol in an attempt to stop vaccines made in the EU from getting into the UK through the back door. The protocol, which is part of the Brexit deal, allows goods to cross from the Republic of Irelandto Northern Irelandwithout checks. It is vital to preserve peace and stability on the island of Ireland. Triggering Article  would have created a hard border - invoking many of the problems of the Troubles. Northern Irelandaposs First Minister Arlene Foster described the move as an incredible act of hostility and Boris Johnson made a furious call to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Even ardent Europhiles such as the Lib Dems and Tony Blair, plus the Labour Party, condemned the EUaposs behaviour on the issue. Irish premier Micheal Martin also spoke to the European Commission. Has the EU backed down  Yes - although the exact details may have to come out in the wash. After the apoplectic response from the UK on Friday night, the EU confirmed it would not trigger Article . Officials accepted theyaposd made a mistake. On export controls to the UK in general, Ms von der Leyen said: We agreed on the principle that there should not be restrictions on the export of vaccines by companies where they are fulfilling contractual responsibilities. This suggests vaccine supplies from Belgium to the UK - which has a contract with Pfizer - wonapost be blocked. But the power still appears to existthe EU wish to invoke it.  So will our vaccine supplies be blocked or not  Ms von der Leyenaposs statement suggests there will be no block on the Pfizer vaccine moving from Belgium to the UK. And the AstraZeneca jab is made in the UK so we have more control over that. Ministers have said they could send doses to the EU, but suggest this may only be in Autumn once all adults have been vaccinated. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss guaranteed there will be no disruption to Pfizer vaccines being supplied to the UK from within the EU. Askedshe could absolutely guarantee the Belgium-made Pfizer jabs would not be disrupted, she told The Andrew Marr Show on the BBC: Yes, I can. The Prime Minister has spoken to the President of the European Commission, she has assured him that there will be no disruption of contracts that we have with any producer in the EU.Is the UK being given special treatment There’s no doubt the UK is getting extremely high numbers of doses compared to some countries - more than million first doses given out so far. But AstraZeneca insist they’re not playing favourites with the UK government. Chief executive Pascal Soriot said the UK signed its contract with the firm - for million doses - three months before the EU signed its deal for million last year. That means we had more time to iron out glitches in production of the jab, made with Oxford University. UK Vaccine Taskforce chief Kate Bingham said we also started work to manufacture the jab extraordinarily early. She told the BBC we “actually started scaling up manufacture of the Oxford vaccine from February” last year - before a contract was even signed, let alone a jab passing trials or being approved. So essentially, we took a massive gamble on the AstraZeneca jab and it paid off.

The UK left the EU on  January , the same date the first coronavirus cases were announced in Britain. Since then it’s been a whirlwind year - but until recently, Brexit hasn’t actually had much of an impact. It was only at pm on December  that we left the EU’s single market and customs union, with a deal stitched up just in time. Boris Johnson ’s Free Trade Agreement means there won’t be tarfs on exports or as much paperwork as feared. Meanwhile, the EU backed down from threats to make a hard border with Northern Ireland last night, which has left many who supported Brexit feeling extremely justied.But there have still been problems for the meat and fishing industries, new bureaucracy and a load of unresolved issues. And some of those are about long-term or broad issues for the UK, not just the behaviour of the EUaposs leadership. So what knock-on effects has Brexit had in its first true month - and what’s gone better than expected  Here’s a snapshot guide.Things that havenapost gone brilliantly Fishing communities say they’re facing ruin Fishermen - particularly in Scotland - say they’ve been battered by red tape since new checks took force on January . Scottish Food and Drink shared grim pictures of an almost empty Peterhead fish market in Aberdeenshire.  Fish and meat are more laborious than most exports because they need to meet rules on “products of animal origin”. Exporters must fill out an Export Health Certicate and have their goods checked at an EU Border Control Post. Chilled mince and sausages are banned from export completely. But it’s ultra-perishable fish that are in the spotlight. The National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations say the first consignments to Calais hit a “brick wall of bureaucracy”. The government has promised a £m compensation fund for those hit, but there are questions about when it’ll actually help. The Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee launched an urgent inquiry yesterday. Chairman Neil Parish said: “A month of delays, disruption and red tape have meant food export businesses large and small have lost many tens of thousands of pounds. “This needs to be gripped by the Government at the highest level before businesses go to the wall.” Online shopping from the EU has got more expensive There has been a flood of Brits ordering goods online from the EU - only to find they are more expensive. One woman told the BBC her £ pair of boots from France came with £ of taxes and duties on top. Another spent £ on two handbags - only to be charged an extra £ on arrival. At the moment the extra costs appear to be because of changes to VAT rules due to Brexit. Goods costing more than £ now have the VAT applied when they reach the UK. Sellers may also be charging more for paperwork. This bit might get worse over time as the UK is phasing in its customs rules on imports, while the EU has applied its rules on UK exports straight away.Gts from EU friends and family now have a price tag It isn’t just purchases that come with a surprise price tag - gts from EU friends and family now have that burden too. One woman told the BBC she had to pay £ in taxes on a pair of earrings gted to her by a friend in Greece. Under post-Brexit rules you pay VAT on gts worth more than £ on arrival in the UK. UK businesses are finding it harder too While we haven’t seen massive queues of trucks at the border , and thataposs a big relief, it’s still become harder to sell to the EU. In fact, critics fear looking at trucks on the roads is a distraction because the real story may be in the goods that are no longer there at all. Large firms can afford to deal with the paperwork of exporting to the EU, but some smaller ones cannot. Even David Cameron’s we Samantha admits her fashion business has been hit by “frustrating teething issues”.  “If youaposre bringing goods into the country from outside the UK, and then trying to sell them back into Europe – that currently is challenging and dficult,” she told the BBC. Duncan Buchanan of the Road Haulage Association told the Mirror: “There is a permanent reduction in trade. There are goods that will no longer be able to be exported commercially because you will no longer be able to make a profit given the increased cost of customs processes.” Half of trucks are crossing empty Around half of trucks are being sent back from the UK to Europe empty, itaposs understood. The number of HGVs crossing the Channel from Britain carrying only ‘fresh air’ has risen since customs declarations were slapped on exports from January , UK officials believe. But there is a row over the figures, which are not officially published by the government. Government officials believe the figure has risen to about % from a normal rate of about % - but the Road Haulage Association believes the normal rate is more like %. The RHA told the Mirror demand for carrying exports had plunged as some firms find the paperwork unaffordable. In other cases, exports take more time to sign off and hauliers “can’t wait” for them to be ready.  Workers’ rights ‘came under threat’ The ink was barely dry on the Free Trade Agreement when the Tories became embroiled in a row over workers’ rights. Ministers faced fury at proposals to look at the -hour working week cap and rules for factoring overtime into holiday pay. BEIS officials had been looking at the whole body of EU law, including employment law and labour markets, and how it might be changed after Brexit. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng later said he had told officials to stop the work in a U-turn, after a major backlash. I made it very very clear to officials in the department that weaposre not interested in watering down workeraposs rights,” he said. But despite his cast-iron pledges not to hurt workersapos rights some have fears for the future. Boris Johnson deliberately secured a Brexit deal in which the UK will have freedom to set its own labour laws - though the EU can take actionthey undercut businesses on the Continent. There are some worries about the Covid vaccineAstraZeneca has raised concerns about getting the Covid vaccine to Northern Ireland in future under the Brexit deal, according to First Minister Arlene Foster. The vaccine is made in Britain, but after a grace period expires there will be new rules on goods and medicines moving from mainland Britain to Belfast. Ms Foster said she needs clarity before the end of the year so there is not a clf edge in terms of supply. Of course, more widely the UK has done perfectly well on ordering Covid vaccines outside the EU - and is ahead of all other EU nations in its vaccination programme. And the EU has not covered itself in glory, slapping export controls on vaccine doses to a string of countries including the UK amid claims Brussels is being short-changed. That could affect movement of the Pfizer jab from Belgium in a move that has prompted widespread condemnation. . A whole load of Northern Ireland questions aren’t resolved Supermarket shoppers in Northern Ireland were greeted with empty shelves earlier this month - prompting a major row. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis claimed Covid and border disruption at Dover in December were to blame. But the DUP, UUP and SDLP rejected those claims, with one MLA saying they were “blatantly” not the case. Under the Brexit deal, firms moving foodstuffs east to west across the Irish Sea must make customs declarations, open them up to sanitary checks, and may have to pay tarfsthey’re at risk of moving into the EU later on. Supermarkets have a three-month grace period to keep moving goods to Northern Ireland, and there’s a six-month grace period for chilled mince and sausages. But there’s still no plan for what’ll happen when that ends. MLAs claim small companies are already struggling to absorb costs. ... And last nightaposs vaccine row highlights that part of the deal could be overridden Despite the UK and EU signing off on a Brexit deal at the end of last year, parts of it are subject to change as the back-and-forth between the two parties continues.Yesterday threats to a substantial change almost came to pass when the EU moved to override part of the Brexit deal on Northern Ireland over export controls on coronavirus vaccines. Boris Johnson was urged by the regionaposs First Minister Arlene Foster on Saturday to replace the Northern Ireland Protocol after Brussels invoked a clause to prevent shipments of jabs entering the UK, in an incredible act of hostility. The EU backtracked on the move after condemnation from London, Dublin and Belfast, with leaders all blindsided by the decision to trigger Article  of the protocol as the European bloc is embroiled in a row with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca over shortfalls in the delivery of jabs. An EU source told the PA news agency the move had been a misjudgment, as the European Commission backtracked to say it is not triggering the safeguard clause to ensure the protocol is unaffected. While disaster was avoided this time, the fact the EU and UK have found themselves at logger heads so early on is not a good sign. Musicians are angry at red tape Covid has of course made tours to Europe a bit of a hypothetical problem. But when the virus finally recedes there will be a big problem of red tape - and itaposs already reared its head in ways that werenapost widely predicted. Sir Elton John, Roger Waters and Ed Sheeran are among leading music industry figures who slammed the Government’s Brexit deal for not including visa-free travel for musicians. More than  stars, from pop singers to classical composers, signed a letter saying performers have been “shamefully failed” by the post-Brexit travel rules. The UK government rejected the prospect of a “waiver” but said the door was open in future. And a few things that have gone better We got a trade deal It’s worth pointing out the obvious - Boris Johnson did in the end manage to get a Free Trade Agreement. It means there are no tarfs or quotas on more than £bn a year in trade between us and the Continent . If those had kicked in, the costs of doing business above would have suddenly been small fry. The tampon tax has been scrapped The hated tampon tax was finally been scrapped after a five-year campaign to stop sanitary products being classed as luxury purchases. The Government abolished the % VAT charged on womenaposs sanitary products, which it had said was previously impossible due to EU VAT rules. The tax cut represents about p on a pack of  tampons and p on  pads.

Boris Johnson wants schools to be the first thing to reopen from March , but the dates after that are shrouded in uncertainty.Leaked reports - downplayed by No - have suggested England’s shops could reopen in April and pubs in May. UK Hospitality have called for pubs and restaurants to reopen on April  - much earlier - in time for the Easter bank holiday weekend, as long as cases are still falling. But the reality is no one knows exactly when lockdown can end because it depends on so many factors.  A plan will only be presented by the government in the week of February . And some measures are likely to be with us long-term - with one report today claiming social distancing could stay all year. So what are the factors that would allow us to ease lockdown more quickly, and what are the factors that would slow it down  According to Sunday Times calculations, on current trajectories cases could drop to , a day by March . That’s still higher than they were when SAGE demanded a ‘circuit-break’ lockdown in November. Only in May  would we reach the -odd daily cases we managed last July, when pubs reopened after the first lockdown. That trajectory, though, will be affected by all sorts of things that could dramatically change our dealings with the disease.The government is using four conditions before easing the lockdown:A new iant isn’t causing dficulties The vaccination programme is working Hospitalisations are coming down Deaths are coming down.We can be pretty sure the vaccine will bring down deaths, because the aim is to give first doses to the % of people most likely to die by February . But that will take time, and as we know, younger healthy people die of Covid- too. We also know there are no “fixed thresholds” for these four factors - it’s the general progress and direction of travel that will matter. So with that in mind, here are three things that would help improve the odds of easing lockdown - and three things that would make those odds worse. things that would help us ease lockdown If the vaccine reduces transmissionSo far we know getting a vaccine - even just the first dose - makes you much less likely to get sick and die of Covid. What we don’t know, and the government are still looking at, is whether it prevents you passing it on to other people. Government advisors believe it’s almost certain there will be some kind of cut to transmission, they just don’t know how much. If the vaccine has a dramatic impact on people transmitting the virus, then it will help drive down case numbers more quickly. It’d mean a -year-old gran meeting her -year-old daughter wouldn’t just be protected herself the daughter would be safer too.  Dr Susan Hopkins, Incident Director for COVID- at Public Health England, said cases are declining in the over-s and over-s. She’s looking closely to work outthat’s linked to the vaccine - and we should have some idea “over the next two weeks”. She told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “It’s a bit early to say whether those declines are directly related to the vaccine. “What we’d like to see is a ergence in the case rates in the over-s and over-s who’ve been vaccinated from the younger age groups, to show they’re declining faster. “We’ve now hit % of the over-s being vaccinated and really fast numbers climbing in the under- age group as well. “So we expect over the next two weeks to start seeing that impact of that vaccine in that age group, and also an impact on hospitalisation.” If schools reopen without driving cases upSchools will be the first bit of lockdown to end - so will be crucial to showing whether other ‘unlocking’ should go ahead or wait longer. Ministers say schools themselves are safe for pupils, but they can act as a “vector” to spread Covid in the wider community. That means while it’s rare for kids to get seriously ill, they can take the virus home to their families without showing symptoms. But the data on exactly how much this happens, and how much it’s driven in the classroom itself, is mixed and disputed. A Department for Education study in December, presented to SAGE, concluded secondary schools have “an effect” on increasing the spread of the virus amongst children - “but we cannot tell how large this effect is, nor can we tell what the impact of it ison the wider community”. Meanwhile a Public Health England study claimed infection rates remained “very low” in primary schools after they reopened in September . If, as government advisors hope, there is no big leap in cases after schools reopen it will help clear the way to other reopenings. Butcases start rising they will have to rethink. If warmer weather helps cases fall in Spring This winter has felt so long, it’s easy to forget the effect the seasons can have on coronavirus.The fact we got down below  cases a day in July  wasn’t just due to the long lockdown - Spring helped too. It’s now well-established that good ventilation, either being outdoors or opening a window, makes the virus less likely to spread. This is something that happens less in schools, workplaces and homes in winter. Heat and light itself can even have an impact, though it’s less signicant. A paper by a SAGE subgroup on October  said winter conditions “increase viral persistence on outdoor surfaces” and in unheated indoor spaces, due to the cold and low UV light. SAGE member Graham Medley said on January : “Weaposre very hopeful now that this virus is seasonal so that it will reduce once the spring and summer comes. Then that gives us an additional chance to be able to prepare and in particular to get vaccination done for everybody. Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said in the same week: “Winter will benefit the virus.”While Britain’s gloomy weather suggests we won’t get much joy until at least April, it could be one factor that drives cases down.   things that would make easing lockdown harder If new iants get into the UKOne reason for Britain’s Christmas explosion in cases was the new iant which began in Kent. Scientists believe it is more transmissible than ‘original’ Covid and it may be more deadly - around a % rise in men aged . So far, early studies have suggested that ious Covid vaccines will work fairly well against the Kent iant. But scientists are worried about South African and Brazilian iants, as well as potential future iants that could resist a vaccine. Early trials for one yet-to-be-approved vaccine, Novavax, estimated it had % efficacy in South Africa compared to % in the UK. Dr Susan Hopkins of PHE insisted this was still “reassuring news” telling the BBC: “I expect that all of the vaccines will have similar levels of effectiveness against [strains] like the South African iant.” Butvaccines have to be tweaked or are less effective against new strains, it could slow down the fall in cases and deathsthose strains become common in the UK. Ministers are also accused of dragging their feet over tightening up the border. Brits ing from Brazil and South Africa will have to quarantine in hotels, rather than in their own homes, but there’s still no start date for the policy.If we unlock too quickly at firstWhen lockdown was eased in July, Boris Johnson steamed ahead by reopening pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and more on the same day. Scientists are warning we must go in two-week intervals to check that unlockings are not driving cases up. If we go too fast, or people are given the impression it’s a free-for-all and break the rules, we could end up with cases and deaths rising and our “unlockdown” going into reverse. Dr Susan Hopkins of PHE warned the BBC: “We have to relax things really quite slowly so thatcases start to increase, we can clamp down quite fast. “The NHS is going to be under pressure until the end of March, as normal in winter, but even more so with the amount of inpatients they still have with Covid-. “Any releases that we have will have to happen very slowly, very cautiously, watching and waiting as we go with a two-week period to watch and see the impact of that relaxation. Because it takes that to see what’s happening in the population.” "},{"url":null,"title":"matt hancock give statement whether","story":"NewsMatt Hancock to give statement on whether hes hit care home Covid vaccine targetThe Health Secretary will give an update after ministers pledged to offer a first dose to all elderly care home residents and their staff in England by January mirrorShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video liz-truss-matt-hancock-give-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Trade Secretary Liz Truss said Britain cannot simply become a vaccinated island while Covid rages in other nations in the world. “In future months we hope to be in a position to help other countries with vaccine supply, she told Times Radio. But she resisted calls today to say when that help might arrive - and suggested it might only be the Autumn. The top Tory told Sky News of course we first need to make sure our population is vaccinated. Currently the whole British adult population is only set to finish getting first doses by September. Ms Truss offered a hand of friendship after a furious row between the UK and EU over supplies of the coronavirus jab. Even Europhile Tony Blair today blasted the “foolish” EU after it tried to block exports of jabs from Pfizer in Belgium to the UK, to preserve supplies for itself. The EU - which had also moved to impose a hard border in Northern Ireland to stop jabs being moved there - backed down on its export threat on Friday night after a furious backlash from the UK. Labouraposs Shadow Cabinet Office Minister Rachel Reeves said it was the “wrong decision” and “any attempt to use Northern Ireland as a political football is absolutely wrong.” On handing out doses to other countries, Ms Reeves said many vulnerable Brits still hadnapost had a jab and letaposs see where we are in a few months.Vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi today also said Britain will help the EU with Covid jab supply problems after a showdown between the two sides over exports. Zahawi told the Sundaythe UK is focusing on collaboration with Brussels and has been trying to assist with shortages.It comes after the bloc made a shock announcement on Friday that it would curb some exports of Covid vaccines by invoking an emergency Brexit clause.The move was reversed within hours but sparked fears over the flow of the Pfizer jab, for which the UK has a m dose order, from its Belgian plant. The row kicked off when AstraZeneca revealed it would have to slash vaccine deliveries to the EU by  per cent due to a production glitch. The UK has an Astrazeneca factory from which the bloc believes it is contractually entitled to be supplied jabs. Meanwhile the EU is home to the Belgian plant where doses the Pfizer vaccine are made shipped to the UK. On Friday, the bloc triggered Article  of the Northern Ireland Protocol to slap temporary export controls on vaccines sent to mainland Britain. It has since backed down and admitted it made a mistake on Saturday as the UK hailed a  per cent drop in cases amid its massive vaccine rollout. Cabinet Office boss Michael Gove announced the retreat by Brussels with the words: “The European Union has stepped back.”Ms Von der Leyen tweeted on Friday night: “We agreed there should not be restrictions on the export of vaccines.” Commission president Ursula Von der Leyen tweeted on Friday night: “We agreed there should not be restrictions on the export of vaccines.” Trade Secretary Liz Truss told Sky News: This is a global problem and we need a global solution and we’re only going to be able to deal with this diseasewe get everybody vaccinated across the world.

Pregnant with my first child, I smiled as I imagined the moment our baby would be placed in my arms, my husband Chris and I gazing at him lovingly. I thought maternity leave would be full of coffee and cake, baby swimming and baby yoga classes. Sam and I didn’t get to experience any of that. I went into labour six weeks early in October . Sam was “back to back”, which meant I was in a lot of pain and was rushed for an epidural. “I’m frightened,” I said to a midwe as I was wheeled to the delivery room. Sam was distressed and his heart rate was dropping, so forceps were used to get him out. It was a chaotic delivery and Sam needed to go straight into special care. As the epidural wore off, I started shaking with shock. “You’ve had a bad tear,” a midwe explained. It extended from my vagina to my rectum, but I’d been stitched up and presumed I’d get better. After a few days, I could not understand why I had faeces in my pants, or where it was coming from. I was in excruciating pain, but when doctors examined me they said the tear was healing.  I didn’t want to cause a fuss, but the pain got worse. A nurse tried to examine me but couldn’t get near me without me screaming. I had to be given gas and air so they could examine me. I was told I had a fourth-degree tear, a huge abscess and a rectovaginal fistula, which is an abnormal connection between the rectum and vagina. My only option was to have a colostomy, which would ert faecal matter from the digestive tract through an opening in the abdominal wall, known as a stoma, into a colostomy bag. I was told the bag would be needed for  weeks, to give the wound a chance to heal. I spent two weeks in hospital and was taught how to clean the stoma. I hated it, but as it was only going to be temporary I tried to cope. In just three months, I told myself, this would all be over and I could get on with motherhood. Catastrophic damage A month after Sam was born, I received a letter from the hospital saying that the tear should never have happened and an investigation had been launched. I thought I’d just been unlucky, but it was dawning on me that something really terrible had happened. I wonderedI’d ever be able toto the job I loved, in the police force. The colostomy bag would fill at the most inappropriate times, and it was always leaking. I couldn’t even look after myself, let alone do such a full-on job. During check-ups, doctors realised the damage to my sphincter was much worse than they thought. I met with the consultant who had delivered Sam and she apologised. “I don’t want your apology,” I said. “If you hadn’t got Sam out, he would have died. You made a mistake, which has had catastrophic consequences for me, but don’t forget you saved a child’s le.” I didn’t want to sue, but I needed to be recompensed because I was being medically retired due to what happened. For my case to progress, I had to have many intrusive, horric tests. These confirmed the tear had caused so much damage I’d need a colostomy bag forever. I was diagnosed with postnatal depression and PTSD. Emergency operations Because of the fistula, every time I exercised and got hot, I got an infection, leading to sepsis. I was put on heavy-duty antibiotics and twice needed emergency operations to drain the sepsis. Chris worked away on oil rigs so I was often alone with Sam, and I was a mess. We’d be in a supermarket and the bag would suddenly fill and start to leak. One time, I had to ask a stranger to watch over Sam while I dashed to the loo. I felt so lonely and isolated.  The friends I’d made at a prenatal yoga class had textbook births and were busy enjoying motherhood. I hid the bag under loose clothes because I was so self-conscious. I had to move slowly due to the fistula, and a walk to the woods near our home which used to take  minutes now took over an hour. It took a year before Chris and I could be intimate again. I had to be careful of how I held Sam in case he accidentally kicked my stoma. It felt like I was keeping him at arm’s . It wasn’t until Sam was seven months old that I gazed down at him and realised I loved him. I didn’t blame Sam, but I felt angry for the damage his birth had done to me. With therapy, I understood we had been through a trauma together and he was a daily reminder of what happened, but we were both so lucky to be alive.  Looking for hope When Sam was two, the NHS Trust settled out of court. I spent a lot of time asking, whatthis had never happened to me  I scoured forums looking for hope, but all I found were other people with stomas saying they couldn’t go camping, cycling or swimming. Once I’d had surgery to fix the fistula, le improved, and I could finally start exercising more. I was overweight and unfit, but I felt determined to reclaim my body and my destiny.  My first challenge was the Chevy Chase , a -mile hike across the two biggest hills in Northumberland. It took almost eight hours, but I did it. Now, with my trusty colostomy bag by my side, I have competed in triathlons and half-Ironmans. I’ve skyed and been wild swimming, wild camping and sea kayaking. Sam and I took a scuba-ing course, something I was specically told I’d never be able to do with a stoma. Never let your fears stand in the way of your dreams.

Rogeraposs Wholesale opened its fth branch in Stockport on Saturday, having already opened its doors to excited customers in Poole, Plymouth, Southampton and Bilston. Masked shoppers eager for a bargain queued up outside the warehouse on the Bredbury Park Industrial Estate, Stockport, before flooding in to have their pick of the bargains. Great towers of tinned food stacked up on huge pallets and row-upon-row of colourful drink bottles greeted the shoppers as they rushed inside. Bargains on offer include  Lucoade originals in a case for just £, .kg of Honeycomb Cinder Toffee for £ and  Starbucks Double Shot Intenso for £. The storeaposs managing Mark King, , said he was inspired to open the huge warehouse stores after becoming annoyed about the amount of food waste.He told the MailOnline : I myself hit hard times and had lost my job through no fault of my own and did not have much money.I was struggling to afford to feed myself even though I had no kids or family. People who are homeless are covered by good charities and get a lot of help from supermarkets.  The scenes moments after Rogeraposs opened were reminiscent of the first lockdown back in March, when shoppers piled food and drink into trolleys and baskets to stock up on essentials. Mask and glove wearing shoppers streamed into the store, enthusiastically wheeling their trolleys around the colourful, maze like aisles. They were channelling a bulk buying energy seen in supermarkets up and down the land since the pandemic first began. While empty shelves have not been as common in sight in the third national lockdown as they were in the first, many Brits are still doing extra big shops to avoid making too many trips out.At the beginning of January pictures emerged of supermarket shelves being stripped of frozen and cupboard goods. The need for affordable food has never been so vital, especially with many people left unable to work during the Covid crisis and not able to access government financial support. The hunger charity The Trussell Trustaposs most recent analysis forecasted a  per cent increase in food parcels needed across its UK network in October to December, which works out as six parcels given out every minute.During the start of the pandemic, around half of people who used a food bank had never needed one before, the charity added. Trust chief executive Emma Revie said: “Throughout  communities across the country have stepped in to provide vital support to people left without enough money. Volunteers in foodbanks have been working hard under extremely dficult circumstances to make sure support is there for people struggling to afford essentials.

Lily McKelvey has been given up to  months to live following the tragic diagnosis.Medics discovered a mass in her brain after she began vomiting at the end of last year, Stoke Sentinel reported.They identied it as a dfuse intrinsic pontine glioma . DIPGs are rare tumours which develop in the brainstem, and the outcomes are often catastrophic. Lily now faces  radiotherapy sessions before doctors will make a decision on which course of treatment will be best suited for her. Now her family are raising money in a bid to fly her to New York for treatment which may prolong her le. Her aunty Lucy Victoria recalled the day when Lilyaposs parents first took the six-year-old into hospital. “It was New Yearaposs Eve and she started vomiting, that was everyday, she said. Her parents had a few phone calls with the doctors and she did have a trip to the AE because she wasn’t urinating so they were a bit concerned about that. “They did some tests on her stomach and sent her home. They gave her some medication and they thought it might have been gastroenteritis. For the next ten days Lily continued to vomit, prompting her parents to contact a private doctor who told her to go back to AE.  She went there and they did a finger prick and noticed something wasn’t right, Lucy continued. “They did a blood test and then it was quite urgent from there. They rushed her for a CT scan straight away and they found the mass.They explained she has got a mass in her brain but they needed to do an MRI scan to confirm what it was.” Lilyaposs parents Jack and Elizabeth, who live in Essex, are expecting a baby boy in June.  Despite the young girlaposs ill health, she is excited to meet her little brother. Lucy, , added: “We felt sick when we found out, we were in shock and couldnapost believe it. What makes it even worse is the fact that we are in this pandemic and I can’t even go around and give her a cuddle or play with her. “She can’t go and play with her friends, she has been robbed of her childhood. We are all trying to remain really positive and we want to get her to America and raise these funds. “The treatment in America can prolong her le so she will get to see her brother and spend time with her friends after this year, hopefully we can get out of the pandemic.  The family are now trying to raise £, for Lily’s treatment abroad. They have been inundated with support from friends, family and strangers alike and have so far raised more than £,. While they work to add to the total Lily continues her radiotherapy at Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge - a specialist hospital for children with brain tumours. Lucy said: “The radiotherapy is making her really tired and the steroids are making her really hungry, other than that she is so smiley and happy. She is getting on with it and being really positive.  “As a family we are trying to be as positive as we can. The amount of support we have received has been amazing especially during these hard times where people have lost their jobs and we are so thankful for all the support. We are so grateful, the generosity of the public has been amazing. “Her mum and dad go with her for her treatment.

Blue Sandford, , has become the public face of the underground protest against the proposed high-speed rail line. She and her fellow protesters have spent the past five days ft under the capital’s streets as bailfs try to evict them. Blue, whose wealthy father Roc lives off-grid on a Scottish island, has accused the bailfs of risking their lives by removing drainage systems. But the defiant teenager is still refusing to leave the tunnels - saying she is more terried of climate change. Blue, who is ‘on strike’ from her studies at her £,-a-year school, told the Mail on Sunday she hates the comparison to Greta Thunberg. She said: “It’s really strange being right at the centre of this huge thing but I canapost just sit at home. “I am really terried of the climate change disaster we are facing and I donapost know what  to do to change things.  “HS is incredibly damaging and despite the Government declaring a climate emergency they are not following through on it at all.” She accused bailfs of “dirty tricks” - something they deny - but said she and her fellow protesters remain “in good health”. “It’s been cold since the eviction team brought in a huge compressor and sent a hose down blasting air along the tunnels,” added Blue.“Weaposve got lots of sleeping bags, though, and weaposre taking it in shts,with some sleeping, others awake having some food.“We have enough stores to last six weeks. Iaposm surviving on rice and tins of jackfruit, as well as pastries and other stuff collected from skips.”  Her dad Roc, a environmental activist, defended his daughter’s actions and the green campaigning carried out by his other children. “They have completely outclassed me in their protests, which proves it isnapost coming from me,” he said. “I am always begging them to be careful. I sometimes feel like I’m going to collapse with fear, but I am also so proud of what they are achieving.  “I’m a parent, not an eco-warrior, and I am terried of the future we are cooking up for our children. “I have been going through a really dark and miserable place knowing I could lose them.” The government claims HS - which is set to link London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds - will lower carbon emissions.  But protesters say the lines will destroy or irreparably damage  ancient woodlands and  wildle sites. They also claim Euston Square Gardens will be built over by a temporary taxi rank before being sold to developers. An HS spokesman denied claims bailfs are flooding the tunnel system to remove the protesters. “We are pumping air so that the protesters can breathe. The activists have dug a crude and poorly constructed tunnel.

Sarah Thomson, , ran a marathon a day for a week for the charity Mind, completing her final run last Tuesday in three hours and  minutes. She took on the challenge to help her own mental health after becoming horrically low during previous lockdowns. But she has not been seen since pm on Saturday and police are becoming increasingly concerned for her welfare. There was a large police presence in her home town of Newquay, Cornwall, yesterday as the search widened. Coastguards, police and helicopters were involved in the search, which appeared to focus on the Gannel Estuary to the south of the town. Police were forced to dispel local rumours that the police operation was related to enforcing Covid restrictions. Sarah is a former RAF fitness instructor and was undertaking a healthcare course with the ambition of becoming a paramedic. She holds numerous records for endurance events and has been a professional surfer and dancer. Sarah has also worked with Bear Grylls as one of his outdoor survival experts and has appeared on ITVaposs aposBear Grylls Survival Schoolapos. After completing the challenge she posted an emotional message on Facebook, describing her mental health issues and pride she felt in completing the challenge.When I first planned to do these  in , the primary motivation was to put something in place to save my own head, she said. Over  months I had tried a lot of things, desperately searching for something to remind myself I had some kind of mental strength to kick through something hard.  I looked back over my le and identied what I was doing when I was really happy and comparatively what was missing from that right now. She continued: I have now realised that sporting competition is definitely a big factor in happiness for me. But the biggest thing Iaposve discovered is that more than that, itaposs people and itaposs love. So many people have reached out with their own stories of similar situations, offering inspiration and advice and of hundreds of comments there have only been kind and supportive ones. During the challenge she nicknamed her legs Gary and Barry so she could give them a good talking to when they got tired. She left home as early as am on some days so she could get home in time to attend classes for her healthcare course. She left at .am on the remaining days so she would not encounter too many other people on her runs.  As of lunchtime on Sunday, her JustGiving page had raised £, for Mind. Earlier in the week messages of support and congratulations flooded onto her Facebook page. Aimee Stapleford wrote: You are so incredible Sarah, such an inspiring post and what an amazing thing you have done to support so many others, you are one in a million precious lady and I hope you are proud of all of your incredible achievements. But yesterday messages of concern for her whereabouts began to appear on the social media . Jason Bowen urged anyone with information to call the police, adding: Sarah is a huge inspiration for other women to get involved on our military events smashing times and inspiring both men and women to get involved. I’m sure she’s just taking some down time as I certainly would with all her tech switched off. I hope you’re ok you superstar. Steven Curnyn praised her as being one of toughest people I’ve ever had the pleasure of knowing and real kind soul.

Pedigree breeds can fetch up to £, on the black market as breeders struggle to keep up with demand. Now people are being warned about walking pets alone in isolated spots after a series of attempted snatches last week. On Wednesday, two men with a fake RSPCA badge on their van approached Ceira Fleming, , who was jogging with collie-cross Callie near Poole, Dorset. She said: “They told me my dog matched the description of a stolen dog and they would have to take her for tests. “The men weren’t in unorm. When I started to ask questions, one of them looked annoyed and started to get out. I slammed his door shut and ran off.” Lauren Barnes, , was confronted by two men while walking her £, golden retriever puppy Bentley near Horsham, West Sussex, at .am.  She said: “A white unmarked Transit van suddenly veered alongside me. “Two men in black woollen hats were staring at my dog. The passenger started to get out but I pulled out my phone to take their picture and they sped off. “They looked really menacing. I think they targeted me because I was a young woman out alone with a nice puppy.” Criminals can make more money from selling puppies than drugs.Demand has rocketed as families with time on their hands in lockdown decide to buy a fashionable pet. The value of chow chows, dachshunds, pugs and bulldogs has risen by nearly  per cent since March, with pugs leaping from £ to £, and French bulldogs from £, to £,, according to the Dogs Trust. The RSPCA said they were hearing of more attacks on lone dog owners and added: “It’s worrying.” Debbie Matthews of SAMPA, the Stolen and Missing Pets Alliance, said: “It’s important for the public at large to be vigilant when out walking their dogs. “Be dog theft aware. Nowhere is safe from these monsters.” "},{"url":null,"title":"face blind woman doesnt recognise","story":"NewsWoman, , doesnt recognise herself in own wedding snaps due to rare face blindnessEXCLUSIVE Lauren Nicole-Jones has a rare condition that is so severe she struggles to recognise friends, or even famous faces like the QueenmirrorShareCommentsByGrace Macaskill :,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsLauren Nicole-Jones suffers from a rare condition \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbizWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Infact,it wasn’t for the familiar white gown she wore on her own wedding day, she would struggle to recognise herself as the bride in her own wedding album. For Lauren suffers from a condition known as face blindness which means she struggles to recognise people. While most people admit to forgetting a face sometimes, Lauren’s problem is so severe that she doesn’t always realise she’s looking at her own reflection, can’t recognise her best friends, famous people and struggles to spot herself in photographs. There is no cure for her condition but she has learnt to rely on mannerisms, habits and the way people speak before she recognises people. Lauren, , of Derbyshire, said: “It can make le pretty tricky sometimes. “I can’t always see myself in photographs which can be embarrassing. If someone shows me a picture and the person had dark hair and is about my height I think ‘why am I being shown this photo, it must be me.’ “There’s been times I’ve looked at pictures and thought ‘that looks like a nice place, when did I go there ’ Then I’ve realised it’s someone  entirely.” Lauren’s condition has led to some very red-faced situations.  She didn’t recognise a woman at her birthday lunch who came hurtling towards her with a huge grin. Yet the mystery female had been her best friend from the age of  – and Lauren was bridesmaid at her wedding less than a month before. It was only when her friend Hannah started talking that Lauren realised her pal had flown more than , miles from Australia as a birthday surprise. Lauren said: “I try to deal with it with humour and there have been some very hilarious things happen, like spending  minutes talking to the wrong person on a video call or mistaking an ex boyfriend for someone .  “On the serious side it can impact on your-self esteem and sense of competence, that general feeling of being able to negotiate the world and people. “I spend a lot of time jumping through hoops under the surface trying to work out who I’m talking to.” Lauren gets embarrassed as she tells how she failed to recognise Hannah – but she’s not the only close person she’s got confused over. She said: “I think the problem was Hannah was out of context. She was meant to be in Melbourne, not Britain, and something like that can really throw me. “We’d been together just over three weeks earlier when I flew to Australia to be her bridesmaid. “The funniest thing was, I knew my husband Jonathan had planned some sort of surprise for my birthday and at one point I was staring out the window, looking at this blonde woman in the car park, not realising it was the woman who had been my best friend for years.”  Lauren’s condition is so bad that she sometimes thinks she is looking at someone  when she sees herself in a mirror. She said: “I’ve been at a busy restaurant and found myself apologising to someone in front of me for getting in their way. I’ve taken a few side steps before realising it was my own reflection in a fullmirror. “I’ve given up watching movies because it’s too confusing. If there are two blonde women who look similar in the same film I can’t tell them apart and the plot gets very mixed up. I prefer reading books. “I can’t recognise famous faces eitherthey are out of context. I’d be able to tell you who Alan Sugar washe was sitting behind a desk in The Apprentice, for instance, but I’d struggle to recognise The Queenshe was wearing a tracksuit.” Despite not recognising her best pal, Lauren rarely has a problem recognising others and family, including husband Jonathan, because she is so close to them.  Lauren only realised she suffered from prosopagnosia aged  when she read a book by neurologist and famed author Oliver Sacks, who also has the condition. Around one in  people are thought to suffer from face-blindness to ying degrees.Some may fail to recognise people they’ve met a handful of times while others, like Lauren, struggle on a day-to-day basis. Lauren said: “When I was younger I guess I must have thought everyone was the same. “I went all through primary school thinking two boys were the same person and once thought a girl in my class was a boy until she wore a skirt one day. It was only when I read about prosopagnosia that I realised ‘that’s me’. “If I meet someone on the street I can sometimes tell who it is because they have a distinctive beard or glasses. If I’m not sure who it is I’ll ask a few questions and try and place them. “I don’t tend to tell people about my condition because it just leads to more questions about it.

The mum of three said: “This year’s Children’s Mental Health Week is all about expressing yourself – about finding creative ways in which to share your thoughts, ideas and feelings. “So whether that’s through photography, through art, through drama, through music or poetry – it’s finding those things that makes you feel good about yourself.” The future queen highlighted the crucial need for parents and carers to look after their own mental health while being in the country’s third lockdown, and pointed to the impact that this has on the children in their care. Kate last week confessed to being left “exhausted” by homeschooling children Prince George, seven, Princess Charlotte, five and Prince Louis, two, during an online chat with parents over their experiences of lockdown. She said: “I think as parents you’ve the day-to-day elements of being a parent, but I suppose during lockdown we have had to take on additional roles that perhaps others in our communities, or in our lives, would have perhaps supported us and helped us with. “Personally, I feel pulled in so many dferent directions and you try your best with everything, but at the end of the day I do feel exhausted.” The royal last year launched her landmark survey on the Early Years, ‘ Big Questions on the Under-Fives’, which aimed to spark the biggest ever conversation on early childhood that will ultimately help bring about positive, lasting change for generations to come.  The research revealed that whilst  per cent of people acknowledge that maintaining parental mental health is crucial to support the health and happiness of their child, in practice the majority of parents struggle to prioritise their own wellbeing. Kate added: “There has never been a more important time to talk about parental wellbeing and mental health too. “Last year you told me just how important this was that many of us find it hard to prioritise. “This is a hugely challenging time for us all so please look after yourself too. “Find those ways in which to share your thoughts and your feelings or find someone to talk to because we really do need to be the very best versions of ourselves for the children in our care.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lidls 169 chicken nuggets branded","story":"NewsLidls £. chicken nuggets branded game-changing McDonalds alternativeA viral snap posted to Facebook group Snack News and Reviews showcased the budget supermarket’s  chicken nugget boxmirrorShareCommentsByGemma JaleelDaniel Morrow:,  JAN NewsThe products packaging appears to be a dead ringer for McDonalds chicken nuggets\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbizWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

When he failed to pay the fixed penalty notice issued by the council, he was taken to court, where he was found guilty and ordered to pay a total of £ in fines and costs.It comes after a council crackdown on owners not acting responsibly and clearing up after their canines. Last year it was revealed dog walkers who fail to pick up after their hounds while out getting their aposessentialapos exercise during the first coronavirus lockdown risked getting fined.Plymouth City Council said its environmental enforcement officers were set to hit the city’s streets and parks in a bid to curb a recent increase in dog fouling.A council spokesperson said: Since social distancing measures were introduced, the council has seen a rise in reported cases of owners failing to pick up after their pooches. At the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, enforcement was not deemed an essential service. However, because of the hazardous nature of dog waste and its dangers to children, officers will be back on patrol from Monday. Unormed and plain clothed officers will be patrolling areas of the city where complaints have been received.Earlier this month PlymouthLive reported on a pop-up ‘poo protest’ planned for Burrator Reservoir by Dartmoor residents who are fed up at the sight and smell of bags of dog excrement left hanging on their fences."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle quietly changes name","story":"NewsMeghan Markle quietly changes her name on Archie’s birth certicate in snubThe one-year-old birth certicate was changed a month after he was born and no longer shows Rachel Meghan as his mum but Her Royal Highness the Duchess of SussexmirrorShareCommentsByLorraine King:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video harry-meghans-year-review-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Little Archie was born on May , , and his birth was registered  days later before the amendment was made on June . The totaposs birth papers no longer shows aposRachel Meghanapos as his mum instead it reads aposHer Royal Highness the Duchess of Sussexapos. The unusual change occured as rumours were growing of a rt between Harry, brother William and their partners, The Sun reports. The move could be perceived as a snub to the Cambridges as all three of their children have Kateaposs names on their birth certicates. It may also be viewed as Harry placing Meghan at equals with his mum Princess Diana who always used “Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales”. Days after the changes were made Harry and Meghan walked away from the Fab Four’s joint charity and had quit the Royal family within months. The caustic split from the royals was dubbed aposMegxitapos by commentators. Harry and Meghan have since moved to North America with Archie and secured lucrative deals with powerhouse companies like Netflix and Spoty.  Lady Colin Campbell, who discovered the amendment, said: “It is extraordinary and raises all kinds of questions about what the Sussexes were thinking.” Dickie Arbiter, the Queen’s ex-press secretary, said the changes could be an early part of their plan.” Royal expert Ingrid Seward added: “For a royal to change a birth certicate is unprecedented but to remove forenames is remarkable. “Perhaps this is another sign they were desperate to do something dferent to the Cambridges.”  The news comes as reports claim Meghan may notto Britain with Harry during several planned visits later this year. The Duchess of Sussex is said to be unlikely to accompany her husband at a number of s this summer - although the move is not said to be a snub. Sources, speaking to the Daily Mail, said the choice has been made for several reasons and her absence will avoid the inevitable public and media hype a joint appearance would bring. Insiders also stressed that the situation is still very much up in the air due to the ongoing global pandemic and other factors.

The infant, weighing just over two-and-a-half pounds, wore just a white nappy and a little woolly hat as he was lted out of an incubator. Strict Covid- rules meant that both his mum, Kirsty Anderson, , and nurse, Kirsty Hartley, had needed to put on a green Covid- mask before the loving handover could take place.

Her Majesty, , is said to be determined to get back to business after nearly a year of Covid- restrictions and lockdowns preventing her carrying out her public duties. She is poised to lead a post-Brexit charm offensive when the new US President and other world leaders visit the UK as part of the G summit in Cornwall in June. Prince Charles, Prince William and the duchesses of Cornwall and Cambridge will reportedly join the Queen for the soft power reception. The Monarch will reportedly also have a one-on-one meeting with Biden, her first signicant diplomatic engagement following her plannedto Buckingham Palace. A senior royal source told The Times: “There is a desire from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office to have a very strong royal presence before G events, and all senior members of the royal family will be part of what happens.” She willto London in time for her th birthday in June in what should be the first major national celebration since the outbreak of the pandemic, the Sunday Times reports. The Trooping the Colour military parade on June  falls two days after the Duke of Edinburgh’s th birthday.  It is set to be the first public reunion of the royal family since “Megxit”. The Queen left London just before the first lockdown was called in March.She headed for Windsor Castle where she isolated with her husband and a small number of staff. During the first wave of the pandemic Her Majesty was largely out of action, holding her weekly meetings with Boris Johnson over the phone rather than in person. She did make two rare televised addresses to the nation during the lockdown however.After spending her actual birthday, April , with Prince Phillip in lockdown, celebrations for her official big day in June were moved from London to Windsor.Aside from brief stays at Sandringham and Balmoral, the Queen and her husband have spent almost all of lockdown in Berkshire.Last year they celebrated their first Christmas at Windsor since .

She also thought she had no remaining family left apart from her daughter following the death of her husband in . So she was stunned to receive a message from kind-hearted Adam Simpson-York to say he had bought Charles’s medals on eBay. The -year-old has spent lockdown buying unwanted medals online and then trying to reunite them with the soldiers’ families. He managed to track down Jocelyn after researching her family history and contacting relatives she didn’t know existed. Adam, from Ipswich, Suffolk, has now gted her the service medal and victory medal, which he bought for £ for the pair. Jocelyn has also contacted the  surviving second-cousins she had no idea existed - including some living down the road from her. The social worker, from Peterborough, Cambs, said: “What Adam did was absolutely incredible.  “He went through so many stages of research to contact me, and was able to tell me things I never knew about my own family. “All I knew about my grandad was that he had lived in Doncaster and worked on the railroad for  years. “And then to find out I have  second cousins that I never knew about - it’s been an overwhelming experience. “It’s like I gained a new family in the space of  hours. I’m going to hold these medals close to me for the rest of my le. It’s unbelievable.”  “I don’t know how to describe what this means to me. “Covid- has brought some dark days, but this feels like suddenly there is a light in my le.” Charles’s medals had been lost for over  years before appearing for sale on eBay before Christmas. Adam secured the help of Jocelyn’s second cousin Rob Sharman - who she did not know existed - to learn more about the soldier. Jocelyn said: “Thanks to Adam and Rob, I now know pages and pages of information about my grandfather that I never knew before.

The -year-old has opened up about the grilling she received following the murder of Brit Meredith Kercher back in . In a fiery Twitter thread the American accused the Italian police of wiretapping her phone, gaslighting her and coercing her into signing a  confession statement. Amanda was found guilty of helping her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito kill the British exchange student, only to be acquitted, convicted again and then finally acquitted a second time in . In a separate trial in  Rudy Guede was convicted of the -year-oldaposs sexual assault and murder. Shortly after Meredithaposs body was found Amanda was interrogated by Italian police in what she described as the worst moment of my le.Taking to Twitter, she wrote: People often assume that the worst moment of my le was that first guilty verdict, where I collapsed in the courtroom.Or that nothing could be worse than those years trapped in a cell. Theyaposre wrong. The worst moment of my le was my interrogation.  Amanda recalled feeling confused and afraid as she was grilled about Meredithaposs death. I was , I was  miles from home, my friend had just been killed, the killer was on the loose, and I spoke Italian maybe as well as a ten-year-old, she wrote. I was confused and afraid. In that state, a group of seasoned adults questioned me without an attorney for  hours over  days in a language I could barely speak. Amanda blasted the officers, who she claimed lied to me repeatedly. They told me I was a witness, that I was helping them. A lie, she continued.  They told me that Raffaele had contradicted my alibi. A lie. They said they had evidence that placed me at the crime scene that night. A lie.Knox went on to accuse the Italian police of wiretapping her phone, something her parents also claimed back in .She also said she was subject to a relentless campaign of lies and gaslighting. They kept me up overnight, Amanda wrote. They told me I had amnesia, that I was so traumatized by events I’d witnessed, that I’d repressed them. They shouted at me to remember, REMEMBER! They slapped me. My phone was ringing on the table--it was my mom, she’d arrived in Italy-- they wouldn’t let me answer it. aposYou were there,apos they said. aposIf you just remember, everything will be fineapos. The cops then questioned a text message sheaposd sent to her boss Patrick Lumumba on the night of Meredithaposs death, claiming it had set up a meeting between the pair. They made me feel insane. Like I couldn’t trust my own thoughts, my own memories, Amanda, who detailed her experience in the best-seller memoir aposWaiting to be Heardapos, wrote. I started to believe them that I had amnesia, that I’d witnessed something horric. They wrote a statement for me, a confused and contradictory statement, that implicated my boss Patrick, and placed me at the scene of the crime. Shaking and tired and gaslit into submission, I signed it. They congratulated each other  rushed off to arrest my boss. I was thrown in a cell. Hours later, I recanted that statement, said I couldnapost stand by it, that I was confused, that it was all a jumble. They ignored me. Patrick was later cleared of any involvement in the crime. Amanda said she blamed herself for making the  statement for a long time afterwards, and has received abuse online from people who believe she is self-serving and rotten.  To this day, people all over the internet blame me for that statement, the ex-University of Washington student wrote. They say I aposly accused someone.apos That evenI’m innocent, I’m a rotten, self-serving c*** who would throw another innocent man under the bus to save her own skin. They say this about the worst moment of my le. About the time I was most terried, most confused. About the time I was broken down by police twice my age who lied to me relentlessly to get a confession. In recent years she has come to terms with the part she played in thrusting Patrick into the spotlight, thanks in part to Saul Kassi, who has studied  confessions for more four decades. The psychologist contacted Amanda and urged her to write down everything she remembered about the confession and sent it to him. She added: Saul Kassin gave me a gt unlike any other Iaposve ever received.

The Royal added that there is no way to downplay organised violent extremism on social media.  Royal author Angela Levin said Prince Harry should droll all his titles and take American citizenshiphe wishes to have the sort of freedom that allows him to speak on political matters. She told Express : If he wants this sort of freedom he should drop all his titles and take American citizenship.Of course having his titles has enabled him to do ious lucrative deals but he can’t or shouldn’t have it both ways. I think Harry’s decision to lecture anyone on how to live, what to do and who to vote for is a misjudgement. And even more so in the United States. Ms Levin added that Prince Harry should especially not speak out as a member of the Royal Family who is still using his Royal titles. The idea of members of the British Monarchy not speaking out stems from the long-upheld tradition of staying non-partisan while carrying out their duties.Rumours over whether the Duke of Sussex will take up American have swirled since he moved to Calornia with his we Meghan Markle in March .Meghan reportedly cancelled her plans to become a UK citizen after the move, as there is no reason to pursue the application.

The army has reportedly been called to support the police in St Petersburg, the home city of President Putin, as they struggle to cope with the crowds of protesters.Tear gas was used in some of the worst scenes of street unrest since Putin came to power more than two decades ago.While brutality was caught on video as police sought to crush protesters in Moscow, St Petersburg and Vlaostok. One video shows a journalist who works for major newspaper Kommersant - owned by pro-Putin billionaire Alisher Usmanov - being aggressively held.

Dear god, how did we get to this  cries a woman.In many cities officers had ‘avtozaks’ - cells on wheels - awaiting the protesters.

We watched the last couple of Scotland games and they have been decent.“But in my opinion, that’s what they need — a targetman.“They have got a couple in the pecking order, but I don’t see why Fraser can’t make that step up in the next couple of years.“I’ve played with him for Scotland for two years now and he’s a great player. He can do both sides. He’s a big target man and a strong boy, but he’s technically very good and his awareness is fantastic.“When we’re training I just try and kick him!“We all know he’s a high-class player. He wouldn’t have played for Everton’s first teamhe wasn’t.”If Hornby completes his move to Aberdeen before the transfer window closes at midnight on Monday, the attacker will be teaming up with a few familiar faces.The striker already knows Connor McLennan, Lewis Ferguson and Ross McCrorie from his time with the under-s, while Dons winger Matty Kennedy was an Everton player when Hornby moved to the Blues in .For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"heathers treks from castle dounie to serpentine ridges","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities. The remainder, £,,, is mostly allocated to single-use ferry facilities, and a huge proportion of that is to provide overnight parking for CalMac ferriesreaders will have to make up their own minds about the merits of spending £,, for an overnight berth at Fionnphort, and £, on a feasibility study for a breakwater at Lismore.CMAL pay back around half of the £,, to the council through harbour dues for the use of council-owned piers, however, that still leaves a whopping £ million gap in the required funding.If past experience of other CMAL projects is anything to go by, the planned eight per cent increase in council harbour fees and charges up to   is not going to cover it.Fergus Gillanders, KilmelfordSir,Last year, , was challenging and, although many people like to give generously to charity at Christmas time, it may have been dficult to make a donation this festive season.It#s not too late # you can still help support the Royal National Institute of Blind Peopleby collecting and donating used stamps from cards and parcels you may have received.Your stamps will be recycled and turned into vital funds that will help RNIB support children with vision impairment.

Some do exist, however, and while not attempting to be a comprehensive history, there is a nicely illustrated booklet about the hospital and its past entitled #Up The Brae#, produced a few years ago by Brenda Bratt, Jess Grant and my former colleague Dr Grace Fergusson .These photographs are a reminder of the loss of a signicant social and economic element in the fabric of Mid Argyll, where for generations it would have been dficult to find a family without some connection to #the AB#. For those who worked there, myself included, any sadness however is much more about the loss of a self-sufficient and widely respected mental health service.I was a late participant in the story of the AB, being appointed physician superintendent in , a post I held in addition to that of clinical director for mental health services for Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire until , and I feel a duty to the many splendid colleagues with whom I worked to comment on the loss of the service in which the AB served as the nucleus.During the course of   the hospital was awarded the accolade #Best Mental Illness Hospital in Britain# as the result of a national competition launched by the King’s Fund and sponsored by the Sunday Times. This was a recognition of the multi-disciplinary spirit and enthusiasm for innovation that characterised the service, and the ethos of best clinical practice being led by academic excellence. The service went on to be recognised as a centre of excellence by many visiting accreditation bodies.My reason for making these points has nothing to do with nostalgia.The past has no utility in the present or the future except as a source for learning how best to proceed.The ingredients for a good mental health service are the same today as they were in  and they have little to do with buildings or even location. Staff have to feel they #belong# to something there must be a collegiate spirit binding together the ious disciplines shared professional development and peer support and clear lines of accountability. It is frankly hard to see any such features in the current delivery of mental health care.Someone once said #psychiatry isn’t sexy#, meaning that in any competition for resources with other clinical specialities, psychiatry will always lose, and so to get the best out of the NHS for folk with psychiatric disorder, exceptional effort is required. The achievements and values of the past can act as a springboard for such effort, but here they seem to have been squandered by a distant and disinterested health board.It is all too easy to avoid investing in a service by reorganising it into invisibility, but the people who pay the cost are those who deserve the best of specialist professional help.So I am certainly sad at the disappearance of the old AB, because it is symbolic of something having been lost that is much more important than stones and mortar.Professor Angus Mackay OBE FRCPsych, ArdrishaigSir,Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns over whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But though customers# usage of data more than doubled, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m also proud of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.We#ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland Director, Alexander Graham Bell House, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 8 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is ridiculous. I have attended  years of meetings on the A and all we get is fobbed off with pathetic excuses.We need a government which will deliver results, not spend all its time plotting to get independence while ignoring the real issues like a closed A which blight people#s lives.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,As we move into  and parents, teachers and pupils once again find themselves facing additional challenges to deliver and attain a full and rounded education, it is worthwhile remembering the role that music can and should play in improving our lives.Firstly, music will help to support and sustain our young people through the coming months. For children and adults alike, the creative arts play a vital role in promoting wellbeing and positive mental health, providing both a means of expression during the isolation of #lockdown# and a practical as well as enjoyable pastime.Secondly # and just as importantly # playing an instrument is complementary to academic subjects and has been shown emphatically to improve wider educational success. As we consider the often daunting challenge of theto home schooling, those parents whose children can mix domestic timetables with musical lessons will understand the release and stimulation playing an instrument can deliver.Across society music is integral to our identities and is made to be shared. We now have the means to do that successfully and safely with online tools whose use has been well-honed by recent experience.So whether you#re at the start of a musical journey, or are well advanced in music-making let#s keep singing, keep dancing and keep music lessons flowing, particularly while the restrictions necessitated by the pandemic keep us apart in our own homes.Dr Kenneth Taylor, head teacher, St Mary’s Music School, EdinburghSir,As Scotland faces a second national lockdown, the country#s national walking charity, Paths for All, is encouraging the public to explore local walking routes in a bid to help combat social isolation, anxiety and loneliness while maintaining physical health.The call follows the launch of the charity#s Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, which asks people to make the pledge of walking every day throughout January.The campaign includes an online hub which outlines the importance of walking and regular physical activity during the winter months. A iety of activities and ideas, designed to motivate iniduals of all ages, are available on the hub with podcast recommendations, creative walking advice and prize incentives.In what is traditionally the time of year which sees a surge of gym memberships and fitness plans we suggest taking up walking instead as part of our new year resolutions.With walking being one of the few essential reasons for leaving your home, it is the perfect exercise and now is the time to get into a walking exercise routine which is consistent with the current government guidelines. Walking can help with our social health as the guidelines allow us to meet with one person from one other household outside.Last year we saw an increase in Scots taking up walking during the first lockdown and the outcome has highlighted just how many benefits are attributed to walking and how outdoor exercise as many times a day as we can has become an important way to look after physical and mental wellbeing.Follow the campaign over on Paths for All social media channels #WalkOnceADay.For more information on the Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, visit the Paths for All website.Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer, Paths for AllSir,The New Year is usually a time for a fresh start – making resolutions, getting fit, setting new challenges and goals. But with the continuing uncertainty caused by the COVID- pandemic, it seems harder to commit to making a change.With restrictions ongoing, it’s becoming even more important for us to find new and innovative ways to raise vital funds for NSPCC Scotland to help children at risk of abuse and neglect.Children have been greatly affected by the pandemic. Since the first lockdown measures were introduced, the average monthly number of referrals from the NSPCC’s helpline to agencies in Scotland, such as the police or children’s services, have been more than  per cent higher than the first three months of . And the effects are far from over.Even with social distancing, there are still many ways you can fundraise for us.From hosting a virtual quiz or coffee morning to selling handmade crafts, cakes or old clothes, we’ve got lots of great virtual fundraising ideas you can try while following the Scottish Government#s advice on social distancing.By volunteering just a couple of hours each month to fundraise in your  area, you can help to make  a better year for children.So please think about using your new year passion and enthusiasm to come up with some ideas to fundraise and help us be there when children need us most.To find out more or to request your fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk or contact jen.lindsay@nspcc.org.uk by email.Jen Lindsay, community fundraising manager, NSPCC Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"boaters urged to abide by covid rules","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The revised guidance recognises that travel is severely restricted by law and owners may only travel to their boatit is kept in the same local authority area they live in.RYA Scotland, Sail Scotland and British Marine Scotland have joined together to encourage boat owners to use the services of staff where their boat is stored,at all possible, in an effort to avoid making a journey, to respect that storage providers may not be able to open and to advise owners to contact providers before travelling to confirm access.The information is tailored towards RYA affiliated clubs and recognised training centres as well as inidual members and the wider boating community across Scotland.James Allan, chief executive officer at RYA Scotland, said: #Lockdown will be disappointing for everyone, but it is still possible to go boating as a form of exercise and spending some time afloat or near the water is great for our wellbeing. It is important to remember we are in the grip of a pandemic that has become signicantly worse in recent weeks. The overriding message for Scotland’s boating community is to stay at home wherever possible as we must all help stop the spread of the virus.#Importantly in this lockdown, owners may travel within their local authority to undertake essential maintenance on their boat but may not stay longer than theof time required to undertake essential maintenance.To check what level of measures apply in your area or venue where you intend to participate in activity, please check the postcode on the Scottish Government webpage.In the meantime, RYA Scotland has decided to postpone its directly organised, non-virtual events and training in response to these measures to protect participants, volunteers and others and to reduce the risk of placing an additional burden on the emergency services at what is a hugely testing time.The RYA will be providing a range of online events and #SailFromHome activities.

In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark, which is grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are # the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,In order to avoid fishermen being adversely impacted by export delays, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross has called on the UK Government to bring forward compensation to the affected fishermen and deliver it immediately.The SNP government must also accept responsibility and deal with ongoing issues involving their agency, Food Standards Scotland, which are holding up exports within Scotland.Both of Scotland’s governments must work together to deliver for Scottish fishermen.We in the Scottish Conservatives will back Scotland’s fishing communities all the way.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,The Scottish SPCA is appealing to animal lovers in Scotland to donate much-needed food to its National Wildle Rescue Centre in Fishcross, Alloa.Scotland#s animal welfare charity had its busiest ever year in  with over , wildle casualties admitted.The pandemic caused quite a signicant drop in the number of animals arriving at the wildle hospital. Over , wild animals were brought to the centre in .As we are entering fox cub season, we are appealing for Pedigree puppy food and puppy milk.Last year, we cared for  foxes, of which  were cubs. It can be a struggle to keep up with so many hungry mouths to feed.We expect to be even busier with admissions this year so we need help from members of the public.If anyone can help with food for these young mammals, we would appreciate anything that people can spare.Puppy meat can be purchased from the wildle centre#s Amazon wishlist http:amzn.to xkUe.Steven Gray Scottish SPCA National Wildle Rescue Centre managerSir,New Year resolutions can be a good starting point for making longer term health and lestyle improvements, but most people do not stick to them. Reasons for quitting include a lack of time, a lack of support from other people and feeling daunted by unrealistic targets.Often, goals are unachievable because they are too dficult, or they do not allow enough time for you to make gradual changes.There is nothing wrong with aiming high and being ambitious, but it is important that your goal is not too dficult or time-consuming as this could leave you feeling daunted.Ask yourself the following questions: Is the goal too ambitious  Is the timeframe realistic  What specic changes do I need to make  Can I fit my new healthy behaviour around my other commitments Breaking large goals down into smaller goals can make them feel more achievable and less daunting.For example,you are aiming to lose weight, the NHS recommends that you aim to lose around  to lbsa week. You should be able to achieve this by cutting down your calorie intake by about  to  calories each day. It might take longer than planned to lose the weight, but you are more likely to stick to it and not give up.Plan how you will achieve your goal and what changes you will make to ensure you stick to it. There are online resources available to help you plan your healthy activities, such as the NHS couch to km programme or the NHS programmes for stopping smoking, cutting down alcohol and losing weight.Try to be patient and don’t expect the results from just one or two weeks of dieting to show on the weighing scales, as it may take longer.A good way to motivate you is to involve other people. If you know someone who has a similar goal to yours, try to involve them as a #buddy# to provide mutual support.They may even be able to push you a little bit harder, helping you to achieve your goals sooner. Look for groups on social media who share your goal.If you miss a fitness session or have an alcoholic drink, cigarette or bar of chocolate, try not to feel guilty. Think about what might have triggered the deviation from your goal and try to avoid it in future. Forgive yourself and aim to get back to achieving your goal as soon as possible.On average, it takes between  and  days for something to become a long-term habit. Make goals that you want to be able to stick to long term, such as improving your overall fitness, stopping smoking or maintaining your weight.If you can make it through these first few weeks, you will notice that things will become much easier.Dr Helen Flaherty, head of health promotion and education, Heart Research UK"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 22 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

More is required, though, in the medium and longer terms, to help this beleaguered industry to get afloat again and regain some buoyancy.Producers and customers need reassurance that future supplies will be prioritised and to regain confidence in the industry through dedicated marketing and investment where possible through the £m fisheries fund your government announced following the publication of the agreement.Our seafood sector desperately needs Government to take action to secure its survival. Please do what you can, urgently, to avoid its demise.Robin Currie, Argyll and Bute Council leader"},{"url":null,"title":"innerleithen-golfer-83-celebrates-first-hole-in-one","story":"AN -YEAR-OLD

Thatrsquos because it helps build up your immune system. Vitamin C is thought to increase the production of white blood cells. These are key to fighting infections.Popular citrus fruits include grapefruit, oranges, tangerines, lemons, limesand clementines.ZincldquoZinc is necessary for a healthy immune system,\" according toMelissa Snover, founder and CEO of Nourished.\"A lack of zinc can make a person more susceptible to disease and illness.\"This essential nutrient helps maintain the bodyrsquos ability to make new cells and enzymes, process carbohydrate, fat and protein in food and also increases the speed of healing muscles and wounds.\"Foods high in zinc include red meat, shellfish, eggs, nuts, wholegrainsand legumes, such as chickpeas, lentilsand beans.BroccoliBroccoli is supercharged with vitamins and minerals. Packed with vitamins A, C, and E, as well as many other antioxidants and fibre, broccoli is one of the healthiest vegetables you can put on your table. The key to keeping its power intact is to cook it as little as possible - or better yet, not at all.GingerGinger is another ingredient many turn to when they are feeling under the weather. The antioxidant is believed to fight off cold and flu symptoms, combat nausea, and is full of iron, zinc, calcium and magnesium.However, itrsquos worth noting that a study from  showed fresh ginger may help boost the bodyrsquos respiratory system, but dry ginger did not show the same results.GarlicBefore it became a staple in cooking, garlic was actually used for medicinal purposes. From manganese to vitamin B and C, as well as selenium and fibre, it is high in immune-boosting compounds.\"Garlic is a potent anti-viral, anti-fungal agent, and eating it raw, or as an uncooked puree alongside your normal foodwill wipe-out most miscreants,\" Sara Davenport, health expert and author of Reboot Your Health told the .YogurtLook for yogurts that have live and active cultures printed on the label, like Greek yogurt. These cultures may stimulate your immune system to help fight diseases.According to Healthline, yogurt can also be a great source of vitamin D, so try to select brands fortied with vitamin D. Vitamin D helps regulate the immune system and is thought to boost our bodyrsquos natural defences against diseases.Sunflower seedsSunflower seeds are full of nutrients, including phosphorus, magnesium, and vitamin B. Theyrsquore also incredibly high in vitamin E, a powerful antioxidant.Vitamin E is important in regulating and maintaining immune system .

He says it should be capable of tracking and verying an iniduals vaccine status across the world.It could, according to Blair, involve not only how many vaccinations someone has had , but also any test results they may have had in the past.It is hoped that the data would be transferred using a QR code, which would be scanned by participating countries at borders and ports.Will vaccine passports be introduced in Scotland In evidence to the Scottish Parliamentrsquos Covid- Committee on Thursday, Professor Leitch said coronavirus is likely to be present in some sort of ldquoendemic form for years to come.When he was asked about vaccine passports, hesaid: ldquoI agree it is an interesting concept, the WHOhave begun to look at it.He stressed the latest scientic evidence suggests vaccination is not a ldquobinary state, but there is precedent for travel restrictions based on vaccination ndash including yellow fever certicates.Prof Leitch said: ldquoI think we will probably move towards that. I havenrsquot seen the exact details of what Mr Blairrsquos think tank have said but I imagine itrsquos relatively sensible, itrsquos about doing it globally rather than just an inidual region of the world.What are others across the world saying Zurab Pololikashvili, the UN World Tourism Organisationrsquos secretary-general, last week told the Global Tourism Crisis Committee in Madrid: ldquoVaccines must be part of a wider, coordinated approach that includes certicates and passes for safe cross-border travel.The leaders of Spain, Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Malta have called for the introduction of certicates which designatea traveller has been vaccinated or not.On Monday, Australiarsquos education minister, Alan Tudge, said planned ldquodigital vaccine certicates would allow international students toto study in the country without the need for them to hotel quarantine.Are there any problems with the vaccine passport The head of the UKrsquos data privacy watchdog has told MPs she can see the benefit of Covid- immunity passports, but warned they came with privacy concerns.Information commissioner Elizabeth Denham was asked by MPs on the Digital, Culture, Media and Sportsub-committee on Online Harms and Disinformation about the possible use of special passports to allow those who had been vaccinated to move more freely.She said any such scheme would face substantial questions over its necessity and concerns over the sharing of health data, but warned of creating a ldquotwo-tier system where people who have received a vaccine have more freedoms than

It is stating the obvious, I know, but as we live through another lockdown, it is tempting to focus on the liberties lost and freedoms curtailed, when there are many good things still to celebrate.Not least of these is hope, another word that is used a lot in these days. We hope the vaccines will make a dference we hope things will get better we hope our children will get back to school we hope the planet can be brought back into balance we hope.But where is the ground for hope  Science and human skill A talk on the radio a few weeks ago, before Christmas, spoke about gts, and posed the question that the vaccines that have been developed might be God’s gt to humanity this Christmas, and the skills of the scientists ultimately come from God.Because for people of faith, the ultimate hope is in the God who is the source of le and who Christians believe came to earth in Jesus to show us the way forward.#For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son…# John :Where is our ground for hope  Surely the power of love is our only hope, the steadfast love of the Lord who #never leaves us nor forsakes us#and is with us every step of the way.Just be glad you have a glass.Reverend Steve Fulcher,"},{"url":null,"title":"sponsors kit out young pupils players","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The problem is, Smithy, a teacher#s nightmare, causes so much chaos that the head teacher ends up on a le support machine.Enter Dr Hannibal Lecture, the replacement head, and the stage is set for a war of nerves. The musical is on next Thursday, Friday and Saturday, with the curtain going up at .pm.West Coast Motors will be extending its local town service to include the school on the three nights of the production.FIFTY YEARS AGOPaul abroadWhile the financial problems of the Beatles are being investigated in London, Paul McCartney is believed to be in America. He left his farm, High Park, on January , after celebrating the New Year there with his we and children.Visit on # but support is neededConfirmation has been received from the mayor of the French village of Montbeliard that a party of Campbeltonians will be welcome at the village#s music festival on July - this year.Provost Dan McKinven told the Courier: #I now propose to call a meeting within the Town Council Chambers of all interested in taking part. I would expect representation from pipers, Highland and Scottish country dancers, choirs and pop groups. Any inidual performer would also be welcome as a cross-section of our community and its talent is essential.#The present plan is to travel directly from Campbeltown to Montbeliard by luxury coach. The village is about km from the Swiss border and the city of Basel.Provost McKinven added: #We would expect to form a committee which would be responsible for organising the finance and travel arrangements for about  people inclusive of press, photographer and artists.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOTwo boys birchedAt a children#s court last Friday – Sherf McMaster Campbell on the bench – two boys were charged with the theft of purses containing money from a house in Burn Road. The crime was admitted.The boys, it appeared, were messengers, and the younger one was in the habit of calling at the house in this capacity daily. The purses were taken on separate days. On the first occasion a purse containing £ s d had been left lying on a small table near the window of one of the rooms. The window was probably partially open. After the younger boy#s visit in the afternoon it was missed.Next day a purse containing s d was left in the same position, and on the boy calling at the house, the occupier challenged him with the theft. He admitted taking the purse and handed it over to the owner. Only  shillings of the  shillings and sixpence remained in the purse.While this interview was going on at the back door of the residence, the older boy, who accompanied the other on the second occasion, appeared to have devoted his attention to the room where the first purse was got, and he possessed himself of the second purse and its contents. His lordship sentenced each of the culprits to receive seven strokes with the birch rod."},{"url":null,"title":"letters january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I see Loch Fyne langoustines are sent to the EU but, living fairly close to Loch Fyne, I don#t seem to be able to purchase the product locally.I am sure UK supermarkets would be only too happy to sell, crabs, lobsters and langoustines provided by Scottish fishermen but it seems they would prefer to supply the EU rather than the home market.Fishing boats enter Campbeltown Loch regularly but there is no local supply of their catch as this is transported #up the road# as soon as it is landed.I just suggest that supplying the UK market is maybe a way out of the continual problems with our #friendly# neighbours who seem hell bent on putting continual obstacles in the way of sensible trading partnerships.Keith Abendroth, Campbeltown.I grew up in Peninver and have been hiking on the hills around the Rest and Be Thankful many times, all year round. My initial thought a few years ago was that the best solution to the problem of landslides on the Rest was building avalanche tunnels like there are on the A at Lochcarron but there is practically zero ground to build on on the downhill side of the A.The big catch-pits along the uphill side of the road do seem to work but, in the long-term, removing the unstable soil and planting lots of trees and shrubs on the rest of the hillside to hold it in place, might be the best solution.Rather than replace the road through the Rest and Be Thankful with a new route through another glen or to continue trying to stop an unstable hillside from obeying the laws of gravity, how much would it cost to remove all the soil in these watercourses which regularly slide Maybe cost-wise removing the unstable soil from the Rest would be cheaper # and quicker  # than building a whole new road If there is a landslide in a watercourse, it weakens the soil directly above it so that will slide next, followed by the soil above it, etc. The bedrock at the Rest is only a couple of feet below the surface so removing the soil in gullies liable to slide after rain might be a lot cheaper than building a new road through another glen.For a permanent solution, perhaps close off the road from Ardgartan to the Lochgoilhead junction for six months in the winter, pipe water from Loch Restil to the top of the gullies prone to sliding # at the base of the first exposed bedrock high up the gullies # let the water run for three or four months, and hydraulically remove all the loose soil, then in the spring shovel all the accumulated debris of the other side of the road It would mean short-term inconvenience for a lot of people but it might save a lot of money, time, and perhaps lives, in the long-term.Harry Hood, New Hampshire, USA. As children and young peopleto being home-schooled due to the new lockdown, there is no doubt that this will have a continued detrimental impact on mental health and wellbeing.As a coalition, we applaud the Scottish Government’s greater investment in mental health services. However, a view we share with other organisations, is that this investment is simply not sufficient.Mental health services were already under immense strain prior to Covid-, with children waiting considerable s of time for support. Recent statistics from December, for example, point to the fact that more than , children have been waiting over a year for treatment.This pandemic will only serve to make matters even worse as services deal with a backlog of those already suffering from mental health problems, added to which will be those who have developed problems over the course of lockdown.What is needed is a national crusade, delivering signicant investment in the public, private and third sectors to deliver adequate mental health support, both during and as we recover from Covid-. We must also use this as an opportunity to radically transform our mental health services, both for now and for the future, refocusing on prevention and early intervention.In the meantime, we would urge those children and their families who feel they need help not to hold back and look to get the support they need.The Scottish Children’s Services Coalition: Kenny Graham, Falkland House School Lynn Bell, LOVE Learning Stephen McGhee, Spark of Genius Niall Kelly, Young Foundations.The serious neurological condition Myalgic Encephalomylitiswill sadly be all too familiar to some of your readers at least , children and adults in Scotland live with ME, also diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome .Many face barriers in accessing health and social care services that meet their needs, and some professionals still don’t understand the impact of ME and its symptoms.UK charity Action for ME is trying to change this by offering people with ME across Scotland one-to-one advocacy, via phone and email, to help them be heard, understand their rights and access support.We want to expand this much-needed service, and are seeking enthusiastic volunteers in Scotland who can make the most of our online advocate training programme to develop their skills, gain valuable experience, and help improve the lives of vulnerable people with ME, all from home.Anyone who is interested in finding out more can call , emailor visit our website– we would love to hear from good listeners who can spare two hours a week.Alice Cranston, advocacy coordinator, Action for ME."},{"url":null,"title":"mark beaumont goes the extra mile for marys meals","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It’s a fantastic way to get more active and also help feed hungry children in the world’s poorest communities.#Funds raised will allow Mary’s Meals to provide hungry children in some of the world’s poorest areas with a nutritious daily meal. The promise of food attracts impoverished children to the classroom, where they can gain an education that will one day hopefully be their ladder out of poverty.And thanks to Double the Love, donations made will go twice as far. Give until January , and the UK government with match public donations to the charity, up to £ million.Gillian McMahon, director of supporter engagement at Mary’s Meals, said: #Whether it’s doing your regular run, getting on your bike or upping your daily step count, we hope that lots of people will get moving and take part in Miles For Mary’s Meals.#Those taking part in Miles For Mary’s Meals are asked to ensure that they participate in their chosen exercise challenge safely and in line with Covid- restrictions in their local area.To find out more about organising your own Miles For Mary’s Meals fundraiser, visit marysmeals.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I’m anticipating an end to the pandemic – coming out of the gloom. And there have been many episodes in le in which I’ve lived in the hope of emerging through the other side of the dark night. I thank God for the hope he gives me. But, how do we know when the darkness of night has ended In a rabbinic school, a very old rabbi posed a clever question to his young students: #When can it be said that night truly ends and the day begins  When is that moment when from darkness there comes light, when it can really be said the gloom has passed and brightness is here #The first student, still a bit immature, replied: #Well, it’s when it says so on the internet.#The rabbi smiled and told him: #That’s not what I mean.#The next student said: #It’s when you can distinguish sheep from goats, because in the dark they look very similar, but when light appears they can be told apart.#The rabbi told him it was a wiser answer, but not the one.The third student said: #When you can tell the fig tree and palm tree apart.#This interested the rabbi, but, no, this wasn’t it. The rabbi askedthere were any other ideas, but there weren’t. So he told them the answer: #It is when you look at another person and do not see a stranger but a brother or sister this is when know the night has ended and the day begins.#Father Tony Wood, Saint Kieran#s Catholic Church, Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +viaYOURTWITTERNAMEHERE\" title\"Tweet this\"TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

After nearly a year of people taking exercise and essential journeys on foot during Covid- lockdowns, plans to keep the nation walking are more important than ever.#The increases in people walking, has highlighted the lack of good infrastructure to support safe and enjoyable travel by foot. Communities that lack local facilities within walking distance have had challenges. That’s why we are calling for investment in everyday walking to build back better after the pandemic, and respond to the challenges of air pollution, climate change and Scotland#s health record.#Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer of Paths for All, said: #We launch our manesto at a crucial point of change for Scotland as we begin to plan for le after Covid-. During lockdown, we have seen a rise in the number of people walking as many used it as a way to cope with the pressures of everyday le, to reach essential shops and services in their  area, and to connect with others and nature in a safe way.#But we need to do more to make regular walking an enjoyable and accessible choice for everyone in Scotland, from all walks of le. By investing in walking programmes and safe, attractive places to walk we can signicantly improve the nation’s health, reducing health inequalities and pressure on our NHS.#Brendan Paddy, director of Ramblers Scotland, said: #Our joint manesto makes a compelling case for investment to make walking safe and attractive for everyone in Scotland.#We believe walking can play a vital role in Scotland’s response to the challenges of Covid- and climate change # and the obesity, bioersity and mental health crises we face. Booming numbers are enjoying the outdoors in the Covid era and we need to support these people to continue to get all the health and wellbeing benefits of outdoor recreation for years to come.#"},{"url":null,"title":"why your business must act now to continue trading with europe","story":"Wyvex MediaUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It will be aired on March  at pm.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOPressure piled on for quick Irish ferry decisionPressure was growing earlier this week on the Scottish Secretary to give Caledonian MacBrayne the go-ahead to operate the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Ballycastle in Northern Ireland.Scottish Office officials are said to oppose state-owned CalMac’s participation in the project.But earlier this week it was revealed they had asked CalMac to submit a business plan for the route. The news was welcomed by the prospective Conservative candidate for Argyll and Bute, Mr Ralph Leishman.He told the Courier: ‘This is a definite step forward and knocks on the head suggestions that the Scottish Office is totally opposed to CalMac as the operator on this route.’Scottish Office reservations are believed to centre on proposals to use the MV Claymore on the route. This would mean £, would have to be spent upgrading another vessel for relief work for its west coast services.They are also said to be concerned that no private firm appeared to be interested in running the service all year-round.CalMac’s participation in the project has been backed by politicians on both sides of the Irish Sea.Both Scottish Secretary Mr Michael Forsyth and Prime Minister Mr John Major were believed this week to have been lobbied at Westminster by CalMac’s supporters.Northern Ireland secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew is said to be among those who have contacted Mr Forsyth to support CalMac’s involvement.The project supporters have been asking the Scottish Office to consider the economic benefits the ferry could bring to Ballycastle and Campbeltown, which are both areas of high unemployment. The project is expected to create around  jobs,  of them in Argyll.The only other company which has expressed an interest in running the service, Seacat, only wants to operate it over a four-month summer season.FIFTY YEARS AGOMr Noble ill # so Provost steps in to open new airport terminalThe new passenger terminal at Machrihanish Airport will be opened on Friday at pm by Provost Dan McKinven, in the absence of Mr Michael Noble MP Minister of Trade, through illness.The new building, which has been provided by the Department of Trade and Industry in conjunction with the Ministry of Defence, is a small one situated within a self-contained enclave and is designed to improve the facilities of BEA passengers using Machrihanish.Before the terminal was built, all BEA passengers had to be taken by bus between the aircraft and the old terminal building near the main entrance of the airport, and, latterly, to a dispersal point on the south side.Under the new improvements, BEA aircraft will now taxi directly to the new terminal area, and passengers will be able to walk the short distance from the aircraft to the terminal.A new road traffic control system has also been provided because aircraft taxiing from the runway to the terminal have to cross a public road.The new arrangements have the additional advantage of reducing the distance, and, consequently, the journey time between the airport and Campbeltown.A complete shake-up of BEA Highland services is on the way. It could mean higher fares and smaller planes and the end of the name British European Airways on some routes.Last year the Highlands and Islands routes cost the company more than £,.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and FlashesThe annual meeting in connection with the Campbeltown Cottage Hospital will be held on Tuesday first at . in the Council Room.Local footballers had again an idle Saturday last week on account of bad weather.

His solution is even more batty.Driven by resentment and sepia-tinted post-Empire English nationalism, cloaked in talk of Britain and the UK, the Tories have jemmied the UK out of the world’s largest and most successful single market.Having placed the UK as a #third country# outside the EU, alongside Somalia and Kazakhstan, it is not the EU to blame for the barriers to free trade, Mr Abendroth, but the UK government and those who parroted the cruel myths of Brexiteer #sunny uplands#.Mr Abendroth suggests that the fishing industry merely sells into the domestic market as a replacement to EU trade, without thought to the timescales required to repurpose supply lines and create a viable home market # evenit could be done fishing businesses would already be bankrupt.Scotland’s economy and the living standards and opportunities of Scots have been thrown under the wheels of England’s red Brexit bus. Never have the consequences of permitting Westminster to rule our country been more stark.But the time is coming when Scotland will have the historic opportunity to regain the huge benefits of EU membership and become a normal, thriving, independent state at the heart of Europe. There is an empty seat at the top table in Europe # and it won’t be empty for long.Ron Wilson, secretary, Kintyre SNP.Remember the closing stages of the Brexit negotiations  Boris Johnson pretended he was holding out to get the best deal for fishermen. In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark – grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are – the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal ward.Keith Abendroth is spot on with his call for the fishing industry in Campbeltown to supply the home market.During my three-and-a-half years in the town it was possible to buy directly from the boat on occasion but it was nigh on impossible to buy fresh live lobster in the town#s fish shop.When I was new to the town , I experienced some shocking service at the some of the small retailers who I always endeavour to support. It is easier to get a full range of seafood and fish in Peebles, about  miles from the sea, which has an excellent fish shop supplied from Eyemouth on the East Coast.Much Welsh shellfish is sent by air to Europe. I often wondered why lorries trundled from Campbeltown across the Rest and Be Thankful and all the way to the English Channel crossings.Much of the st century supply chain is a mystery to me. For instance, much Pacic wild salmon is processed in China before being exported to the UK.  It is an excellent alternative to the farmed version at roughly the same price.Surely a town with an airport could develop a sea product freight service or is it simply down to volume, weight and cost Mark Davey, Peebles.Two weeks ago, at Campbeltown Free Church, we received a letter of thanks from Blythswood Care for filling shoeboxes to support the  Shoe Box Appeal.However, we are aware that many who contributed do not belong to Campbeltown Free Church.So, through the pages of the Courier, can I thank them for their kindness towards people they have never met but whose lives have been enriched by their generosity Dr Rodger M Crooks, Campbeltown Free Church minister.Like many, many other residents in Argyll and Bute I have received through the post a bizarre leaflet from the Liberal Democrats. Bizarre, because it promotes a candidate standing in a completely dferent seat # Caithness, Sutherland and Ross.Meanwhile, the good folk of Caithness, Sutherland and Ross have been equally mystied as to why the hapless Lib Dems have sent them leaflets promoting a candidate in Argyll and Bute!The Lib Dems have certainly lost their way when it comes to their policy on the EU # but it seems that they#ve lost their way in Scotland too.Les Wilson, Islay.Earlier this month the Prime Minister announced a third national lockdown. Although necessary, these measures mean many of our veterans will be facing the next several weeks – or months – completely alone.And while the vaccine rollout out across the country provides some hope, social isolation and loneliness poses a real threat to our elderly this winter, among them many former RAF personnel and their partners supported by the fund.To help combat this, last year the RAF Benevolent Fund introduced a weekly Check and Chat service to support members of the RAF Family experiencing loneliness. I speak to one such gentleman every Tuesday. He lives alone and spent much of  totally isolated and, for him, this service truly is a leline. We chat about what he’s been up to, what he’s cooking for tea, to his time in the RAF and often I’m the only person he will speak to for days.The fund also organises weekly telephone friendship groups, provides access to a listening and counselling service, relationship counselling support, and an online wellbeing portal to help support emotional wellbeing amongst the veteran community.Throughout the pandemic, many of us have learnt more about our neighbours and local community. That’s why we are calling on the people of Scotland to consider whether they know any RAF veterans, or their spouses or widows, who may be experiencing loneliness.To refer someone to the RAF Benevolent Fund, please visit rafbf.org or call   .Air Vice-Marshal Chris Elliot, chief executive, RAF Benevolent Fund."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 29 2021","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I cannot help but think that it bodes well for the future of that great nation to have a man of faith leading it.Returning to the words, some of the finest and most moving that day came from a young woman called Amanda Gorman.She spoke of lting the gaze of the nation not to what stands between its people, but to what stands before them, of closing ides because they know that, to put their future first, they must first put dferences aside.#The new dawn,# she said, #blooms as we free it.

This adaptation means that they are ideally suited to being houseplants, particularly in homes where the owners are forgetful waterers!Succulent is a general description for plants that have tissues adapted to store water but doesnrsquot refer to a specic plant. On the other hand, cactus is a botanical name for plants belonging to the plant family Cactaceae and, for specic physiological reasons, may not always be regarded as succulents.Succulent suggestionsAmongst the toughest, most robust indoor succulents is the sanseveria, a wide range of plants whose common names include mother-in-lawrsquos tongue , snake plantand birds nest plant .With bold, thick, simple leaves, theyrsquore almost sculptural in appearance, tolerant of low light levels and, because they require minimal attention, theyrsquore an obvious choice for those with little or no experience of houseplants.Sanseveria are particularly good at improving the indoor air quality theyrsquore known to remove air pollutants including formaldehyde, xylene and toluene and, because they convert carbon dioxide to oxygen at night, theyrsquore popular bedroom plants.Another group of plants that are particularly easy to care for are the aloes, which the ancient Egyptians called lsquoimmortality plantsrsquo because they are almost indestructible.The natural healing benefits of aloe vera has made it popular for centuries and is iously credited with the ability to soothe irritated or burned skin, improve skin, hair, oral hygiene and digestion and to treat acne and arthritis.Like sanseveria, aloe requires very little care, tolerates low light levels and infrequent watering, removes air-borne pollutants and oxygenates the air at night, which aids sleep.One of our favourite succulents is the echiveria, which grows in compact rosettes of succulent, sometimes coloured leaves from which flowering stalks may grow.These plants like a reasonable amount of light, some dilute feed when actively growing and prefer under-watering to over-watering. A happy echiveria will produce little plantlets which can be removed and grown into new plants.Carefree cactusIt would be impossible to talk about easy-to-care for plants without mentioning cacti, which have well-developed survival adaptations.Most cacti have developed spines which in fact are highly modied leaves. Not only do these spines help prevent the plant being grazed, but they also reduce the airflow around the plant, which helps it conserve water.Photosynthesis takes place on the stemand its shallow, far-reaching root system enables the cactus to react quickly and absorb any water reaching the ground.Whilst the enormous tree-like cacti of the American desert may be the first cactus that springs to mind, wersquove highlighted some interesting houseplant types below that are incredibly easy to look after and certainly wonrsquot take over your home!There are many dferent shapes of cacti, including round, flat, columnar, smooth, bumpy, ribbed and fluted, and itrsquos important to note that some of these actually change shape depending on how much water is stored in the stem at the time!Not all cacti have fully developed spines. For example, the popular schlumbergera, of which the best-known culti is the Christmas-flowering cactus, has less modied leaves which look like lsquoteethrsquo along the edge of their stems. Their stems grow in lsquosegmentsrsquo and resemble flattened pads, with their flowers being produced at the end of the segments.Although the Christmas-flowering culti is most popular in the UK, there are dferent cultis which flower at dferent times of the year.In their natural habitat, schlumbergera grow on trees or in rocks and generally enjoy shady habitats with high humidity, making them an ideal choice for bathrooms.If yoursquore looking for an unusual and interesting but easy-to-care-for indoor hanging plant, you might consider the aporocactus ndash a group of tree-growing cactus that grow well in a hanging pot.For a cactus with impact, the gymnocalycium mihanovichii is a sure winner. The top part of the stem on this cactus lacks green pigmentand can be bright red, yellow or other amazing colours.So,yoursquore looking for a plant that thrives on neglect, hopefully wersquove given you some ideas!Just remember that the golden rule for cacti and succulents is to under-water rather than over-water ndash too much moisture will cause disease and rot.For more information, take a look on our website at www.merryhatton"},{"url":null,"title":"mary-contini-column-food-thought-covid","story":"To be able to buy vegetables from the likes of Crunchy Carrot in Dunbar or Phantassie in East Linton is my foodie heaven !It is probably more expensive to shop locally and, as you need to drive to dferent outlets, it does take longer.For hard-pressed working families, this is not always an option.

 per cent more than in a normal year.A report lodged in the councils members library service describes a \"motorhome invasion\" in the summer with parking bays taken up.And it said July  was the busiest day in  years, according to East Lothians countryside rangers service.Coastal car parks overflowed with people parking illegally on access roads and wild camping incidents regularly saw groups of  tents gathered at any given site.The report said it was only face to face engagement with visitors by countryside rangers which helped the county avoid many of the dirty camping issues other Scottish beauty spots experienced but there were still issues with indiscriminate toileting and litter as well as fires causing damage to woodlands.Between June and August, , tents and motorhomes were recorded in the coastal car parks.RECAP: Patrols carried out after human waste left by campersThe report said: \"The number of tents at both Yellowcraig and Tyninghame was particularly high and the most affected compared to other coastal sites, with one weekend recording tents at Tyninghame and  tents at Yellowcraig.\"Associated issues were fire damage to the SSSI grassland and dune habitats, irresponsible toileting, tree damage bythose scavenging for wood and generally camping out with the guidance with the Scottish Outdoor Access Code, to the inconvenience of other users or detriment of their experience with coastal sites.\"New camping information signage was installed although high levels of camping and fire sites persisted.\"The proposed changes to car parking rules would mean motorhomes would be unable to use any coastal car parks overnight and would be directed to the new park.The report revealed: \"The council is in talks with Tarmac for Barns Ness to be a potential site specically designated for motorhomes.\" In relation to existing coastal car park provision, it is proposed to ban overnight parking, and control through a twilight parking enforcement service in the evenings and overnight.\"In this way, motorhome and campers can be directed to purpose-built accommodation. This will ensure that the coastal car parks which have been established as a resource will enable locals and visitors to enjoy the coast as opposed to being motorhome sites.\"A ban of overnight parking will effectively close the car parks for vehicle use and prohibit any vehicle from staying overnight \"The proposed changes would also see an increased stretch of coastal road where parking is banned.No waiting restrictions are proposed for the B between Dean Road and Seton Sands Caravan Park and on the south side from Dean Road to Lyars Road, Longniddry.The public consultation went online today ateastlothianconsultations policy-partnerships land-management-rules "},{"url":null,"title":"find-information-google-stores","story":"The information includes your age, gender, profession and interests based on what Google has managed to find out about you from how you use its services.When you use Google products including the search engine and over services such as Gmail, the company collects data to personalise ads specically for each user in an effort to make them more successful.This information is available for anybody to see as long as you are logged into a Google account.How to find out what Google assumes about youIn response to a TikTok trend asking users what obscure facts they know because of their job, digital marketer and TikTok user @tiktoktrishkabob caused a huge stir on the video .She said: ldquoSo, Irsquom a digital marketer, and I donrsquot think anybody realises just how invasive Google is.ldquoAndyoursquove ever thought, ldquohuh, this is a weird ad for me to be seeing therersquos actually a website that you can go to, to see all of the assumptions Google has made about you based on your previous searches.ldquoSo, as long as yoursquore logged into a device thatrsquos logged into your Google account, typeadssettings.google into the search bar.ldquoAnd here, yoursquoll be able to see every assumption Google has made about you, and why you see the ads that you see.Kabob then goes through her own assumptions that Google has about her, stating that it has her age range, gender identity and parental status correct.Kabob says: ldquoIf you have ever Googled it, itrsquos somewhere in here.ldquoYou can edit specic factors, like Irsquom not even quite sure what microblogging is, and you can also turn off ad personalisation altogether.

He says it should be capable of tracking and verying an iniduals vaccine status across the world.It could, according to Blair, involve not only how many vaccinations someone has had , but also any test results they may have had in the past.It is hoped that the data would be transferred using a QR code, which would be scanned by participating countries at borders and ports.In evidence to the Scottish Parliamentrsquos Covid- Committee on Thursday, Professor Leitch said coronavirus is likely to be present in some sort of ldquoendemic form for years to come.When he was asked about vaccine passports, hesaid: ldquoI agree it is an interesting concept, the WHOhave begun to look at it.He stressed the latest scientic evidence suggests vaccination is not a ldquobinary state, but there is precedent for travel restrictions based on vaccination ndash including yellow fever certicates.Prof Leitch said: ldquoI think we will probably move towards that.

It is not yet classed as mutton, which is older yet, sold up to  years old and has a far more gamey, stronger flavour.The lamb we buy now benefits from longer slow cooking with fuller flavours added to complement its taste.

The good path runs up the steep, airy edge of Gleouraichrsquos south-west ridge above Loch Quoich near Glengarry, a superb stalkersrsquo path that has been well maintained by the estate. But close by, at the eastern end of Loch Quoich, just south of its dam, another path leads to the Druim na Geid Salaich, a long, rising ridge that in turn gives access to the Munro of Gairich.The boggy, rutted, poorly drained and badly eroded nature of this path shouldnrsquot really surprise anyone for this is a land notorious for its high rainfall. The area around Loch Quoich, just west of Glen Garry, has the distinction of being one of the wettest places in Scotland.The area enjoys a real wilderness feel, despite the presence of a single-track road that runs along the north shore of the loch between Glen Garry and Kinloch Hourn.For all its wetness, the Loch Quoich area, and its Munros, remains a great favourite amongst hill bashers.Gairichstands in splendid isolation on the south side of the loch, gazing across the neck of water towards the Glengarry twins of Gleouraich and Spidean Mialach. A little way along the road north of the loch lies another magnicent Munro, Sgurr arsquo Mhaoraich.Irsquove often driven along this road and thought that the finest way to climb Gairich would be to canoe across the loch and climb the hill by its broad north ridge. You could then canoe back across the loch and add Sgurr arsquo Mhaoraich to your dayrsquos tally.This time, given the shorter hours of daylight, I was content with one Munro. After weeks of rain and wind, the Celtic winter god Biera got her act together, flourished her icicle wand and enveloped much of the Highlands in a smattering of snow and icy temperatures. This would be a good time to tackle Gairich, and I was hopeful her horrendously boggy approaches would form a deep-frozen highway.A pale sun shone from a milky, creamy sky as I set out but despite the low temperatures underfoot conditions were not ideal ndash as the rainwater that had previously flooded the path had turned to ice. I might have been better with ice skates so I left the slippery path after a kilometre or so, and took a more direct route, over crisp, crunchy frozen turf, onto the Druim na Geid Salaich.Once I reached the crest of the ridge overhead conditions dramatically improved too. Great streaks of blue sky appeared through the high cloud and the sun broke through ndash the first Irsquod seen in weeks. Away ahead of me I could see other climbers on the sharply defined east ridge of Gairich and beyond lay the jumbled hills of Knoydart.As the ridge widens out onto the Bac nam Foid it usually becomes increasingly boggy and cut up by peat hags, but a couple of inches of fresh snow lay on top of old neacuteveacute, hard snow that has frozen and thawed several times, and it was delight to walk on it. Soon I was climbing up through rocky outcrops and crags, avoiding the icy sections as much as possible.Various tracks cross the south-east slopes of this hill and itrsquos easy to follow them too far west, but by keeping on a rising traverse as close to the crest as possible I managed to pick a line through the dficulties to the surprisingly broad summit ridge and cairn.The cold was intense but the views were magnicent, the white crests of the hills rising from russet flanks. I could see the Cuillin of Skye, I could see Ben Nevis crouching over its acolytes but best of all were the Knoydart hills, wild Scotland in all her winter glory.Cameron McNeishROUTE PLANNERMap: OS :, Landranger sheet  Distance:  miles lkmApprox Time: - hoursStart Finish: Loch Quoich dam .Route: From S end of dam a path leads to an old stalkersrsquo path that runs S over boggy moors to the edge of a forestry plantation. Here, another path runs due W up the Druim na Geid Salaich. Once the broad ridge crest is reached the path peters out but the going is easy and the broad ridge should be followed W to the final steep pull to Gairich. At the foot of this final rise a path reappears, but after a while it runs out on to the S face. Donrsquot be tempted by it but continue climbing on the ridge crest to the spacious summit and large cairn.

Itrsquos looking at the landscape and thinking of how to integrate it or using an old technique to produce a product that meets the expectations of todayrsquos customers, she adds.ldquoItrsquos using an unexpected part of heritage in a dferent way to tell stories.The seminar organisers have pointed to recent work by Edinburgh-based Craft Design House, which has drawn inspiration from the le of Arctic adventurer, botanist and writer Isobel Wylie Hutchison to create a collection of wearable, accessories and homeware.While some designers, such as Fair Isle knitwear specialist Mati Ventrillon, have already taken inspiration from museum collections of traditional designs and patterns of the past to create new, highly desirable fashion items for new markets.Others have fused traditional Highland products in innovative ways to ignite the interest of modern consumers - such as a range of Harris Tweed imbued with the scent of whisky, the result of a project involving Harris Tweed Hebrides, Johnnie Walker Black Label and textile experts at Heriot-Watt University.Clare Campbell of Prickly Thistle says while her tartan products are soaked in Highland heritage, they are created with modern customersrsquo demands for sustainability, heritage and style in mind.ldquoWersquore disrupting the way tartan is produced on a number of levels, she adds. ldquoWe are using cast iron looms that give us more creative freedom, are highly sustainable and create more jobs.ldquoWersquore disrupting the clan system of tartan design and working collaboratively with people around the world.ldquoWe make kilts, but we are also pushing forward towards creating modern styles of highland dress and new designs that have zero waste.ldquoConsumers now realise that mass consumerism is killing everything, and theyrsquore looking for products that are more than fast fashion.Meanwhile in Orkney, textile designer Kirsteen Stewartrsquos window showcases the arearsquos natural heritage, with dramatic open skies, rugged coastlines and the power of the sea inspiring her range of textiles.While most become clothes or accessories, she has found an innovative use for some fabric ndash as a vibrant splash of colour and shape on a surfboard.She has also delved into the archives of Orkney jewellery designer Sheila Fleet for a collaborative collection of scarves and is working with other local creatives using natural heritage and skills as inspiration for prints inspired by the underwater landscape of Scapa Flow Bay and a corset made from rope.ldquoOur lestyles are changing, and people want to buy products with an authentic story behind them, she says.She has plans to develop the surfboard and swimwear, both items typically associated with tropical designs but which she says could instead be decorated with the patterns inspired by Orkney plants, sunsets or underwater seascapes.Iain Hamilton, Head of Creative Industries at Highlands and Islands Enterprise, and co-founder of XpoNorth, says: ldquoProvenance and authenticity is a big selling point at the moment.ldquoPeople want to buy things that are more than just an immediate product they want something that has really some meaning behind it.He suggests Highland and Islands producers might look to Scandinavian countries, where traditions and heritage have inspired distinctive lsquoScandic stylersquo products and influenced literature and film.ldquoThe Highlands can have a similar impact ndash therersquos a feeling and a look that people identy with.ldquoItrsquos not about recreating the past, he adds. ldquoItrsquos about how to use the things form the past to create something new, but which tells you a story.The online seminars, which run until April, are available at www.exponorth."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12273788.jpg?type=article-full","title":"gorbals-can-inspire-scotlands-town-centres-future","story":"Densely populated, roamed by razor gangs and gripped by appalling poverty, the Gorbals became synonymous with everything that was wrong with Scottish housing while its hard done by residents were admired for their strong community bonds, spirit and compassion.Now, in a remarkable turnaround that would no doubt have tenants of the past reeling, the Gorbals is being held up as a prime example of the neighbourhood of the future.According to Craig McLaren, Director of Scotland, Ireland and English Regions at the Royal Town Planning Institute , the arearsquos regeneration has created the kind of ldquo-minute neighbourhood ndash where almost all of whatrsquos required by its residents can be reached within a short walk or cycle - that could become a blueprint for the post-Covid- landscape.:High-rise in Glasgows Gorbals to be demolished on SundayThe organisation is now calling for Scottish Government funding to help communities across Scotland lay down plans for their own neighbourhoods of the future.ldquoThe Gorbals has high quality housing, quite high density and a lot of it built on ideas of the past, he says.ldquoThere is a library, a community centre, supermarket and a range of other shops and it has green space. Itrsquos well designed. There are links to public transport so people who need to go outside the area for other services can get to the city centre easily, by walking or by bus.ldquoRegeneration was reusing land that had been used before, not digging up greenfield sites.ldquoIt was developed through a masterplan put in place that set out how to develop it over a long period, so it was phased and with the public and private sectors working together.Last September the First Ministerrsquos Programme for Government pledged poundm investment over five years to support active travel and poundm to support investment in communities including lsquo-minute neighbourhoodsrsquo.Originally developed in Portland, Oregon, and intended to boost prosperity, health, equality and educational outcomes, -minute neighbourhoods are carefully planned to give residents with almost everything they need for day to day living on their doorstep, undoing the need for a car.The idea has been adopted in Paris, where authorities are championing a rsquo-minute cityrsquo, and Melbourne in Australia where it is embedded in the cityrsquos long-term planning strategy.Momentum here has grown in the wake of Covid- pandemic lockdowns, which have left city centres deserted and highlighted the benefits of communities with services alongside homes, where residents can access public green space, walk or cycle instead of using cars, and with good digital connectivity to enable working from home or at local digital hubs.The idea harks back to generations past before key services such as libraries, GP surgeries, Post Offices and shops were centralised in sometimes hard to reach locations, retail parks and out of town developments.Supporters say a knock-on impact of -minute neighbourhoods would be less congestion in city centres, with urban office space potentially converted into affordable housing and an expansion of leisure facilities.The high-rise flats were destroyed in The RTPI Scotland is now calling on the Scottish Government to release funds so communities can work with the public and private sector to develop their own Local Place Plans and -minute neighbourhoods.It is also highlighting the need for a greater role for professional planners, including investment in planning jobs and ato days when town planners were highly influential with influence on local authoritiesrsquo asset management and spending.According to Mr McLaren, carefully planned -minute neighbourhoods could bring a wide range of benefits.ldquoIn terms of trying to reach zero carbon targets, people will not need to travel as much, he says. ldquoTherersquod be health benefits for people because people can access green spaces. Covid- has shown how people have valued having local amenities and green spaces around them.:A walking tour of Glasgows transformed Laurieston districtRedesigning neighbourhoods around the -minute model could help address inequality in how services, amenities and work can be accessed by the third of Scottish households who do not own a car, a figure which increases to half in deprived areas.It would also align with active travel and public transport strategies, helping to lower car use and boost demand for buses while bringing health benefits of more walking and cycling.Reduced need for roads and car parking would then open up green areas for play, community use and growing food.An important element of creating -minute neighbourhoods is ensuring local communities are empowered to design the places in which they live, adds Mr McLaren.ldquoThe way people engage with planning tends to be through objections to a planning application. We want to flip that so people tell us what they want rather than what they donrsquot want.RITP Scotland has called for investment in planning departments, which have faced the largest cuts in local government expenditure since   and seen % staffing cuts.ldquoWe currently have a fairly opportunist and short-term uncoordinated approach to how we plan things. Planning is not used to full effect, he adds.ldquoWe do need to change the way we live our lives and the way our places feel and look. We need to start thinking to longer term and move away from very opportunistic ways of developing our towns and cities.Stuart Hay, Director, Living Streets Scotland says the disruption to work and travel brought by Covid- is a ldquoonce in a generation opportunity to tackle a host of transport-based societal problems, including carbon emissions, air pollution, inactivity-related diseases, traffic accidents and weak community connections.He adds: ldquoWe need to get more people walking their short everyday journeyswersquore to tackle the climate emergency, boost our local economies and become healthier. This means getting the basics right and improving infrastructure.ldquoBy creating rsquo-minute neighbourhoodsrsquo, which build facilities close to where people live and work, we can make walking a more pleasant and convenient option for many more people.ldquoIf you plan for cars - you get traffic and emissions. Butyou plan for people and places ndash you get more walking and great places to live.Sustainable transport charity Sustrans also supports the idea of -minute neighbourhoods.Daisy Narayanan, Director of Urbanism, says: ldquoCities and towns should be places that connect us to each other and the things we need, and should be places where everyone can thrive without being locked into car dependency.ldquoThe best way to do this is to ensure that it is easy for people to meet most of their everyday needs in their local area.ldquoNeighbourhoods are defined by the communities who live there, and each will have unique expectations of the services and facilities they need.ldquoHowever, the coronavirus pandemic, and the subsequent lockdowns that have been put in place across the country, highlight how vital it is for people to be able to live locally, and to be able to access shops, health centres and schools by using safe and physically distanced modes of transport such as walking and cycling.ldquoToo many neighbourhoods have been planned around car travel at the expense of providing the local jobs and services that a community needs to thrive. It is important that we learn from what we are experiencing now to shape our towns and cities of the future."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-vaccine-nationalism-shows-not-together","story":"In fact, the very reverse has been the case, as nations have rediscovered their primary role in protecting their own people first. Borders are back. The globalisation trend of the last half century is being thrown into reverse as travel is banned indefinitely and international supply chains collapse. When Donald Trump closed the borders to EU travellers back in March he was attacked for being xenophobic, even racist. Now everyonersquos shutting borders. Nationalism is on the march: from Scotland to New Zealand.Vaccine nationalism has now ripped through Europe. Brussels has resorted to the modern equivalent of gunboat diplomacy: issuing threats, raiding factories, seeking to halt the movement of vaccines, even ldquomistakenly trying to create a hard border in Ireland.

Nicola Sturgeon has also got in the blame game, apparently claiming UK responsibility for the delays in the Scottish vaccine programme.Opposition parties claim it is rather a result of her inefficiency.Brussels, meanwhile, is trying to strong arm AstraZeneca into redirecting some of its UK vaccine supply to Europe. It is also threatening to block exports of the Pfizer vaccine from Europe.This would be an extraordinary lapse into vaccine protectionism. It would arguably be illegal under EU laws on state intervention and free movement. But when lives are at stake, who cares about laws.The situation in Europe is undoubtedly dire. Countries like Spain and Portugal, which are struggling to cope with a menacing third wave of Covid, have been forced to cancel immunisation programmes. Old people could die as a result of not getting their jags on time.The European press is furious and has accused Brussels of a catastrophic failure to meet its obligations.Brussels had insisted on negotiating for vaccines collectively for all countries above the heads of inidual nation states.This was to prevent a recurrence of the chaotic border closures last April, and the unedying sight of EU countries squabbling over the delivery of PPE masks and gowns. It didnrsquot want smaller countries to be left behind, either. Unfortunately, the whole of the EU has now found itself in the vaccine slow lane.Britain got ahead of the curve, for once.In March, long before it was even known whether a vaccine against Covid- was possible, the UK Government decided to invest massively in the development of what it regarded as the most likely candidates.It pumped money into the Oxford research and, more importantly, into AstraZenecarsquos manufacturing supply chain. The UK Vaccine Taskforce recruited , volunteers to test future vaccines. This meant thatand when new ones emerged they could receive regulatory approval very quickly.The UK Government signed contracts with AstraZeneca for  million doses three months before Brussels.:Covid vaccine Scotland: How many jags in my area The EU held out for a lower cost and got caught in bureaucratic delays trying to negotiate for all  nations in the Union. The EU had still not authorised the AstraZeneca vaccine for use last week, even as it was accusing the firm ndash which makes no profit from the vaccine ndash of selling to the highest bidder.All hell broke loose on January  when AstraZeneca told Brussels that because of problems in its Belgian plant, it could only supply one-quarter of the  million odd doses it had agreed to deliver by March.The company insists that it had entered into what is called a ldquobest effort agreement, and that it gave no cast-iron commitment to deliver come what may.The UK Government has sought to keep out of the row. There has been some injudicious crowing from Brexiters like Nigel Farage. But Boris Johnson has tried to sound magnanimous, offering to help out in the EU once its UK order has been fulfilled.But no way is he agreeing to give up British vaccines ordered and paid for. If he did, the immunisation schedule would be delayed here and people in the UK might die.Itrsquos the age-old question of altruism: are you willing to risk the lives of British people in order to save lives in other countries As in wartime, the first responsibility of any government in a national crisis is always going to be the welfare of its own people. This is a legal responsibility of the state, though one so obvious that it rarely needs to be stated.The sight of the richest countries on the planet squabbling over millions of vaccines is unedying, to put it mildly. Many African countries have been able only to get their hands on hundreds or less. However, the poor countries have been cautious in their condemnation.They need this to be resolved quickly so they can get sorted with vaccines under the UN-sponsored COVAX programme. The UK has pledged pound million, rather more than the EU.With the world watching there is a moral imperative for this disgraceful row to be resolved as quickly as possible.Fortunately, new vaccines seem to be arriving almost by the week, like the Valneva vaccine which is to be manufactured in Livingston. Once again, the UK pre-ordered  million doses and invested heavily in manufacturing before there was any guarantee of success.Boris Johnson made a point of visiting the plant last week to demonstrate the ldquobenefits of the Union.The question being asked in the capitals of Europe, and in Germany in particular, is why the European Union, with all its buying power, was left so flat-footed.It underlines a basic contradiction in the constitutional arrangements. It is baked into the DNA of the EU that nationalism is a curse, which in many ways it is. They talk of ldquoBritish exceptionalism and ldquoBrexit nativism asthis is a character defect.However, the problem with Brussels is precisely that it is not a nation and does not see itself as responsible to any one national community.The European Commission is not a democratic institution and cannot be held to account through a general election. It is a bureaucracy which, like all bureaucracies, puts its own protocols first.Everything has to be processed through the national governments of  member states. Nimble it is not.A delay in supply might have seemed a small price to pay for ensuring that all of Europe moved at the same pace. However, it failed to appreciate that the voters in member countries would not see it that way.In future, Europe may have to become a proper state or the nations may, to coin a phrase, take back control."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12275508.jpg?type=article-full","title":"neil-mackays-big-read-scottish-academics-go-head-to-head-nations-ugly-legacy-slavery","story":"Their explosive exchange shows just how far we have to go as a country before we truly come to terms with our past. Writer at Large Neil Mackay reportsIF evidence were needed of Scotlandrsquos bitter, unresolved legacy of slavery, then proof is to be found in the tense and at times acrimonious relationship between two of Scotlandrsquos most distinguished academics when it comes to the truth about our nationrsquos past.Sir Tom Devine is Scotlandrsquos most distinguished historian, and the man who quite literally wrote the book on the nationrsquos role in empire and slavery. Sir Geoff Palmer is Scotlandrsquos first black professor, and a champion of the Black Lives Matter movement.This week, The Herald on Sunday hosted the pair in a private online debate about Scotland, slavery and the legacy of history.Fittingly, the debate occurred on Burns Night. The legacy of Scotlandrsquos national poet is now under reassessment itself given he once considered taking up an overseer position on a slave plantation.To say the discussion was fraught is an understatement. At the heart of the two academicsrsquo dferences is the way Scotland should view Sir Henry Dundas ndash an Edinburgh aristocrat who became one of the most powerful men in the British empire during the late s. Dundas, known as ldquothe Uncrowned King of Scotland, was right-hand man to Prime Minister William Pitt.He was at the heart of the wars against revolutionary France and British expansion in India. Victorians saw him as a towering symbol of the Enlightenment.A statute of him stands in Edinburgh. However, today he is infamous for his role in slavery.In , the anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce put a motion before parliament calling for slavery to be abolished.Although Dundas claimed he opposed slavery, he tabled an amendment calling for ldquogradual abolition and for the slave trade to be ended ldquoby moderate measures.It wasnrsquot until , therefore, that the slave trade was eventually outlawed ndash although it took until  for a full ban on the owning of slaves to be enforced. Campaigners see Dundas as guilty of continuing one of the most dreadful crimes in world history.As a result, amid the Black Lives Matter protests last year, a plaque was erected at Dundasrsquos statue denouncing him as instrumental in preventing the abolition of slavery, and so responsible for continuing atrocities across the Caribbean.Palmer played a central role in ensuring the plaque went up. Devine takes issue not only with how Dundasrsquos role in the continuation of slavery is perceived, but also with the way in which the plaque was erected. Their dferences strike right at the heart of how Scotland deals with its legacy of slavery.Scottish amnesiaWhat is clear, though, is that both men hold slavery in utter contempt and detest modern racism. Nevertheless, their dispute over the interpretation of the past is rancorous.Devine begins by noting that Scotland has only recently started coming to terms with its history of slavery. The study of ldquoslavery and Scotland as a subject ldquowas only really born about  years ago whereas England has been debating the issue since the post-war period.ldquoTo some extent, the passions in the south have already been exhausted whereas in Scotland so much of this material is new and challenging, he says.Over the last decade or so, it has become clear, says Devine, ldquothat Scotland was implicated deeply in the reality and the legacy of slavery hellip Every nook and cranny of Scottish le had direct or indirect connections to slave-based economies across the Atlantic in the th century.He adds: ldquoDespite the fact that Scotland had collective amnesia over this issue for centuries hellip Scotland was actually more dependent on these slave-based economic systems than England. Much of Scotlandrsquos wealth and industrial revolution was dependent on slavery. Palmer says that when he has given lectures around the country many people have been completely unaware of Scotlandrsquos role in slavery.\"The consistent response from the audience has been lsquowhy hasnrsquot anyone told us this before rsquo. He pointedly adds that people have walked past the Dundas statue for generations, and the many landmarks in Glasgow linked to slavery, and ldquothey hadnrsquot a clue.Neither Palmer nor Devine want statues of men like Dundas taken down ndash both see them as important historical artefacts, which teach us about the past.However, when Palmer became involved in moves to erect a plaque at the Dundas statue, he was taken aback by claims that the man was a ldquogradual abolitionist. He denounces such statements as ldquohumbug and says ldquoDundas was guilty of villainy and rotten to the core.Forces of historyWhere the pair dfer, says Devine, relates to ldquothe controversy over the Dundas [statue] and the role of Henry Dundas, and whether or not he prolonged the slave trade led to many thousands of other African people being transported across the Atlantic.:Its time for our children to learn the truth about Scotlands role in slave tradeDevine notes he finds it ironic that he is ldquodefending ndash at least on a specic issue ndash this long dead man, becauseyou look at his role in history, and leave aside slavery, Dundas was an autocrat, unrelentingly opposed to political reform hellip an utter reactionary, and as far as I can tell not a very pleasant human being.However, Devine says that as a historian he must judge historical figures on ldquoevidence, much of it inevitably ambiguous hellip without fear or favour or whether I canrsquot stand the man or not. Devine says that studying the evidence leads him to the opinion that ldquothe jury is still out on [Dundasrsquos] personal role hellipPersonally, Irsquove not come across what Irsquod describe as entirely convincing evidence to convict [Dundas] one way or another of postponing or trying to postpone the end of the slave trade.Devine adds that ldquoevenDundas had never existed as an inidual or high-ranking politician, slavery would not have been abolished in the s because ldquoforces political, economic and military were so potent that there was no way a British government would want to get abolition over the line.Among those key forces were Britainrsquos war with France, the fact that the Caribbean was central to the economy of Empire, and slave rebellions in the French colony Saint-Domingue ndash now Haiti. Britain, Devine says, ldquowas fighting in a titanic struggle with France, not only for its very existence but the future control of Empire across the Atlantic.Slave rebellions ldquosent tremors right through the whole of the British Caribbean and the corridors of power in Westminster ndash the feeling was thatthe British gave an inch too quickly it might trigger the same kind of horror in the British Caribbean islands.The House of Lords, ldquowhich had to agree to abolition, was constantly and adamantly opposed hellip as was the King [George III] who had to sign any legislation off.Palmer questions Devinersquos position and produces a statement included in the book Recovering Scotlandrsquos Slavery Past, edited by Devine and published in . It says that Dundasrsquos ldquoparliamentary intervention hellip arguing for gradual abolition hellip effectively killed off reform for a generation.What has changed Devinersquos opinion of Dundas between  and today, Palmer wants to know.Devine admits that his view of Dundas has changed. ldquoThe point about my discipline is that it moves on hellip I believed that in , I no longer believe it because I look at the totality of the period hellip My position has moved from an inidual critique hellip to seeing the thing in terms of these very potent historical developments and forces which ensured [abolition] couldnrsquot happen.ldquoTom, Palmer pointedly says, ldquohas changed his mind. Palmer says as a scientist he would never come to ldquoconclusions without evidence.Slaveryrsquos friendDUNDAS, Palmer says, ldquogave money which facilitated the debt that some of these slavers had gone into hellip notorious slavers who didnrsquot want abolition. He points to James Baillie, a notorious Scottish slaver in the West Indies, descended from William Wallace, as one of those Dundas supported.How history views Dundas, says Palmer, is critical ldquoin terms of the general public. He worries that those who describe Dundas as a ldquogradual abolitionist pave the way for him eventually becoming ldquoan abolitionist in the public mind. Palmer says he was quite clearly a supporter of slavery.:Henry Dundas - Controversial legacy of Scotlands most powerful manPalmer goes on to point out that in a  letter, Dundas speaks of opposing abolition. Dundas also, Palmer says, facilitated that ldquoblack slaves should be enlisted into the British army to fight the French, and ordered action against fugitive slaves in Jamaica.ldquoThatrsquos gradual abolition  Palmer asks.Palmer says that in the Caribbean part of Dundasrsquos strategy was ldquobringing in young slaves hellip so that in the end you could be self-producing your own slaves. He wonrsquot countenance any suggestion that Dundas was not guilty of continuing the slave trade.Any claims by Dundas at the time that he was a gradualist, says Palmer, simply chime with other misleading statements by similar politicians in the late s, who were all guilty of ldquothis awful hypocrisy hellip saying one thing and doing the other. He adds: ldquoDundasrsquos gradualism is like gradual murder.Dundas, Palmer goes on, ldquowanted to develop slave plantations in Jamaica. When the word ldquogradual is used in connection with Dundas, Palmer says, we should take it to mean that he was ldquorefusing to act until a thousand favourable circumstances united ndash that really means never hellip he was playing the game hellip he was involved in delaying abolition.Palmer adds it is curious that when Dundas was impeached in , the ldquoslave trade was abolished in .Angry exchangesDEVINE responds by saying: ldquoGeoff presents [Dundas] as a kind of superman, a titan who single-handedly managed to produce this extraordinary historical result of postponing abolition.The only reason Dundas was able to achieve this end wasnrsquot because of personal skills hellip [but] because the forces of history, unfortunately for a period, were in favour of people like the postponers ndash aka him ndash or people who were root and branch opposed to abolition hellip We must move from the role, for good or ill ndash probably for ill ndash of one inidual and see this as an international process, based especially on war, which confounded the abolitionists until the early-th century.At this stage of the debate, the conversation degenerates into the two men talking over each other and general bickering.ldquoI just think he was irrelevant, says Devine. ldquoHe was the minister of war and the home secretary, Palmer responds.He was just ldquoone influential man, Devine adds. ldquoAre you saying the lsquoUncrowned King of Scotlandrsquo was the stooge of a whole lot of other people hellip that hersquod no power  Palmer asks.The legacyTHE Herald on Sunday brings the debate to order and moves on to asking both men why the legacy of Dundas matters today. ldquoWersquove a situation of  national pride, says Palmer.Thatrsquos ldquoa deception, he adds. When an Edinburgh City Council committee ndash on which Palmer sat ndash debated putting up the plaque at the Dundas statue, claims were made that Dundas was an abolitionist, Palmer says. ldquoThe public needs clarication on that, he adds.Devine disagrees with ldquothe way, and the outcome of the way, the plaque was revised. He says the issue should have been debated with ldquodispassionate impartiality.He adds: ldquoWhatrsquos said on that plaque needs to combine, in addition to the condemnation of Dundas hellip the context of the time which allowed the postponement of abolition to take place hellip This is such a fundamental part of our history hellip it must be debated.He questions why no ldquotrained historian was part of the discussion around the Dundas statue. ldquoEdinburgh council should hang its head in shame, Devine says.He cites a similar discussion ongoing in Toronto about the city possibly renaming its Dundas Street, which he sees as the right process to follow. There have been public discussions, and the city will present options to ranging from scraping the street name to doing nothing.Devine says Edinburgh acted ldquoin a moment of panic. The Edinburgh judgment was made by a ldquokangaroo court, he says ndash the ruling was a ldquodiktat.ldquoI donrsquot want Dundas forgiven or applauded ndash what I want is for the historical record to be taken into account, he says. Devine adds that by  ldquothe number of people in Scotland who would have supported abolition would have been very small indeed.He says it took the majority of Scottish people a long time to come to opposition ldquoas they realised the extent to which the ramparts of their economic system depended on [slaveryrsquos] wickedness.Palmer adds: ldquoThe majority is not always right ndash at one time the majority thought the Earth was flat.The conversation starts to get fractious again. Palmer says Devinersquos complaint about no historian on the Dundas  is ldquolike saying ldquoShakespeare didnrsquot do a course in playwriting so what does he know rsquo.Palmer says people have dismissed his comments on black history because of his background as a scientist rather than an historian, adding: ldquoThatrsquos dangerous as what itrsquos saying is that my view of history isnrsquot acceptable.He raises the fact that Dundasrsquos statue stood for nearly  years ldquoand that was perfectly okay to historians ndash they didnrsquot complain about it hellip they had  years to write about it in detail hellip they didnrsquot.Palmer adds: ldquoThe council did what it thought was right and as far as the narrative on the plaque, I agree with it ndash and as far as Irsquom concerned thatrsquos it.Palmer says amending the plaquersquos text would be ldquolike saying Hitler isnrsquot responsible because he was just one man and had lots of other people around him.On claims that there is new evidence to consider about Dundas, Palmer adds: ldquoI canrsquot see the new evidence, there isnrsquot any.After another spat, the conversation calms down and debate resumes. Devine says: ldquoIrsquom totally committed to the racial equality agenda, itrsquos extraordinary itrsquos taken so long to reach this point [but]we donrsquot get this right in terms of the reckoning with the past it will continue to be an open sore and there wonrsquot be any closure.Palmer sees a continuum between men like Dundas, the actions and words of politicians like Enoch Powell in the th century, and white supremacy today, which resulted in deaths like that of George Floyd. ldquoWe cannot change the past, but we can change the consequences of the past ndash such as racism ndash for the better, he adds.With the debate becoming bogged down, Devine says he is unlikely to speak out again on such issues.He believes discussion has ldquobeen hijacked by activists, controversialists and polemicists hellip [who] will withstand the cold logic of any conclusion you present. Yoursquove lost hellip before you begin hellip I think Irsquom hitting my head against a brick wall and itrsquos becoming increasingly painful.Palmer responds: ldquoYou can write what you think is true, nobody can stop you writing, the point is that now people are being much more critical.The futureDESPITE the acrimony, the debate begins to close on a point of agreement.

Meaning it stood to gainthe price went down and loseit went up.It seemed the perfect piranha plan until thousands of members of a Reddit subgroup, WallStreetBets, decided to pile in to support GameStop and inflict crippling losses on Melvin and other funds.By Tuesday evening last week, Melvin had given up, kept afloat only by a bn injection by two of its backers. Other hedge funds lost at least bn as GameStoprsquos price turbocharged.It was a conspiracy by the little guy, and in the case of the Reddit group, the kids, two million of them following it.At the beginning of this year GameStop shares were selling at  ndash a year ago at . By Thursday they had spiked to  as word got out and more amateurs joined the maul, before dropping back at one point by  per cent in the day, presumably when the WallStreetBets punters took their profits.It all began when a serial investor, Ryan Cohen, who had previously bought safe stocks like Apple, bought nine million shares in GameStop last year at an average price of ., an outlay of  million.He saw the opportunity, but he genuinely wanted the company to succeed by becoming a specialised e-commerce retailer of games, rather than a bricks-and-mortar shop presence.His arrival initially had only a small push on shares, going up to . He probably didnrsquot intend it, but he was also betting against the rapacious hedge funds.At the opening of Wall Street and the Nasdaq on Thursday, after the WSB latecomers jumped in their thousands, Cohenrsquos m stock was worth more than bn.For his investment Cohen got three seats on the board, but as the stock began to take off short-sellers had to buy more of it to cover their borrowings ndash itrsquos known as the ldquoshort squeeze ndash as the investors who had bet against it tried to cover their losses. And, of course, the price inevitably went up.The great gameThe hedge funds game is to borrow shares in a company from other investors, put them on the market, wait until the price falls, buy them back,the borrowed shares and pocket the profit. Itrsquos financial sleight of hand, jiggery-pokery.To them, GameStop seemed fair game. It had heavy losses last year and was the most shorted stock on Wall Street, with around % of its shares in the portfolios of hedge funds.But rather than the ailing patient having to go to the ICU and reap huge profits for the professional investor, there was resuscitation through what seems to have been personal animus against them by the Reddit amateurs. Almost a generational fight, robbing the rich to give to the millennial poor.When the stock rose to , Andrew Left, founder of Clinton Research, bet that it would halve. Oh no, said the WSB brigade, in what was clearly a reaction against the old guard ndash and him ndash and bought more, pushing the share value up % overnight. Since the beginning of January, Gamestop is up more than ,%.One WSB investor claims he turned a , punt into .m within just a few hours. Everyone, it seemed, was a winner ndash except the hedge funds, of course.Rumblings began. One online  called Discord removed the WSB server for alleged hate speech, the majority of it against the hedge fund pinstripes.In response, the Redditers said: ldquoYou know as well as I do thatyou gather k people in one spot someone is going to say something that makes you look bad.ldquoThat room was golden and the people that run it are awesome. We blocked all bad words with a bot, which should be enough, but apparentlysomeone can say a bad word with weird unicode icelandic characters and someone can screenshot it you donrsquot get to hang out with your friends anymore.The price took another hike on Tuesday when Elon Musk, whose company Tesla has suffered fromshort-selling in the past, tweeted ldquoGamestonk and linked it to WSB. By midweek the loss-making retailer was valued at more than bn, although market logic dictates that this will fall ndash demonstrated in Thursdayrsquos volatility ndash and many amateur investors will lose heavily. But then logic hasnrsquot had much input in this affair.Hedge fund manager Michael Burry, of Scion Asset Management ndash played in the Hollywood movie The Big Short by Christian Bale ndash and who had previously shorted Tesla, warned that GameStoprsquos share price was out of control, tweeting that it was ldquounnatural, insane and dangerous.It may have been all of those thing but Scion reportedly made a -foldon his fundrsquos investment in the company.The amateurs are now targeting other companies that have been shorted by hedge funds. US stocks AMC Entertainment, Koss Corp and BlackBerry all saw their share prices rise on Wednesday, only to fall back overnight.UK shares in Pearson and Cineworld rose on speculation they could be next in line for the WSB treatment, only to fall in early trading on Thursday.The Sydney Morning Herald also reported that a tiny West Australian mining company saw a % surge in its share price, probably because its stock market code matches that of GameStop.Biden his timeThe GameStop bubble has also caught the attention of the new Joe Biden administration in the White House.Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Bidenrsquos economic team, including newly-appointed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, was ldquomonitoring the situation.US stock exchange Nasdaqrsquos chief executive Adena Friedman joined in, saying exchanges and regulators should watch whether anonymous social media posts could be driving ldquopump and dump schemes.They donrsquot like the upstarts.In the past,you had the cash and the cachet, you hired a broker to advise you what shares to buy, with the broker taking a commission on the trade.The rise of cut-price and free apps and forums like WSB means that anyone, with only a little cash, can take a punt on the market.Itrsquos the digital rebels against the analogue old guard.As one of the WSB moderators put it: ldquoWhat I think is happening is that you guys are making such an impact that these fat cats are worried that they have to get up and put in work to earn a living.Itrsquos a bubble, of course, like the South Sea one, as the wild fluctuation in the share price of GameStop on Thursday showed.Get in early, help to inflate the bubble and,you time it right, come out with a fortune ndash hang in too long and you lose it all.And like all bubbles it will burst.

It pains me to see that with % of our children out of school as a result of school closures, we risk taking away opportunities from our own coming generations.“The pandemic has illustrated better than most things the full consequences of the digital ide, with which we have lived for too long we see those areas of the country that have access to connectivity and those that do not, and the families who have broadband and sufficient devices for everybody to get home schooling opportunities, and those who do not.

However, there is still some way to go before our inter-island service is of a standard we see where in Scotland.#Orkney SNP candidate for the Scottish Parliament elections Robert Leslie said that the additional funding was brilliant news for the islands. He said: “This delivers on the fairer ferry funding calls that have been made by Lib Dems and the local authority and shows that the SNP government is in full listening mode when it comes to island issues.“I look forward to these enhanced services and reduced fares being put in place. The next step will be to engage further with the local authority and other parties on the replacement of Orkney’s ancient internal ferry fleet.”SNP MSP for the Highlands and Islands Maree Todd added: “The additional £.m in funding for inter-island ferries is a positive development and delivers on a key ask from local authority partners at a time of unprecedented financial pressure on the Scottish budget.“Whilst it is the local authority that is wholly responsible for the ferry services they provide, the SNP Government is sympathetic to the financial pressures which fall on inidual local authorities, which we know have been heightened as a result of COVID-.#She added: “It’s worth pointing out that for a long time, local authorities received no funding from the Scottish Government to support inter-island ferries, it is only under the SNP that this has changed and increased over the years. Today, we have a pledge to meet the revenue ask in full, fulfilling the SNP government’s commitment to fair ferry funding.“Considering the draft Budget meets a key ask from the Liberal Democrats, I hope to see the party get behind the budget and support it through Parliament.”Orkney#s MSP, Liberal Democrat Liam McArthur said: “This additional funding for our leline internal ferry services is undoubtedly welcome. Having been promised ‘fair funding’ by the First Minister since the last election, it’s remarkable how the prospect of an upcoming election concentrates the minds of SNP ministers.“Welcome too is the proposal to fund RET on internal ferry services. Some of these are amongst the most expensive routes mile-for-mile anywhere in the country.“Given we are still waiting for RET on Pentland Firth routes three years after it was due to be introduced and  years after it was introduced on west coast routes, it may be premature to celebrate just yet.“Of course, this will not stop SNP politicians from being first in the queue to pat themselves on the back. Let’s not forget, however, that Orkney has consistently been short-changed on ferry funding over the course of this parliament since the promises made at the last election.“There is a strong argument for the millions in under-funding now to be repaid. Indeed, it is a case SNP ministers themselves have been making to the UK Government over VAT payments for Police Scotland. If it’s good enough for police funding, it’s good enough for ferry funding.”The co-covener of the Orkney Greens, Councillor Steve Sankey welcomed the #long overdue# news.#The Scottish Greens won an additional £.million for Orkney’s ferries out of the budget settlement in , and this time around the Scottish Government has finally got there itself, after years of pressure from the three island councils involved and opposition parties,# Councillor Sankey said.“We’ve been saying for years that the knock-on effect of having to fund the deficit in ferry funding has impacted on us here greatly, and has precipitated budgetary pressures throughout Orkney. We emphasised that the situation was grossly unfair, particularly when compared to the huge increases in funding afforded to Calmac out west. The news that OIC will receive £. million next year is a relief, and will enable improvements in service such as Sunday sailings to the outer isles.#Councillor Sankey concluded: “Fairness with funding is all we’ve ever asked for, and now  years after Road Equivalent Tarf was first piloted, it seems that it will also finally be rolled out on our internal routes, although there is still no mention of the Pentland Firth.“Whilst this is good news, it now means that we turn our attention to the replacement process for our ancient ferry fleet which ranges in age from  to  years. It’s essential that any replacement proposals commit to a renewable fuel component, be it hydrogen, ammonia or electric, so that we can greatly reduce the high carbon emissions that afflict our marine transport sector.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the islands, Highland and rural areas and villages across the country, BBs and self-catering properties are often the only tourism accommodation, and the spend by their guests supports these fragile economies.“The business owners on today’s webinar were understandably very concerned that the poorly-drafted ‘Short-Term Lets’ licensing legislation would be hugely onerous to microbusinesses in Skye and right across Scotland and would be a catastrophic ‘double whammy’ after these very same, small family businesses have been so disproportionately hit by Covid-.”SkyeConnect maintain that the fees for licensing accommodation with the council could be as high as £, per business. that the process to determine the fees has not been completed, and urged those affected to respond to the Parliamentary consultation before the cut-off date of this Friday. The draft regulations, published just before Christmas, will then be considered by the Local Government and Communities Committee.A spokeswoman added: “The fees are not proposed to be the subject of a statutory instrument but instead are at the discretion of each local authority to set. However, the fees must be set to ensure they are sufficient to cover the local authority’s administrative expenses.“In order to calculate this, it requires work to be carried out with our finance department as to the cost of processing and determining a licence taking into account income vs expenditure. It also requires to take into account the cost of resourcing the new licensing regime including factors such as recruiting additional staff, building and IT costs.“In terms of setting dfering levels of fees, this also needs to be assessed based on whether the processing of these applications will take longer, ie be more costly to administer.“This is an ongoing exercise and ultimately cannot be completed until the draft Regulations are finalised and we know for certain what types of letting premises will or will not be included within the licensing regime. Once this is known, it will require a paper to go to the Licensing Committee on the setting of fees for their determination.” she had “raised the concerns of constituents# with the Housing Minister Kevin Stewart. She also stressed the importance of responding to the consultation.She added: “I fully understand the concern of those across Skye and Lochalsh.

To that end, the deadlines associated with this have been extended to April  so that the sector has some breathing space.

The Scottish Government has not specied the specic fee level that local authorities should charge, and there is scope for local authorities to consider setting dferent fees for dferent types of short-term lets.“As the MSP for Skye and Lochalsh I will ensure that the concerns of SkyeConnect and others are passed on to those steering the legislation through parliament.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CARBOST-SHOP-1.jpg","title":"community purchase secures future for carbost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe project was delayed due to the first covid lockdown and since then the Carbost Community Shop Community Interest Company has been working hard to organise the legal side of the purchase.: “We are so pleased that everything has gone through at last and the current owner, Sharon Thacker, has been so supportive and patient during the whole process. We cannot thank Sharon enough for keeping the shop open for the community during the covid pandemic until we took over.“Sharon has also been a great help to our newly appointed manager, Ted McMullen, and supported the handover process. This all meant we were able to keep the shop open during this period and continue to provide a vital service for the community. We are also really pleased current and experienced staff member Fiona MacLeod is continuing working for us.“The local community have been great from the very beginning and are continuing to support our new manager, Ted, as he settles into his new role.”The Scottish Land Fund, who provided the £, of funds to purchase the shop have been great to work with, said Cathy, and supported the community fully during the project.“We are really grateful that they believed in our project and helped us to keep our shop in Carbost,” she added. “We would also like to thank Minginish Community Hall Association and their project officer Henrik Micksi who supported the project in the early days. MCHA are also pleased to support the project via their Fairy Pools carpark income and have granted funds to modernise the shop’s IT system.“We are all really excited about creating a really great little community shop. New signs are coming soon with a logo designed by committee member Cath Waters, we have extra funding from the SLF for repairs and these are planned for the next few months, and as a community business we will try to expand and improve the services we offer, for example, we would like to set up a more formal home delivery service.”Carbost Community Shop CIC have also obtained grant funding from Zerowaste Scotlandfor dispensing equipment which they will be ordering soon to help develop an eco-range of products.Fellow director Janette Sutherland said: “I am delighted that the Scottish Land Fund has allowed us to retain a village shop. It is an important community hub and provides a vital service especially during critical times like the current lockdown.”As a recently arrived resident, director David Smith said it has been “heartening to see the value people place on the continuation” of the local shop.“It has been a pleasure to play a part in bringing this about,” he added. that when he moved to Carbost a year ago, he didn’t really get a chance to integrate due to Covid restrictions.“So to now have the opportunity to manage the shop I am getting to know the character of the place,” he added. “It is fantastic. The people are so open, friendly and welcoming – even to this Irishman – and the characters are great.“As we are  miles from the nearest supermarket, the shop really is a leline to many, especially in these times where people are sheltering and when the winter grips the roads. Now the community of Carbost own the shop they are able to influence it, shape it and help us develop it to make it something even more special.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/LOCHBAY-HOUSE-2.jpg","title":"stein decision highlights a broken planning","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLocal opponents of the new build were “shocked and deeply disappointed” by the decision, and see it as evidence of a “broken” planning system.Plans by Huw and Johanne Morgan, the absentee owners of listed building Lochbay House, to construct a “very contemporary” two-bedroom house nearby attracted widespread objections in the area, with dozens submitted to the council.At a committee meeting on Tuesday of this week, council planner Mark Harvey said applications for two other properties in the area submitted by the couple were withdrawn while Mr and Mrs Morgan “consider reworking the proposals in terms of siting and design.” This was because Historic Environment Scotland had adopted a “strict view” of the settlement pattern, he said.However, the application for the two-bedroom house “did not have a signicant impact on the character” of the area’s conservation designation, Mr Harvey added. Officials recommended approval.A motion tabled by Skye councillor John Gordon to reject the application was seconded and supported by Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and fellow Skye councillor Calum MacLeod. It was defeated by eight votes to six.A statement on behalf of a number of Stein locals opposed to the Morgans’ development said: “Obviously, the community is shocked and deeply disappointed at the decision made at planning committee yesterday.“It is widely felt that what we are seeing is the result of a planning system that is broken. A system that has lost all integrity of intention and total collapse in community trust and respect. Everyone is talking about it.“It would seem, that a system of double standards exists, where one set of rules apply to the long-standing residents and a dferent set for the speculative, corporate developer who demonstrates no understanding interest or empathy for local heritage or the community they impose their developments on.“The progress of this application through planning has totally failed to uphold the objective of the conservation area and fails to recognise the importance of the setting of the listed building. Neither does it take account of the numerous natural heritage and wildle issues raised.”Approving the application “makes a mockery of the term conservation area and neither does the proposal comply with the terms” of Highland Council’s own local plan, the statement said.It added: “From the moment this application, with very signicant potential for detrimental impact, was accepted into the system amidst the strictest part of the pandemic lockdown, it has been felt that it sought to subvert the right of the local community to fair comment.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/James-Rebanks-and-dogs-credit-Andrew-Heading-edited.jpg","title":"we can learn a lot from old henry of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineHis debut book, ‘It’s A Shepherd’s Le’ — which I stumbled on by accident— went on to become a best-seller.It’s a wonderfully evocative account of the massive challenges and privilege of being a hill farmer in the fells of the Lake District.Like all good writing, it doesn’t feel like reading you are just taken on an effortless journey of the imagination.I’ve never been to the Lake District myself, but from all accounts it’s quite spectacular — a bit like our own Highlands — and Rebanks captures that vividly.But what comes across more than anything is the sense of privilege he feels from being connected to the land, the massive challenges of trying to make a living from a harsh environment and his profound sadness that a way of le which was once the bedrock of rural communities is now fast disappearing. The parallels to our own circumstances is quite striking.His second offering, ‘English Pastoral’, offers a bit more optimism. Once again it’s a tremendously easy read and we are back on the fells, among the distinctive Herdwick sheep, the cattle, the characters — in particular his grandfather whose farm he inherited —and the drystone dykes. Except this time we are offered a lesson, and it is one that should make us sit up and take notice.Through charting the history of his home valley, Rebanks shows how agricultural practices have changed over the course of time and goes on to explain how similar trends have taken place throughout the UK and, indeed, across the globe.After the Second World War, governments rigorously pursued policies of producing more and more food. Farmers were offered huge subsidies and incentives, so farms became bigger, semi unproductive land improved through mechanisation and modern practices, and on and on the juggernaut ploughed.Then came the supermarkets. Their over-riding aim was to drive down prices, so farms had to become more efficient. Economies of scale became the mantra. Traditional family farms disappeared, swallowed up by larger businesses, machines became bigger and more expensive and farmers became captains of industry and capitalists.None of this happened overnight, of course, but it is heartbreaking to read of the struggles of the Rebanks’ own traditional family farm, trying to stay afloat financially while competing with the drive for modernisation going on all around them. The le of a hill farmer —or crofter for that matter — can seem romantic, but the reality is often very dferent.Eventually, Rebanks’ father had an epiphany – and it was something that the younger ones had also realised. And it was all to do with ‘Old Henry’.Old Henry was a neighbouring farmer, an eccentric bachelor. As all those around him invested in new machinery and chemical fertilisers, Old Henry never bothered, or even seemed to care.He just continued in his own stubborn way, farming the way it had been done for generations with native breeds of livestock, cutting hay well into the autumn , thistle and weeds adorning every nook and cranny and his old stone barns more a haven for birdle than serving any useful practical purpose.Rebanks always used to take more than a passing glance at this farm. With its vast array of wildle and ancient practices, it reminded him of the way his grandfather’s farm used to be.When Old Henry passed away, the inevitable happened and the farm was broken up and sold to larger businesses. The agronomists came with their scientic degrees to survey the land and assess what inputs were required to transform this antiquated model into profitable production. Their conclusion astounded them: never before had they seen soil so healthy. It required not a jot of chemical input.And here’s the crux of the lesson: Old Henry was onto something, whether knowingly or not. And the Rebanks were to take heed.Over the course of time, as the drive for greater efficiency became ever more necessary, farmers began to specialise in one or maybe two products – whether that was focusing on huge livestock numbers or on a particular crop. Traditional mixed rotation became a thing of the past. It was seen as unnecessary, as chemical fertilisers and pesticides could ensure continued productivity and profitability.But, through time, it all led, perhaps inevitably, to the destruction of the soil and natural environment. The evidence was there all along, but perhaps no-one had the time or inclination to see. The farmland birds — the curlew, the lapwing, the corncrake — were disappearing the earthworms, such a crucial indicator of soil health, non-existent. ‘Modernisation’ had come at a very heavy price indeed.And so the Rebanks family began to reassess. Fast-forward to today and their family hill farm now derives part of its income from subsidies geared towards environmental improvement: from the hedgerows planted, the trees, the fenced off waterways, from ious bits of wildle havens dotted around the farm.But, be under no mistake, this is still very much a working livestock business, just that the main enterprise is now dove-tailed with nature and bioersity, just as it once was through natural occurrence back in his grandfather’s day.There is a growing realisation that this is the way forward for agriculture and land use – and might even be a way of getting the wider populace to warmly embrace the countryside once again.Due to simple economics and geography, a lot of the ‘modernisation’ of which the book speaks passed crofting by, so who knows maybe we could be in the vanguard of this new agricultural and land-use enlightenment – given the proper vision and the right political will, of course.As Old Henry of the fells so ably demonstrated in his own idiosyncratic way, there’s a lot to be said for the old ways. Maybe it is time to re-connect with the past."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3595857.jpg--.jpg?1611825143000\n","title":"big ballymena response sought for big garden birdwatch 2021","story":"RSPB NI is hoping that more people from the Ballymena area than ever will celebrate their love of nature and unite to count garden birds at the end of January for the annual Big Garden Birdwatch.In the past year, it’s been clear to see how important the natural world is to everyone’s mental health and wellbeing. There has been a surge in interest in the nature on our doorsteps and many people have come to rely on garden birds to bring joy and comfort in these unsettling times. This year’s event takes place on Friday , Saturday  and Sunday  January. People are being asked to spend just one hour watching and recording the birds in their garden, then send their results to the RSPB. Close to half a million people join in the Birdwatch every year across the UK. Just under , people from Northern Ireland took part last year.Anne-Marie McDevitt, RSPB NI Head of Species, said: “With more people having to stay at home over the past year, everyone has been spending more time outdoors and in gardens and I think as a result have been noticing nature more and having more time to engage with it.“Last year people were asking usmore birds were singing during the lockdown, but it’s not that there has been more wildle about it’s just that we’ve had more time and space to notice it.“By taking part in the Big Garden Birdwatch, you are helping to build an annual snapshot of how our birdle is doing. It is only by us understanding how our wildle is faring that we can protect it. We’ve noticed that more people have signed up now for the Birdwatch than had at this stage last year, which is fantastic. We know that nature is in crisis and together we can all take action to solve the problems facing it. Nature needs us.”Just one hour every year for the last four decades has made the RSPB’s Big Garden Birdwatch the world’s largest garden wildle citizen science project. Now in its nd year,  million birds have been counted. Last year’s results showed that house sparrows remained at the top of the Big Garden Birdwatch rankings in Northern Ireland, with an average of almost five sparrows being spotted in gardens. Collared doves flew into the top , replacing coal tits, while sightings of goldfinches and robins were up too.While counties Down and Tyrone both had the same top two in  , starlings were the most-spotted birds in counties Antrim, Armagh and Derry-Londonderry – ahead of house sparrows – while Fermanagh’s number one bird was the chaffinch.Big Garden Birdwatch continues to highlight the winners and losers in the garden bird world. While house sparrows and starlings may be the UK’s most commonly sighted birds, a closer look at Big Garden Birdwatch data shows that numbers have dropped dramatically since the Birdwatch began in . House sparrows are down %, while starlings are down %. It’s a pattern echoed by two more garden favourites, with blackbirds and robins down % and % respectively.

Dale Fusco was shocked when he was told how much it would cost to ship.He said it was just one more unintended consequence of Brexit. Mr Fusco, who has a sizeable guitar collection, said he never expected to be charged so much for a delivery. I buy guitars from England all the time, he said.One guitar I found on eBay, a guy who lives in Cardf has it and he wasn#t posting it, but said he was happy to sell it to meI arranged my own postage and courier.The electric guitar, a Charvel made in Calornia in the s, is worth around £. I went on to Shiply. I#ve used it before when I#ve bought guitars from England, and normally it costs £ or £, and that includes your insurance, he explained. The Shiply price was the most expensive he found.He eventually got quotes approaching £ for the same service. But he said the price was still too much compared to what he was paying pre-Brexit. You could get a ferry to go and get it for the same price,it wasn#t non-essential travel, he added. Mr Fusco said he normally used DPD to ship guitars to add to his collection, having received a lot that way. However, DPD has now said it will not offer that service for guitar deliveries to here and refused to give a quote. One of the companies in England called Rich Tones, who I#ve bought stuff off in the past, they use DPD and on their website they#re saying there#s disruption, he said.It won#t stop him adding to his collection but it will mean he has to be more careful about where he shops, or travel over the Irish Sea himself for purchases. I#ll just have to keep looking for guitars in Northern Ireland, he said. I#ve bought maybe four or five guitars out of England, and I went to college there, so I might have to go over and stay with my friends and buy guitars that way. This is the first time I#ve bought a guitar and it#s said it#s going to be £ postage.He said the reality of Brexit was now starting to bite a wee bit as we are forced to change the way we shop. Amazon has even stopped delivering beer here, he said. If you#re anything like me, you just go to Amazon and swipe right. I#m not sure whether we#re all going to have to just buy what we can get locally.We#re all going to have to start paying more postagewe want to buy things out of Great Britain. We#re starting to see the effects of it now and the ordinary man on the street is starting to have to pay or not get the stuff at all.Shiply has been asked for a response.Belfast Most ReadCovid rules dead and buried: UVF chiefs caught breaking regulations at loyalist funeral Co Armagh woman accused of forcing man into sexual activityEamon McCourt#s family cut ties with Sinn Fein after funeralGB should cut ties with Northern Ireland, argues author Louis de BernieresCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Another  people die after testing positive for Covid-Latest Northern IrelandPolice investigating hate crime after sectarian attack on Limavady Catholic church Police probe loyalist funeral over potential breaches of coronavirus regulationsIreland moving towards ‘phased reopening’ of education, scientist saysMan in his s left with injuries following stabbing at Co Down homeCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  deaths and  new casesLatest from Belfast Demarai Gray joins Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen from LeicesterPolice investigating hate crime after sectarian attack on Limavady Catholic church Police probe loyalist funeral over potential breaches of coronavirus regulationsMuslim Council of Britain elects first female secretary generalPatrick Bamford inspires Leeds to comeback win over Leicester,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNew guidance on hauliers picking up multiple loads for transfer from Great Britain to Northern Ireland has been published By Michael McHugh, PAJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailNew guidance on hauliers picking up mixed food loads for transfer from Great Britain to Northern Ireland has been published.The industry gave a cautious welcome to the Government advice.The Northern Ireland Protocol keeps the country in line with EU trade rules and animal products require special certication.A statement from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairssaid: “Freight volumes into Northern Ireland’s ports are at normal levels for this time of year and there have been no signicant queues.Our new approach to the movement of mixed food loads into Northern Ireland, known as groupage, is more flexible and gives businesses further options as to how they meet the required SPS checksDefra statement“We have always been clear that as the Northern Ireland Protocol is implemented we would work very closely with industry and DAERAto improve ways of operating.“Our new approach to the movement of mixed food loads into Northern Ireland, known as groupage, is more flexible and gives businesses further options as to how they meet the required SPSchecks and we will continue to offer our support to hauliers and suppliers as this beds in.”Agriculture departments in Northern Ireland and Great Britain have worked with hauliers to establish the new groupage model which will aid the movements of these loads into Northern Ireland.Following successful trials with industry involving taking goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, two groupage models have been agreed.Groupage means lorries in the rest of the UK picking up goods at multiple points for transit across the Irish Sea.It is a common method of reducing delivery costs for smaller retailers.Paperwork required due to the protocol had created problems with that because lorry containers were being opened and resealed multiple times.Defra proposed two models, one using “consolidation hubs” in which all mixed products arrived at one premises, were consolidated and certied as a single unit then sealed.Logistics UK is cautiously optimistic that the solution proposed will help prevent delaysAlex Veitch, Logistics UKThe other, known as a “linear model”, meant every inidual consignment like an inidual pallet would be checked and sealed by a certying officer before the haulier moved on to the next pick-up.The consolidated load would be sealed at the final point of dispatch before leaving for the port.Haulage industry body Logistics UK’s general manager of policy Alex Veitch said it followed pressure from the sector to ease the administrative burden after Brexit.He said: “Logistics UK is cautiously optimistic that the solution proposed will help prevent delays, by reducing the number of vehicles needing to be inspected on arrival in Northern Irelandadministered correctly.“The sector will continue to work closely with both Defra and DAERA as the scheme develops, because it is still untested for larger volumes of traffic and it is clear that further IT developments will be required as the system evolves.“As the scheme expands, it will be vital for government to work closely with Great Britain companies sending goods to Northern Ireland to ensure they are fully briefed on how to prepare groupage loads of SPS goods for Northern Ireland.”PAMost ReadCovid rules dead and buried: UVF chiefs caught breaking regulations

People like me have been silenced for too long and now feel disenfranchised by the way it has been handled.Mr McCollum said he read the results of the independent inquiry into mother and baby homes in the Republic earlier this month, but felt there were too many pieces of the jigsaw missing.Read MoreMother and baby homes inquiry must have powers to deliver justice – survivorsCatholic and Church of Ireland primates express shame over mother and baby homesThere wasn#t a focus on the border like I thought there would be, he said.We were trafficked and the Church didn#t recognise the Border. That#s why it#s vital that the investigation in the North looks at all of these key points.Last week#s report shows that of the babies sent to Co Donegal from Co Down,  were recorded as being adopted in the Republic and  were ed to Northern Ireland to be adopted.The records also indicate that  babies were adopted using the services of the St Patrick#s Guild in Dublin, with  of them adopted in the Republic.Three babies were adopted in Dublin through the Catholic Protection and Rescue Society of Ireland three were adopted from the Holy Faith Convent in Eccles Street, Dublin and two were adopted through St Anne#s Adoption Agency in Cork.All of these children went to live in the Republic.The research also revealed a number of babies were taken to the United States, with one baby boy being taken from Northern Ireland to Co Donegal in  and adopted by a couple in New York.Another, born in  and moved to St Patrick#s Guild in Dublin, was adopted by a family in Illinois in .There has never been a more appropriate time to highlight the wrongs, Mr McCollum said.I want to highlight the cruelty, the mistreatment of children like me, he said.It galls me when they say these homes were a place of refuge.Those involved had a warped sense of reality.Irish IndependentMost ReadCovid rules dead and buried: UVF chiefs caught breaking regulations at loyalist funeral Co Armagh woman accused of forcing man into sexual activityEamon McCourt#s family cut ties with Sinn Fein after funeralGB should cut ties with Northern Ireland, argues author Louis de BernieresCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Another  people die after testing positive for Covid-Latest Northern IrelandPolice investigating hate crime after sectarian attack on Limavady Catholic church Police probe loyalist funeral over potential breaches of coronavirus regulationsIreland moving towards ‘phased reopening’ of education, scientist saysMan in his s left with injuries following stabbing at Co Down homeCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  deaths and  new casesLatest from Belfast Demarai Gray joins Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen from LeicesterPolice investigating hate crime after sectarian attack on Limavady Catholic church Police probe loyalist funeral over potential breaches of coronavirus regulationsMuslim Council of Britain elects first female secretary generalPatrick Bamford inspires Leeds to comeback win over Leicester,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

to go,” he said.“I think all of us have a collective responsibility to ensure that the developing world, and particularly frontline workers in the developing world, are vaccinated as well because this is a global situation.We have a journey to go but I think we will get therewe can just calm downMicheal Martin“There’s very little point in the virus raging across developing countries while we vaccinate % here because that would mean more mutations.“We have a journey to go but I think we will get therewe can just calm down.“There’s an understandable race against time in relation to getting the vaccines out but,you think about it, what has happened in the last  months has been truly remarkable that we’ve managed to facilitate the development of vaccines in such a short space of time.“I understand that anxiety, but we will get there.”PAMost ReadCovid rules dead and buried: UVF chiefs caught breaking regulations at loyalist funeral Co Armagh woman accused of forcing man into sexual

So Ill be in the kitchen prepping on Christmas Eve and then the dinner will be cooked and delivered on Christmas Day for anyone who’s alone or in need of one.Last year we actually had some spare meals left over so I went and delivered them up to the Fire Station, which was the highlight of my Christmas, she said.Paula has been provided with the names of people in the local community who would benefit from the scheme by the Operation Snowball at the OLT and staff at the Long Tower Youth Club.This service is free of charge of course, soyou or someone you know needs help this Christmas please send me a message to the Peggys Kitchen Facebook page,continued Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push Last year we covered the cost of it ourselves, apart from the desserts, but this year Foyle Fruit have kindly offered to donate the potatoes and vegetables and we have also had donations of containers and cups. All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It eyes a small bird skipping along in front of it. The cat crouches and snarls, but its all a bit half-hearted. The bird flies off. The cat continues its stroll up the hill towards the Heaney HomePlace. Nonplussed. Its a common feeling at the moment as people battle the lockdown-enhanced January blues. Though it isnt quite business as usual, Bellaghy is far from a ghost town.  The scene last week at Bellaghys mini-roundabout. A steady flow of lorries navigate its narrow streets as they head for the roomier surroundings promised by A dual carriageway. googletag.cmd.push Occasionally, a slow-moving vehicle leads a convoy of frustrated motorists through the town. There are no traffic lights, but an unwritten system appears to be in place. Motorists wave pedestrians across the road and traffic pauses accordingly to facilitate their safe passage. Polite waves are offered in . Several notices placed on buildings up and down Main Street implore drivers not to park in front of their access gates. One is particularly vocerous in its insistence, with a huge notice in red above the entry and a smaller one on either side. I find myself hoping someone does park there. Ive a feeling the fallout would be spectacular. googletag.cmd.push A neon sign above the Spar shop transmits a silent traders call. Hawking wares for the st century. Skinny whips - pound. Coors  pack - pound.. Tempting. The intermittent thermometer displayed on the screen keeps passers-by up to date on the current temperature. Greying sky unleashes a squall of hail, prompting a waiting NI Electricity worker to take shelter under the canopy of Poets Corner.  The cafe itself is open for takeaway food and drinks. Inside, the woman behind the screen says it has been quiet so far today. Its cold outside, she offers by way of explanation. “Seven degrees,” I inform her, drawing on Spars meteorological information.     It doesnt stay quiet too long as the lunch time trade begins to build. The cafe operates responsibly, only permitting two customers inside at a time. Mask compliance is high in the village. Owner Rebecca explains they take the safety precautions seriously. “We try our best to make sure there arent many queues, we cant have people standing in the shop, or anything like that,” she says. “Its horrible to see the other places closed. I would know the owner of the bar next door very well, its a sin to see everywhere closed and people not working. “We closed during the first lockdown and didnt open again until June, but we didnt get any grants or anything because we were a new business. “This time we stayed open because we have got so busy with the takeaways that we can still operate, which is a good thing. “There werent as many people about at all during the first lockdown, but there seem to be more out walking about now. “The shops are definitely quieter, but there are more people out walking around to exercise.” A man in the cafe who had greeted me exuberantly up the street does so again. His enthusiasm is infectious, social distancing or not. Those brief interchanges, that leave a smile on your face, have even greater effect these days. People remain resolute despite all setbacks. Heading up Castle Street, it becomes apparent just how quiet the shops actually are. A sign in the charity shop window informs passers-by it is closed until further notice. Turf Man hard at it. The hairdressers next door lies in darkness, as does the barber further up the street. Outside the Bellaghy Bawn, though, Turf Man is perpetually busy. I tweet out a picture, asking people to guess the location. One reply suggests I wont get many quotes off Turf Man. The quiet man at the quiet end of town. Walking down the Ballyscullion Road towards Paacuteirc Seaacuten de Bruacuten, the traffic noise subsides to a faint rumble. My footsteps begin to echo off the low walls of the houses on my left. A bottle blown across the road by the stf breeze rattles into earshot, against a backdrop of chirping birds. It is quiet down here. Some walkers are braving the changeable weather to get their steps in. A woman walking her dog walks along the empty stand on the far side of the pitch. I contemplate the plaque commemorating Sean Brown. The words remembering his tragic death are framed by a bleak sky. In need of inspiration, I head for Seamus Heaneys grave. At the chapel, two men are standing on scaffolding that reaches half way up its tower, staring upwards. With all churches closed, they can work largely undisturbed. The grave of Seamus Heaney. There is no one  in the graveyard, not even weary home-schooling parents taking a school trip to the Poet Laureates resting place. On the way back into the town, three children are playing in the yard of Bellaghy Primary School. A member of staff supervises. Their laughter carries on the breeze all the way down the hill. If only the drivers shooting disapproving looks at each other on the roundabout could hear it. Throughout Bellaghy, there are sets of outdoor chairs set into the concrete pavements. Under normal circumstances, people would be passing their lunchtime sitting in them, chatting to others. As I sit outside the pharmacy, the postman pulls up to the Spar, collecting letters and parcels from its post office. An NI Water van passes through. An Ulsterbus carrying just two passengers. Tractors rattle busily up and down the street. A DHL delivery van approaches the roundabout, the driver glancing at the street signs before turning left towards Castledawson. The unsung are quietly grafting away, navigating the pandemic and ensuring le goes on. No rest for the essential.  Back in the car, a radio bulletin announces the Northern Ireland Executive have extended lockdown measures for a month. Normalitys odds have ened. So much of normal le feels empty at present. The constant cycle of infection, sickness and death has hollowed it out. Leaving Bellaghy, Im struck by the symbolism of those empty chairs. Despite your best efforts, sometimes grim reminders are impossible to avoid.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It eyes a small bird skipping along in front of it. The cat crouches and snarls, but its all a bit half-hearted. The bird flies off. The cat continues its stroll up the hill towards the Heaney HomePlace. Nonplussed. Its a common feeling at the moment as people battle the lockdown-enhanced January blues. Though it isnt quite business as usual, Bellaghy is far from a ghost town.  The scene last week at Bellaghys mini-roundabout. A steady flow of lorries navigate its narrow streets as they head for the roomier surroundings promised by A dual carriageway. googletag.cmd.push Occasionally, a slow-moving vehicle leads a convoy of frustrated motorists through the town. There are no traffic lights, but an unwritten system appears to be in place. Motorists wave pedestrians across the road and traffic pauses accordingly to facilitate their safe passage. Polite waves are offered in . Several notices placed on buildings up and down Main Street implore drivers not to park in front of their access gates. One is particularly vocerous in its insistence, with a huge notice in red above the entry and a smaller one on either side. I find myself hoping someone does park there. Ive a feeling the fallout would be spectacular. googletag.cmd.push A neon sign above the Spar shop transmits a silent traders call. Hawking wares for the st century. Skinny whips - pound. Coors  pack - pound.. Tempting. The intermittent thermometer displayed on the screen keeps passers-by up to date on the current temperature. Greying sky unleashes a squall of hail, prompting a waiting NI Electricity worker to take shelter under the canopy of Poets Corner.  The cafe itself is open for takeaway food and drinks. Inside, the woman behind the screen says it has been quiet so far today. Its cold outside, she offers by way of explanation. “Seven degrees,” I inform her, drawing on Spars meteorological information.     It doesnt stay quiet too long as the lunch time trade begins to build. The cafe operates responsibly, only permitting two customers inside at a time. Mask compliance is high in the village. Owner Rebecca explains they take the safety precautions seriously. “We try our best to make sure there arent many queues, we cant have people standing in the shop, or anything like that,” she says. “Its horrible to see the other places closed. I would know the owner of the bar next door very well, its a sin to see everywhere closed and people not working. “We closed during the first lockdown and didnt open again until June, but we didnt get any grants or anything because we were a new business. “This time we stayed open because we have got so busy with the takeaways that we can still operate, which is a good thing. “There werent as many people about at all during the first lockdown, but there seem to be more out walking about now. “The shops are definitely quieter, but there are more people out walking around to exercise.” A man in the cafe who had greeted me exuberantly up the street does so again. His enthusiasm is infectious, social distancing or not. Those brief interchanges, that leave a smile on your face, have even greater effect these days. People remain resolute despite all setbacks. Heading up Castle Street, it becomes apparent just how quiet the shops actually are. A sign in the charity shop window informs passers-by it is closed until further notice. Turf Man hard at it. The hairdressers next door lies in darkness, as does the barber further up the street. Outside the Bellaghy Bawn, though, Turf Man is perpetually busy. I tweet out a picture, asking people to guess the location. One reply suggests I wont get many quotes off Turf Man. The quiet man at the quiet end of town. Walking down the Ballyscullion Road towards Paacuteirc Seaacuten de Bruacuten, the traffic noise subsides to a faint rumble. My footsteps begin to echo off the low walls of the houses on my left. A bottle blown across the road by the stf breeze rattles into earshot, against a backdrop of chirping birds. It is quiet down here. Some walkers are braving the changeable weather to get their steps in. A woman walking her dog walks along the empty stand on the far side of the pitch. I contemplate the plaque commemorating Sean Brown. The words remembering his tragic death are framed by a bleak sky. In need of inspiration, I head for Seamus Heaneys grave. At the chapel, two men are standing on scaffolding that reaches half way up its tower, staring upwards. With all churches closed, they can work largely undisturbed. The grave of Seamus Heaney. There is no one  in the graveyard, not even weary home-schooling parents taking a school trip to the Poet Laureates resting place. On the way back into the town, three children are playing in the yard of Bellaghy Primary School. A member of staff supervises. Their laughter carries on the breeze all the way down the hill. If only the drivers shooting disapproving looks at each other on the roundabout could hear it. Throughout Bellaghy, there are sets of outdoor chairs set into the concrete pavements. Under normal circumstances, people would be passing their lunchtime sitting in them, chatting to others. As I sit outside the pharmacy, the postman pulls up to the Spar, collecting letters and parcels from its post office. An NI Water van passes through. An Ulsterbus carrying just two passengers. Tractors rattle busily up and down the street. A DHL delivery van approaches the roundabout, the driver glancing at the street signs before turning left towards Castledawson. The unsung are quietly grafting away, navigating the pandemic and ensuring le goes on. No rest for the essential.  Back in the car, a radio bulletin announces the Northern Ireland Executive have extended lockdown measures for a month. Normalitys odds have ened. So much of normal le feels empty at present. The constant cycle of infection, sickness and death has hollowed it out. Leaving Bellaghy, Im struck by the symbolism of those empty chairs. Despite your best efforts, sometimes grim reminders are impossible to avoid.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ladies football and camogie, while they bring so much to the association, are still on the fringes. To a few, they have the same respect as their male counterparts, but not by all. I write this as the news breaks of Kamala Harris being sworn in as the first female Vice President of the USA, at a time when new President Joe Biden set about uniting the country. The camogieand ladies footballboards were formed after the main body of the GAA in , but to many they have always come under the loose GAA umbrella. But officially, and more importantly, they should all be part of one association. googletag.cmd.push At county level, venues for camogie and ladies are rolled out after football and hurling have theirs set in stone. Its not uncommon for teams to be finalising their training without knowing where they are playing. Just like in Croke Park, all provinces and counties have their separate fixtures boards. But Id like to see it all rolled into one. It just makes sense on so many levels. Teresa McKennaand Colette Darraghare exceptionally helpful when seeking information for games. Likewise, Breige ONeill with all things football and hurling. No doubt there will be a degree of working together in the background. Why not take it a step further, with a central committee that leads the ious codes  googletag.cmd.push There is so much common ground. And, overall, it would help on so many fronts – promotion, sponsorship, links to the media, sorting referees and venues. The benefits are endless. God rest Hugh McWilliams, but his HA brand is emblazoned across all Derry and Ballinascreen gear. Hurling and camogie. Ladies and mens football. That says it all. Uniting all parties is not something that could be done over night and it wouldnt be without its teething problems, but it should be granted adequate time at the committee table. When you think of the households across Ireland, where players are representing the ious codes. It makes sense to have a more joined up approach.     Last week, I spoke to Magherafelts Sara Gribben who has been the clubs camogie Chairperson for  years and she is very highly thought of for the efforts she puts in. Likewise, a lot of males have channelled a lot of effort for the betterment of camogie and ladies football. As a wider association, total integration is the way forward. A few years back, Slaughtneil ran a highly successful fundraising draw. At the heart of it was Bernie McEldowney, who worked diligently with her husband Eamon, as they kept tabs on over poundk. The Emmets adopted the GAAs One Club model. The senior captains and coaching officers of all three codes are on it. There is also a fair sprinkling of all codes across the main committee. And so it should. Desertmartin Chairman Pat Kidd is proud that their club committee has many women on board as men. In , the GAA, Ladies Football and Camogie Association came together to produce a -page set of guidelines for clubs to run their affairs. When you think about the amount of dferent skills a clubs membership now has, the potential is endless. There are experts in fundraising, coaching, running events, health and well-being, all with the personality to link into the local community. It can betied together with the use of technology. It gives everyone the chance of belonging. The only drawback can be those looking out for their own kids, but a strong chairperson and high standards will quickly knock that on the head. I just think that all this potential can be railroadedthe GAA is not totally united. There is a school of thought that feels the mens side have invested all the money in sponsorship and infrastructure and should keep the mainstream GAA on its own. In my opinion, thats a very shallow mindset. In this day and age, equality is everything. Any organisation worth its salt will want the best people involved. Thats how the GAA needs to be sold. The USA, for the circus it has become over the past four years, has made a seismic statement by appointing Kamala Harris. Why  Because, like newly appointed Galway United manager Lisa Fallon, she is the best candidate. For the GAA, they know what all the ingredients have to offer at the top tables finest feast. So, its time to put them all on the official shopping list.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

If an application is made to the council for a bilingual street sign, residents of the street are contacted and askedthey support such a move. At present, at least % of the respondents must be in favour of the bilingual sign for it to erected. However, the council this evening voted to support a reduction of this threshold to %. The decision was described by unionist councillors at the councils monthly meeting as a backwards step for cross community relations in the local area. googletag.cmd.push However, those who backed the decision said it would promote equality. The proposal to reduce the threshold was put forward in a motion by Sinn Fein councillor Mickey Cooper. His motion read: Given the increasing demand for bi-lingual street signs to be installed in the DCSDC area, this council supports the lowering of the threshold for the installation of bilingual signage in addresses within the DCSDC boundary to %.This proposal would require one resident or their local councillor to come forward with the request to erect a bilingual street sign andthis was to gain the support of % of residents on the electoral register then this would be suffice to go forward for approval by Council. googletag.cmd.push DUP Alderman David Ramsey proposed an amendment to Cllr Coopers motion, which read:In the interests of good relations, equality and democracy, this council asks the Environment and Regeneration committee to form a working group to consider this further and attempt to achieve cross community support. However, when a vote to decideAlderman Ramseys amendment would be added to the original motion, it was defeated by  votes to nine. Members of the unionist parties on the council voted to support the inclusion of Alderman Ramseys amendment, while Sinn Fein, SDLP, People Before Profit, Aontuacute, Alliance and independent councillors voted against it.     Cllr Coopers original motion was then put to a vote and was passed by  votes to nine. Unionist councillors voted against the motion, while it was supported by all other councillors at the meeting. Cllr Cooper said the issue was not about Irish street signs but about promoting equality within all communities. This is not about removing the English language from street signs. It is about being inclusive. That is not a threat to anyone and should be celebrated, he said.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The boat, named Day Dawn N , ran ashore on August  last year and has remained anchored to the spot ever since. The retired fishing vessel had been acquired by Nathan Ross and Druso Martinez de Riquelme with a view to mooring it at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast as an Air B ‘n’ B. However, after running into dficulty last August, those plans have been put on hold. It was initially suspected that the tide was too low to refloat the boat. googletag.cmd.push However, the owners later revealed that the bigger issue was the fact that it’s suspended over a three and a half metre crater in the mudflats. In late November, the stars seemed to align to the sailors’ delight a high tide arrived and they secured the services of marine specialists to dig a channel under the boat in order to move it to a nearby marina. The drones were out to capture the moment Day Dawn made it back to sea. Unfortunately, their efforts proved unfruitful and, according to the owners, the operation cost a substantial sum of money. There has been little to no activity around the boat since the start of this year. googletag.cmd.push The Derry News asked Foyle Portthere will come a time when it may have to intervene orit’s possible the boat could become a permanent fixture on the River Foyle landscape. In response, a spokesperson said: “The responsibility for the movement of the boat remains firmly with the owners and we would encourage them to continue to do all they can to have the vessel re-floated. “This is an unfortunate situation that they have created and now must make every effort to employ further resources to deal with this problem. “We continue to monitor the location to ensure that the vessel poses no threat to the main navigation channel, nor that it is causing any unnecessary impact to the local environment.”     The boat owners were contacted for comment but none was provided at the time of publishing.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Colmcille  is a year-long commemoration marking the thanniversary of the birth of Colmcille - also known as Columba. Donegal County Council and Derry City  Strabane District Council are co-ordinating a programme for the year which includes a community grants scheme now open for applications until .pm on Friday thFebruary . Grants of €, or pound, are available for projects that primarily take place within the Donegal County Council or Derry City  Strabane District Council areas and the scheme is open to community organisations or groups iniduals working in partnership with communities. googletag.cmd.push The thanniversary recognises the importance and legacy of the th-century saint, not only for Donegal and Derry but for the island of Ireland, Scotland and across the world. The year-long celebrations will last from the thDecember  to thDecember . The programme being co-ordinated by the two councils is supported by key partners including the North West Development Fund, in conjunction with and supported by The Executive Office and The Irish Government. The programme builds on an Audit of Columban Heritage undertaken in  and is being delivered in partnership with a range of local, regional, national and international organisations. A dedicated Colmcille  Project Manager has recently been appointed as part of the programme to lead and co-ordinate cross-border commemorations for the year. googletag.cmd.push This will include a range of projects, events and activities as well as the grant scheme. The programme aims to raise knowledge and understanding of Colmcille and to establish a lasting legacy. The grant scheme will play an important role in this by supporting local communities to contribute to the year and its legacy. Colmcille  Project Manager, Deirdre Harte said Im delighted to be in post and excited for the year ahead. One of the first tasks has been to get a small grant scheme up and running to provide funding for projects that relate to any aspect of Colmcilles legacy, for example, through culture, heritage, arts, literature, spirituality, language, music or storytelling.     I would really encourage local groups to come up with creative ideas to mark this signicant anniversary which could include activities such as events, exhibitions, artwork or other projects with a strong Colmcille theme. COVID has provided unique challenges to commemorating Colmcille this year but there is an opportunity to bring celebrations to an international audience through virtual events for example. This is an exciting opportunity to showcase the creativity of our local communities and to open up Colmcilles legacy to new audiences of all ages. We look forward to seeing what ideas emerge.

Dr McGinley set up a small steering committee in  to fundraise before officially opening the Foyle Hospice in the city in  and, since that opening, the deeply-valued palliative care centre has been a source of great comfort and assistance to thousands of families across not only the city, but the entire district. Dr McGinley was honoured for his selfless and le-changing work by Derry City Council in  when he was awarded the prestigious Freedom of Derry. googletag.cmd.push He also received a papal knighthood from Pope John Paul II in  and has a sculpture in his honour in St Columbs Park. Mayor Tierney said his thoughts were with Dr McGinleys children Ciaran, Aisling, Ronan and Sinead, and his extended family and friends. I was deeply saddened today to learn of the news of Dr McGinleys passing, a man who has had such a profound effect on the lives of acountless number of families across our district and the wider North West region. It was after an encounter with a young man with terminal cancer that Dr McGinley pursued the idea of opening a palliative care facility in the city, and we are all immensely grateful for his determination, dedication and passion in following through and opening the Foyle Hospice. googletag.cmd.push Dr McGinley has left a legacy on this city and its people that will last for generations to come and we know that his vision will continue to be delivered by the hard-working team at Foyle Hospice. The Freedom of Derry was one of many deserving honours that Dr McGinley received but for him thats not what it was about – he wanted to help as many people and as many families as he could through some of their toughest days. My thoughts and prayers are with Dr McGinleys children, his wider family circle and his many friends. I hope that they can take some comfort in knowing how deeply loved and appreciated he was by all across this city, district and region.

The -year-old, captain at Derry City last season, had one year left on his contract at the Brandywell, but made a transfer request, which the club had reluctantly accepted. “I’m absolutely delighted to join Galway United,”McCormack said today. “I’m really looking forward to the start of the season now. It’s been a busy few days getting the deal over the line – I’m just pleased to finally get it done now. “John is a great manager, you can see what he did with Cork City, we had great success there together. I spent three years playing under him down there, now John’s come to Galway United, and hopefully we can replicate that success here. googletag.cmd.push “We will be targetinga strong start and hopefully the fans can get back into the stadium and drive us on until the end of the season.” It is a reunion for Galway manager John Caulfield and the midfielder who enjoyed success at Cork City together and the manager was understandably delighted to get his man. “Conor has got great leadership qualities, he’s a top player on the park and with the young squad that we have, I think he’s a perfect fit to come into what we’re trying to build at the club. “It’s taken a bit of time, Derry have been very cooperative, they obviously didn’t want to lose one of their top players, but Conor wanted to move further down and it’s a great fit for us. I’m thankful to our board for going out and helping to get him into the club and obviously our sponsors too. googletag.cmd.push “We’re getting a player that has won major trophies and played in several European games. Conor is going to come into our team and hopefully drive it forward, so that we can compete at the top of the table, that’s the reason we’ve gone out and brought him into the club. “Conor is only , he’s played with huge clubs in this league, and he’s won a lot of major honours. I’ve had Conor for a number of years, I’ve seen how he applies himself every day, he trains how he plays, and that’s what you want. His overall presence, not just on match night, but around the training ground and in the dressing room, he’s just a great leader.     “Conor is someone that our young players can look up to, because he’s a thorough professional. We’re really excited to have him at the club.” McCormack is understood to have had discussions with manager Declan Devine in the latter stages of last season about his desire to move closer to home. Club CEO Sean Barrett confirmed the move this weekend, adding: We reluctantly accepted Conors request to move closer to home for family reasons. We also had to be clear however that any move would have to be on Derry City FCs terms and as a consequence, we came to a suitable arrangement with Galway United. As a club we would like to thank Conor for his efforts both as a player and as our captain and we wish him every success in the future.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He has represented Ireland in multiple events over recent years and has quietly built up a reputation as one of the finest runners to come from the city.Eamon, a runner himself, decided to combine his passion of athletics and cinema, and, taking the skills he has learned working with McMatic Media, has directed and produced his first documentary.It has been a labour of love over the past two years for the -year-old.“Myself and my friend Paul Gormley, who is a producer alongside me on the project, went to Vienna to see Eliud Kipchoge break the two-hour barrier,” he explained.“We were going to make a film about running in general but when we were in Vienna we saw that it wasn’t really what we were looking for, so we talked about it and decided that instead of starting out globally, for our first film we would take it back home and start local.“One of the main characters in the film is Malcolm McCausland who is a real character in the film. We went to his house one night and talked about who we should make the film about. He said Conor was the man because he was a humble guy who has a great story about someone who wanted to represent Ireland internationally. He always showed great potential but once he hit really good form he would get injured, so it was about shining some light on him. The further I got into it, I studied Conor and realised that there was this wealth of archive spread across Ireland.“I rang Conor and asked himhe would be interested in an independent documentary and he said he would, which is where it was conceived.”Eamon’s approach to the film has evolved from that first trip to Vienna and that first conversation with Conor, and whilst the Spartan is the focus, the story is also about Derry itself and the impact of running in Ireland.“When I really honed in on it, I wanted to make the story Derry-based,” Eamon admitted.“The story is just as much about Derry and Ireland as it is about Conor. I started filming with Conor and then the story started to develop.“Conor had that summer when he ran in the Morton Games in Cork and was the fastest guy over m, running sub- which was the first time in  years that someone from Derry did that. He ultimately ends up running in the European Athletics Cross-Country.“Because his story expanded, I was able to follow him and show the European Athletics Association what I was doing.“They could see that I was doing it at a professional level so they allowed me their archive. They gave me unbelievable footage, so the story really expands at the end – it’s not just about Conor.” googletag.cmd.push  Film FestivalsOnce the film is complete, it will be entered into the Cork and Galway Film Festivals in the hope of being accepted.“It’s been quite the journey,” he stated.“It’s just under two years since I started. If it gets traction it might be later this year when we’ll be able to share it. I’m really excited about sharing it online. For me I want to go the professional route.

There is a wealth of talent in it. The Derry creatives really came together and my friends really helped me bring it to fruition.“I’m just excited about it. We’ve needed a lot of patience during these teams but we’ve just been quietly working away and Conor has been amazing. The whole running community has also been amazing, so many of them have reached out.“When it’s released, I think it will just be a nice piece for the running community and for Conor. He is a really humble guy who doesn’t promote himself. All those nights he was out running, it will just be nice to see that. He has a lot more to come as well.”The challenges brought about by Covid- were unexpected but ultimately manageable for Eamon and his team, and they were finally able to show their work to Conor himself, ahead of the big realse later on this year.“It was scary showing it to Conor because we didn’t show him anything for a year,” Eamon laughed. “Fortunately his reaction was very positive.“Once that happened I could just enjoy it more. On the technical side, I’ve shown some other directors and they have given me good feedback for some tweaks.

He has represented Ireland in multiple events over recent years and has quietly built up a reputation as one of the finest runners to come from the city.Eamon, a runner himself, decided to combine his passion of athletics and cinema, and, taking the skills he has learned working with McMatic Media, has directed and produced his first documentary.It has been a labour of love over the past two years for the -year-old.“Myself and my friend Paul Gormley, who is a producer alongside me on the project, went to Vienna to see Eliud Kipchoge break the two-hour barrier,” he explained.“We were going to make a film about running in general but when we were in Vienna we saw that it wasn’t really what we were looking for, so we talked about it and decided that instead of starting out globally, for our first film we would take it back home and start local.“One of the main characters in the film is Malcolm McCausland who is a real character in the film. We went to his house one night and talked about who we should make the film about. He said Conor was the man because he was a humble guy who has a great story about someone who wanted to represent Ireland internationally. He always showed great potential but once he hit really good form he would get injured, so it was about shining some light on him. The further I got into it, I studied Conor and realised that there was this wealth of archive spread across Ireland.“I rang Conor and asked himhe would be interested in an independent documentary and he said he would, which is where it was conceived.”Eamon’s approach to the film has evolved from that first trip to Vienna and that first conversation with Conor, and whilst the Spartan is the focus, the story is also about Derry itself and the impact of running in Ireland.“When I really honed in on it, I wanted to make the story Derry-based,” Eamon admitted.“The story is just as much about Derry and Ireland as it is about Conor. I started filming with Conor and then the story started to develop.“Conor had that summer when he ran in the Morton Games in Cork and was the fastest guy over m, running sub- which was the first time in  years that someone from Derry did that. He ultimately ends up running in the European Athletics Cross-Country.“Because his story expanded, I was able to follow him and show the European Athletics Association what I was doing.“They could see that I was doing it at a professional level so they allowed me their archive. They gave me unbelievable footage, so the story really expands at the end – it’s not just about Conor.” googletag.cmd.push  Film FestivalsOnce the film is complete, it will be entered into the Cork and Galway Film Festivals in the hope of being accepted.“It’s been quite the journey,” he stated.“It’s just under two years since I started. If it gets traction it might be later this year when we’ll be able to share it. I’m really excited about sharing it online. For me I want to go the professional route. I’ve invested my own money into this. No-one would help us, no-one would back us. It was just an idea.”The entire product is almost exclusively local and Eamon admits he could not have made it this far without a dedicated team.“It is home made,” he emphasises. “The music composed in it is very obvious and prominent and that’s by Composer James Curran.

He also managed the club for  games over  and , saving the club from relegation in that infamous play-off against Finn Harps just over  years ago.Dykes, now assistant manager at Warrenpoint Town, has a wealth of League of Ireland experience and knows what it takes to succeed, having won the First Division title and FAI Cup with Sligo in , the Premier Division title with Derry City in  and again with Sligo Rovers in , as assistant manager to Ian Baraclough.Dykes is still an occasional visitor to the Brandywell and keeps up to date with his former team and after a disappointing year at the club last year, he can empathise with current boss Declan Devine on the pressure he may now be facing as he heads towards another season.“Its a dficult job and theres pressure on it,” he said.“The team that I played in were part-time, but Felix was the manager and we had a good core of lads in from Dublin and it worked really well. Derry have now gone full time andyoure bringing in a lot of players from England and Scotland youre taking a chance.“The football world being the way it is, you lose three games and youre under pressure. Its a really dficult job. In this modern world, does Derry have the financial punch to compete with the Dundalks and Shamrock Rovers  They didnt make Europe last year so Im sure that will affect their budget this year. We all know that Philip ODoherty puts a lot of his own money into it and only for him, where would it be  Its a very dficult job and theres no quick fix in it. I think Decky will do wellhes given time.” googletag.cmd.push  Highs and lowsDykes has experienced the highs and lows at Derry City and believes that with certain structures in place, consistent progress could be made at the club over the next few years.“I would always go with local players with Derry City because that helps,” he continued. “They finally got the Academy going and there was a lot of work that went on, but there was always a sprinkle of locals like Coyler, Peter Hutton, Paul Curran or Sean Hargan, there were always a few. You need that, and you need to look where, but thats dficult.“I always think the model that suits is the Bohemians model. You have Keith Long and Trevor Croly and they are part-time, but they are part time-full time. They are in Monday Tuesday, then theyre off, they have brought players back from England, they have got their education, and they work alongside football and that works really well for them.“For a club that was in serious trouble four years ago, they are going to be up challenging for titles. It should give Derry hope.“The other side of that is trying to attract players to Derry, and I know from being manager of Sligo and trying to attract players to Sligo, its not easy. Its very challenging.”That challenge is one which many Derry City managers have found challenging over the years. With the recent signings of Danny Lafferty and David Parkhouse, the numberplayers signed to the club in the past six years now stands at , with last season highlighting the risks of bringing players to Derry, who dont know the club, the league or the city.“Recruitment is key,” Dykes agreed.“If you have good recruitment, there are a lot of good players out there but a lot of players who might come over as well and see Derry as just a wage packet.“If you want to take a gamble on a player, you sign them for a season, buta player does well for a season, one of the bigger clubs come looking, so maybe it should be a policy to sign players on two-year contracts. I dont know.“A lot of it is geared by finances. I know when I was manager, Jim Roddy was a gentleman and really, really good to me, but it is dficult. We were part-time back then and we were trying to attract players from Dublin, and you werent getting the top players from Dublin, but yet you were paying top dollar to get them up the road.“Maybe they should look a wee bit at the Northern market. At the moment thats flying and there are some really, really good players. Coleraine are going well and they have some good young players andthey got some players who were originally from Derry and brought them back, I think that would be a great start for them. It ticks a box for them because youre getting good players and theres also that local Derry identity with it.”PressuresDespite the disappointment of , and the renewed expectation on the manager heading into the  season, Dykes believes that Devine will get the time to show that he can bring success to the club again, and is expecting, based on his own experience as manager, the current boss to get the backing he needs from the fans.“Derry and Sligo are very much alike in my opinion,” he explained. “Derry will always hold a special place for me and I love going back there. I always found the people there to be very friendly, even when things were going bad, it was really well supported. It is dficult though because youre in a glass bowl. I didnt live up there so I was still travelling up and down and that might have been a wee bit easier.“Sometimes, with full time players, you go to training in the morning, but what do you do in the afternoons  Idle hearts sometimes doesnt do much good, so I think the Bohemians model is something that Derry should look at.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I suppose with the first lockdown, things were definitely easier. It was spring, coming into summer, we all had the good weather and there was a novelty to it really. Now though, it has been slightly tougher. But listen, overall I canrsquot complain at all. Irsquom still in training, working in football too, so I am very lucky I have that.CB: How did you find things at the start of lockdown because there did appear to be some ambiguity as to whether the Irish League players could be classed as elite athletes and continue playing  That must have been confusing and unsettling AW: It was a strange one no doubt. Certainly everyone involved in the Irish League, especially at Premiership level, strives to be elite. A lot of us are full-time. I have certainly no problem with the extra training that comes with that and the extra work.But the players do need to be subject to regular testing for Covid-. It is counter-productive to what we, as a society, are trying to do in terms of curtailing this disease otherwise.There has been a lot of ambiguity, but certainly I havenrsquot encountered a player who didnrsquot want to be playing. But obviously we are all concerned that we are able to do so in as safe a manner as possible.At the end of the day, after a match or a training session, we are all going back to loved ones and people who may be vulnerable too. We want to ensure they are as protected as possible.CB: In terms of your role and your standing now at Linfield, you would be considered to be one of the veterans of the side, but you still seem as hungry as ever for goals and success.AW: Absolutely, and in many ways you know that has been the case even more since the first lockdown. At that stage I had so much on with my work with the Irish FA, I probably didnrsquot have the time I would have liked to have dedicated to my own football.But certainly you can see the dference it makes to your season and your ability to hit the ground runningyou do get that good pre-season base in.I was doing my own fitness work in the house during the lockdown.I embrace where I am at now in my career and my age. But I am fortunate in that sense. I know a lot of people who get to my stage and they basically dread retirement. I am  now, so I suppose you do think about when retirement will come.Over the past while, as one of the more senior players at Linfield, I have been able to take on more, I suppose, of that advisory role to younger players. You know those younger guys coming to me asking me about fitness programmes, looking for advice about clubs and things like that, it is great.I am still, believe it or not, learning about the game. I am adapting my role on the pitch too as I move into this latter phase of my playing career. Sometimes you have to do that.But I am going back to foundations and in many ways that has really helped my form this season.Things like learning about playing more with your back to goal, how to use that to your advantage. It is something I have really enjoyed and as I say, embraced.CB: You have played under many of the top managers in the Irish League during your time. David Healy, another local figure at the club like yourself, obviously went into the Linfield job very much managerially as a rookie, although having of course achieved so much as a player. How would you rate him as a manager and indeed how he has made that switch from the pitch to the dugout AW: David I know, never really foresaw becoming a manager. He would tell you that himself. What I do notice about him is, despite everything he achieved, he never talks about his playing days. He is a huge Linfield supporter and he is results-driven. Make no mistake though, he rules with an iron fist.He expects very high standards. It is the job of the players who are there to win. Thatrsquos it, no excuses. Dferent managers bring dferent attributes to any job. But certainly with David,you fall below his standard, you will know.With playing under the like of David Jeffrey, he is a very dferent case. He loved to create that whole ethos of lsquoeverbody hates Linfieldrsquo, and I guess tap into that siege mentality side of things.DJ I suppose, would have been a bit more touchy-feely with the players than perhaps David Healy. Jeffrey would have brought the players to the side, and had the little one-to-one man management conversations with them.But I will say working with David [Healy], especially as he himself was a striker, has taken my game to a whole dferent level since I have been working with him. There is never a comfort zone at Linfield mdash that is the big thing. That has been a key part of my longevity I believe. You constantly have to be kicking on at Linfield. Anyone who coasts at Linfield, they donrsquot last long.CB: Casting your mind back to your days with Kilmore Rec, how much do you think the Amateur League and Kilmore helped you in terms of being ready for the steps up you made AW: Thatrsquos a really good question. The Amateur League is a brilliant springboard for then moving on to the Irish League. You play real first team football. As a player, you can sometimes spend too long at bigger clubsrsquo academies.I had been at the Glentoran academy for a while before I went back to Kilmore for first team football. I was lucky at that time with the Kilmore first team that was there. I played with boys like Gary Curran, Paul Smyth, Joe McMahon.They were players who wanted to win so badly, they played fair, but they played hard. I went into Duck [Donal] Bellrsquos team just as the club were going on a great Irish Cup run that season. That gave me a complete love for the game.But I quickly got to the stage where I didnrsquot just want to do two days a week with my football. Donrsquot get me wrong, the Amateur League, Premier Section is a good standard. As a footballing family, there is a lot for us to be proud of with the Amateur League.Obviously at the moment, all the clubs at that standard are in such a dficult place, but a good club at that level serves a purpose in so many ways, especially for the community. For clubs like Kilmore, and indeed all those playing at that level, it is a real tragedy that there is no football being played at the moment.CB: You are also heavily involved in the coaching side of things with your work with the IFA. Is coaching something you think you might be interested in post-playing, and indeed do you want to remain in football when you hang the boots up AW: I am definitely at the stage now I suppose where I am asking myself how can I remain in the game. It is without doubt something I want to do, to stay in football. But it is about working out exactly in what role that would be best for me.I suppose I have been able to work on a bit of a niche thing for myself with the Irish FA with a coaching and education role. I have done a bit of work with Gerard Lyttle with the Northern Ireland under-age teams and that has been something I have really enjoyed. It is great to see the progress of the younger boys through the dferent age levels with Northern Ireland.CB: You made the move for a time to Hamilton and were up against the top teams in Scotland. How was playing over there for you AW: It is funny you ask about that. My uncle only last night was asking me about all that is happening with Celtic at the moment. When I was there in Scotland you had boys like James McCarthy, Leigh Grfiths, James Forrest all up-and-coming and you could tell easily at that stage that they were boys who were going places. It is definitely a better standard of football in Scotland than a of people realise. I remember when I moved to Hamilton from Lisburn Distillery, I had played for Distillery on the Tuesday night, and then the move to Hamilton picked up momentum quickly.All of a sudden, come the Sunday of that week, there I was playing for Hamilton at Aberdeen in a Scottish Cup game in front of , people. I have to be honest, maybe I was a bit young at the time, maybe the home sickness got the better of me, but I do regret that I came home from Scotland again so soon.I have regretted it every day. You donrsquot want to let the like of that eat away at you, but I was there. I was rubbing shoulders with the gamersquos best.If I could go back and relive that experience again, I would do it in a heartbeat. But you donrsquot want to dwell on it, otherwise it could destroy you.I trained as hard as anyone over there. Maybe I would say compared to others at that standard, I struggled technically. You can get so down on yourself but when you are younger. For me, the chance came too early.It was the last day of the January transfer window when I made the move to Scotland. It actually looked for a long time that Irsquod be going to Aberdeen. However, that fell through at the last minute. I went to Hamilton then, but unfortunately it was just the wrong club for me.I did have chances again to go across the water. When Warren Feeney got the Newport job, he wanted me to go across there, but it wasnrsquot right for me. Everyone has a dferent journey. I was a late developer.Football is a tough place. People watch the Premier League and think that is what it is all about, but in many ways that is not the real picture of what football is, the glamour that is seemingly there. It is so tough to crack the code across the water.It is especially dficult for an Irish kid. If it is an English kid at an English club or a Scottish youngster at a Scottish club, they can easily go back and forth to their family, and alleviate that home-sickness.You canrsquot have thatyou are an Irish kid over there as easily. It can be lonely at times, and it is tough there is no doubt.CB: When you look at Scottish football this season, and particularly in the Premiership for Celtic and Rangers, there has been a complete transformation in fortunes and that in the season when Celtic have been chasing that historic ten-in-a-row. Has the role-reversal between the two Glasgow sides surprised you AW: There is no doubt, the change has been really drastic. I never imagined, despite how much Steven Gerrard has improved Rangers that the gap would be this big, particularly this early in the season.I know Michael Beale, a coach at Rangers from working at the IFA. He is a methodical coach, leaves nothing to chance, and I have no doubt he will have had a big role on the success Rangers are enjoying on the pitch at the moment. Gerrard has done a great job of getting that Rangers back four shored up.But things go wrong. For Celtic, I have no doubt they have found it dficult playing without fans.They definitely feed off the atmosphere that is usually generated by the supporters at Celtic Park.And the Dubai trip has been a really unwanted distraction that has not helped them at all.I do believe however for Celtic it can be a quick turn-around. I donrsquot necessarily see that they will now have to wait years for another Scottish title, the way in which it has been so long since Rangers last won it.Celtic can dust themselves down. Football can be so fluid. That is one of the great things about it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch named Irish club of the year by writers  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH RFC have been voted as the best rugby club in Ireland.The club was named Club of the Year by the Guinness Rugby Writers of Ireland Club of the Year.The club won the accolade for its outstanding community outreach work during the Covid- lockdown.This community spirit, said the Rugby writers, was nurtured from mini rugby players through to the seniors.Club chairman James Kirk said everyone at the club was delighted with the award.We are obviously very pleased.

It is only by us understanding how our wildle is faring that we can protect it.ldquoWersquove noticed that more people have signed up now for the Birdwatch than had at this stage last year, which is fantastic. We know that nature is in crisis and together we can all take action to solve the problems facing it. Nature needs us.Just one hour every year for the past four decades has made the RSPBrsquos big garden birdwatch the worldrsquos largest garden wildle citizen science project.

They cannot take a chance and send plants to us as they may be delayed at our new border. A plant, like food, is perishable and a delivery could be taken and destroyed. Who will be willing to take that chance  I guess no one.Beth said Northern Ireland has the same climate as the rest of Great Britain and plants that do well there will also do well here, explaining that the local nursery is more selective about taking plants from Europe.She said the new regulations were not just a challenge for Saintfield Nurseries, but the entire Northern Ireland horticultural industry.The new reality for some businesses is that it has become easier to get key supplies from the EU, with Beth explaining that she already gets part of her stock from the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland and that this may have to increase.She said that several nurseries in the Republic of Ireland are emailing the Saintfield business saying theyrsquore going to have roses, but they may not be the particular ieties that they really want.Beth added: ldquoWe were told we would leave the EU as one country, the UK. We have been badly let down by all those that govern us. We should be equal to Scotland, Wales and England all of us members of the United Kingdom, but sadly now this is not the case.ldquoOne of my suppliers in England who contacted me last Friday thought there would be no problem supplying us but now the whole Northern Ireland and Brexit issue is a complete nightmare.The Horticultural Trades Associationis also lobbying the government, urging it to work with the EU to explore ways to ease the new rules.ldquoThe impact of these complex and burdensome changes is far-reaching for GB and NI, said the organisationrsquos chairman James Barnes, warning that the UKrsquos horticulture industry stands to lose outsolutions cannot be found..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Centennial.jpg","title":"Centennial celebrations event by Spa Wells LOL  ","story":"MEMBERS of Spa Wells LOL  kicked off their year long celebrations of the Centennial of Northern Ireland with a hike up Slieve Croob on New Yearrsquos Day.Crisp clear weather afforded enchanting views stretching to neighbouring Scotland and England.A poem was written to commemorate the occasion.On Slieve Croobrsquos lofty mountain peak:We placed our flag todayTo give a message to the worldThat we are here to stayOne hundred years have come and goneOur motto is the sameThe Union is our safeguardAnd this we will maintain.The members plan more exciting and interestingprojects throughout the year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Student.jpg","title":"Cormac secures place at prestigious Harvard University  ","story":"A TEENAGER will be swapping Downpatrick for Hard University later this year.Cormac Savage is the first pupil from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School to be offered a place at the world famous American university.Seventeen year-old Cormac, who is head boy at St Patrickrsquos, says itrsquos a dream come true to be given an opportunity to study at what is regarded as one of the top universities in the world.Hersquos also grateful to his family and the teachers at St Patrickrsquos, including the principal, Mr Joe McCann, for encouraging him to apply in the first place.Hard is one of the fabled lsquoIvy Leaguersquo universities in the United States and Cormac was one of , students to apply for a place, of which only seven per cent were successful.ldquoWhile Irsquod always wanted to study in the USA, it wasnrsquot until a year ago I seriously considered Hard, he said.ldquoIt was always my dream university but I was convinced I wouldnrsquot get in.

I have made up my mind to go abroad to work and I think a lot of other students will do that as well.The Nursing and Midwery Council , the registration body for nurses, recently extended its Emergency Standards to allow final year nursing students to undertake paid clinical placements in order to support the existing nursing workforce during the pandemic.While this has been introduced in England, Scotland and Wales, Robin Swann has declined to implement them into Northern Ireland.In early December, the Department of Health said a joint statement from the NMC and UK chief nursing officers explained that students would not be put into paid placements, as happened earlier during the pandemic.The statement said that instead, employing health trusts would protect their status as supernumerary students and continue to support them through high quality placements, which is a fundamental aspect of pre-registration nurse training.South Down MP Chris Hazzard is supporting the call from Eimear and other final year nursing students.He added: ldquoThese nurses are working at the front line and saving lives.

He has performed the role of club chairman, with his playing reduced to part-time due to the fact he suffers from arthritis in a finger.He has played for Drumaroad in the past, and in more recent seasons for the former top club in Downpatrick, De La Salle.Back in the days of the Lecale Leaguersquos Spin magazine, which was edited by the late and sadly-missed Gerry Carson, Jim provided lsquoPeople in the Newsrsquo and lsquoAt your Servicersquo on a regular basis.This was back in the late s. Starting in  he produced another magazine named Equipment Plus.At this stage, he was running his Table Tennis Servicesfrom his home in Castlewellan. However, as many will recall, for some years he ran Northern Irelandrsquos only table tennis shop in Irish Street, Downpatrick. He had a steady line of customers from near and far who came to make their purchases.As all local players will of course know, Jim is the local man to go to for advice on what rubber suits inidual players.As one who has made use of his help and advice on many occasions, it is quite common to arrive in Strangford to play a match, or indeed in another local hall, and find Jim replacing rubbers.He has also given people from ious local halls advice and has moved many on to pimpled rubbers in recent years, saving them money. A good many seasons back, Jim, anxious to give some of the Strangford clubrsquos younger players a bit of extra publicity, wrote reports for the Down Recorder.As a close associate to the long-time secretary of the Lecale League, Pat Morgan, there was never any doubt who would replace Pat when he sadly passed away.Since taking over, he has certainly done his utmost to keep the league going. He has brought in new clubs and written regular and well-received reports, as well as travelling to matches to take team photos.As well as being a great supporter of the Lecale League over many years, he has also been a great supporter of the East Down Churches League.He has attended and made donations for the leaguersquos annual charity cup match, as well as being present at their annual presentation evening.While Jim has been in regular action in recent seasons, he has proven that while form is temporary, class is permanent.When called upon to help a local team out in the Belfast  District League, he has been the only player on the team to win a game.As well as being a title-winning player, he has also proven he is a superb organiser as those that have attended the Lecale Leaguersquos th and th anniversary evenings know.In fact, so many turned up at the th anniversary event that lsquohouse fullrsquo notices had to go up.He even ran out of anniversary mugs for those who had played in the league over the years.While the Lecale League may not have as many teams as it did had in the past, the fact that it is still going is mainly thanks to Jim.It is also worth noting that with his guidance, the many charity tournaments he runs every season have raised a lot of money for Marie Curie and provided some great action for players.It is thanks to Jim and the late Pat Morgan that the league has been going now for over  years.

There are now mental health social workers in all the surgeries, yet  years ago you wouldnrsquot have heard of this, she added.Brenda said that while her family was sad at the closure, they were all very proud of what they had achieved with the help of the local community.ldquoWe truly believe we have saved lives and while it has been challenging at times, I wouldnrsquot have missed it for the world.

In , the  gained two million new members worldwide per month.The Strava team wrote in the report: ldquoAt the global level, the Covid- pandemic resulted in a rise of activity on Strava like wersquove never seen before, far surpassing our normal projections.In the UK, from March to May, members logged  per cent more outdoor activities than would be expected for that time of year, making the UK the most active global nation for outdoor activity.Alison continued: ldquoIt was a very bad year for everyone last year, and unfortunately this year has started in much the same way. With running though, it is one of those sports that is still accessible to us to take part in.When the regulations on sporting activity took hold, Alison said she and other members of the club were fastidious in following them to the letter.ldquoWe took our directive closely from Sport NI. We were able to develop a training plan that our members could follow inidually in January, and our members, because of the fact they are associated with the club, are particularly stringent about following the protocols as they should be done.ldquoRunning is something that can still be done outside, safely, and at a distance. Unless, for example you are running in a train of people, in these times, it is still a relatively low-risk activity. Both our sport and cycling have been able to proceed relatively well in terms of participation numbers.ldquoAnd from a mental health perspective, it offers so much. It has been a terrible time, for everybody for months with everything that has been happening. People have lost their lives, their loved ones, their livelihoods, running can be a nice outlet to just get away from things for that short time.Things may still be in limbo now in terms of planning any sporting activities locally in the district, but East Down AC members are still keeping their fingers crossed that the year ahead can still be one which will become more positive the longer into it we get.ldquoThis time last year, we would have had all our members training a lot, said Alison. ldquoThis year of course, we are not able to offer that. The Jimmyrsquos K is obviously a big event traditionally in the local athletics calendar, but that can attract around  runners. At the moment, it is just too dicy to even entertain that we could host that.ldquoHowever, we havenrsquot given up hope that we can still have some action to speak of later in the year with events. We would urge our members to keep training, keep themselves ready for when things can come back.ldquoWe know there are people out there who are naturally struggling with how things are. However people are there for you. The amount of virtual contact we all now have is something to embrace in these times. We have found we can even run a virtual league, which is something.Alison is hopeful that normal service can be resumed soon, as for many it is a huge leline to be a member of a running club.ldquoSome people are solitary. They may live alone, or work long hours alone. For those people, coming to the club to train, is as important in terms of getting face-to-face company with others.ldquoThese are the type of runners who donrsquot come to win the medals, they donrsquot come with winning as being the most important thing. It is about that human connection.ldquoDefinitely when I look around the town in Downpatrick, I can see more people out running, especially around the Quoile River and on the streets.ldquoRunning is a great outlet. It is not expensive, and for members of our club in particular, without it they would all be a lot more lonely..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Schools.jpg","title":"Schools set for closure to pave way for merger  ","story":"A PLAN to open a new co-educational voluntary grammar school for , pupils in Downpatrick from September  has been announced by the Education Authority.A two-month public consultation began today, with the final decision to be taken by Education Minister Peter Weir.Under the proposal St Patrickrsquos Grammar School would merge with St Maryrsquos High School and De La Salle High School.Adverts announcing the proposed dates of closure for all three schools and the opening of the new school have been placed by the Education Authority in todayrsquos Recorder.The Board of Governors at St Patrickrsquos are opposed to the merger and have reaffirmed their opposition this week, while De La Salle and St Maryrsquos are both in favour of the controversial plan going ahead.In a statement issued last night the Board of Governors at St Patrickrsquos called on parents, past pupils and members of the public to make their views known over the next two months.They said: ldquoThe outcome of this consultation will have a lasting impact, not just in the school, with staff and pupils, but its ramications will be felt throughout the local community in East Down.ldquoThe Board of Governors and management do not believe the case has been made for the proposals as currently outlined and will be re-stating the reasons for this as part of the public consultation process. That said, the Board and management are focused on achieving the best outcomes for all concerned.ldquoThe Board and management ask the parents of pupils, past pupils and members of the public impacted by these proposals to make their voices heard by participating in the consultation process. This is a matter for the entire community ndash not just those directly involved in education.The statement continued: ldquoFor over  years, St Patrickrsquos [the Red High] has been at the heart of the local community as a centre of learning, a resource hub and as an active contributor to civic le.ldquoPupils, past and present, have made and continue to make signicant contributions in the fields of sport, art, music, business and public service.ldquoThe motivation of the Board of Governors and management of the school is to ensure the widest range of parental and pupil choice remains available in the East Down region.Last December, the chairman of the Board of Governors, Dr Aidan Hamill, lost an application to the High Court for a judicial review questioning the Department of Educationrsquos authority to go ahead with the proposal before securing agreement from its governors.Under the merger plan the new school would educate girls and boys aged - with an admission of  pupils per year, with up to a maximum of % of pupils admitted through academic selection.Grammar schools in Northern Ireland normally admit students exclusively through academic selection.It is intended that existing school campuses would be used ldquopending capital investment for a one site solution.The closure of the three schools will also mean the loss of distinctive local school unorms as well as requiring all teaching and support staff to reapply for jobs at the proposed new school.The controversial amalgamation has been put forward by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolson behalf of the De La Salle Congregation, who are the trustees of all three schools.St Maryrsquos High School and De La Salle High School have declined to comment this week.However, both schools previously welcomed the proposed amalgamation, which originally included merging St Columbarsquos College in Portaferry.Mr Ciaran Maguire, principal of De La Salle, said in December that he was ldquodelighted to see the proposal going to full public consultation.He said at the time: ldquoItrsquos been a long time coming. I am reassured now that the families of the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority.Ms Rosemary McLaughlin, principal of St Maryrsquos, said last September that the merger reflected her values and belief in all-ability schools.She said: ldquoIn terms of social justice, I feel the move is very important.

There is also a busy local authority garage and depot and a private care nursing home, with this section of road governed by a mph limit.Residents say that the overwhelming majority of drivers who speed along the road are travelling from the Strangford direction and that the issue could be addressed mdashthe speed indicator sign was relocated further back to the entrance to Lecale Park mdashit has to have any signicant impact on the speeding.Those who live at this part of Downpatrick say while the majority of drivers obey the mph speed limit, there are a number who do not.The new speed indicator devices, designed to make drivers aware of their speed and to slow down, are dotted across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area and have been warmly welcomed.South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Downpatrick councillor John Trainor say the speeding data recorded by the devices and released by the Policing and Community and Safety Partnershipshows an average speed reduction in the Downpatrick area of .% and that the new initiative is working.Mr McGrath said that when he and his SDLP colleague initially floated the idea of erecting the speed indicator signs, the feedback was that the such a scheme would not be efficient and would be too expensive, with little reward.He insists that confirmation that in the Downpatrick area alone speeds have reduced by .% in the short time the devices have been in place vindicates their installation.ldquoWhile John and I are delighted to hear that speeds are reducing across the district, we are in no way complacent about this.ldquoThe fact that the PCSP is doubling the provision of speed indicator signs is not only an indication of their efficacy, but also highlights the continued need for them.However, Mr McGrath said he was concerned about the mph speed recorded at the Strangford Road and appealed to all drivers to ensure they stick to the speed limit.Cllr Trainor said plans were in place to provide an additional seven speed indicator devices across the district.He added: ldquoCombining this with infrastructure minister Nichola Mallonrsquos scheme for mph zones at  schools across the country can only help safety on our roads.ldquoConsidering the very low temperatures we have witnessed this weekend, this is another reminder that we all need to be conscious of our

forthcoming St Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick.The decision mdash confirmed on Monday mdash comes a week after a number of councillors urged the local authority to formally cancel the cross-community event due to the continuing coronavirus pandemic.Last yearrsquos cross-community spectacular was cancelled ahead of the first national lockdown to help combat the deadly virus and with infection rates remaining high across the district, the council has finally decided to cancel the event in the grip of the continuing public health emergency.The local authority, which last week would only confirm that it was ldquoreviewing plans for its St Patrickrsquos Day events in line with the current restrictions and ongoing response to the Covid pandemic, told councillors on Monday afternoon that the Downpatrick parade and one in Newry had been postponed, with the wider media informed yesterday.In the wake of other councils postponing their respective St Patrickrsquos Day parades, Newry, Mourne and Down was coming under increasing pressure to follow suit.The local parades have now been added to the growing list of national and international events across Northern Ireland which have been cancelled due to the pandemic, including the North West  motorcycle races.Belfast City Council has cancelled its St Patrickrsquos Day parade, with Derry City and Strabane and Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon councils currently discussing how their March  events will be celebrated.Local council officials have confirmed that following careful consideration of the current restrictions and the ongoing response to the Covid- pandemic, they have ldquoregretfully cancelled the traditional St Patrickrsquos Day celebrations.The organisation has confirmed that it will be hosting some activities and performances online via its tourism and arts social media channels.In addition, training green spotlights on a number of major buildings, including Down Cathedral and St Patrickrsquos Church in Downpatrick, is expected to go ahead as planned,restrictions allow.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said it was with ldquogreat regret that the annual St Patrickrsquos Day parades have been cancelled for the second year in a row.She said the March  events were normally an opportunity to celebrate the districtrsquos connection with St Patrick and the arearsquos important place in his the patron saintrsquos story.ldquoI know how disappointed many will be about this decision and I share their disappointment, said Cllr Devlin. ldquoHowever, the councilrsquos priority at this time is to continue to support the ongoing response to the Covid- pandemic across wider society.She said that the decision to cancel was made in the best interests of residents, visitors, festival participants and event partners.She also confirmed that the local authority will continue to review plans for this yearrsquos tourism events programme on an ongoing basis and in line with guidance from the Northern Ireland Executive.Councillors Willie Clarke, Dermot Curran, Billy Walker and Robert Burgess, who last week appealed to the local council to cancel the parade, welcomed the decision and said they were looking forward to the  event going ahead.They said the local authority had to act to avoid any needless delay, warning that there was no way any festival parade could take place in the current Covid climate.Cllr Clarke said people needed to know that the parade would not happen, highlighting the continuing importance of protecting peoplersquos health.Cllr Curran said the event could not possibly have proceeded, given the ongoing public health emergency.He said the Covid situation remained ldquoextremely serious and that news of the parade cancellation would not come as a surprise.Cllr Walker urged council officials not to wait until the ldquoeleventh hour to pull the plug on the parade and hoped that next yearrsquos event will be one of the best ever.Cllr Burgess said

Liltingwas called lsquojaw musicrsquo, or lsquopuss musicrsquo.Mummers played one of the worldrsquos oldest instruments, called the jawrsquos jewrsquos harp.Also called lsquothe trumprsquo, the miniature jawrsquos jewrsquos harp produced a twang sound, which changed by altering the shape of the mouth and moving the tongue.Another mouth instrument used by mummers was the harmonica, also called lsquothe mouth organrsquo or lsquoFrench fiddlersquo.Another impoverished instrument in early mumming was spoons, which were played as a makesht percussion instrument by hitting the concave backs of one tablespoon against the other.Typically played with the palm of hands repeatedly moving down towards the knees and back upwards again, the spoons sharply hit each other, producing dferent sounds, rhythms and rattles.Dry spare ribsof animals were used before the introduction of spoons produced a similar sound.In Ederney, the sole musician was a bagpiper lending a hand for the night.During the coldness of mid-Winter, keeping the bagpipes warm until the ldquomarching in tune would be ldquostruck up was remedied by the bagpiper carrying a hot water bottle next to the skin of the pipes.Once made from dogsrsquo skin, bodhrans notndash as a home-made, open-ended, willow-framed drum ndash emerged from a farm sieve used in winnowing corn, and were extremely popular amongst mummers.The bodhranrsquos deep, hollow sound was vulnerable to Winter weather, resulting in the goatskin or leather skin loosening.Latterly, snaredrums with synthetic skins and tightening snares replaced bodhrans, providing a thundering warning of mummers approaching.Mummers joined together to purchase a melodeon, thereby the name a ldquojoined melodeon.Commonly called lsquothe squeeze boxrsquo, music box, accordion or concertina, accordion players such Jim McGrathare called lsquobox playersrsquo.The Clarkesrsquo tin penny whistles and the music from the concert flute, by John Joe lsquoThe Puckrsquo Maguire, had the ear, hands and soul of his flute when playing for both the Aughakillymaude and Kinawley mummers.Over time, instruments became personal possessions of the musician, as was the case with the fiddle of legendary Sean Dan Maguire, who played more than  years with mummers, strawboys and wrenboys.Musicians often tried music out on the spot! They may have just heard a march tune just once or twice, but they would give it a go.Gaining consent, mummers lsquoploughedrsquo into the heart of the household with a lsquoMarching Inrsquo tune, with the next interlude for music being the performance of a jig to coincide with the start of comical combat.Protaganists ndash Prince Patrick and Prince George ndash instead of duelling, were lsquoseamlessly seducedrsquo by music from the reel, and turned the combat on its head by jostling in a dancing motion, with the absurd clashing of wooden swords keeping time with the music.With the fallen hero feigning death, the musician instinctively began a slow, melodic airconducive to his impending death.Its purpose was to impinge sadness and, of necessity, was always a slow air born of mourning or regret.The musiciansrsquo opening for celebratory music came immediately post the odious fight, when dancers amongst the mummers would instinctively dance by the rendition of a reel with a lsquogood ltrsquo in it!Playing at a brisk, dance tempo, the dancers would rely on both keeping the time and in step with the rhythmic effect of the music for their foot movements.Inspired by musicians who understood the dance styles, dancers would whirl the floor with precision and elegance.Dancing in front of the hearth was revered by dancers, especially when it was customary to lsquopull outrsquo, firstly, the women of the household for social interaction.If neither residents nor mummers had dancing skills, mummers resorted to lsquoshufflingrsquo, often with cut sparable boots, armoured with tip and toe plates, i.e. a form of dancing on one spot, with feet kept close to the ground.Mummers disported themselves by entertaining and involving everyone by getting their neighbours out dancing.By having a set of slow waltz tunes, lasting longer than the play itself, this would wind up the visit.The Belcoo mummers were unquestionably the traditional set dancers of high renown.Staging either a half setor a full set , they danced with artistic interlacing and unwinding movements at very brisk speeds, to high-tempo reels.Having just one good dancer, the musician would likely play a hornpipe to allow for a display of heavy step dancing, with either Harvey leather shoes or even hobnailed boots.Mummers were known to throw matches onto concrete floors, where friction from the nails on boots struck the matches alight.Mummers also put wax shaving of candles onto floor to ease and increase their whirling.Sean-noacutes dancing was the showpiece of the Toura mummers, and twin brothers, Johnny and Paddy McGee, were foremost at exhibiting face dancing, such as the clap dance.Sean-noacutes dances, such as the half-door dance, was performed either singularly or by the twin brothers on a space or floor covering no more than the size of a half door.Undoubtedly, there was no better man at demonstrating the brush broom dance with a besom broom than Dessie Reilly of Aughakillymaude.Ballyshannon school mummersrsquo group dance was the unique ldquopot stick dance, originally from the Drumbad area , which has the remnants of English Morris Dance influence.The Ederney mummers showcased the Square Highland, involving four men at close quarters, as it didnrsquot take up much space in households, and didnrsquot involve swinging.As a Highland was a fling, it lent to being performed quickly, enabling mummers to depart sooner.The Fermanagh or Donegal Highlands iations were danced by just two dancers, and are heavily weighted with Scottish connotations.The Highlands flings are referred to by Fermanaghrsquos dancers as lsquothe Schottischersquo, or lsquoCetishrsquo.With larger venues, musicians playing North Kerry polkas and Fermanagh kick polka with two dancers ndash which allowed for swinging ndash had the musicians even imitating the dancersrsquo movements.Notably, the jig for Christmas called lsquoPaddyrsquos Returnrsquo was played marking the ing of ex-pats from England.After music, drama and dancing, a singer would sing a ballad of local signicance, or a light-hearted yarn on people grappling with the frailties of the human body, matters of the heart, and lersquos trials and tribulations.Attention was also afforded to the storytelling narrative of mummers, where the farcical spinning out of a yarn brought much laughter.Marking the end, a two-hand reel was played as the Captain led mummers outside, but unbeknownst and hidden underneath their lsquoget-uprsquo, mummers secretly had taken bread for pure devilment.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

What Mr McCausland identied was a work of “conversion” — the work of God by His Holy Spirit,— whereby Mr Cook underwent, in his own words “a road to Damascus moment”. This had nothing whatever to do with “gay conversion therapy” as quoted by those opposed to the post. It was quite simply, and quite wonderfully, the conversion of a sinner, by the grace of God.    \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Godwas not concerned with whether Mr. Cook was gay or not. The Bible does not distinguish people by their lestyle, but rather by the fact that “All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God “ .God saved a sinner when He saved Mr Cook. His hitherto gay lestyle was inconsequential at that moment in time. Those who defend the LGBTQ rights are too sensitive, to the degree that they see every mention of God and gay people as homophobic, as criticism, as a danger! They need an understanding of God, and His Word, and His work of salvation. This event in this man’s le had nothing to do with anyone attempting to “convert” him from his lestyle. Mr Cook attended a church meeting and, it seems clearly obvious, he underwent conviction of sin, the work of God’s Holy Spirit,and was converted. There should be rejoicing that a lost sheep has been found. Instead we hear calls for Nelson McCausland to “resign”, that he should be “ashamed of himself”, that he is “advocating for ‘so called gay conversion therapy’”.There is no such thing as ‘gay conversion therapy’. The only One Who can convert the sinneris God. So let’s not get carried away here! Social media is replete with stories of conversion of sinners. It would be good to hear the same critics of McCausland Cook rejoicing over other stories of conversion on social media, instead of jumping on the one most likely to allow them to inflame passions over perceived wrongs. Was Nelson McCausland careless in all his comments  Perhaps his words weren’t best chosen. But let’s not lose the real story here. A story of God’s grace at work. Would that it were repeated over and over again, in this by-and-large Godless society we live in.Gordon McNeill, PortadownPetition begun to unseat DUP’s Nelson McCausland over ‘gay conversion therapy’ post——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIN our bridge improvers sessions, we are continuing to deal with opening two bids, playing Benjy Acol.Here is a hand with a big point count that requires careful bidding to reach the right contract.The AuctionNorth has a hand with twenty-three points. So, playing Benjy Acol, North opens two diamonds. This shows at least nine tricks in hand or a balanced twenty-three points plus. It is forcing to game. Her partner, South, with only four points bids two hearts, which asks North, her partner, to show what she has. With a balanced hand North bids two no trumps. South now knows that between them they have more than the magic twenty-five points required to play three no trumps.But hold on a minute, whatNorth has five hearts  Four hearts would then surely be a better contract than three no trumps. So, as with last weekrsquos hand, the correct bid by South is now three clubs - five card puppet Stayman - asking Northshe has a four or five card major. North bids three hearts, showing her five-card heart suit. South now bids four hearts, as she knows that they have eight hearts and at least twenty-seven points between them. This is indeed the best contract, as three no trumps makes, but not so many tricks on a spade lead.The playEast begins with the queen of spades. North as declarer looks carefully at the hand before winning this trick with the king in dummy. She realises that this was the only way to dummy to be able to take the heart finesse. Remember - eight ever nine never is the rule. In other words, with eight cards between you in a suit the percentage play is to take the finesse. But with nine cards between you, the percentage play is usually to play the ace and then the king to try and drop the queen. So, declarer at trick two plays the two of hearts from dummy, playing the jack from her hand to execute the finesse.This wins, as West has the queen. North then plays the ace of hearts followed by the king, removing all the opponentsrsquo trumps. The odds for a   break are good, % in fact. Declarer then plays the king of diamonds from her hand. West holds up his ace of diamonds for two rounds, until declarer has played the king and queen, overtaking the third diamond with his ace. West does this in case declarer has a losing club, which could be discarded on dummyrsquos jack of diamonds.East has played first the three and then the five of diamonds, indicating he has three cards in that suit. We will see next week how he would have played his diamondshe had four cards in this suit, using what is known as a Peter. West then plays his ace of clubs, and it is all over, North winning the rest of tricks with the ace of spades, the remaining trumps, and the king and queen of clubs. So, she makes her contract of four spades with an overtrick,  tricks in all ndash two spades, five hearts, two diamonds and two clubs.Well bid and well played. Without the use of puppet Stayman North would probably play in three no trumps. On the lead of the queen of spades this only makes nine tricks - two spades, five hearts and two diamonds. Declarer takes the heart finesse and plays all her hearts. Then, she plays the king and queen of diamonds, West winning the third diamond with his ace, having refused to take the king or queen. West would thenthe ten of spades, which would be won by declarerrsquos ace. But when she plays the king of clubs, West pounces with his ace and plays the nine of spades, which wins, followed by Westrsquos last spade won by Eastrsquos queen, East West making four tricks ndash two spades and two aces, East having to discard one of his spades on the preceding tricks.What have we learnt . As we saw last week, five card Puppet Stayman, after the opening bidder has shown a strong two no trumps, is vitalyou are to find either a   of   fit in one of the majors. lsquoPuppetrsquo has sunk into bridge jargon over the past forty-five years. The convention was originally invented by Neil Silverman and developed in the s by Kit Woolsey and Steve Robinson, all American players. As well as finding a   fit in a major, -card puppet Stayman has the advantage that,there is a   fit, the person with the strong hand plays the contract, and the lead comes up to him.. Always take care to take the first trick in the right handyou want to take a finesse.. Sometimes it is advisable to hold up an ace, particularly in no trumps, to block your opponents from entering the hand with winners in it.Penarth club newsPeter Sampsonrsquos ladder competition continues.

And itrsquos been quite nice to feel a bit more relaxed because itrsquos an open environment.As soon as the staff are aware of the amount of stock that they will be getting from the health board, they can organise the clinics.ldquoWe have to factor in the spacing, itrsquos a new vaccine so people might have questions which we are always happy to answer.ldquoSo far itrsquos going pretty well. We are quite ahead of the game.ldquoIrsquom quite pleased with the surgeryrsquos managing with the vaccines.

He leaves a huge gap but his enormous contribution, enthusiasm and positivity will not be forgotten.Des was born in Drogheda in the Republic of Ireland but, whilst still very young, moved to NI where he grew up and was educated. He attended Portadown College before moving to Queen’s University Belfast in  to study German. He graduated with a First Class Honours Degree four years later, which included a year in Freiburg im Breisgau, a city where he made many le-long friends.Des’ first teaching job was back at his alma mater, Portadown College, where he taught German and French between  and . Keen to satisfy his thirst for travel, widen his knowledge of other cultures and experience teaching in other countries, he moved to Uganda in  where he taught French and German at the Aga Khan Secondary School, Kampala for two years. \"Des Johnston in his younger years.Des then ed to County Armagh where he was appointed Head of Modern Languages, again at Portadown College. It was during this time that I had the good fortune and privilege to be one of Des’ pupils. Des was ahead of his time. He recognised the importance of integrating language and culture.In spite of the passage of  years, I remember very clearly the lesson where he set up the screen and projector, cutting edge technology in the s, and showed us slides of his tour on a scooter through France, Luxembourg and Germany. As a class of  year olds, we were transfixed. Des was an example of Dali’s “true artist”, as two years later Keith, George and I packed our rucksacks and followed Des’ tracks, not on a scooter but by train. Des’ inspiration did not stop there as I was to follow his path to a degree in languages at Queen’s, a PGCE and a career in teaching. I was certainly not the first or the last of Des’ pupils to do this. It is striking that Des’ son, Philip, also followed in his dad’s footsteps, working in Germany for three years, studying in the Czech Republic and qualying as a German interpreter – without doubt a chip off the old block. Des knew how to manage a class. He had presence he got lessons off to a fun start he always progressed from what we knew, gave us confidence and self-belief and made us curious to learn more. Lessons were fun. Time flew by. We felt that we were achieving. Motivation was not an issue. He got the very best from each of us. Des was a master of the art of teaching.In  Des’ itchy feet took him to Luxembourg where he spent two years working as a translator for the European Commission. During this time he also won two caps for the national rugby team of Grand Duchy.Keen to pass on his pedagogical skills and knowledge and to champion modern languages teaching and learning, he joined Her Majesty’s Inspectorate, Department of Education, Northern Ireland in . We all feel apprehensive about the visit of the inspector. Des was not to be feared, however. His focus was always on the supportive and the formative. His aim was always to help and guide and build the confidence of those he visited. Des’ distinguished career did not end when he retired in  but rather took a gentle turn. He continued to teach with the University of the Third Age and at Millburn Primary School where he taught English and English as a Foreign Language to Polish children, a role in which he found particular enjoyment and fulfilment.Des was born to teach and so very many of us, across the world, have benefited from his skill, encouragement and warmth. Teaching was not his only passion, however. I have already mentioned his rugby caps for Luxembourg. He also excelled at the shot put in athletics and played badminton and table-tennis. He loved music, good food and reading. Des could talk convincingly and engagingly on a very wide range of subjects. He was knowledgeable, interested and interesting. He was a wonderfully entertaining raconteur, the perfect dinner guest.I feel very honoured to have been able to stay in contact with Des from the time I left Portadown College until a month before he sadly died. He and I always thought it an amazing but lovely coincidence that, in the small world that is language teaching, the boy who was to become his future son-in-law, Chris, was one of my pupils in the school in the north-east of England where I first taught.I was not the only former pupil to enjoy his wisdom, guidance, mentoring, support and friendship for many years after leaving school. I was one of a large number across continents. Des was always generous in investing time in people. He cared. This is why he was so respected and much loved by so many.Des is survived by his we, Irene, and his children Tanya and Philip.Des Johnston -PSNI investigation after girl found dead in NI flats Read the full story hereEditor’s Message:Thank you for reading this article.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

The latest figures show a total of , first doses and , second doses – bringing the overall number of vaccines administered to , Today’s figures provide a further indication of important progress in the roll-out of vaccines to combat the virus. In addition: * Mobile vaccination teams have administered first doses in all of Northern Ireland’s care homes - and second doses to over % of the homes. * We have vaccinated % of the  year olds and over, and have started to vaccinate  –  year olds through the GP programme. * Online booking was opened on Wednesday night for - year-olds to book their vaccination appointments in one of NI’s seven regional vaccination centres. In the first  hours of the online portal, , people had booked their vaccination jabs. Intensive work has been undertaken to address teething problems with the online system, linked to high levels of demand. * A further signicant consignment of the Astra Zeneca vaccine is due in NI next week, for immediate distribution to GPs. This will help facilitate a rapid acceleration of vaccinations for those over  and patients who are Clinical Extremely Vulnerableto Covid-. * In another important development on the vaccine front, a large-scale UK trial for a new coronavirus vaccine indicates it to be .% effective against the virus. The Novavax vaccine is expected to be available across the UK in the second half of this year,approved for use by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency  People in Northern Ireland have played a key role in the development of Novavax. Nearly  participants were recruited from Northern Ireland for the trial which was led locally by researchers from Queen’s University Belfast and the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. Health Minister Robin Swann said: “I want to thank everyone working on the vaccination programme right across Northern Ireland. “This is a massive logistical exercise and I am very encouraged by the strong start we have made. It should be remembered that the first Covid- vaccine approval was only announced last month, with the second approval coming some four weeks later. We have made great strides forward since then. “There will inevitably be frustrations along the way. We will get to everyone - we are getting to thousands more each day.” Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride thanked everyone involved in the Novavax trial. He said: “The rapid development of Covid- vaccines is our long-term route map out of this pandemic. We should be rightly proud that Northern Ireland continues to play its part in the historic global effort to develop new drug treatments and vaccines. Throughout our response we have all come together in support of each other. We continue to see the benefits of the partnership between academia, health and industry and this another example.” The Department of Health this week announced a twin track approach to accelerating NI’s vaccination programme - ensuring more people can take up the offer of vaccination and help protect themselves against Covid-. GPs will be focusing on the  plus age group with the Astra Zeneca vaccine, while the seven regional vaccination centres will in parallel be offeringPfizer vaccination appointments to - year-olds. The plans are to offer everyone over  in NI a vaccine by the end of February. People who are Clinical Extremely Vulnerableto Covid- are also a priority for February. GPs will be vaccinating a large proportion of CEV patients. The twin track approach will see the Trust vaccination centres offering vaccines to CEV patients who are frequent hospital attenders.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eecddababefe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_afeadbb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1612024107217.jpg--covid_19___sat_30th_jan_figures.jpg?161202410700","title":"covid  sat th jan figures ","story":" The NI Department of Health dashboard shows a further  coronavirus related deaths and  new positive cases.  deaths occurred outside of the current reporting period.
