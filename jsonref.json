The owners of those projects were not immediately clear.  A spokesperson for Imperial did not immediately respond to an inquiry from DailyMail.com on Tuesday.Officially, the Scheherazade\u0027s registered owner is Bielor Assets Ltd, a company registered in the Marshall Islands, and the boat is flagged in the Cayman Islands.The ship\u0027s name, Scheherazade, is the female protagonist from the Middle Eastern collection of tales known as the One Thousand and One Nights. It is also the title of a symphonic suite by Russian composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov that is based on the tales.Speculation about a connection between the vessel and Putin has run rampant in Marina di Carrara since the boat first docked there last winter, a source said.The person said that workers at the shipyard believed the initial owner was Middle Eastern, but that at some point the boat was sold to Putin or another wealthy Russian.The SuperYachtFan site has also speculated that the owner of the boat could be a Middle Eastern billionaire. Officially, Putin has a declared net worth of about $150,000 and very few assets. But the Russian leader\u0027s true wealth, thought by some to be as much as $100 billion, though it has never been confirmed.  Forbes recently called it \u0027the most elusive riddle in wealth hunting.\u0027 Nevertheless, Putin\u0027s fondness for luxury yachts is well established. He has previously been photographed on yachts from the Black Sea in the south the Russia\u0027s northern regions.Last May, he took a yacht cruise with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko near the Black Sea resort of Sochi.   A 459-Foot Mystery in a Tuscan Port: Is It a Russian¿s Superyacht? - The New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"The Power Dog director says wanted movie fetishized interview","story":"Share this articleBenedict Cumberbatch responds to The Power of the Dog criticismJane Campion on The Power of the Dog: ‘Too much leather and ropes and chaps?

The current overflight and landing ban on Russian aircraft is also being strengthened, making it a criminal offence for any to fly or land in the United Kingdom. The UK will also ban exports of aviation or space-related goods and technology to Russia, including technical assistance. UK companies will also be banned from related providing insurance and re-insurance services. That means cover is withdrawn on existing policies and UK insurers and reinsurers will be unable to pay claims in respect of existing policies in these sectors, the Foreign Office says. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the new measures will further tighten the growing economic pressure on Russia: Russia is on the brink of defaulting on its debts, rating agency Fitch has warned, as the sanctions imposed since the Ukraine war batter its economy. Fitch has downgraded Russia’s sovereign debt to its second lowest level, down six notches to C. That’s just one step above borrowers who have defaulted. Fitch said that developments since it last downgraded Russia on March 2nd had further undermined the country’s willingness to service government debt. It points to President Vladimir Putin’s decree last week that Russian creditors can use roubles to pay some foreign currency debts, and the country’s central bank’s restriction of some rouble-denominated debt coupon transfers. The intensifying sanctions could also lead Moscow to default on its obligations, Fitch says: The statement comes after the US and UK said they will ban Russian oil, as the economic response to the invasion of Ukraine continued to ratchet up. Russia is due to make its next debt repayment on March 16 -- though it would have a 30-day grace period to meet the coupon payments. Western sanctions, including a ban on Russia’s central bank from accessing foreign currency reserves, have preventing Putin from accessing much of the $630bn war chest built up in foreign currencies before the invasion. Yesterday, a flurry of major Western countries suspended business in Russia, with Starbucks, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and McDonald’s joining the pullout following the Ukraine war.

There are fewer mature applicants compared to 2021. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw Arts, environment and language courses have recorded sharp increases in first-preference college applications this year.By contrast, nursing and many health-related courses show some of the steepest decreases. Popular fields of study such as business, law and science are also down slightly this year. Overall, latest Central Applications Offices (CAO) figures as of March 1st show there are 78,000 college applications this year, a 1.5 per cent decline on last year.There are fewer mature applicants compared to 2021 (-25 per cent), though this has been partly offset by an increase in EU (+16 per cent) and British application (+9 per cent).CAO points overall are likely to remain at about last year’s record-high levels due to a pledge by Minister for Education Norma Foley that Leaving Cert grades will be no lower than last year.There is particularly strong interest in environment-related courses which have one of the biggest increases in first-preferences this year (+35 per cent).Climate and sustainabilityUniversities say this is reflected in a jump in applications for courses linked to climate change and sustainability.UCD, for example, says applications to its interdisciplinary degree in sustainability are up 43 per cent, while city planning and environmental policy is up 44 per cent.Other areas nationally where there are significant increases in applications include languages (+17 per cent), architecture and construction (both up 6 per cent).Arts (+6 per cent) and humanities (+4 per cent) are also up for the second year in a row, reversing a trend of declining applications over recent years.In addition, interdisciplinary courses involving arts and humanities are up sharply (+59 per cent).The rebound of arts across inidual universities is striking. Maynooth University, for example, said its popular arts degree – which has the highest number of first-preference applications of any CAO course – is up by 11 per cent this year.There is a similar pattern at Trinity College Dublin where there is high demand for arts and humanities courses such as English studies (+21 per cent), European studies (+23 per cent) and philosophy (+54 per cent). UCD also said its humanities course (+29 per cent) was up significantly.Mid-wifery downSome of the biggest decreases are in the health sector, such as nursing and midwifery which is down 27 per cent on last year.In the wider area of health (-13 per cent), there is an uneven pattern with physiotherapy (-9 per cent) and pharmacy down (-7 per cent), while medicine is up (+4 per cent).Agriculture is also down sharply (-19 per cent), as are smaller sectors such as transport (-50 per cent ) and hygiene and occupational health services (-41 per cent).Business and administration remains one of the most popular fields of study, but is down slightly on last year (-3 per cent).The so-called Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) area is a mixed bag this year.Social and behavioural science is down (-6 per cent) along with biological and related science (-2 per cent), while physical science is up (+5 per cent). ICT is continuing its upward trend (+6 per cent) this year, while engineering remains unchanged.The latest data is subject to change when late applications are taken into account when the CAO’s change of mind facility closes on July 1st.

Photograph: Eric Luke The North’s obsession with its sectarian schism has plunged it into the “dark ages” in looking after its soaring minority ethnic population, a damning report by a Westminster watchdog has found.Despite a more than doubling of ethnic minorities in the region between 2001 and 2011 – the figures from a decade ago being the latest available – not a single elected representative in the Stormont Assembly is from an ethnic minority background, the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee said.Hong Kong-born Anna Lo, an MLA for the centrist Alliance party for nine years, quit politics in 2016, because of racist abuse by loyalists and her disillusionment with continuing sectarianism.At the time of standing down, she said: “I do not feel safe here and I know many people who feel the same.”Three years later, according to latest official figures from 2019, only one of the North’s 462 local area councillors was from a recorded minority ethnic background.Neither the police nor the civil service fare well when it comes to ersity, according to the committee’s report – The Experiences of Minority Ethnic and Migrant People in Northern Ireland.During a series of witness testimonies as part of its inquiry, Andy George, president of the UK’s National Black Police Association, told the committee that minority ethnic officers made up just 0.5 per cent of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).The Northern Ireland Civil Service also admitted it had some way to go to remedy its shortcomings.Public appointmentsFigures from 20172018 – again the most recent published by Stormont’s power-sharing Executive office – show just 24 out of 942 public appointment applications were from minority ethnic people.Of the 183 people appointed to the civil service over the same period, “less than five” were minority ethnic applicants.According to the last census in 2011, 32,000 people living in the North were from a minority ethnic background. However this figure – 1.8 per cent of the population – is “widely expected” to show a significant increase in upcoming data.Despite this, there has been “no obvious policy preparedness to deal with this demographic change”, the report states.The minority population rise is expected to be bolstered by the resettlement in the region of thousands of refugees fleeing war and persecution in Syria and Afghanistan. The ongoing invasion of Ukraine will “almost certainly” add to the numbers.More than 1,800 Syrians have moved to the North since 2015.The report noted, after an almost year-long inquiry, that the number of racially motivated hate crimes in the North has superseded reported sectarian incidents.In the year to September 2021, 41 per cent of all hate-motivated crimes alerted to the PSNI were racist, compared to 38 per cent which were sectarian.The figure was all the more stark “when considered in relation to the small proportion of the population from minority ethnic backgrounds”, the watchdog warned.The PSNI told the inquiry there was “strong evidence to suggest that many other incidents go unreported to the police, meaning the true position of hate within society can be difficult to articulate”.The North’s Jewish community told the committee during its visit to the region about rising reports of anti-Semitic and Jewish-related hate incidents and crimes in Belfast, including anti-Semitic remarks made by public figures.“We also heard during that visit of an increase in incidents of verbal abuse in the street towards the Chinese community since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as experiences of attacks on and abuse towards members of the Polish community, linked to the EU referendum,” the report states.Anti-discrimination and hate crime laws in the North are “probably the worst on the books for the UK at the moment”, Kendall Bousquet, of Migrant Centre NI, told the inquiry.There was also evidence of “stark inequalities” in health, education and housing suffered by Irish Traveller communities in the North, with just 1 per cent of the community living to the age of 65, according to the latest decade-old figures.Geraldine McGahey, Northern Ireland Equality Commissioner, said the absence of any form of ethnic monitoring and only out-of-date data meant ersity policies were all “flawed”, leaving the region in “in the dark ages”.The Westminster committee – which includes MPs from the DUP, Alliance and the SDLP as well as Britain’s Labour and Conservative parties – has demanded the North’s Executive respond to its findings.Tory MP Simon Hoare, committee chairman, said the preoccupation with “GreenOrange discourse” has led to other and increasingly populated communities being “overlooked”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"over one third of north s population hold irish passport","story":"Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, was due to pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the UK withdrew from the EU.  More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics europe s turning point","story":"Russia\u0027s invasion of Ukraine has brought about enormous changes in European policy in an incredibly short space of time.

The crisis in Ukraine has exposed the flaws, mistakes and downright complacency that has been evident for years to everyone except politicians desperate to burnish their green credentials whatever the cost.The so-called “net zero” commitment was the last act of Theresa May before she stepped down as prime minister in July 2019 but has been enthusiastically endorsed by her successor in a series of speeches and announcements. Until now, that is. Boris Johnson says there needs to be a new supply strategy in response to the energy crunch caused by Russia’s invasion, and he wants a temporary “climate change pass” to help manage the difficulties it has caused.Apparently this does not entail changing the 2050 target but rather ramping up oil and gas production in Europe so that countries such as Germany and Italy are less dependent on Russian supplies.He vouchsafed his new approach in an interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica and the German publication Die Welt last week. “We need a collective European strategy and a Western strategy to ersify away from this dependence,” Johnson reportedly said. “There are other sources ... in North America, in Canada, in the Gulf.”And in the UK, he might have added, but didn’t. Here, in a nutshell, was Britain’s green policy: we can make commitments to decarbonise our own energy supplies while importing the same products from other countries.It is the antithesis of energy security: a reliance on others to provide fuel for industry, heating and motoring while ignoring the available resources under our own feet. It is telling that on his list of alternatives is the Gulf, hardly the most stable of regions. Britain relies on liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar to supplement pipeline supplies from Norway and the EU. This market-based import strategy follows the deliberate run-down of our own reserves, even though gas accounts for 40 per cent of UK electricity generation and heats the majority of homes. It assumes unimpeded supply while anticipating price volatility caused by circumstances. So the recent spike in prices was caused not by Russia but by the recovery of the world economy after the “unforeseen” Covid pandemic. This has now been exacerbated by fears of an embargo on Russian gas and oil which has seen market prices soar to unprecedented levels, even though European leaders are determined to resist emulating the import ban announced by President Biden last night.It is all well and good relying on LNG from Qatar, but if there were tensions in the Gulf between Israel and Iran over nuclear weapons, Tehran could block the Straits of Hormuz, stopping supplies of LNG.Anyone who says this is an unlikely scenario was presumably offering assurances to all who would listen that Russian would never invade Ukraine. The point is that you never know what might happen, which is why we need to secure our own supplies as much as possible.Yet it is instructive to look back at the debates in the Commons on the legislation to impose carbon reduction targets. You will find precious little discussion about the likely impact on price or supply. The 2008 Climate Change Act was opposed by precisely five Conservative MPs, denounced as “flat-earthers”, even by their own side, for deigning to ask whether the strategy was sensible.It committed the UK to reduce emissions by 80 per cent of 1990 levels by 2050, which was increased from a previous target of 60 per cent with hardly any debate. All that seemed to matter was that Britain was the “first country” in the world to adopt such a target, that this was a “landmark” moment and a “unique” measure. Its ramifications were simply trampled under a stampede of virtue signallers.The target was increased to 100 per cent by the Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 Target Amendment) Order 2019, a statutory instrument that went through the Commons after a 90-minute debate. This is how matters of great strategic import are handled in this country – and not only here, it must be said. If you think our policy is bad, just look at Germany’s, where the madcap decision to dismantle its entire nuclear power programme is now being reversed.Mr Johnson’s new supply strategy, to be published “in days”, will give the go-ahead to North Sea oil and gas fields that have been awaiting approval but will only now get it because foreseeable events have come to pass. This strategy should also remove the moratorium on shale gas extraction, or fracking, but almost certainly won’t, denying the country an energy source that Mr Johnson himself once saw as our salvation.It should include a feasibility study of thorium-based nuclear reactors, using a fuel which is cleaner, cheaper and safer than uranium but which has always been blocked on cost grounds.It should include proper storage facilities: the decision to close the Rough facility in the North Sea and rely on contracted deliveries or the spot market was a massive mistake. It should include a re-examination of tidal barrage power dismissed in the past as too expensive but which looks cheap compared with the likely long-term costs of oil and gas.Tides in the UK are higher than almost anywhere in the world and can be harnessed every day under any conditions, unlike solar or wind power. The sea will rise and fall with metronomic precision twice a day until the Earth stops spinning and the Moon drops out of the sky.As an example of procrastination, the approach to tidal power takes some beating. The Severn Barrage, an engineering project to harness the tidal energy of Britain’s longest river and produce enough electricity to power all of Wales, was originally proposed in 1925, only to be shelved because, at £25 million, it was considered too expensive.In 1971, it was estimated that a barrage could be built at a cost £500  million. But since North Sea oil and gas was coming on stream there was no incentive to invest in tidal power. Various proposals have been put forward recently, both on the Severn and in Swansea Bay, but the cost is estimated in the billions of pounds and is opposed on environmental grounds.

To be clear, Russia is not likely to win this war. It probably won’t be able to capture Kyiv, and any city it does gain will not be held onto for long. This is not political hope-talk but my professional assessment as the former commanding general of US Army Europe.Russia’s key problem is logistics. Look, for instance, at the infamous convoy that has now stalled north of Kyiv. It is a commander’s nightmare, forcing troops to consume the supplies they were meant to carry forward. No military planner would purposely allow such a large group of personnel to sit road-bound on a single highway, surrounded by agricultural land too soft to allow vehicles to ert.While Ukraine may not have the air capabilities to destroy all of these vehicles, it can take bites out of the convoy. Indeed this is already happening.Russia’s logistics capability may only have been readied for a lightning campaign, in anticipation that Kyiv would be captured in a matter of days rather than weeks or months. That, of course, has not happened – and the more that flawed assumption is disproven, the more sluggish the entire operation will become. The further into Ukraine Russian oil tanks move, the more exposed they are to attack.Russia will soon struggle to deliver basic food and petrol supplies to the front, leaving soldiers hungry and immobile.Such failures have given President Zelensky the opportunity to galvanise his population and the Ukrainian armed forces. They are now capable not just of holding ground but pushing back too, as they did in Kharkiv last week. Russia will have to fight a war of attrition to avoid outright defeat, bombing roads and flats as well as military infrastructure. Even then, Moscow could quickly run out of the kinds of ammunition required to sustain it at an intense level.President Putin might well be asking how, after all the rhetoric about modernising his forces, it has come to this. The truth is that there appears to be a lack of high-intensity experience. Apart from Syria – which is an air operation, with air bases serving as simple logistics hubs – Russia has not been able to test its new systems over terrain as large as Ukraine. Interventions in Chechnya and Georgia did not pose the same challenge of sheer land mass.The West should respond to this weakness with strength. We can help push the Ukrainians over the line. A no-fly zone, which I originally supported, would not solve the problem, since most of the damage being done is by artillery and rocket fire based on the ground.Something we can do immediately is provide Ukraine with the capability to knock out these rocket launchers and missile sites. Counterfire radars, for instance, not only provide an early warning of attack but also identify the point of origin so that it can be rapidly targeted. Ukrainian forces already know how to deploy these systems to great effect. Give them more.We could also train Ukrainian special forces to go after the launch sites in the same manner US special forces went after scud missile sites during Desert Storm and the Iraq war. This would mean providing intelligence, specialised weaponry and laser designators.Ultimately, this campaign will end with information operations. We have seen how effective the Ukrainian government has been with its social media efforts, jolting the world to its cause and discrediting Putin’s claims domestically. Western institutions should back this up with a campaign targeted at the Russian army’s spring conscription period. Tens of thousands of Russian families are being asked to step forward.If we can reach these families with the realities of the war, showing that their teenage sons are being used as cannon fodder, perhaps they will pressure the Kremlin to stop killing fellow Slavs.Lieutenant General (Retired) Ben Hodges holds the Pershing Chair in Strategic Studies at the Center for European Policy AnalysisMore from NewsAs Poles welcome Ukrainians into their homes, Britain must ditch its complacent attitude to refugeesRussia-Ukraine latest news: Four British soldiers may have gone to fight for UkrainePolitics latest news: Zelensky wants refugees to stay near Ukraine instead of Britain, insists ministerErnest Shackleton\u0026#39s Endurance: world\u0026#39s best preserved wooden ship found 107 years after it sankFive reasons to suggest \u0026#39puffy-faced\u0026#39 Putin could be seriously illThe charities taking donations to help Ukraine refugees and those on the front lineMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"thousands pupils left school lockdowns never came back","story":"Lockdown has led pupils to leave school and not return, the Children’s Commissioner has said as she admitted “tens of thousands” are missing from education.On Wednesday, Dame Rachel de Souza published an audit of local authorities (LAs) revealing a “striking” lack of accurate and up-to-date data on the numbers of children in each area.The report argues that this means vulnerable pupils could fall through the cracks and miss out on crucial support.“While the majority of children are attending every day, there are tens of thousands of children who are persistently or severely absent or missing from education altogether,” Dame Rachel said.She added that there were “some children who haven’t come back after the lockdowns, and not just because of having to isolate due to Covid”.Dame Rachel said that, even prior to the pandemic, there were children who were “falling through the gaps in education” if they were waiting for a school place, were being home educated because their needs were not being met in school, or who had simply “fallen off the radar”.She said she had surveyed all local authorities, which revealed the “striking” finding that LAs “do not have an accurate figure of how many children there are in England – let alone the number of children not receiving education”.Out of 145 LAs surveyed, making up 96 per cent of the total, just 39 per cent could provide an estimate on the number of children who missed at least a week of school waiting for a school placement, while fewer than one in five (18 per cent) could estimate the number of children attending private schools.Only eight per cent could give an estimate of the number of children in home education who were not registered with the LA.All LAs that responded did provide an estimate of the number of children who were electively home educated, but these estimates ranged from 0 per cent to 2.4 per cent.In total, 92 per cent were able to provide an estimate of the number of children missing from education but these estimates ranged from 0 per cent to 4.1 per cent.Around half of all LAs could provide an estimate of persistent and severe absence last term, with figures suggesting that 22 per cent of pupils were persistently absent while 1.5 per cent were severely absent.“These estimates suggest 1,782,000 children were persistently absent and 124,000 children were severely absent,” the report said.More from NewsAs Poles welcome Ukrainians into their homes, Britain must ditch its complacent attitude to refugeesRussia-Ukraine latest news: Four British soldiers may have gone to fight for UkrainePolitics latest news: Zelensky wants refugees to stay near Ukraine instead of Britain, insists ministerErnest Shackleton\u0026#39s Endurance: world\u0026#39s best preserved wooden ship found 107 years after it sankFive reasons to suggest \u0026#39puffy-faced\u0026#39 Putin could be seriously illThe charities taking donations to help Ukraine refugees and those on the front lineMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"6 ways russian oligarchs can","story":" ways Russian oligarchs can get away with it with loopholes in new crackdownResponding to the Ukraine-Russia war, ministers have pledged to toughen up UK sanctions and pushed through the Economic Crime Bill - but critics warn it is rushed, full of holes and has a “get-out-of-London-free” cardBoris Johnson rushed through tougher laws in response to the Ukraine-Russia law - but are they tough enough  Image: Anadolu Agency via Getty ImagesByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Mar |commentsMPs last night backed a new law to crack down on ‘dirty money’ that sloshes into UK mansions, jets and yachts.The Economic Crime Bill was rushed through the Commons in a bid to achieve Royal Assent after the weekend.The government claims it will finally allow “hundreds” of Russian oligarchs to be sanctioned in line with the EU and UK - as soon as next Tuesday. It will also bring in a long-awaited ‘register of beneficial ownership’ to better show the chains of who really owns vast assets through shadowy firms.Home Secretary Priti Patel insisted the Bill would set a new global standard for transparency.But critics warn loopholes will give Vladimir Putinaposs cronies a head start and “get-out-of-London-free” card - with time to hide their dirty money”.  Cross-party rebels were racing tonight to toughen up the Economic Crime Bill in the Lords with a flurry of amendments tomorrow. One furious MP told the Mirror: “There’s the danger that by rushing it through, you botch something that would have been a good tool.” Another pointed out it doesn’t actually do much on sanctions, it’s all about transparency - and MPs are trying to “dress it up as something it’s not”. So what are the six biggest hitches in the law  We go through them here.  Six-month grace period for declaring assets The Bill will introduce a “public register of beneficial owners of overseas entities owning land in the UK, which will be held by Companies House”. This is after years of complaints that dirty money is plunged into London property through shadowy offshore property. There are still several concerns about this - more on this below. But a principle one was the time period for declaring your assets. It was going to be  months and Tory ministers cut it to six months.But the government refused to accept Labour ’s plans for a -day grace period to declare assets in the UK.Labour’s Seema Malhotra warned: “Six months still provides ample time for criminals to sell properties and find other assets in which to invest.” Ministers did promise to name oligarchs who sell up during the transition. Business minister Paul Scully: “They will have to register ownership, so we will get their ownership details either when they sell or at the end of the transition period.”  Could assets still just be declared via an offshore company Tory MP Anthony Mangnall questioned whether the register of beneficial ownership, as drawn up, will let oligarchs “get away with it”. He wanted ministers to address the issue of nominees - lawyers often in a Panama or Virgin Islands company who are supposedly the owner. He said: “Do the enforcement mechanism and the reference to named iniduals enable us to stop them doing that ”Ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith replied: “They should, because the inidual has to declare the whole chain. “Not knowing” would be no excuse.”Former Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick added: “If I wanted to conceal the ownership of a property, I would simply set up a shell company in the British Virgin Islands… We must resolve that.” Assets won’t be seized immediately Boris Johnson told his MPs to reject plans to immediately freeze assets, such as land, flats, mansions, yachts and aircraft, when an oligarch’s name is announced - and before they are actually sanctioned.Cross-party MPs led by Tory David Davis put forward the amendment but it was defeated -. It wold have immediately banned anyone formally named by the UK government from selling any assets or moving them out of the UK. It would have covered land, houses, businesses, art, jeweller, yachts, jets, gold and bank deposits. Mr Davis said: “What will we see during the months it takes to get people to the legal point at which they are sanctioned  “We will see Russians scrambling to sell off their houses, dispose of their businesses and offload their football clubs.”  People who help the ‘economic wellbeing of the UK’ could be exempt Lib Dem MP Layla Moran said she was concerned one exemption could “drive a coach and horses” through the crackdown. She pointed out there is an exemption to declaring ownership of propertya Tory minister decides it is “in the interests of the economic wellbeing of the UK.” There is also an exemptionit is “in the interests of national security” or “for the purposes or preventing or detecting serious crime.” But an amendment to overturn this was not selected so could not be voted on in the Commons. They could transfer to a minority stake or a family member UK officials admit they are limited in what they can freeze or seize when sanctioning oligarchs. This is because under current sanctions law, ownership counts as owning more than half of something, and family members are not subject to sanctions. While the Bill is mainly about transparency rather than actual sanctions, it will be slightly better on this front. When deciding how property should be declared, “beneficial ownership” will be defined as owning % or more of an asset.But SNP MP Alison Thewliss had urged ministers to lower the threshold for beneficial ownership from % to %.She said: “Evidence already points to the threshold being gamed and to people appointing family members and those they can easily control, and the Government need to be aware of that and do more to prevent it.”  Shutting off Russian banks’ access to the West, with plan to move to full asset freeze on all Russian banks.  Sanctions on Russian central bank and financial institutions, already in effect.  Preventing Russian firms and the Russian state raising debt in the UK, already enacted.  Asset freeze against inidual oligarchs, with  so far including Putin and Lavrov and more to come.  Targeting key strategic sectors including defence with more planned on services and energy.  Blocking access to SWIFT, with UK still pushing for a full SWIFT ban against all Russian banks.  Banning Russian planes and ships landing in UK, with new laws next week to put this on longer-term footing.  Banning export to Russia of ‘dual-use’ items such as electronics that could be used in military computers or weaponry.  Setting a £, limit on wealthy Russians’ deposits in UK bank accounts.  Extending the above sanctions to Belarus due to its role supporting the Russian invasion.  Extending UK-Crimea total trade embargo to the Luhansk and Donetsk ‘People’s Republics’. But still no date, due to concerns about protecting Ukrainians still there.  Sanctions on all members of Russian Parliament and Russian National Security who voted in support of invasion. Still in progress despite EU acting already. For more information click here. Enforcement Critics say the law will be useless without proper enforcement, and it doesn’t currently exist. Government-ally MPs also voted down bids to be more transparent about the funding of enforcement, and to bring a new law reforming Companies House. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, former chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said agencies charged with punishing breaches are “no longer fit for purpose” after a decade of austerity. She said: “Money laundering prosecutions have dropped by % over the past five years, just as money laundering has increased and intensied in the UK economy. Fraud is now the most common crime committed in the UK, with more than  million offences, but hardly any are prosecuted.” Ms Hodge told the Mirror: “This is not an Economic Crime Bill. It’s simply a transparency issue around properties. They’re trying to dress it up as something it’s not.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyEuropean UnionPriti PatelBoris JohnsonIain Duncan SmithMargaret HodgeVladimir PutinCrimeBritish economyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Yet it still happened to me.” The Labour MP highlighted the importance of breaking down stigmas surrounding abuse. She recalled the case of one survivor who was raped, and then confronted in court with the barbaric scare tactic of having to open an evidence file to a photo of the man who violently abused her. “The courts are complicit in the abuse that women face - this needs to change now”, she said. In another case, she said, Helen lost everything - her home, her friends, her career - her father died and her mother was sectioned, both broken by watching their daughter go through such an ordeal. The man involved was found not guilty. Her speech comes as  members of the Shadow Cabinet wrote to their Government counterparts urging them to launch a cross-departmental strategy to tackle the epidemic of VAWG.In a letter seen by The Mirror, Labour MPs said on International Women’s Day: “We are writing to you as Shadow Secretaries of State to ask you, our opposite numbers, to recognise that this is an issue that cuts across departments and can no longer be siloed. “It must and can only be addressed by Government as a whole. “The scale of our action must meet the scale of this crisis. We believe we all have a responsibility to ensure that ours is the last generation plagued by violence against women, and we know that there is widespread support, both from the public and from organisations across the sector, to make this commitment a reality.”Earlier today, senior Tory MP Caroline Nokes told the BBC Boris Johnson must “step up and show that he does take womenaposs safety seriously” by supporting new legislation to criminalise public sexual harassment.A YouGov survey found that % of women across the UK do not feel safe walking alone at night, at least some of the time. It came after MPs said a culture of toxic misogyny in the Met Police uncovered in the wake of Sarah Everardaposs death must lead to better vetting. As part of International Womenaposs Day on Tuesday, MPs from across the political spectrum took part in a Westminster Hall debate on the reports of misogyny and sexual harassment in the countryaposs largest force. It is just over a year since Ms Everardaposs rape and murder at the hands of serving police officer Wayne Couzens. A recent report into Charing Cross police station uncovered a catalogue of deeply disturbing racist, homophobic and misogynistic messages exchanged between officers, the handling of which led to outgoing Met Police chief Cressida Dick being forced to resign.And in December, further questions were asked about the force when two Met officers were jailed after taking photos of murdered sisters Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry and sharing them on WhatsApp.MPs called on the Government to do more to restore public trust. Opening the debate, Lib Dem Sarah Olney said the Independent Office for Police Conductreport into Charing Cross police station, revealed “a number of factors that contributed to the toxic culture they identied”. The MP for Richmond Park said: “These included that officers were often isolated, lacked supervision and that there was widespread acting up, with officers assuming unofficial promotions. “This meant that inappropriate behaviours or attitudes were not properly challenged at the right time and so became normalised. “This strongly suggests that the lack of appropriately experienced or trained police officers has been a contributory factor in allowing negative behaviours to flourish unchecked, which leads back to the dramatic cuts in policing in the capital that we’ve seen over the last decade.” Shadow Home Office minister Sarah Jones urged ministers to look at how “we vet police officers” as she argued the process “is not good enough” to actually assess who a person is. She said: “The vetting is not good enough on actually who you are, what you’ve said on social media over the last five years and what you think and whether you should be with vulnerable people. So our vetting needs to be looked at.” On training, the shadow Home Office minister said it needs to be “overhauled”, adding: “Officers need ongoing training throughout their careers, including on anti-racism and including on tackling violence against women and girls.” Conservative former equalities minister Maria Miller stressed the importance of “trying to deal with some of the root causes of the problem”, arguing “we have got to get sex and relationship education ingrained into our schools”. Home Office minister Rachel Maclean recognised policing and the politan Police “must do better” but said the Government is “absolutely committed to raising the bar”. Saying the findings of the IOPC report were “shocking”, adding: “Policing and the Met must do better. And we are absolutely committed to raising the bar.” She went on: “As the public would expect, when officers are found to have committed gross misconduct and dismissed they cannot re-join policing. “And we’re also ensuring that initial police recruitment vetting practices carried out in each force are rigorous and the assessment process addresses the candidate’s suitability for the role of police officer, including testing against core behaviours and values and when officers move force, they are then re-vetted.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON House of CommonsLabour PartyInternational Womens DayDomestic violencePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

No announced a special Minister for Refugees as Downing Street tried to catch up with the public mood.But veteran Tory backbencher Sir Roger Gale suggested Home Secretary Priti Patel should quit.Quoting Ms Patel’s words from  hours earlier, he told the Commons: “The Home Secretary said, ‘I have already made it clear in terms of the visa application centre that has now been set up en route to Calais, that we have staff in Calais’. “That was untrue, and under any normal administration, that in itself would be a resignation issue.” Conservative Tracey Crouch said some refugees could wait seven weeks for an appointment at a Polish centre. She said: “We have been advised to get people to Rzeszów in Poland for biometric testing to support their application, but the word on the ground is that there are no biometric appointments in Rzeszów until the end of next month.” Former Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said: “Snails also move ‘at pace’.”  A long line of MPs slammed the Home Office for the fact a sponsorship route for Ukrainians with no family links to the UK is still not set up. It will allow Brits, firms and charities to bring refugees to the UK for an “initial”  monthsthey provide accommodation. There are hopes warm-hearted Brits could give up their spare rooms - but there is still no date for the scheme to launch. Tory MP Steve Brine added: “So much about this doesn’t feel right and my constituents know what they see. “All of this is far too robotic, and there’s very little Christian compassion being shown at the moment. “Surely we are past the UK saying we’re going to have a generous scheme - it’s time to deliver a generous scheme.” Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke said: “I’m proud of my constituents who are coming forward to offer as much help as possible. I’m proud of the Prime Minister in the way he is leading the world.  But the Home Office is cutting off their legs. And it is simply not good enough. Does the Home Office recognise that this is a war of the likes that’s not been seen for  years ” He added: “This is a disgrace… Get a grip!” Tory MP Julian Sturdy said: “Now is not the time for box-ticking and red tape. Now is the time to do everything we can.No more excuses. Weeks is simply not good enough! These are women and children! We have to speed it up!” Ministry of Defence officials will help process visa applications, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace revealed. But the defiant Home Office tonight continued to resist pleas for a visa application centre at Calais - the port in northern France closest to Britain where Ukrainian refugees have mustered in the hope of joining relatives already in the UK. Instead, the ministry is opening a “pop-up” centre in Lille, with Eurostar laying on free trains to help exhausted and frightened families travel from Calais to Lille for processing. Amid rising anger that refugees gathering in Calais were being sent to Brussels and Paris for checks, the Home Office initially refused to say where a promised centre “en route to Calais” would be set up.But Foreign Secretary Liz Truss let slip to the Commons that it was Lille.Immigration Minister Mr Foster then faced furious MPs demanding to know why the processing of applications was taking so long.Shadow Home secretary Yvette Cooper said: Two million refugees have left Ukraine. Other countries are supporting hundreds and thousands of people.“The Home Office is currently issuing just around  family scheme visas a day. Most want to stay close to home but some want to come here to join family or friends, and we should be helping them. “Instead most people are still being held up by our Home Office bureaucracy or being turned away. Mr Foster claimed security checks were needed on refugees to make sure they were not Kremlin agents who could unleash a nerve agent attack in Britain - like the  novichok atrocity in Salisbury. The Government will not take chances with the security of this country and our people, Mr Foster told MPs. He added: “Sadly, we are already seeing people presenting at Calais with  documents claiming to be Ukrainian. “With incidents like Salisbury still in our minds, the Government will not take chances with the security of this country and our people.” Furious MPs lined up to condemn the Home Office approach. SNP MP Stuart C McDonald fumed: Don’t quote Salisbury at us, that has absolutely nothing to do with this.Tory MP Andrew Murrison added: “Salisbury borders my constituency. I fully accept the need for security checks, particularly on adult males. But the fact remains that Ireland, with which we share a common travel area, has a population of million but has committed to , refugees from Ukraine and has admitted already over ,. This country, population million, has come nowhere even close to that. Why not ” Lib Dem Tim Farron said Mr Foster had “misread the country”, with British families “desperate” to help Ukrainians. The party’s home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael said: This is yet more chaos and incompetence from the dysal Home Office.” Defending the Government’s handling of the crisis, Mr Foster said it had “brought forward a generous humanitarian offer to those Ukrainians who want to come to the UK to escape the conflict”. He added: “Last week, the Home Secretary announced a new Ukraine family scheme for those with family ties to the UK, and we are extending the scheme further to include aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, cousins and in-laws. “The scheme went live last Friday and has already seen over , applications submitted, for which over  visas have been issued, with more being issued as we speak. “We have also announced that we are setting up a new humanitarian sponsorship visa, and we are working at pace with our colleagues in the Department for Levelling-Up, Housing and Communities to set that up.” Foreign Secretary Ms Truss also faced MPs’ rage when she answered questions in the Commons.Shadow Foreign Office Minister Catherine West blasted a “paltry effort to offer refuge” and accused the Government of a shameful lack of humanity, saying the shambles was a stain on its efforts to tackle the Ukraine crisis. Former Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott said sending Ukrainian refugees who want to come to Britain to Brussels and Paris to apply for visas brings the UK into disrepute.SNP frontbencher Chris Law blasted the Home Officeaposs “continued xenophobic and inhumane immigration policy”, claiming it was “a complete humiliation” for the Government.

Mr Shapps insisted that Ukraineaposs president Volodymyr Zelensky had told the UK that he wants his people not to travel too far from their homeland so they can .The number of people fleeing Russian bombardment has exceeded  million, according to the UN.The Home Office has come under fire for failing to follow other European countries who have waived strict visa rules for Ukrainian refugees. Desperate Ukrainians trying to get to Britain visas were told to travel to Brussels or Paris to make their applications, with a pop-up centre being set up in Lille - some  miles away from Calais.Setting out the latest visa figures, Mr Shapps told Sky News: No country has given more humanitarian aid to Ukraine than the UK, in the world.We have given £ million, in addition the British people have been incredibly generous as well.Geographically we are, of course, spaced further to the West and President Zelensky and the Ukrainian government have told me that they do not want people to move far away,at all possible, from the country because they want people to be able to come back.We are really leaning into this, at the same time respecting Ukraineaposs wishes, the governmentaposs wishes, not to pull people a long way away from Ukraine. Askedhe was embarrassed by the situation, he said: We want everything to work smoothly, absolutely, of course. Iaposm sure thereaposs always lessons to be learned in these things.  But you are dealing with a war situation - funnily enoughPutin didnapost put much consideration into what would happen to refugees out of this war. But Labouraposs Yvette Cooper blasted the Government, saying: People shouldnapost be treated like this. Boris Johnson has appointed a new Refugee Minister to get a grip on the situation after days of chaos.Former Tory MP Richard Harrington was handed a le peerage in order to hold the Government post. Meanwhile, the UK has ramped up aviation sanctions to make it a criminal offence for Russian planes to enter UK airspace. Mr Shapps told airports he can order them to detain Russian aircraft and has the power to order the Civil Aviation Authority to terminate registration of planes owned by sanctioned iniduals. The ownership of one plane at Farnborough Airport in Hampshire in under investigation, he confirmed. It comes after President Zelensky gave an impassioned address to the UK Parliament on Tuesday where he echoed Sir Winston Churchillaposs wartime address. We will fight until the end, at sea, in the air. We will continue fighting for our land, whatever the cost, Mr Zelensky told MPs. We will fight in the forest, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets.

You had to pinch yourself to realise that until very recently our Prime Minister spent every appearance here refusing to admithe’d held parties in his own flat. Yet here was the leader of a major European country being brutally honest about the devastating shelling of flats by an invading army in cities three hours away from the UK on a budget flight.As Volodymyr Zelensky outlined the crimes being unleashed by a “gangster state” the assembled MPs, wearing headphones and grim expressions on the packed benches, gave the big, hushed room the feel of a war crimes court. Hopefully a modern-day Nuremberg awaits Zelensky’s nemesis, Putin. The Ukrainian leader pointed out he was addressing everyone in the UK, as a fellow citizen of the world. And dressed in his trademark green tee-shirt he looked the part. As he gave us a breakdown of the horrors happening in his homeland, with eyes heavy and face drawn, it could have been someone you’d just met talking you through a personal tragedy. If anything encapsulates the Spirit of Ukraine it is this man. If anything says Putin won’t win it is Zelensky’s defiant demeanour. His presence in our parliament, like his message, was simple. It said: “I’m not hiding, I’m not afraid. We will endure.” Other world leaders have addressed Westminster before such as Barack Obama and Angela Merkel. But whereas they felt like they were taking part in some mutual admiration ceremony, this felt real. It felt urgent.  Whenever we turn our TVs on we see voiceless children and pensioners scrambling for their lives, and here was their voice. Here was their living symbol of resistance. Here was a man telling us, from the heart, why we cannot further abandon those innocent civilians who do not deserve their plight. Yet who do deserve our protection. It made you ashamed of the listening government’s pathetic response to the refugee crisis, with the pitul amount of visas they’ve handed out and the bureaucratic hoops they are making desperate people jump through to get them. Zelensky is what we hope we would all be when put under the most intolerable of pressure. Cool and courageous. This former actor is suddenly making speeches on the hoof that the finest dramatists would be proud of. For his British audience he evoked Shakespeare, saying there was no question of whether Ukraine’s fate was “to be or not to be.” It was to be. He pushed the British patriotic buttons even harder when he summoned the spirit of Winston Churchill, vowing to fight the Russian enemy in the fields and in the forests. Johnson gave a knowing smile of recognition when he heard that. Priti Patel sat there smirking by his side throughout, as she does. And when Zelensky talked about dramatically increasing sanctions, Rishi Sunak’s eyebrows twitched as he did the sums.  To hear him speak is to realise how badly Putin underestimated the will of Ukrainians. It’s the sense of calm he projects that has kept his nation going in the face of horrendous oppression. At the end of his -minute speech, during a long standing ovation, some MPs wiped away tears. It was a moving performance which humbled all who watched and gave us hope. Because the longer Zelensky survives and the more he draws standing ovations from parliaments and wet cheeks from millions watching on TV, the more he becomes Putin’s worst nightmare.

Rachael Easter, , from Ipswich, split from her husband in March  and was left in a dire financial situation, facing eviction from her family home and in £, debt. Worried for her -year-old son Jackaposs future, Rachael says she was at rock bottom after the break up and didnapost know where to turn. She said: I was a stay at home we and mother, with no money to my name. I didn’t have a job at the time. We were at risk of eviction. The thought that I couldn’t put a roof over my sonaposs head because I relied on another being devastated me. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters hereRachael claimed Universal Credit to stop herself and Jack becoming homeless, and received £ a week in food vouchers which was given to low-income families during lockdown.Then, she started looking at her outgoings versus what was coming in every month to try and make a dent in the debt. The debt was from my gas and electric provider, water, bank loan, a sofa, and a credit card, she explained. Rachaelaposs rent is £ per month, plus council tax. She pays £ for water bills and had been paying £ for energy - although this had increased to £. Each month, she would receive £- in Universal Credit payments and every four weeks, sheaposd also get £ in child benefit. While she tried out dferent methods of paying off the debt, Rachael decided she needed to start working, and began offering her services as a self-employed cleaner on Facebook in summer .She charged £ an hour and worked up to  hours some weeks - but in others it could be as few as just five. Her universal credit payments ied depending on how many hours she worked - and last year she earned a total of £, from cleaning, which was topped up to £, with UC. Recalling how she paid of a huge amount of the debt she owed, Rachael said she tried the snowball method. I sorted my household bills first including water, and gas and electricity. I called the companies and with both monthly bills they put my debt on top, she said.Then I used the snowball method to manage it. Which means I paid off the smallest of all the debts first before moving onto the larger debts. Rachael said her motivation for getting the debt paid off on her own was her son Jack - but she worried she was taking on too much at once and had to make huge sacrices. The mum, who doesnapost drive, was so determined to get working that she sometimes walked an hour to and from cleaning jobs. She also started the p challenge, which involved saving a little bit of money every day, starting with a penny. The next day you save two pence, and so on. By the end of a year, youaposll save £. and have a total of £. in savings. She also created online Monzo savings pots for spare money - which she uses for birthdays, Christmas, driving lessons and regular savings. Rachael said: I would move money from my bank to my Monzo pots. Before, I would have just used the money here and there and it would have disappeared. But I’ve been making a conscious effort to put it aside. I’m now also able to give my son pocket money once a week buthe hasnapost done anything to earn it I put it in his Monzo pot to help with a car or deposit when heaposs older. ThenI do an extra cleaning job or have an additional ironing customer, I split what I earn - half onto the debt and half towards my savings. Another way Rachael made up the cash she owed was by selling unused items she had in her house - and thinks this is a great tip for making money quickly. As well as her cleaning job, Rachael set up a side hustle, which she calls her hobby hustle, selling decorated vases with her friend. To keep costs down in her day-to-day le, Rachael draws up meal plans to keep her weekly shop to a minimum and uses vouchers and discounts where she can.While trying to save money, Rachael discovered the debt-free community on Instagram and set up her own page, @getstuffdone_withcoffee to share her progress and top tips.She also uses the page to talk about house cleaning and mental health - and receives plenty of support from her , followers.  I was so embarrassed of my situation and I wanted to improve all aspects of my le so I set up my page, Rachael said. Just  months on from starting her debt-free journey, Rachael had paid of £, of the debt sheaposd accumulated. My house is becoming a home, I have savings, a small amount but more than I have ever had before, debt clearing and a new lease of le, she said, adding sheaposs so proud of what sheaposs achieved. Since becoming more financially independent, Rachael is sure anyone  can manage what she has - particularly single parents. I still have a long way to go but my target for this year  is to become debt free and pass my driving test which will open up more opportunities, she explained. I now have under £ debt left to pay and by the end of the year I will be debt free. As the future is always uncertain with prices of bills and food I am currently looking for a part time job to make sure myself and my boy are secure. ButI can do it, I hope it shows other single parents that they can do it too.

He told Asda: Gayle has given me a second chance she saved my le. There is no thank you big enough to say to her. She just jumped in and did what she had to do to save my le before the ambulance crews got there. Some people may have panicked but not Gayle. She went above and beyond. I will be eternally grateful to her. Asda said that more than  of their stores have a defibrillator, and Gayle used her storeaposs one to monitor Nigelaposs heart. Gayle told Asda: The defibrillator kept analysing his heart rhythms and continued to tell me to keep doing CPR and then it said shock required so we stood back and then continued CPR. At this point, he still wasnapost breathing.  We carried on, really determined, and then there was a lady there who was a carer who jumped in for me at the very end and did three or four compressions, and he started to take gasps for air. There was just sheer relief when he started to breathe again, and the paramedics arrived at that point. Thousands have praised Gayle for saving Nigelaposs le. Responding to Asdaaposs message, one said: Well done Gayle So many people would panic and not know what to do. So good to know how to carry out CPR and use a defibrillator. It is lesaving, literally.

They have been greeted with floods of donations.  Russia began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February. It is the largest conventional military attack on a sovereign state in Europe since the Second World War. Putin recently placed his nuclear forces on higher alert, raising tensions between the West and Russia. The invasion has caused a refugee crisis - Europeaposs largest since the Second World War.The UN said two million people have now fled Ukraine.But Putinaposs forces have been decimated by the Ukrainian resistance and Russia could lose the war, according to a top UK admiral. As the Russian President vows to press on with the invasion, Chief of the Defence Staff Admiral Sir Tony Radakin said the invasion in Ukraine is not going well for the Kremlin.He added Putinaposs forces are in a mess with eight Russian aircraft shot down in one day, losing , troops a day and a huge convoy of , soldiers and hundreds of vehicles at a standstill. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletterAsked whether Russia taking over Ukraine was inevitable, Sir Tony told the BBC : No. I think weaposve seen a Russian invasion that is not going well.I think weaposre also seeing remarkable resistance by Ukraine, both its armed forces and its people and weaposre seeing the unity of the whole globe coming together, applying pressure to Russia. Russia is suffering, Russia is an isolated power. It is less powerful than it was ten days ago. Some of the lead elements of Russian forces have been decimated by the Ukrainian response. Youaposve also seen basic failures in terms of maintenance and their kit failing. Russia hasnapost operated at this scale since the Second World War and it is incredibly complex and dficult. However, he said the key call of Kyiv - a no-fly zone - would not help those on the ground.Ukrainian leaders have repeatedly called for a no-fly zone but Putin warned that imposing one would be considered participation in the armed conflict.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Vladimir Putin\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

While the passenger locator form has been simplied, it remains a requirement for people heading back to the UK from holidays and could be removed completely. Travelling has become more straight forward in recent months for people who have been vaccinated and they no longer need to take Covid tests before departure and then on theirto the UK. And also under discussion for ministers will be the possible removal of the testing requirements for the unvaccinated.The removal of the passenger locator form could be a boost for the tourism industry ahead of the Easter holidays which is reportedly the aim of Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. The forms were introduced two years ago as a means of tracking infections and went into signicant detail at a time when travellers had to quarantine on theirto the UK. Currently the form is a lot more simple and requires people’s address, contact number and flight details. For unvaccinated people they need to still have a lateral flow test,  hours before they travel back to the UK and then have another PCR test two days after they arrive. Ryanair boss Michael OaposLeary said scrapping the passenger locator form is long overdue. He told the Daily Mail: Itaposs a shambles. They should ditch it, itaposs completely irrelevant. Nobody collects them, nobody checks them or follows up on them.They were designed to pretend that the politicians were doing something to protect people.There is a possibility that a meeting to discuss scrapping all Covid rules could be postponed due to the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.Currently flight bookings and prices are bouncing back following a relativeto normalcy for popular destinations like Spain. Last month Boris Johnson announced his long term plan to “live with Covid”.Self isolation laws for people with Covid were axed on February , meaning people with the virus would no longer be legally required to stay at home for the first time in nearly two years. People were still advised to quarantinethey catch Covid but it was no longer a legal requirement. Routine contact tracing also ended. This meant vaccinated Brits people no longer were required to test daily for seven daysthey came into contact with an infected person and unvaccinated people didnapost have to quarantine. A Government spokesman was reported to have said: We keep all measures under review, including the ongoing use of the passenger locator form, and will be updating on our contingency plans to fight any new iants ahead of Easter.

Kennel supervisor Natalie Wood said: “Bella and Lila had led such restricted, sheltered lives and we believe they’d only had very limited time out of their crates, so theyaposd barely experienced the outside world.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. “Their coats were matted and dirty, tangled with urine and faeces. They had fleas, their nails were overgrown, their ears were thick with dirt and their teeth were covered in plaque. Both were displaying extremely fearful behaviours and we were unable to approach them or handle them. They were terried of everything and everyone.”Staff spent weeks gaining the girls’ trust, assessing them and developing rehabilitation plans to help prepare them for new homes.Natalie added: “It took two months until we were able to take Lila out for her first walk off the site, and a further month until Bella would venture outside the safety of the centre with us. That was a huge milestone for us. “After months of slow and gradual work we had a breakthrough in May when Lila, who’d developed a strong bond with our kennel assistant, Lucy, learned to rush over to her when she arrived at her kennel each morning and put her paws onto her shoulders asto give her a hug. It was a beautul moment.Lila - now renamed Jemima - was adopted by Deborah Turpin and her family, from Suffolk, to live with their eight-year-old retired racing greyhound, Sam. They were looking for another dog after losing their border terrier and spotted Jemima’s profile online. “Her video was heartbreaking and I just couldn’t get her out of my mind,” Deborah said. “What she’d been through was unimaginable and I knew we had to give her a chance. We decided to rename her as we wanted her to leave her old le, and her old name, behind her.” The family collected Jemima in October and set about helping her settle in her new home. “She is an absolute dream, she’s such a superstar,” Deborah added. “She has a wonderful personality and is so affectionate. She rushes up to us every morning to give us a cuddle she obviously has six years of cuddles to make up for! We had no idea we needed a little white curly-haired dog as much as we do! “The most enormous credit goes to the team at Martlesham who helped her after what she went through they instilled such confidence in her. We’re overwhelmed by the work that they did with her and how easy they’ve made the process for us. “Now Jemima is becoming quite cheeky and loves to spend time with us. She is so happy, has wonderful manners, and is very clever and eager to learn. She loved her first visit to the beach, enjoys going in the car, and had a fabulous first Christmas. “She is an absolute joy and embraces le with enormous enthusiasm. She has every reason to hate everybody, but she is so happy and is game for everything!” Bella, who was adopted by a family from Scotland, has also settled into her new home. Her new owner said: “Bella is doing really well we feel very fortunate to have her!”To help the RSPCA rescue more animals in need, like Bella and Jemima, please visit www.rspca.org.uk give to donate.

Graphic designer David Benqué, , and his partner Claire OaposBrien, , say they lost £, worth of belongings when a freak flood destroyed their south London flat. They claim they have since spent nearly £, replacing damaged items and relocating - bringing the total spent to £,. The couple says they are furious with Thames Water, who they claim gave them no compensation after a collapsed sewer caused the carnage in September .Thames Water refused legal liability because there were no previous issues with the sewer, therefore they claim they were not negligent, MyLondon reports.  Thames Water also reportedly asked the couple to sign a letter meaning they wonapost pay for aposun-restorableapos items. David and Claire say they refused to sign the letter and had to fork out £, to dispose of the wrecked belongings themselves. David said: I was alerted to the sound and the smell, something did not seem right. I saw a torrent of water. The pipe that exploded was under a bin so there was a bunch of rubbish floating.  I opened the door and saw the whole staircase was like a waterfall. I closed the door and for a couple of seconds, my brain said it would be fine. Then I knew it was not going to be okay so I woke my partner up. Once Claire was awake they grabbed the children, their teddies and put an iPad up high. David said he got his coat and laptop, but the computer later fell into the sludge.  David recalled: The water was coming through the door so we thought it was time to go out, then the door opened and let a torrent of sewage in. Our furniture started floating and then it got pretty intense.The fire brigade arrived as the water was filling the basement.David added: I was carrying my five-year-old, I saw the firefighters so I crawled so they could see us. They helped my partner who was carrying the three-year-old and she could not walk forward the pressure was so strong, so he was carried by a fireman.  The coupleaposs flat wasnapost the only one affected and other neighbours were rescued from their windows because the water pressure was so strong. By the next day, the extent of the damage could be seen and the costs started to mount up. Thames Water said the family was not eligible for the hardship fund. David said: We are lucky we have family and friends that are able to help us, but we are broke as hell now. There were lots of upsetting moments but when you walk into your flat and see a book your kidsapos like and itaposs covered in muck. You could see stuff that was familiar but itaposs all in the wrong place and everything is covered. Then we realised they were not going to give us any money at all. Textile designer Claire said: Now the time has passed it was actually a really traumatic event to be woken up to a torrent of water rushing into your home. The trauma of seeing how much water was in our flat, just filled up like a bath. Itaposs been really dficult just the devastation, the time and stress to get back on our feet and have nothing from Thames Water. We feel like criminals that do not matter when itaposs their pipe that exploded on our lives. A few hours earlier it could have been a very dferent story but it was still pretty terrying. The fact that it was sewage water, itaposs toxic. The kidsapos stuff is sentimental, they still talk about it all the time. It makes you think lots of people would not be able to get back on their feet. That really stuck with me, the utter devastation, everything gone within five minutes. Itaposs a terrible thing for your family to go through. Itaposs not our fault, or climate change, itaposs Thames Water. A Thames Water spokesperson told The Mirror: “We understand how distressing sewer flooding is and we sympathise with anyone affected. “In this case, the flooding was caused by a collapsed sewer which caused sewage to spill out into nearby properties. Our engineers were quickly on the scene and carried out repairs as a matter of urgency. Investigations show there were no previous issues with the sewer which would have contributed to the collapse, and as such Thames Water was not negligent and is not legally liable for the damage caused. “As with all sewer flooding, we offered to clean and sanitise affected properties, which includes removing belongings which are too damaged to be ed to the property. In order to do this, we ask our customers to sign a document acknowledging that we won’t be reimbursing them for the items removed. “We encourage anyone affected by the devastating impact of sewer flooding to make a claim through their home insurance provider.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Thames Water PLCiPadClimate changeHouse insuranceFloods\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates from our environment editor on green issues and actions you can takeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Panitzke was caught last Sunday as she walked her dogs in Santa Barbara, between ­Barcelona and Valencia. The head of the elite ­Fugitive Task Force squad which nabbed her told yesterday of her disguise and dramatic escape in . He said: “It was like ­something out of a film.  “She appeared by her door to smoke and one officer passed by to get a closer look. “She saw him and changed her clothes, donned a wig and a small rucksack before heading for the mountains beside the house a few moments later. “It’s very rare to find people as prepared as she was.” He revealed after her arrest Panitzke, who had been living under the alias Maria ­Antonietta, claimed she felt she had already done her time, having lived in isolation for so many years.

Fire crew have been asked to work on the baggage belts and travellers complained of massive lines at security that took hours to get through, it has been claimed.Queues at check-in desks were described as beyond a joke causing some people to miss their flights and leaving others in tears on Monday. It marked the second day of delays at the international hub amid staff shortages which saw some passengers stuck on the runway for two-and-a-half hours.One airport worker told the Manchester Evening News : “It’s been so bad that they have been asking firefighters, engineers and parking staff to offload the bags onto the conveyors in the arrivals hall. “I think the summer is going to be horrendous, at this rate we just won’t have the staff, and morale is already low. I just hope that we get the staff we need in time and get back to normal. One woman said her flight to Gran Canaria with TUI departed more than two hours late due to delays getting the baggage on the plane. Kathleen Moorland said she was still sitting on the plane on the runway at .pm, when it was meant to be departing at .am.She added that there were delays getting through queues at the airport, despite arriving more than three hours before her flight. Kathleen said: TUI and Manchester Airport, a total farce and joke. All you want is an easy start to your holiday - not the total chaos that there is. Julia Teale tweeted: @manairport. You really need to sort your staffing issues. Just witnessed people missing flights who have been here three hours but security was so disorganised it’s taking hours to get through. If it’s like this in March what will it be like in high season. Not enough staff.  Martijn van der Voort also tweeted: When will @manairport @AndyBurnhamGM @ManCityCouncil grasp that the airport is one of the worst in the world  From rude security staff to long queues to poor infrastructure and parking. Truly terrible airport and I have been to many across the globe. On Sunday, passengers were also faced with ridiculous two-hour queues amid a workforce shortage, sparking fears of more chaos for passengers in the busy summer ahead. It is estimated that more than , redundancies were made at Manchester Airport as the aviation sector was savaged by the pandemic. This included around  workers employed directly by the hub and more than , by outside employers like baggage handling agents and airlines.Now travel restrictions are lting, passenger numbers are on the rise and plans to reopen Terminal  are also in the pipeline. But questions have been raised as to whether the workforce can meet demand in what Manchester Airport bosses have described as an extremely challenging labour market. Airport bosses apologised over long delays and horrendous queues at passport control on Friday. A spokesperson for Manchester Airport said queues on both days were due to a greater number of passengers than expected. Passengers have been urged to get to the airport at least three hours before their scheduled flight time. A spokesperson for Swissport, which handles baggage for TUI, said: “We would like to apologise to those passengers who experienced baggage delays at Manchester Airport following an aircraft change which impacted our resource allocation. We have worked with our airport partners to remedy the delays and normal service has resumed. Thehas contacted Manchester Airport for further comment.

Landlord Phil Tewkesley, , made the shocking discoveries after he was able to remove the occupants who he claimed had been refusing to go for months.When he finally was able to enter the bungalow he found it full of rubbish including the four snakes - two dead and two alive - fish, bugs crawling across the carpets and even a scorpion and tarantula, reported LancsLive. The tenant was allegedly an animal lover who had rescued the snakes and other creatures. The landlord has now shared shocking footage of the trashed home, near Kendal, and the abandoned creatures.  Phil, from Worsley, said: It was unbelievable, the sheer volume of not just belongings but actual rubbish and food. Iaposve never seen anything like it in my le - it was like a rubbish dump with a roof on it. The neighbours said they were hoarders - they got deliveries every day and never threw anything out. There was mould growing from the carpet and it was full of urine, mealworms - you name it, it was rotten. There was also evidence in a number of spots of rodent damage and a bit of an infestation with holes gnawed through places around the house. The daughteraposs room was the worst - my partner Lisa cleared that and had to run out of the house heaving and retching numerous times because of the stench of urine. I saw this huge tank and it was dirty. I looked a bit closer into the tank and got the shock of my le - there was this gigantic snake curled up.I was terried, I screamed and ran out of the house because the shock of seeing something like that was unbelievable. Phil issued a formal notice for the tenants to vacate the bungalow upon histo the UK in late , after living abroad for six years. But the couple, who lived in the property with their teen daughter, didnapost leave for another year, it is reported. Phil, an HR manager, gained access to his property in December last year and then made the grim discovery that the entire three-bedroom house was piled high with rubbish and housing both dead and live exotic animals. He phoned the RSPCA and left a spare key with the neighbours, allowing them to come and collect the aposgiganticapos snake. The RSPCA officers also called the police, who sent an officer to witness the recovery of the animals.Once they were removed, the locks were changed and the tenant was given a month to remove the rest of his belongings before the clean up could begin. It took the landlord, his partner Lisa McCartney, , and some friends around  stomach-churning hours to clear all of the rubbish and rip the soiled carpets out. Phil said: I initially hired three skips - at £ each - and we filled them in one day, followed by another two which were full to the brim as well. I also had to pay for the council to do a large collection of the sofa and kitchen appliances because they were rotten. It cost about £, just to get rid of their stuff and the stuff theyaposd wrecked and itaposs going to cost tens of thousands to get it back to how it should have been. Itaposs been a really stressful period, trying to get him to leave and then to find what I found. Weaposre getting married at the end of this year so itaposs something we really didnapost need to have to deal with. Phil, who said he felt the new rule, introduced due to Covid, of giving tenants six months to find somewhere new to live was aposfairapos, setting the vacation deadline at April .  But in January of that year, he got the first hint that something was wrong at the property when his application to release capital from the bungalow to help fund a new house deposit was rejected due to the state of the property. A spokesperson for the RSPCA said: We can confirm that four snakes - two sadly dead and two alive - were removed from a property in [Cumbria] by the RSPCA following a report from a member of the public. The live snakes were rehomed at a specialist boarding facility. As there is now a live investigation, we are not able to provide any further information at the moment.

With the focus of the day on this, it is no wonder that some people have been reminded that Mothering Sunday is only around the corner, as people looking forward to showing their appreciation for their mum and everything she has done for them So when is Motheraposs Day  When is Motheraposs Day   Motheraposs Day this year falls on Sunday, March . The term aposMotheraposs Dayapos technically means the day dedicated to the celebration of mums everywhere, whereas Mothering Sunday tended to refer to a Christian tradition that began in the th century where people would visit either the church they grew up in or were baptised.  The dates for the next few years are as follows: - March   - March   - March   - March Why does the Motheraposs Day date change   The celebration falls on the fourth Sunday in Lent and the date changes depending on Easter and the Christian calendar. Easter and Lent changes every year depending on the cycle of the moon and means that Easter Sunday can occur on any Sunday between March  and April  Motheraposs Day shouldnapost be confused with the day in the US, which falls in May and has ious sources that helped to set it up. Why do we celebrate Motheraposs Day   There are ious reasons we celebrate Motheraposs Day, but it is now seen as a chance to be grateful to our mum for everything they have done for us over the years Until recently it was more commonly known as aposMothering Sundayapos. There were ancient Greek festivals that celebrated motherhood as well in honour of their god Rhea and festivals were also held by the Romans, so the tradition is nothing new. In Europe and the UK, a special service would see people ing to their aposmother churchapos during Lent. Like with other Christian holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, the day has become more of a secular tradition and widely commercialised.  In the US, abolitionist and suffragette Julia Ward Howe set up Mothers’ Friendship Day in the wake of the American Civil War in  to promote reconciliation with the mothers of Union and Confederate troops. In fact, Anna Jarvis, who pushed for the idea for Motheraposs Day to be celebrated in the US as part of the national calendar, eventually criticised the commercialisation of the day and lobbied to have it removed. Jarvis was the daughter of Ann Reeves Jarvis, who had set up work clubs for mums to come together. Anna had originally campaigned to have it as part of the national calendar and President Woodrow Wilson officially added it in .

The video emerged from King’s Leadership Academy in Dingle Vale, Liverpool. Filmed by an anonymous student, it shows pupils trying to catch the rodent as it races between tables in the school’s cafeteria,The Liverpool Echo reported .Nicola Kelley has two children who attend the school, she said: It has been going on since before half term, when my kids were telling me about it, I didnapost believe it at first until I saw some of the videos. I thought that they would have fixed the problem over the school break, but obviously they havenapost.  I got in contact with them to tell them my concerns, and they came back to say that they saw two mice before the break, and that they thought the students were being dramatic, and that it wasnapost as bad as they were making out. The footage, filmed on March , shows only a single rodent racing around, but there were said to be “multiple” mice running around. The -year-old mum added: My daughter said that she saw at least five mice in the hall which is just outside the canteen yesterday [March ].  “I have had to start making them packed lunches, I donapost want them eating from in there. I ended chemo in November and finished radiotherapy in January, I am terried about my kids bringing any diseases home that these pests could carry, I donapost want to catch anything. The Echo also reported that two further mice were spotted at the school earlier.  A spokesperson for the King’s Leadership Academy Liverpool added: There was an incident last week where a mouse was seen within the canteen and our estate management team dealt with it immediately and the mouse was caught. Covid protocols requiring us to keep doors and windows open for ventilation presents challenges, particularly during the winter months, to stop incidents like this from happening.

CEPI will invest up to £million towards a version of mRNA technology already used in Moderna and Pfizer jabs that could be quickly modied to target new pathogens. Mr Johnson said: “The UK is proud to have committed to a quarter of a billion pounds to support CEPI at the start of the pandemic, because it was precisely the partnership between CEPI, government, industry and academia which helped our vaccines to triumph over the virus.  “And now, we must come together to support CEPI’s global plan for the next generation of vaccine technologies, such as the new iant-proof vaccine being developed at Cambridge University to help protect us against the next Covid iant, or indeed, against the next pandemic.” DIOSynVax, a university spin-off company, is working with the structure of proteins, computational biology and on boosting the immune system to work out how vaccines can be used to their best effect. If the plan works, experts believe that vaccines could rapidly be developed against “Disease X” - unknown pathogens that have yet to emerge but which could cause pandemics.Dr Richard Hatchett, chief executive of CEPI, said: “The UK Government and the country’s world-leading scientic institutions have been pivotal to the global response to Covid-. “From the development of the CEPI-supported Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine - which is used in more countries than any other - to the ground-breaking Recovery trial to evaluate le-saving treatments like dexamethasone, British science has played a leading role in protecting the world from Covid-. “I am excited to further strengthen CEPI’s strong ties to British science through this partnership with DIOSynVax.” Professor Jonathan Heeney, chief executive of DIOSynVax, said: “Our approach is to be ahead of the next pandemic. “To deliver custom-designed, immune selected vaccine antigens - which is ideal to prevent diseases caused by complex viruses such as the large and erse family of coronaviruses. “If successful, it will result in a safe, affordable NextGen vaccine for widespread use.” England’s chief medical officer, Professor Sir Chris Whitty, told the CEPI conference the world had had many “near misses” with pandemics, and preparation for the next one was key.

It had been suggested that Harry and Meghan wanted to compromise with a one foot in, one foot out solution to being working royals and chasing their own financial deals.However, following the so-called Sandringham Summit between Harry, the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William, it was decided they should cut ties completely.And now former BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt says more could have been done to keep Harry and Meghan in the Firm - especially as Meghan could have been an asset to them. He told the: She was able to give a speech in South Africa about being a woman of colour who entered an institution that, to survive and prosper, needs to continue being the head of state in several other realms which are Commonwealth countries, and it failed to do enough to keep her within the institution.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

They’ve managed to find a mechanism whereby [civilian] Prince Edward can attend the Cenotaph wearing a military unorm. They could have found a mechanism whereby Harry could have carried on. The fact that they didn’t smacks of a level of cruelty.”His comments come as Harry made a surprise appearance at a Texas rodeo - and came dressed for the occasion wearing a cowboy hat. Harry was spotted at the Stockyards Rodeo in Fort Worth, Texas, on Saturday - a famous rodeo where contestants ride bulls and take part in roping competitions. He was at the event without Meghan and was seen chatting to people attending the rodeo and was given a tour of the venue.Harryaposs appearance at the rodeo comes two weeks after his and Meghanaposs last public outing at the NAACP Image Awards, where they were awarded the prestigious Presidentaposs Award to mark their special achievement for aposdistinguished public serviceapos.Accepting the award, Harry said: I think itaposs safe to say that I come from a very dferent background from my incredible we, yet our lives were brought together for a reason. We share a commitment to a le of service, a responsibility to combat injustice and a belief that the most often overlooked are the most important to listen to. The couple also offered their support to the people of Ukraine amid the Russian invasion and Harry explained: Before I begin, we would like to acknowledge the people of Ukraine, who urgently need our continued support as a global community.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Meghan MarklePrince HarryRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He got promised a tour to Afghanistan, same as a lot of other lads after all the ceremonial stuff. But that didn’t happen. “A lot of the lads are fed up. They were promised an operational tour and it got pushed under their noses for about three or four years. Then when the tour was supposed to come about, it got cancelled. “He probably thinks he could do some good out there but it’s a very misguided decision.” Several of the army’s top brass has slammed the teen’s decision to leave his post.It comes as Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told the BBC she supported Brits going to fight in Ukraine. She said: “That is something people can make their own decisions about. “The people of Ukraine are fighting for freedom and democracy, not just for Ukraine but for the whole of Europe. “Absolutely,people want to support that struggle I would support them in doing that.”Defence secretary Ben Wallace later claried only Brits with military experience and who are no longer in the British Armed Forces should consider joining the war effort. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier called on soldiers around the world to boost his army’s numbers by creating an “international legion”. Last week he revealed more than , foreigners had volunteered to fight. He said: “We have nothing to lose but our own freedom.” A spokesman for the MOD said: “All Service Personnel are prohibited from travelling to Ukraine until further notice. “This applies whether the Service Person is on leave or not. Personnel travelling to Ukraine will face disciplinary and administrative consequences.” Buckingham Palace was approached for comment.

Syllipsimopodi bideni was armed with two more limbs than its descendants today. It roamed the oceans  million years ago. Additional appendages would have made it a more efficient predator, say the team at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.The species was unearthed at the Mississippian Bear Gulch in Montana - one of the best preserved fossil sites in the world.It was a primitive vampire squid. They do not suck or drink blood but have dark skin that connects the arms - resembling a cape. The discovery sheds fresh light on evolution - pushing back the age of the group by nearly  million years.What do you make of squid Joe Biden  Have your say in the comment section Lead author Dr Christopher Whalen said: This is the first and only known vampyropod to possess ten al appendages. The paper was submitted for publication in Nature Communications around the time of the  year-old US presidentaposs inauguration. Dr Whalen said: I wanted to somehow acknowledge the moment in a way that was more positive and forward-looking. I was encouraged by the plans President Biden put forward to counter anthropogenic climate change, and his general sentiment that politicians should listen to scientists. Vampyropods are the ancestors of vampire squid and octopae. Their origins are unclear. Modern descendants have eight arms and two big eyes - enabling them to survive in pitch black waters near the bottom of the ocean. Octopae and squid can reach  and  feet long respectively - and weigh half a ton.  S. bideni was less than five inches showing they started out small - before becoming very big. Its remains are exceptionally important. The soft-bodied nature of cephalopods mean they rarely fossilise. Co-author Professor Neil Landman said: Syllipsimopodi may have filled a niche more similar to modern squids, a mid-level aquatic predator. It is not inconceivable it might have used its sucker-laden arms to pry small ammonoids out of their shells or ventured more inshore to prey on brachiopods, bivalves or other shelled marine animals. S. bideni was dug up in the s and donated to the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada where it has resided ever since - without previously being described. After scanning the specimen Dr Whalen and Prof Landman realised it was a completely new genus - and the oldest cephalopod on record. It corroborates previous arguments that their common ancestor had ten arms.Dr Whalen said: The arm count is one of the defining characteristics separating the -armed squid and cuttlefish line from the eight armed octopus and vampire squid line. We have long understood that octopuses achieve the eight arm count through elimination of the two filaments of vampire squid, and that these filaments are vestigial arms. However, all previously reported fossil vampyropods preserving the appendages only have  arms. So this fossil is arguably the first confirmation of the idea that all cephalopods ancestrally possessed ten arms. Two of S. bideniaposs arms appear to have been elongated relative to the other eight. Its torpedo-shaped body is reminiscent of todayaposs squids. The genus name is Greek for aposprehensile footapos because it is the oldest known cephalopod to develop suckers. They allowed the arms - modications of the molluscan foot - to better grasp prey and other objects. Added Dr Whalen: The findings present a revised and more detailed analysis of vampyropod evolution than previously possible. Joe Biden was inaugurated on  January last year. He is the th president of the United States. A host of strange animals have been named after his predecessors - including the tiny moth Neopalpa donaldtrumpi. The insectaposs yellow-and-white crown bore a striking resemblance to Donald J. Trumpaposs distinctive cofure. Baracktrema obamai is a species of flatworm that is meant to honour Barack Obama. The parasitic wasp Heterospilus washingtoni is named after George Washington, a tiny shrew Heterospilus washingtoni hails Theodore Roosevelt - and there is the bluegrass darter Etheostoma jimmycarter. Others include the beaded darter Etheostoma clinton after Bill Clinton and the wasp Heterospilus reagani after Ronald Reagan.

Probably some bus services affected with some journeys taking longer.”  Met Office forecaster Clare Nasir said: “Windy on Wednesday with gales towards the north west and also some heavy rain. Dry skies towards the south and the east.” She continued: “We could see severe gales for a time as the strongest winds extend to the far north of Scotland. We could even see some damaging gust across the east side of Northern Ireland again through the morning associated with that rain band with some heavy bursts.” At the same time it is likely to be a dry start to Wednesday across England and Wales before the rain moves in.  “This rain gradually pushes in and again these winds will be incredibly strong particularly through the north channel, said Ms Nasir. Now the cloud will come and go across England and Wales as well as eastern Scotland but some brighter weather, even some sunshine across eastern counties during the day. At the same time rain will slowly clip western part of Wales as well as the West Country, hanging onto that wet weather for Northern Ireland as well as western Scotland and an undercut of cold air will allow snow to fall especially above m. So west will see the strongest winds, outbreaks of rain, east temperatures will be C to C.  Maps from WXCharts shows that a couple of centimetres of snow can be expected in Scotland overnight going into Thursday.And BBC weather forecaster Nick Miller has also predicted snow that will come along with the gales.“Some severe gales, gusts up to -mph, could be disruptive before they ease,” he said.  This weather system weakens moving east over night and into Thursday on its back edge it will have some some snow towards the Highlands and southern uplands for a time. In the clear spells in north west Scotland and Northern Ireland as Thursday begins there will be a frost here and especially in Northern Ireland there is a risk of seeing some fog. UK forecast for the next  days Wet and windy in the west, drier in the east. Today: Low cloud across central, southern and eastern England breaking to allow sunny spells. A band of rain, heavy at times, will move slowly eastwards across Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and then western England. Severe gales across western Scotland at first. Tonight: Outbreaks of rain across some northern and western parts, though rain turning lighter and patchier. Dry with clear spells in the southeast, and also the far northwest where turning frosty. Thursday: Cloudy across many parts with patchy light rain and drizzle edging slowly eastwards. Brighter across some western areas. Turning windy in the west later. Outlook for Friday to Sunday: Rather unsettled with outbreaks of rain at times for most parts of the UK, heaviest and most prolonged in western areas. Strong winds at times, especially along western coastal areas.

Mr McKeague, of Dunfermline, Fe, was  when he vanished in the early hours of September   after a night out in the Suffolk town.The airman was stationed at RAF Honington, more than eight miles from Bury St Edmunds. No trace of him has been found since a last sighting on CCTV at .am entering a service area behind a Greggs store, and Suffolk Police believe he climbed into a bin which was then tipped into a waste lorry. Alicia Gallagher, giving evidence to an inquest in Ipswich by video link, said she first met Mr McKeague on a night out in Bury St Edmunds in December .She said she was with her sister at Flex nightclub and saw a number of people who were in smart dress formal wear, like tuxes. One of them was on his own, she said. We were just out dancing really and he stayed with us for a couple of hours until closing. She continued: He was actually just really friendly. He wasnapost flirty. He was just really sociable - it was like he was looking for people to chat to.  She said that when they left, at around .am, she was taking a taxi with her sister in a dferent direction from Mr McKeague. My sister was concerned he wasnapost going home with anyone, said Ms Gallagher. We offered him some money for a taxi - he did mention a base but he didnapost say which base it was. He said he walked... one time which my sister wasnapost happy with. In the end I think he just wandered off.She continued: He said he had done it before, which I remember as we talked about it in the taxi home and said aposthataposs so farapos. Itaposs something I remember from that night as I thought aposthataposs so far, I wouldnapost do thatapos, but then Iaposm not a young, fit male either. It was a striking point that he mentioned walking home, that he had done it before. She said she saw Mr McKeague a second time on September   in Wetherspoons in Bury St Edmunds. She said she was with a friend for a casual drink when Mr McKeague, who did not recognise her, pulled up a chair. Ms Gallagher said he was very friendly, very confident. She said when she recognised him she found a video of him with her sister on the previous night out, showed it to him, then sent her sister a Snapchat video of Mr McKeague saying hello. She said he left after a few minutes. Aaron Figge, who worked in the Spar shop at RAF Honington, said in a statement that Mr McKeague bought a bottle of vodka from the shop on Friday, September  . He said Mr McKeague was among his regular customers who he became friendly with, describing him as a very happy, chatty person who was always well-presented and seemed a nice guy. I was aware he lived on the base as he was a regular customer, he said.  He asked to see ious bottles of vodka and while choosing he chatted to me, said Mr Figge. He stated he had not had a good day at work - this was not usual for Corrie as he was usually so upbeat. He said he believed Mr McKeague bought a cl bottle of Spar vodka, the cheapest bottle in the store, for between £ and £, and also bought cigarettes, paying by card. We said bye to each other and he left the shop, he said. The inquest, due to last for up to four weeks, continues.

Speaking on Evan Haferaposs Black Rle Coffee Podcast in the US, the decorated hero said: In the back of my mind Iaposm like aposIaposve been shot, thataposs coolapos, then thereaposs like aposI hope I donapost lose my armapos. Speaking with a hint of his Geordie accent, he went on: This is the strange thing. Now it hurt badly. When it goes through that bone. And I get it when people say when they get shot, they donapost feel it. I completely buy into thatit doesnapost go through a bone.  But once it goes through a bone and shatters it, it hurts. It was like banging your funny bone and times by ,. Thataposs what it felt like. But hereaposs the messed-up bit. Going back into junior para, being indoctrinated and things, there was a sense of satisfaction. It was like, aposoh, Iaposve just been shot, thataposs pretty coolapos. In the back of my mind, Iaposm like aposIaposve been shot, thataposs cool, then thereaposs like aposI hope I donapost lose my armapos. And my arm was hanging by the triceps but, having some medical knowledge. I could wriggle my fingers.And in my mind, again just thinking, thataposs not that bad because I can wriggle my fingers. In my mind, I was thinking, aposIaposm going to keep my armapos. He suffered a shattered humerus and now has a titanium rod implanted from his elbow to shoulder. Craighead added: I think most young soldiers, maybe, you kind of want to get shot because itaposs like a thing isnapost it, like aposoh Iaposve been shotapos. Itaposs a be careful what you wish for, isnapost it. And you kind of want it to happen, you want to be tested. And sometimes death is a price where you say aposdo you know what, I donapost mind dyingapos.  I think there are lots of people who havenapost seen combat who wouldaposve said aposI will sacrice my le to experience that combatapos. I think thataposs part of training, mindset, everything that comes to it. Craighead, who joined the army in  as a -year-old, was pictured in January  during the Nairobi hotel siege. He was in Kenya on a SAS mission to train local forces and was relaxing off-duty when Somali-based Al Shabaab militants attacked the Dusit D complex.He raced to the scene in his civvies, pulled on a camouflage flak jacket, then led a counter-attack armed with a Colt Canada C assault rle, Glock  pistol and combat kne. Wearing a balaclava and heavily armed, he almost single-handedly defeated jihadis, rescuing dozens. The -hour siege left  people dead, including British charity worker Luke Potter. It was only last year, Craighead, who won a Conspicuous Gallantry Cross, the UKaposs second-highest medal for his heroics, unmasked himself so he could publish an account of how he ended the terror attack. His move came after people kept impersonating him on social media and in pubs near the SASaposs Hereford base. Craigheadaposs decision to unmask himself sparked deep concern among senior or defence officials, worried he may reveal details of the missions he was involved in. Under strict rules, Special Forces troops must not discuss their operations publicly and seek to make money from revealing their details. The rules follow the furore over books by ex-troopers Chris Ryan and Andy McNab, which raised the SASapos public profile and led to concerns over Special Forces troops leaking sensitive information which could compromise future operations. Craigheadaposs book on the siege called One Man In: The Explosive Firsthand Account of the Lone Special-Ops Soldier Who Fought Off a Major Terrorist Attack in Kenyaapos, is expected to be published in June next year.Discussing the MOD rules and confidentiality issues, he said: Iaposm working with the Ministry of Defence as we speak to do it properly, to release this book, so thereaposs no sense of information or anything.So thataposs as far as Iaposm willing to talk about my le in the nd Special Air Service Regiment. I should add that the book is just about that one day, so for anyone on the edge of their seats, it doesnapost talk about anything I did while serving in the unit. It just talks about one thing I did that we all know I did. The Newcastle-born hero currently spends much of his time in the States as he is engaged to Donald Trumpaposs chief White House photographer Shealah Craighead.

Jay Curtis, , stumbled upon the interesting find late last year when he noticed the network tucked away in the countryside in Brackla, Bridgend.And when the explorer, from Wales, investigated the area he found nuclear blast doors, as well as an air filtration system, generator and water and diesel storage. The bunkers also housed eight secret magazine tunnels that were built to protect the high explosives held within the Brackla Munitions Factory, where , people worked during the Second World War. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Jay explored the area and shared the find on his YouTube channel, Jay Curtis Explores, where he said: “Now this place might look like any ordinary industrial estate, but with the imminent Second World War upon Britain this place became one of the most secretive places in South Wales – and there’s plenty of other hidden history left overyou know where to look. “Inside the bunker is a maze of rooms for personnel, beds, a canteen, recreation, offices, communication centres – you name it. This bunker remains locked and forgotten in the hillside.”The Royal Ordnance Factory stopped production of the explosives in  and the site was left abandoned until the s, when the Ministry of Defenceturned part of the site into a nuclear command bunker for South Wales.While the bunker appears totally abandoned and reclaimed by nature, with leaves and plants growing up around it, Jay revealed it still has its own power supply.  Jay added: “You can tell by the well-maintained road and new locks that this place is very much still in use.” It is currently not clear who is using the site, but it has previously been used as a filming location for Doctor Who and Torchwood, where the crew was allowed access to film episodes featuring the iconic Cybermen villains. According to Jay, everything inside the locked bunkers remains “in full working order”. Standing outside the entrance, Jay explained: “That bizarre-looking square building behind me was in fact originally a magazine tunnel entrance, but this new entrance was added with the imminent threat of a nuclear attack – hence the air filtration system, the generator inside, the water and the diesel storage, and a series of nuclear blast doors.”  The magazine tunnels are also still intact and “scattered across the landscape”. Jay said: “Many have been filled in but two or three entrances above ground give an idea of what a secretive past this hillside once had. It’s in these dark magazine tunnels that thousands upon thousands of tonnes of explosives would be piled high to the ceiling, hidden away from the enemy and the threat from above.” And further down the hillside, Jay found the remains of more tunnels, with the main access and ventilation shafts now filled in.  Speaking after sharing his video, he said: “It was a complete surprise to find this as I went looking for evidence of the former munitions factory tunnels and did not expect to stumble across the bunkers in the woods. The feeling below ground was very eerie. You could hear nothing from le above ground. “The damp environment within the bunker offered little resemblance to its signicant past – just a chemical toilet, cupboard, some BT junction box and wiring, and the remains of the water pump could be found inside.”Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Viralproperty news\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterSubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Chey, who goes by the name @cumminschey on TikTok, has taken to the app to share a photo of the adorable inking she wanted, compared to what she actually received.The trainee teacher, from Ohio in the United States, revealed that the tattoo artist even drew a stencil of the artwork she wanted on her skin before doing the tattoo, yet it still turned out completely dferent. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.Didn’t they stencil it before to show you the design  a follower questioned, to which Chey replied: Yes but it looked completely opposite. Worst Iaposve spent, she wrote alongside the clip, which been watched nearly , times. One TikTok user commented: The detail and colour is amazing but this was NOT what you were going for lmao I get where youaposre coming from Iaposve had the same thing happen... Weaposve got to normalise being comfortable bringing up our issues with the stencil before they start, another added. A third wrote: These are two completely dferent concepts. In a follow up clip, it appears to show the tattoo having been covered up, although its unclear what design Chey decided to go with instead. One thing weaposre sure of is that she probably went to a dferent artist for that one...Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Kayleigh Ball, , described the horrying incident when her kids called her saying there was a snake in the bathroom and at first she assumed it was a toy. But the distressed mum-of-four soon realised her mistake when the creature on her bathroom floor began to writhe and squirm.Kayleigh said she has had trouble sleeping since finding the serpent in her Liverpool council home as it has since disappeared and she has no idea where it is.The -year-old told The ECHO : It was bedtime and I took the kids up to bed at around half seven when one of them started shouting apositaposs a snake in the bathroomapos. When I saw it I told them it was just a toy. I moved it lightly with my foot and it didnapost move. When my kid turned on the bathroom light, it started moving and I s*** myself. Itaposs skinny but itaposs huge, You find spiders and flies in your house, not a f*****g snake. Kayleigh closed the bathroom door and placed down a towel, covering the small gap between the door and the floor, before comforting her children and putting them to bed.  By the time she went back into the bathroom, she saw the snake go behind the back of her toilet. She continued: I saw it go behind the toilet and I havenapost seen it since. Iaposve since read they are attracted to dark places. I had to get a bath and I must have set a new world record for the quickest bath and hair wash ever. I was constantly checking the floor and the water to make sure the snake didnapost come back.

One woman on Mumsnet has found out just how tough it can be to try and be discreet with your office pining after she tried to creep on her handsome co-worker, only to have her covert operation completely backfire.

But instead of being silently creepy like she had hoped, her phone decided to plot against her - as she accidentally triggered the GPS within the map and a robotic voice told the entire office she was planning to head to her co-workeraposs house. In a post titled, To have done the most embarrassing thing ever, she explained: This happened about an hour ago and I think I need to go home and never come back to the office again. I work with a very very very handsome man. He was on the phone in the office this morning trying to sort out someone to come and fix his boiler. He happened to say his postcode and I, being the creepy wee lady I am, put it into maps on my phone to see where he lived.  For some reason, and I still donapost know why, my phone blared out: Starting route from aposcurrent locationapos to aposhandsome manaposs postcodeapos. I was  feet away in a quiet office. He turned to look and I couldn’t even look up for wanting the ground to swallow me whole. How do I come back from this  Commenters on the Mumsnet post were sympathetic to the mumaposs hilarious blunder, with many of them suggesting she style it out by just pretending her Siri picked up on his voice. One person said: Oh my god thataposs horrendous and something that would happen to me so I am dying for you. Definitely Siriaposs fault! As another suggested: Style it out. Siri must have picked him up saying his postcode. Really must remember to lock your phone before you put it in your bag... While others attempted to make her feel better by sharing their own embarrassing romance stories. Someone posted: Years ago, I was texting my friend about this boy I really liked and accidentally sent it to him. A few days later I saw him and he asked meI had something to tell him, and I said no and left it at that.

For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. When asked by her followers how she ended up living in the accommodation, the woman explained that the town decided to open up the free apartments due to a lack of rental properties in the area. Because of the nature of my job, I need to be at work. And I travel a lot but it was impossible to find housing. So this town has a lot of people who come here for that reason, and they had no housing other than low income, she explained. So they started allowing people to live in their old folks home because it was one of their only rental units that would have openings. There’s a tech school in town and there’s a handful of about three or four people my age that live here, but  percent of the people that live here are still old folks because they live here since before the city bought it and allowed other people to live here.

Demi Bradford, , said she suffered a shopping fail after buying the £. dress that was only available in one size, from SHEIN - a retailer she often uses.When it arrived, she was shocked that it looked so small - and when she placed it next to a one-litre bottle of water the two items looked about the same size. The teaching assistant from London claims that even though the dress had some give, there was no way she could wear it properly as it went completely see-through as it stretched so much.Demi, a teaching assistant, added: As soon as I lted the dress out of the package, I was positive that I must have been sent the wrong item. It was absolutely tiny! It looked like it would fit a five-year-old. I was positive that there was no way Iaposd be able to get the dress on. I ordered the light blue bodycon dress because Iaposd seen a few people wearing it on social media and I loved it.  I thought it would be a great outfit for when I go out with my friends. Itaposs a similar style to the clothes I wear, as I love glamourous bodycon dresses. I was really excited for the delivery to arrive so I could try the dress on. I loved the style. Demi said: The material of the dress was stretchy, but I didnapost think it would stretch so much that it would be able to fit me. But I decided to try the dress on and thataposs when things got worse.  When I eventually had the dress on, it was totally see-through! You could see absolutely everything. Because it was stretched so far, the material had gone from light blue to completely transparent. Thereaposs no way Iaposd ever be able to wear it out of the house. The colour looked a lot darker on the picture online and the material seemed like it would be a lot thicker over certain areas. The only similarities were the patterns on the dress, but other than it was nothing like I expected. I sent it to my friends and they all got a bit of a laugh out of it. But they were just as shocked as I was. They couldnapost believe how small the dress looked and agreed that there was no way it could be worn on a night out. SHEIN has been contacted for comment.

I asked my boyfriend why just out of curiosity, and he said it was a aposjust becauseapos gt. I was really excited until he said that I need to pay him back for my ticket. I was confused because I didn’t know that the artist was coming town let alone ask him to buy the tickets.  The woman said her boyfriend has been really pressing the issue of repayment and is so determined to get money from his girlfriend, that she has told him to just sell her ticket. She added: He’s really pressing the issue that I should pay him back. I told him that I shouldn’t have to because I never asked him to buy the tickets in the first place.

The ­desperate families squeezed in, standing, sitting, lying wherever they can, next to their precariously piled ­belongings, packed into the dank underground space they now call home. There’s an air of restlessness, a palpable sense of tension and anxiety. How could there not be And then, completely unexpectedly, something magical happens. Little Amelia – age unknown, but probably, what, seven or eight  – stands up on a chair. She’s wearing a sparkly jumper with stars on it, from HM a few years ago – my friend’s daughter has the same one and still loves it too. Hands clenched together shyly, unbrushed hair pulled back into a ponytail, Amelia plucks up all her courage, opens her mouth and starts to sing Let It Go, from Frozen. And like a spell cast in the movie her song comes from, the Kyiv shelter falls silent. Everyone turns and gives this small blonde scrap of a girl their mesmerised full attention. No one moves. Babies stop crying. This captive audience cannot take their eyes off her, as they listen to her sweet, steady voice, a chink of shining light in the unimaginable ­darkness of Ukraine.She has given these people the gt of focusing on something other than the living nightmare they’re enduring, albeit briefly, and there isn’t a dry eye in the room. Or from any of the millions around the globe who have since watched the video on social media.Despite probably never having heard Ukrainian before, the song is in the universal language of Disney, kids from any country in the world watching it could name that tune in three. In the caption, the woman who posted it explains that Amelia told her she wanted to be “a singer on a grand stage” – an ambition now fulfilled, just not in a way anyone would want. Their poor parents can, at least, try to fight back, but the children of Ukraine are utterly defenceless in this war. Putin is torturing and traumatising these pure, faultless human beings, turning them into orphans. Murdering  of them.  Amelia and the other kids in that shelter, and similar ones across the country. Danya and Mpak, the boys trapped in Calais, denied entry by our callous government because they don’t have the right paperwork. The -year-old who braved a -mile journey to safety alone. Heroic President Volodymyr Zelensky’ s own children – Aleksandra, , and Kiril, age nine – who have targets on their backs. Polina, the girl with the pink hair, and her brother Semyon, both dead. And the many other nameless young casualties.All entirely blameless, innocent children – just like their entirely blameless, innocent mums and dads – frightened for their lives.  Two weeks ago they were moaning about homework, playing with their friends, not eating their vegetables. Now, suddenly plunged into a reality where growing up without their fathers may well be the best case scenario. The least worst of their horrendous options. When Let It Go lyricist Kristen Anderson-Lopez saw Amelia’s rendition, she tweeted: “Dear Little Girl with the beautul voice, my husband and I wrote this song. The way you sing it is like a magic trick that spreads the light in your heart and heals everyone who hears it.” She finished by urging Amelia to “Keep singing!” If only that choice was hers.

Caroline Wortman, , discovered she was nearly ten weeks pregnant with her second child, Brooks, just six months after the birth of her first daughter, one-year-old Josie.This came after she was told that she may be infertile after being diagnosed with uterine didelphys, meaning she was born with two reproductive systems. Caroline said: Having children was always something I knew I wanted, but I just tried to stay positive and not dwell too much on it. Infertile was the story that I told myself for ten years. But after seven months of trying, Caroline became pregnant with Josie, and found out she was pregnant again just six months after her birth. Have you got an incredible story to tell  Email webnews@mirrorHer first ultrasound told her that her son was growing in the other uterus. Josie was in the right, Brooks was in the left said Caroline, from Woodstock, Georgia. For women with my specic diagnosis I just hope that this is one story that they can turn to and say aposlook, this girl was told no and she had two healthy babies in one yearapos, she said. Uterine Didelphys is caused because when a female foetus is growing, the uterus starts out as two small tubes called Mllerian ducts. These will eventually fuse together to form the reproductive system in a process called embryogenesis.  Women with uterine didelphys do not undergo full embryogenesis, and can be born with two full reproductive systems. Caroline was  when she had her first appointment with the gynaecologist who, after completing the exam, told her that she had two cervixes. She said: I honestly shrugged it off because I didnapost really realize what the implications could be. I did ask the doctor what having two cervixes meant and remember her telling me that I may be infertile andI did become pregnant, it would likely be complicated and high risk. I think this took years and meeting my husband to really sink in, but it was always in the back of my mind.  A couple of months later she went for an internal ultrasound where it was confirmed that she had two complete uteruses, and was diagnosed with uterine didelphys. She was also told that it may be dficult for her to get pregnant in the future. Caroline, who works for a law firm, said: I always knew I wanted to be a mum, I just wasnapost sure that I would be able to without adoption, surrogacy or some other intervention. As she grew up, her diagnosis did not affect her le, but things changed when she met her now-husband Nate Daniel Wortman, , when she was . The couple were married in September  and very quickly started trying for a family.  She said: I didnapost know how long it may take,at all. I was worried but you always hear worrying makes getting pregnant harder, so we just tried to be happy and relaxed as newlyweds about the whole thing.She found out she was pregnant in April .Her uterus that was not carrying her baby was simply pushed aside as it grew, and little Josie Magnolia Wortman was born on January  at a healthy six pounds.The family-of-three spent a happy six months as just that, before Caroline started feeling nauseous while out at lunch with her parents the following June.We were giggly with excitement but also still terried. The visual communications graduate said. The couple had not been trying for a second baby, but at her next appointment Caroline discovered she was already almost ten weeks along - and the baby was growing in her other uterus. She said: The baby was small enough each time to see the other uterus and confirm which side the baby was in - Josie was in the right, Brooks was in the left. Brooks Daniel Hayes Wortman was born on Boxing Day  weighing just lbs oz, and remained in the NICU for nine days.  She shared her unique pregnancy story on TikTok, which now has over , views in order to raise awareness of fertility struggles.She said: Being infertile and thinking you will be infertile are two drastically dferent things, but I would just encourage women to not give upthey want to become mothers, and to not take a doctoraposs words as the be all and end all. I donapost remember really coming across any relatable stories with my specic diagnosis during my pregnancy, so I hope this can be that to at least one woman.

It was obvious he had set himself a goal. More likely he had understood that he had to achieve something in his le. Follow all todayaposs latest updates on the conflict with our live blogBefore this, a fellow teacher told Vera that she regarded Putin as sneaky and disorganised but Gurevich said she immediately spotted that he would make something of himself. In the book, Putin said he enjoyed school as long as he managed to be the unspoken leader, meaning he didnapost try to command people and remained independent. But he realised that he needed to improve his social status - and began playing sports, alongside trying harder in his classes. Vera helped Putin improve, as she began to shower him with attention and discourage him from hanging around the streets with a wayward pair of brothers. But while other pupils enjoyed attending dances, Putin avoided attending and didnapost like socialising in favour of attending judo classes four times a week. He told the bookaposs authors: When I began to do sports...I used to work out every other day and then every day. Soon I had no time for anything . I had other priorities, I had to prove myself in sports, achieve something, I set goals. The pair grew very close, with Vera becoming a second mother to him, even taking him on holiday. She told the bookaposs authors in : I think [Putin] is a good person. But he never forgives people who betray him or are mean to him.In an interview with the BBC today Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said it was clear President Vladimir Putin was a “spent force”. He said the Russian leader would not break the people of Ukraine and that he now potentially faced decades of occupation which would be impossible to sustain.“Whatever we think about President Putin, he is done. He is a spent force in the world. No-one will be taking his phone calls in the long term,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme. “He has exhausted his army, he is responsible for thousands of Russian soldiers being killed, responsible for innocent people being killed, civilians being killed in Ukraine. “He is reducing his economy to zero, because the international community has decided that is absolutely unacceptable, what he’s done. “So he is a spent force in the world and I don’t know whether he thinks that’s a clever thing to be, but that diminishes his own country in the world and he has to take responsibility for that.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationRussia Ukraine warVladimir Putin\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs argyll events in covid recovery","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowCowal Highland Gathering is to receive a £, grant from Argyll and Bute Council as it prepares to take place in person for the first time in three years.The event, at Dunoon Stadium in August, had to take place virtually in  and  due to the Covid- pandemic.But preparations are being made for the  event to take place from August -, and it is the only event recommended to receive more than £, from round four of the council’s strategic events and festivalsfund.The Mull Rally has been recommended to receive £,, Mull of Kintyre Music and Arts Festival is earmarked for £, and the Tiree Wave Classic is in line for £,.Seven other events across Argyll and Bute are recommended to receive smaller grants.Councillors approved the recommended grant awards at the virtual meeting of the authority’s policy and resources committee on February .Eleven events across culture, sport and the arts will receive support totalling £, from round four of the council#s fund.The total budget available for   is more than £,.Councillors agreed to make remaining SEF funds, estimated to be £,, available to apply for.Receiving £, grant awards are Jura Music Festival, the Gathering of Cowal Clans and Helensburgh Winter Festival.The Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival will get £,, West Highland Yachting Week £, and Inveraray Highland Games £,.Tarbert Seafood Festival has also been recommended for £, despite being £ over the  per cent criteria.The report says it is felt this #does not prejudice the other applications# and the funding is available.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for economic growth said: #Events and festivals have played an important part in the economic health of Argyll and Bute in past years.

The scenes from Paddington to Windsor were impressive, especially the arrival at Windsor and the unforgettable journey to St George’s Chapel.To those people in Kintyre, so far from the television

mining in the Blantyre district, while the other man had  years’ experience in another Scottish mining area.He argued that on several occasions the men had to quit the road because of creaking and

of washing through its new laundry service, after moving its headquarters from a former retail shop on Longrow to a unit at Snipefield Industrial Estate.The new Launder-Aide venture offers a same-day laundry and ironing service, with pick-up and delivery included.‘We had been looking for new premises for some time and the unit has everything we need,’ said Joan Stewart, Shopper-Aide project manager.The building has been altered to suit Shopper-Aide’s needs, with the creation of a reception office space, a group meeting room, a private office and accessible toilets, in addition to the laundry room that was already in the building.There is also a kitchen where Shopper-Aide hopes to make soup which will be sold to the public twice a week.While there are still some small additions to be made to the building, Joan said Andrew Smith, Shopper-Aide’s new landlord, and local tradesmen who have carried out work so far, have been ‘brilliant’ in helping get things up and running.When Shopper-Aide was first set up, to help people aged  and over with their grocery shopping, it was dependent on external funders to operate and pay staff salaries.Over the years, as it began to offer more services including household support, a befriending service and organising social clubs like Elderberries and Garry’s Gang according to clients’ needs and abilities, the charity introduced new initiatives to help generate its own funds.These include selling crafts created by clients at its art and crafts clubs and donated second-hand books and other items.The importance of Shopper-Aide has been highlighted during the Covid pandemic, with its outstanding work in the community earning it a Queen’s Award for Voluntary Service, the UK#s highest award for volunteers.During the first lockdown, the charity’s shopping client-base more than doubled, but an influx of volunteers who were unable to work due to Covid restrictions supported the charity to cope with the increased demand.Volunteers also helped Shopper-Aide to continue providing entertainment to older people throughout lockdown, despite not being able to hold its regular groups, by organising virtual afternoon teas and quizzes and a poetry competition.A ‘Phone Buddies’ system was also set-up, offering one-to-one phone-calls to clients.The charity encouraged its clients to knit squares as part of its ‘lockdown blankets’ project. These were then sewed into blankets which have been donated to three dferent charities to help homeless people.‘During lockdown, it was brought to our attention that it wasn’t only older people with dficulties who struggled,’ Joan said. ‘Everyone felt loneliness.‘To that end, we want to invite everyone, including older people, to come and help us at Shopper-Aide, to help support their community.‘Our volunteers come from all walks of le and are truly tremendous. We wouldn’t be where we are today without them.‘Just an hour a week of someone’s spare time would make an amazing dference to us.’Shopper-Aide is looking for volunteers across all areas of the charity’s work, although it should be noted that people must be aged  or over to drive Shopper-Aide’s vehicles.Garry’s Gang, a men-only group that meets twice a week, was the first to resume when Covid restrictions allowed.One attendee told Shopper-Aide staff: ‘I’m not going to die of Covid, I’m going to die of loneliness.’That is why the charity is keen to restart its social groups as soon as possible, initially in bubbles to ensure safety.‘The last two years, we’ve been on hold, the same the rest of society,’ said Joan, ‘but we’re starting to open our wings and are looking forward to getting back to the new normal.’Shopper-Aide has three full-time and  part-time staff who assist and coordinate volunteers.‘Our staff are very committed,’ Joan said. ‘They all do a brilliant job and go above and beyond what’s asked of them.‘The Shopper-Aide family is committed to supporting each other, and we want to become more resilient should something like Covid ever happen again.’As well as volunteering, people can also support the charity by becoming a ‘Shopper-Aide Friend’ by donating £ a year infor newsletters and the knowledge that they’re supporting a charity within the community.Call   or visit Shopper-Aide’s website or Facebook page for more information on the new laundry service or to support the charity."},{"url":null,"title":"letters march 4 2022","story":"We have recently moved to Carradale, and are loving it!I wrote this poem in praise of our new home.Carradale, O Carradale,Room to stretch, peace to workThe south might say it’s grim up northMay our days be long and all spent hereI urge you alltired and stressedThe story’s just startingTo quote a French poet, Charles Baudelaire,Best wishes.Living in a Campbeltown flat, one up from the street, with only one flat above using the same toilet waste downpipe, I was amazed tohome to find a previous #deposit# still in my toilet.My attempt to clear and flush caused the toilet basin to fill to the brim with #dirty# water etcetera and white paper.The emergency plumbers were called and two good men arrived but efforts to clear the toilet basin in the flat failed.At ground level outside, they effected an entry into the said downpipe and pulled out unpleasant #deposits# and many many wet wipes – which I do not use.They claimed to have previously attended similarly choked toilets with wet wipes.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a vegetable plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is your key to successful growing and means that you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and vegetable beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing directly into the ground at this time of year, there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option not only does it provide a warm environment for germination but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests.If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, then even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost-filled seed trays and then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost.If the seeds are big enough to handle, then you can sow them inidually into cm pots – the quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds, between five- seeds per pot.For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost-filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can then be planted outside tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill.You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots.Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and – handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots – gently tease them apart.Drop inidual seedlings into a cm compost-filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level.Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes.These can be planted from mid-March however planting times will y across the country, according to temperature and risk of frost.Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags.You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, and approximately cm deep and cm apart.Once stems are about cm tall, they will need earthing up – by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered.Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt – good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle – nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh Maris Bard – white flesh with good ‘new potato’ flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks.It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden."},{"url":null,"title":"cowal gathering set for 2022 return","story":"Nobody could have predicted at the end of the th Cowal Gathering in August  that it would be another three years before the sights and sounds of one of Scotland#s best family days out again would be experienced again.The event will be held from Thursday August  to Saturday August  and will feature a full programme including the World Highland Dancing Championships, the Cowal Pipe Band Championship and the Cowal International Heavy Athletics Championship.Live music fans will be well catered for as The Gig at the Gathering s to rock the Stadium on Cowal Gathering Friday night, before some of Scotland’s best-known traditional bandson Cowal Gathering Saturday to the Live Music Tent.Cowal Gathering chairperson Ronnie Cairns spoke of his excitement that the -year-old gathering will be live this year.#This is the best possible news and I can#t wait to welcome competitors and spectators from across the world through the gates of Dunoon Stadium this August,# he said.#While Cowal’s Virtual Gathering entertained thousands of gathering fans across the globe in  and , there is nothing that compares to the atmosphere of games day.#We’ve waited for three years to gather together again and this year we’re going to make sure we celebrate in style.#Full details of this year’s programme, competition entry and ticket sales will be available over the coming months.Visit www.cowalgathering or email info@cowalgathering for more information."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclist mark beaumont supports dambusters ride","story":"The - and -mile cycling event is raising money for the RAF Benevolent Fund, the RAF’s leading welfare charity.It consists of two elements: a virtual ride on the weekend of May -, and a physical #heritage ride# taking place in Lincolnshire on Saturday May .The event pays tribute to the Dambusters, members of the RAF’s  Squadron who were assembled to bomb three dams in Germany’s Ruhr Valley on the night of May - .It was a risky raid, dropping the revolutionary bouncing bomb at low level, and the cost was high.

builds at the end of last year, with more than £, set aside for a full-size pitch and changing facilities.Councillor Norman Hampshire, council leader and ward member, revealed that that was just part of the proposals being brought forward, with the scheme tying in with nearby Hallhill Sports Centre.He said: “We are looking to create a new pump track and skate park along with changing rooms for the

have a game of pool or other activities.”Funding is already in place for ious aspects of the ambitious project.However, there are still obstacles to be overcome.A planning application will be needed for the changing rooms, cafe, skate park and pump track.Youngsters will play a key role in the design of the skate park and pump track, with funding applications then being submitted to ious

Sexual violence overwhelmingly affects women and people of minority genders , a reality even more confronting for people of colour.

As a feminist, and as a person assigned female at birth, I identy with my material history of being brought up, perceived as, and oppressed as a woman – something I don’t have to look far back to find examples of.I am a survivor, multiply. I have lived with the trauma of reporting an assault, of navigating a crumbling criminal justice system, but my focus is now on the teaching and practice of consent. For this International Women’s Day, you will find me planning creative workshops with other survivors in my neighbourhood of Govanhill, collaborating on research about dferent intersecting issues, and drafting teaching materials for S-S levels in Scottish schools.Sexual consent is not routinely taught in UK schools. A better understanding of consent encourages active communication, respectful boundary-making, and a thoughtful approach to interactions with peers. In teaching children to care for themselves, to respect their own bodily integrity and personal autonomy, we cannot forget to teach them that – for a successful society - this care must be interdependent, it must extend to how we approach and relate to others.As a survivor, my experiences will have changed me, forever. But my history can be used to inform a vision of better futures with better systems of education. Last month, Australia became the first country to pass a law enforcing universal consent education within schools.

However questions must be asked about census planners continued insistence on the use of a question that is shown to overrepresent religious identity by as much as a million people.“We are asking everyone to pause and think about their beliefs before they fill in the census this year, ascertainingthey actually follow the religion and believe in the teachings of the faith, orthey are ticking a box in recognition of the faith they were brought up in but no longer adhere to.\"This data is used to justy compulsory Christian religious observance in Scottish schools for example - answering the question honestly will ensure an accurate picture of religious and non religious beliefs in Scotland.”The most recent poll involved  Scots adults and was carried out between February  and . The analysis compares the results to a  YouGov poll.When asked what religion or denomination people belong to, % said Church of Scotland, compared to % in .Some % said they were Roman Catholic, compared to % in .A Church of Scotland spokesman said in response to the survey: “Jesus called every Christian to be faithful to God and to make a positive dference in the world.“That is why throughout history you have found Christians fighting injustice and inequality, being a voice for the poor and standing up for those who otherwise were alone.“Jesus called this being a light in the darkness.“The Church of Scotland is there to celebrate with iniduals and families in the happy times but also to provide support during the dficult and sad times.“Irrespective of the Church’s popularity, that calling remains the same and is why today you still find Christians active at all levels of society.“Whether we are many or we are few, the Church will always seek to be a force for good in society.”"},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-263-todays-wordle-word-9-march-hints-answer","story":"The aim of the game is to find a  letter word in only six attempts.The game uses the same rules as Scrabble, where only real words are allowed both in guesses and the result.If you get a letter in the right spot and form the correct word, the square turns green.Butthe guessed letter is in the word but not in the right spot, the square turns yellow.Letters that are wrong turn grey to help the process of elimination for the six tries.If you’re still trying to save your streak, then don’t scroll down yet, maybe some hints will send you on your way.Today’s word starts with the letter M and ends with the letter H.It has only one vowel.There are  of these.If you have given up on today’s game, then we can save you the misery.

Like countless others watching the invasion unfold on the news, from a position of safety, we are deeply moved and appeal for your urgency in introducing sanctions on Russian activity in the UK.#We appeal to you to take immediate action to address the activity of state-owned Russian vessels in UK waters at this time, in particular the activities by Sovcomflot oil tankers in the Northern Isles of Scotland. We are aware of the vessel NS Challenger, owned by Sovcomflot, which was permitted to take on cargo at Sullom Voe Oil terminal, in Shetland on the February .#Following the media statements from Rt Hon Grant Shapps MP, another Sovcomflot vessel NS Champion has cancelled its berth in Scapa Flow, Orkney on the March , .#It is with our disappointment that sanctions were not imposed prior to this Sovcomflot activity in Shetland, however we hope that similar commercial activity in our waters is restricted in future.#We, the undersigned, fully support the UK Government extending sanctions to mody the obligations of Open Port Duty, Section  of the Harbours, Docks and Piers Clauses Act , to be applied to the activity of Russian state-owned vessels and their use of UK ports.#Elected members of Orkney Islands Council, as the Orkney Harbour Authority, continue to uphold the Port Marine Safety Code and the obligations covered by the Pilotage Act .#The letter was signed by all  councillors. The amendment to UK sanctions came into force at pm this Tuesday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On Wednesday, South Korea’s health authorities reported , new virus cases, another record high.After voting began at am, mask-wearing voters waited in long queues at some polling stations before putting on vinyl gloves or using hand sanitiser to cast ballots. People infected with coronavirus were to vote after regular polling ended on Wednesday evening.About  million South Koreans aged  or older are eligible to vote, out of the country’s  million people. About  million cast ballots during early voting last week.Turnout was more than % seven hours into voting on Wednesday, when including early voting ballots, the National Election Commission said. vw,vw,px, px\"People queue to cast their votes in the presidential election at a polling station in Seoul Election officials said vote-counting may take longer than usual because of the extended voting time for Covid patients and that the winner may not be clear until early Thursday.Ahead of the vote, Jeong Eun-yeong, a -year-old Seoul resident, said she was agonising over which candidate is “the lesser of two evils”.“Nobody around me seems happy about voting” for either Mr Lee or Mr Yoon, she said. “We need a leader who would be really devoted to improving the lives of working-class citizens.”While both candidates share some similar economic and welfare policies, they have clashed over North Korea and other foreign policy issues.Mr Lee, who has often expressed nationalistic views, is calling for exemptions to UN sanctions so that dormant inter-Korean economic projects can be revived, and hopes to mediate between Pyongyang and Washington over the North Korean nuclear crisis.Mr Yoon has said he will sternly deal with North Korean provocations and seek to boost trilateral security co-operation with Washington and Tokyo. vw,vw,px, px\"South Koreans are voting for a new president, with an outspoken liberal ruling party candidate and a conservative ex-prosecutor considered the favourites On confrontation between Washington, Seoul’s top military ally, and Beijing, its biggest trading partner, Mr Lee said picking a side would pose a greater security threat to South Korea. Mr Yoon wants to place a priority on an enhanced alliance with the United States.After North Korea’s latest reported ballistic missile launch on Saturday, Mr Yoon accused North Korean leader Kim Jong Un of trying to influence the results of the South Korean election in favour of Mr Lee.“I wouldhim some manners and make him come to his senses completely,” he told a rally near Seoul.Mr Lee wrote on Facebook that he will push for a diplomatic solution to North Korean nuclear tensions but will not tolerate any act that would raise animosity.South Korea’s constitution limits a president to a single five-year term, so Mr Lee’s party colleague, President Moon Jae-in, cannot seek re-election.Mr Moon came to power in  after conservative president Park Geun-hye was impeached and ousted from office over a huge corruption scandal.With conservatives initially in shambles after Ms Park’s fall, Mr Moon’s approval rating at one point hit % as he pushed hard to achieve reconciliation with North Korea and delve into alleged corruption by past conservative leaders.He eventually faced a strong backlash as talks on North Korea’s nuclear programme faltered and his anti-corruption drive raised questions of fairness. vw,vw,px, px\"A voter casts a ballot in the presidential election at a polling station in Seoul Mr Yoon had been Mr Moon’s prosecutor-general but resigned and joined the opposition last year following infighting over probes of Mr Moon’s allies. Mr Yoon said those investigations were objective and principled, but Mr Moon’s supporters said he was trying to thwart Mr Moon’s prosecution reforms and elevate his own political standing.Mr Yoon’s critics have also attacked him over a lack of experience in party politics, foreign policy and other key state affairs. He has responded that he would let experienced officials handle state affairs that require expertise.Mr Lee, a former human rights lawyer who entered local politics in , has established an image as a tough-speaking, anti-elitist who can get things done and fix establishment politics, but his opponents call him a dangerous populist relying on isions and demonising opponents.Mr Yoon has launched a political offensive against Mr Lee over allegations that he is a key figure in a corrupt land development project launched in the city of Seongnam when he was mayor there. Mr Lee has tried to link Mr Yoon to that scandal. Both of their wives have offered public apologies over separate scandals.Some experts say that whoever wins is likely to struggle to bridge conservative-liberal isions.“Both candidates have failed to create their own, distinctive images because they became absorbed in party allegiances amid partisan animosity, so the race was defined by negative campaigning,” said Shin Yul, a politics professor at Seoul’s Myongji University.“Whoever wins will be tasked with an important but dficult task of healing the isions.”"},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-262-todays-wordle-word-8-march-hints-answer  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

What is the best way to save energy in our homes A. If your home isn’t yet insulated, then the best way to save money is to get your loft and your cavity walls insulated. You will soon recover the money spent and there may even be a grant available to help.After that, turning your thermostat down even by  degree Celsius can help save money — andyou need to, put on another layer of clothes to keep warm.Q. Does only filling a kettle with as much water to boil as you need really help A. Every small action helps and that includes only boiling the water you need in a kettle. Heating more water than you need means you are spending money unnecessarily.And it is also financially beneficial to heat water in a kettle and then add it to a pot, for exampleyou are boiling your potatoes, as a kettle is more efficient at heating water than many stoves.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Related topicsClimate ChangeMore On Climate ChangeCampaigning mum transforms old crisp packets into £, for stillbirth charity PremiumThe hidden RHI scandal of how Stormont wasted £m in green energy subsidies‘A vegan diet can be healthy — but it needs planning’Aine TonerOpinionI followed a vegan diet for a week – here’s how it went PremiumKerbside boxes for every home to sort recycling ‘could save £m a year’ – and clean up the current dirty systemMost ReadDoctor faces tribunal over ‘cover-up’ of child’s deathFloundering council’s £,-a-day boss quits just days into role – putting fourth person in charge in three monthsThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsNorthern Ireland braced for strong winds as Met Eireann issue gale warning for islandPortadown man transports  vulnerable Ukrainians across Polish border in London black cabTop VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayVideo: CCTV shows the moment thieves rob Moneymore store of k of stockPlayVideo: Two children hospitalised as car overturns in west BelfastLatest EnvironmentRosalind SkillenOpinionWe are not beat in climate change battle but we must act nowCampaigning mum transforms old crisp packets into £, for stillbirth charityEco-friendly alternatives: seven everyday household items you can easily replaceBehavioural change key to ‘going green’: expertThe cost of going green for homeowners... and how long it could take to get your money backLatestSouth Koreans vote for new president after tight and bitter election raceStagecoach agrees rival £m takeover in blow to National Express merger plansShackleton’s lost ship Endurance found  years after sinking off AntarcticaWhy put a pop-up centre in Lille and what next for Ukrainians in Calais England suffer second World Cup defeat as West Indies triumph in Dunedin,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Then you can use public transport.“I do have a concern around the promotion of electric vehicles in that it is sending out the wrong signal. We should be urging people not to travelthey don’t have to, walk or cycle when they can, then use public transport, and finally go down the electric car route.”Many companies and products promote themselves as green or eco-friendly, but when you read the small print, they really aren’t, says Dr Barry.He also says there are problems with a plant-based diet.Moving away from meat and dairy can help the environment, but there is a danger of becoming reliant on processed vegan-friendly foods and ‘fake meat’ products.“Not only could they be harmful, but ecologically, the production of these processed products is not environmentally-friendly,” he added.“By going plant-based in our diets, we need to go for fresh forms of protein and carbohydrates, not processed food.“Unlike eating raw vegetables, processed vegan foods or fake meats use more energy in their production, like oil and gas.“It’s much more ecologically-friendly from an energy and climate point of view to avoid processed food.“We need to be focusing on ‘farm to fork’ in the real sense of the term, as every part of the journey of processed food from production to your table uses up carbon energy — processing in the factory, driving to supermarket, refrigeration, cooking.“The are other forms of dietary choice you can make that use less carbon energy in the chain from production to consumption.”Related topicsQueen’s UniversityMore On Queen’s UniversityPoll: Unionists more concerned about NHS than Northern Ireland protocolKey dates in le and political career of the late DUP politician Christopher Stalford PremiumSam McBrideOpinionMLAs cleared of ‘bullying’ top civil servant who complained after being asked #do you want to phone a friend #QUB should focus on attracting working class unionists instead of Irish language residency scheme, claims WellsNI university staff begin -day strike action over pay and ‘brutal’ pension cutsMost ReadDoctor faces tribunal over ‘cover-up’ of child’s deathFloundering council’s £,-a-day boss quits just days into role – putting fourth person in charge in three monthsThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsNorthern Ireland braced for strong winds as Met Eireann issue gale warning for islandPortadown man transports  vulnerable Ukrainians across Polish border in London black cabTop VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayVideo: CCTV shows the moment thieves rob Moneymore store of k of stockPlayVideo: Two children hospitalised as car overturns in west BelfastLatest EnvironmentRosalind SkillenOpinionWe are not beat in climate change battle but we must act nowEco-friendly alternatives: seven everyday household items you can easily replaceCampaigning mum transforms old crisp packets into £, for stillbirth charityThe cost of going green for homeowners... and how long it could take to get your money backReduce, reuse and then refill: How zero waste shops are proving paramount to those wanting to live more sustainablyLatestPhilippine authorities seize largest drugs haul this yearHeather Knight: England ‘fighting for our lives’ after another World Cup defeatOfwat has ‘serious concerns’ over Thames Water, Yorkshire Water and othersSouth Koreans vote for new president after tight and bitter election raceStagecoach agrees rival £m takeover in blow to National Express merger plans,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueGreen Party NI leader Clare Bailey pictured.March   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailPoliticians are increasing recognising that immediate and decisive action on the climate crisis will not only influence votes — it will win votes.Indeed, for many Northern Irish voters, climate action will be one of the defining issues in the upcoming MLA elections in May.With these elections fast approaching, many candidates have already started leafleting and door-knocking. However, when a candidate knocks at your door, what questions should you ask them  More importantly, how do you know whether they are genuinely serious about what they propose To gain a deeper sense of the candidate’s knowledge and understanding of climate breakdown, begin the conversation in the context of the broader political landscape.There are currently two climate bills passing through the Northern Irish Assembly. These are subject to ongoing debates, reviews and amendments. Both bills have a target of net zero emissions. Yet while the Private Members’ Billaims for Northern Ireland to be net zero by , the Executive Billaims for .Read MoreClimate: ‘Supporting that Bill would have led to the loss of , jobs in the farming sector’ – Agriculture Minister Edwin PootsYou could therefore start by asking the following question: which bill do they support Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Given how both bills aim for Northern Ireland to be net zero, despite ying target dates, a good follow-up question would be to ask how their party hopes to achieve this. How will they get us there  What is their political strategy  What concrete steps will they take to help Northern Ireland reach net zero Northern Ireland is not only the last nation in western Europe to implement climate legislation, but we also rank th worst in the world for bioersity loss. Nature recovery is therefore integral to an ambitious climate strategy.It is therefore crucial to ask the candidate about how they plan to halt and reverse nature and bioersity loss. How will they promote regenerative agricultural practices  How will they create more spaces for nature  How will they prevent the decline — and potential extinction — of our valuable species and wildle There are also three sectors in Northern Ireland which could be uniquely affected by the climate crisis: agriculture, energy and transport. These three sectors are vastly dferent. However, what unies questions regarding the future of these sectors is the principle of ‘just transition’.‘Just transition’ is the idea that we should not moveto a low-carbon, environmentally-friendly economyit means sacricing justice or ‘fairness’. A just transition recognises that, whether it be people on low incomes or workers in the fossil fuel industry, no one should be left behind in the creation of a ‘greener’ society.To take energy as an example, fossil fuels like oil and gas remain the primary source of heat and power in Northern Ireland. We already know that fossil fuels are harmful to the environment, and they will not help us to reach climate targets. Beyond asking candidate about renewable energy systems, we must therefore go one step further.We need to ask candidates about how they will compensate for workers in polluting industries, who may find themselves without a job in a more sustainable world. What incentive schemes will they promote  How will they re-train or upskill iniduals  How will government invest in this The same is true for agricultural and transport sectors. Will there be grants or public goods for farmers who dedicate areas of land to rewilding or regenerative practices  Will there be further investment in public transport infrastructure, particularly in rural communities  How will government incentivise citizens to support ‘greener’ lestyle choices that are typically more expensive, like buying an electric car or fitting solar  at home Lastly, ask the candidate seeking your vote about what is important to you.Whether it be plastic pollution or food waste, this is an invaluable opportunity for you to ask the candidate about a specic topic that you care deeply about. This could be an ongoing problem in your local area, or a global issue which causes you concern.Raising more personal questions with candidates may subsequently elicit a more direct response from them.Elections are a rare opportunity for citizens to shape environmental policy, and focus political attention on the most defining issue of our generation: the climate crisis.Climate change will be related to every social issue on each political party’s manesto – from gender equality to healthcare.Voting for candidates who support ambitious environmental policy solutions is therefore arguably the most important action that citizens can take.Remember this when candidates come calling.Related topicsEdwin PootsClare BaileyClimate ChangeClimate BillMore On Edwin PootsFriends of the Earth: ‘Stormont’s one of the main reasons we’re so close to becoming the dirty corner of Europe’Greens call for independent environmental agency in NI after Poots announces English office to extend its remit to Northern Ireland PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionConservative farmer Edwin Poots parachutes into liberal south BelfastEdwin Poots confirmed to replace Christopher Stalford for south Belfast seat PremiumClimate: ‘Supporting that Bill would have led to the loss of , jobs in the farming sector’ – Agriculture Minister Edwin PootsMost ReadDoctor faces tribunal over ‘cover-up’ of child’s deathFloundering council’s £,-a-day boss quits just days into role – putting fourth person in charge in three monthsThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsNorthern Ireland braced for strong winds as Met Eireann issue gale warning for islandPortadown man transports  vulnerable Ukrainians across Polish border in London black cabTop VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayVideo: CCTV shows the moment thieves rob Moneymore store of k of stockPlayVideo: Two children hospitalised as car overturns in west BelfastLatest EnvironmentRosalind SkillenOpinionWe are not beat in climate change battle but we must act nowEco-friendly alternatives: seven everyday household items you can easily replaceBehavioural change key to ‘going green’: expertCampaigning mum transforms old crisp packets into £, for stillbirth charityThe cost of going green for homeowners... and how long it could take to get your money backLatestPhilippine authorities seize largest drugs haul this yearHeather Knight: England ‘fighting for our lives’ after another World Cup defeatOfwat has ‘serious concerns’ over Thames Water, Yorkshire Water and othersSouth Koreans vote for new president after tight and bitter election raceStagecoach agrees rival £m takeover in blow to National Express merger plans,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But more compelling is the awareness of how, just a few years ago, all of this valuable material was just dumped into holes in the ground.It’s a filthy business, but far less filthy than the alternative of landfilling the contents of our bins.Anyone who has lived near a municipal dump knows the stench, flies and rats which follow. The toxic nature of much waste means the sites are contaminated for generations, threatening groundwater and wildle.And yet,we all dump our waste into black bins, these sites must go somewhere. It is hypocritical for someone who refuses to recycle to object to a landfill site simply because it is close to their home, rather than close to someone ’s.As recently as , every year we sent , tonnes of municipal waste to landfill by last year that had fallen by %, even though the population increased in that period.Not all the reduction is because of recycling. Just over a decade ago no household waste was incinerated, but now , tonnes are sent abroad each year to be burned to make electricity.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up But recycling is the key explanation for the transformation. Driven both by legislative compulsion and growing public awareness of how we are polluting our world and wasting its resources, many people now put more into their recycling bin than into the black bin.Compostable and food waste is now collected separately and used for everything from garden compost to creating gas which can power lorries or make electricity.But what happens when the recyclable material leaves our homes  It is particularly hard to understand how the recyclable items put into blue bins or other comingled recycling bins — where all manner of materials are mixed — can be accurately sorted for processing.In an industrial estate in Mallusk, Bryson Recycling is where that process unfolds for much of the east of Northern Ireland. Bin lorries from five council areas — Belfast Antrim and Newtownabbey Ards and North Down Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Mid and East Antrim — arrive and leave in a constant stream.Mechanical rams push out each bin lorry’s contents into a hangar. A huge quarry shovel loads it onto a conveyor belt. Plastic bottles explode like fireworks as the vehicle’s heavy wheels drive over the material.The belt carries the waste into the deafening materials recycling facility . The process which follows is surprisingly labour-intensive, as well as using technology to separate the waste.First, a group of workers stand on a raised  and manually lt obvious contaminants from the conveyor belt.Secondly, the belt moves through screens designed to remove paper, which goes to a separate line.The third process involves a magnet that attracts steel cans, such as baked beans tins.That process is then reversed at the fourth stage as the remaining material is subjected to an eddy current that repels aluminium into a chute.The line splits into four conveyors which run through a sorting cabin — the fth stage — where a team of workers pick out materials by hand, aided by a prototype robot that recognises materials and lts then.The sixth stage sees plastics removed using optical sensors which recognise material based on how it reacts to light. A final process involves a worker again manually picking out recyclable items which have been missed.By this stage, more than % of the initial material has been removed. But it’s not perfect. I saw plastic bottles and paper dropping off the end after the final check.The conveyors move quickly and not even all the obviously recyclable material can be caught there is no time to explore items which look unclear. Small items such as bottle tops are particularly unlikely to be correctly identied, falling off the end of the line to be taken for incineration.There are two forms of contamination: material which is wrongly bundled together through the MRF-sorting process [such as plastic in bales of paper], and material which cannot be recycled at all at that facility and so is taken for burning.The contamination at the start of the process stems from a mixture of ignorance of ambiguous rules for what can be recycled in dferent council areas, and deliberate flouting of rules.Claire McCallum has been in the recycling business for two decades at Bryson. “We’ve probably seen nearly everything coming through the doors here,” she tells the Belfast .“We have an ongoing issue with nappies coming through, but also dead animals all sorts of things. We’ve had quite a lot of dead lambs.”Food waste in containers rots, both making the process of hand-sorting more unpleasant and contaminating the final material.What can the public do to help  “I think the best thing people can do is, rather than look at a certain type of material and think ‘oh, that can be recycled’, always check your local council website,” she says.“And the other thing is to ensure things are clean give them a quick rinse before recycling.”But the blue bin comingled recycling is only part of what happens at this facility. Bryson’s own-design vehicles move to another part of the site where no sorting is necessary because the materials have already been sorted manually as they were lted.It is this system Ms McCallum believes is the future.It produces far higher quality materials, almost % pure, rather than some plastic or metal inevitably ending up in a bale of paper. And it uses far less energy, unlike the vast electrical and mechanical demand of the MRF plant.There isn’t just an environmental benefit to the kerbside sorting. Counterintuitively, Bryson says it is also cheaper for ratepayers.“We have been looking at cost analysis and we have worked out thatevery household in Northern Ireland had wheelie boxes, it would save councils about £ million a year,” Ms McCallum says.The costs of sorting the material properly by hand are higher, but the processing costs signicantly less and produces materials which can be sold for a much higher price.So why were councils ever using blue bins  She suspects councils instinctively did so because they had been used to bins and bin lorries, and when told to recycle, they used what was familiar.When asked about this, a spokesman for Nilga, which represents councils here, said the issue was complex, but that the public should try to consume as little materials as possible and recycle the maximum quantity of what they do use.Bryson would like to see a single, consistent approach to recycling across Northern Ireland.Another benefit of improving the quality of recycled materials is that it makes it easier to sell to local firms and improves the quality of their products.Just % of MRF-sorted material stays on the island of Ireland for processing for kerbside-sorted material that figure is %.The high quality, low-contamination materials are not possible through an MRF facility, Ms McCallum says: “You can’t achieve that through recycling through a blue bin system.”Bryson’s plastic, paper and glass is recycled locally, supporting about  jobs and generating around £m a year.The paper is turned into moulded packaging like egg cartons and cup carriers by Huhtamäki in Dollingstown. Glass is melted in a Encirc’s furnace in Derrylin before being turned into bottles for Bailey’s, Bushmills, Fever-Tree, Bottlegreen and other leading drinks brands. Plastic is taken to Cherry Pipes in Dungannon where it is made into civil engineering and agricultural pipes.In one key area, Northern Ireland is now behind the Republic.Last year it became mandatory for recycling companies south of the border to accept ‘soft plastics’ such as the film lids to be recycled.Here that form of plastic makes up much of what still goes into landfill. It is not likely to be collected for recycling locally until .Dealing with waste is complex, but it can be over-complicated by government. For years, as the government prodded people to recycle and cut black bin collections, there was public grumbling.But public opinion has shted rapidly polling now finds public support for recycling.In the post-war decades it was a symbol of society’s growing wealth that a consumer could buy something new, use it for a while and then dump it in landfill because a newer model was available or a minor fault had developed. But that materialistic hedonism has become increasingly uncool.Now people want to recycle more, and do so more easily, but it is government that has not moved to satisfy this desire — either by not collecting basic items such as soft plastic or glass for recycling, or by using a system that will inevitably fail to recover a high percentage of what could be salvaged, and will inevitably contaminate even what is recycled.Stormont and our councils have the power to change this — but may only do sothey believe votes are at stake.Related topicsClimate ChangeMore On Climate ChangeCampaigning mum transforms old crisp packets into £, for stillbirth charity PremiumThe hidden RHI scandal of how Stormont wasted £m in green energy subsidies‘A vegan diet can be healthy — but it needs planning’Aine TonerOpinionI followed a vegan diet for a week – here’s how it wentBuzz words: net zero, a key way to tackle escalating climate changeMost ReadDoctor faces tribunal over ‘cover-up’ of child’s deathFloundering council’s £,-a-day boss quits just days into role – putting fourth person in charge in three monthsThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsNorthern Ireland braced for strong winds as Met Eireann issue gale warning for islandPortadown man transports  vulnerable Ukrainians across Polish border in London black cabTop VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayVideo: CCTV shows the moment thieves rob Moneymore store of k of stockPlayVideo: Two children hospitalised as car overturns in west BelfastLatest EnvironmentRosalind SkillenOpinionWe are not beat in climate change battle but we must act nowEco-friendly alternatives: seven everyday household items you can easily replaceBehavioural change key to ‘going green’: expertCampaigning mum transforms old crisp packets into £, for stillbirth charityThe cost of going green for homeowners... and how long it could take to get your money backLatestPhilippine authorities seize largest drugs haul this yearHeather Knight: England ‘fighting for our lives’ after another World Cup defeatOfwat has ‘serious concerns’ over Thames Water, Yorkshire Water and othersSouth Koreans vote for new president after tight and bitter election raceStagecoach agrees rival £m takeover in blow to National Express merger plans,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Risks associated with rising temperatures, such as more extreme heatwave events causing impacts on people’s health, are likely to become more prevalent as a result of these projections, with their magnitude depending on the degree of change that is experienced.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up At the time of writing, Northern Ireland remains without a climate bill, although the expectation is that this will soon be resolved. The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , led by Environment Minister Edwin Poots, and Green Party NI leader Clare Bailey have bills that have reached the consideration stage in the Assembly.Whichever bill emerges, it is clear that signicant change to our socio-economic model needs to occur to reach any of the proposed targets. In , Northern Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions were estimated to be . million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. Northern Ireland accounted for % of UK greenhouse gas emissions in , compared to approximately % of the UK population. Agriculture , transportand residential buildingswere the largest sectors in terms of emissions. Mindful of the need to address this and maintain a viable economy, Daera has produced a draft green growth strategy which is about creating more green jobs and protecting or re-purposing existing jobs where possible.An important part of the draft green growth strategy is the new energy strategy from the Department for the Economy. It notes an ambition to deliver energy savings of % from buildings and industry by  and meet at least % of electricity consumption from a erse mix of renewable sources by .While the legislation may be edging forward and strategies are emerging, the current Northern Ireland report within the latest UK Climate Change Risk Assessment makes for sobering reading. The Government is required by the Climate Change Act  to conduct such an assessment every five years to inform the UK National Adaptation Plans for England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. The assessment covers  specic risks and opportunities in detail across themes such as infrastructure, health, the natural environment, international dimensions and business and industry.Taking the business and industry theme, issues such as increased flooding of business sites, increased levels of coastal flooding, access to finance, worker productivity and disruption to supply chains could all be at risk from climate change.For example, the annual bill for damage for non-residential properties in Northern Ireland is expected to increase by % by  due to flooding events. The expected annual damages for UK business properties from coastal flooding is expected to increase by % by .The Climate Change Risk Assessment also suggests that there is a risk that access to finance, investment, insurance, and capital for businesses are negatively impacted by climate change through decline in availability and affordability of insurance, a reduction in the value of assets and investment and increased credit risks and cost of capital.Across Northern Ireland, this is currently a medium risk, but it has the potential to rise to high magnitude in future.With these potential risks fast approaching, finding a path to net-zero is crucial. The net-zero carbon roadmap produced for Belfast is enlightening in this regard. Currently, % of Belfast’s emissions come from the domestic housing sector, with transport responsible for % of emissions, public and commercial buildings for % and industry %.Belfast’s roadmap includes an assessment of the potential contribution of approximately  energy-saving or low-carbon measures.I don’t think anyone knows where the money is coming from to pay for these initiatives, but it may be the case that a slowness to act has brought us to the point where we can’t quibble on the cost.Andrew Webb is chief economist at Grant ThorntonMost ReadDoctor faces tribunal over ‘cover-up’ of child’s deathFloundering council’s £,-a-day boss quits just days into role – putting fourth person in charge in three monthsThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsNorthern Ireland braced for strong winds as Met Eireann issue gale warning for islandPortadown man transports  vulnerable Ukrainians across Polish border in London black cabTop VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayVideo: CCTV shows the moment thieves rob Moneymore store of k of stockPlayVideo: Two children hospitalised as car overturns in west BelfastLatest EnvironmentRosalind SkillenOpinionWe are not beat in climate change battle but we must act nowCampaigning mum transforms old crisp packets into £, for stillbirth charityEco-friendly alternatives: seven everyday household items you can easily replaceBehavioural change key to ‘going green’: expertThe cost of going green for homeowners... and how long it could take to get your money backLatestSouth Koreans vote for new president after tight and bitter election raceStagecoach agrees rival £m takeover in blow to National Express merger plansShackleton’s lost ship Endurance found  years after sinking off AntarcticaWhy put a pop-up centre in Lille and what next for Ukrainians in Calais England suffer second World Cup defeat as West Indies triumph in Dunedin,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Northern Ireland’s average diesel price is .p per litre or £. for a -litre fill.Petrol and diesel prices have increased by .% and .% in the last  months, respectively.Consumer Council Head of Transport Richard Williams has said that this increase is “driven by factors outside the control of consumers” and as with domestic energy costs too, this contributes to “a worrying time” for consumers.“It is likely that these price increases will encourage drivers to rethink how they make their journeys,” he said.“In the short term there are small things you can do to make the fuel you buy go further such a maintaining your vehicle properly and properly inflating the tyres. You can also use our free fuel checker tool for a weekly guide to the best price within your area. It is available on our website,” he added. In the longer term, Mr Williams has suggested that this ongoing economic crisis may force motorists to consider whether it is time stop using petrol or diesel altogether and purchase an electric vehicle instead.“This is something all car drivers are going to have to do eventually as the UK government has already announced a ban on the sale of all petrol and diesel vehicles by ,” he said.“Currently only .% of vehicles in Northern Ireland are electric but this is increasing, with a % increase on electric vehicle registrations from  to .“Many consumers will have questions around the cost of purchasing and running an electric vehicle, where and how they will charge it and even whether the battery range is sufficient for their driving needs,” he added.“The Consumer Council continues to work with government, elected representatives, consumer bodies and industry to safeguard the people of Northern Ireland and ensure they have the information and support required in order to make the move away from petrol or diesel.”While fuel consumption has a lot to do with the car you buy, whatever you drive there are things you can do to save fuel, save money and cut pollutiongoing electric is not an option right now. top tips on saving fuel. Keep your tyres inflated. Under-inflated tyres will make your car use more fuel so always check the pressure regularly.. Reduce the drag. This could be by removing roof racks or boxes which all add to your fuel consumption. Pack carefully to reduce drag.. Declutter your car. Less weight means less fuel soyou don’t need it right away, take it out.. Don’t fill your car up with fuel. Fuel is heavy so don’t overfill your tankyou’re not planning a long journey.. Brake and accelerate less — both of these burn fuel. Try to drive smoothly, accelerate gently and read the road ahead to avoid unnecessary braking. Decelerate smoothly as well by releasing the accelerator in time, leaving the car in gear.. Avoid stopping and starting where possible. Roll up slowly for traffic lights or coming to a stop at a queue where you might not have to stop completely.. Get your car serviced regularly. For best efficiency to ensure your car is running as smoothly as possible.. Use the right specication of engine oilto improve efficiency.. Don’t hang around — idling wastes fuel and your engine warms up more quickly when you’re moving so don’t start the engine until you’re ready to go.. Plan your journey — getting lost wastes fuel. Check traffic news before you go too as well as sticking to the sat nav.. Combine short trips — cold starts use more fuel so it pays to combine tripsyou can.. Walk or cycle —you’re only going a couple of miles or so, do you really need to use the car . Use your air conditioning wisely — at low speeds, it increases fuel consumption but at higher speeds the effect is less noticeable. Try opening the windows around town and save the air-con for the motorway. Running it at least once a week helps keep it in good condition.. Cut down on the electrics — turn off your rear window heater, demister fan and headlights when you don’t need them. Stick to the limit — going faster uses more fuel. Drive at mph and you’ll use up to % more than at mph and up to % more than at mph. Taking it up to mph can use up to % more fuel than at mph.Most ReadDoctor faces tribunal over ‘cover-up’ of child’s deathFloundering council’s £,-a-day boss quits just days into role – putting fourth person in charge in three monthsThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsNorthern Ireland braced for strong winds as Met Eireann issue gale warning for islandPortadown man transports  vulnerable Ukrainians across Polish border in London black cabTop VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayVideo: CCTV shows the moment thieves rob Moneymore store of k of stockPlayVideo: Two children hospitalised as car overturns in west BelfastLatest Northern IrelandI won’t let son’s killer control my le, says devastated mother of Jason Lee MartinNI must quickly introduce a refugee integration strategy, says reportNI is ready to welcome refugees, says local charityMural of Cregagh hero Best ‘back home where it belongs’Eco-friendly alternatives: seven everyday household items you can easily replaceLatestPhilippine authorities seize largest drugs haul this yearHeather Knight: England ‘fighting for our lives’ after another World Cup defeatOfwat has ‘serious concerns’ over Thames Water, Yorkshire Water and othersSouth Koreans vote for new president after tight and bitter election raceStagecoach agrees rival £m takeover in blow to National Express merger plans,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It’s just lovely to have that.”She said that football teams would often request to play matches on the green instead of the G all weather pitch in the community centre.“There is just that sentiment with it, it is very special to us and to the football community,” she said.“It’s a bit mucky in the bad weather but it’s buzzing at the weekends in the summer, it just comes alive.”Marlene said that, due to the pandemic, there wasn’t much action happening around the green over the last two years.“It was sad that it wasn’t being used because no one was allowed to play football, but at the end of last year and now this year the kids and adults areback playing and it’s great to see,” she said.“Coming into the spring now it’ll definitely start to pick up again.“We have been in lockdown for two years and without our mural for five, but now George is back where he belongs looking over us.”Last year the childhood home of the football legend was transformed with a retro refit to take visitors back in time to the moment he signed for Manchester United aged .The house on Burren Way, where George grew up and his father Dickie lived until his passing in , was taken over by the EastSide Partnership and transformed to show what it would have looked like when the young footballer was still living there.Most ReadDoctor faces tribunal over ‘cover-up’ of child’s deathFloundering council’s £,-a-day boss quits just days into role – putting fourth person in charge in three monthsThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsNorthern Ireland braced for strong winds as Met Eireann issue gale warning for islandPortadown man transports  vulnerable Ukrainians across Polish border in London black cabTop VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayVideo: CCTV shows the moment thieves rob Moneymore store of k of stockPlayVideo: Two children hospitalised as car overturns in west BelfastLatest Northern IrelandNI must quickly introduce a refugee integration strategy, says reportNI is ready to welcome refugees, says local charityCampaigning mum transforms old crisp packets into £, for stillbirth charityEco-friendly alternatives: seven everyday household items you can easily replaceDoctor hid fact that hip surgery on -year-old patient who died was unnecessaryLatestSouth Koreans vote for new president after tight and bitter election raceStagecoach agrees rival £m takeover in blow to National Express merger plansShackleton’s lost ship Endurance found  years after sinking off AntarcticaWhy put a pop-up centre in Lille and what next for Ukrainians in Calais England suffer second World Cup defeat as West Indies triumph in Dunedin,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But the  census is expected to show an increase in the ethnic ersity of the population.The Executive has published two racial equality strategies — in  and  —  but the committee heard concerns about a lack of progress.Today’s report notes that minority ethnic communities “may be largely invisible to policy makers” due to the lack of ethnic monitoring and data on the population.Natalie Donnelly from Unison NI told the inquiry how such monitoring “is just not there”, adding that “we have the Catholic Protestant other split in the monitoring, and that is it”.Other witnesses said they are still relying on  census data. Geraldine McGahey, the Equality Commissioner, told the committee that “all policy development to date has been flawed” as a result.The report states the absence of accurate ethnic monitoring data “is lamentable”, leaving little insight on the scale of demand or whether equality initiatives are succeeding.Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK without a refugee integration strategy, although a draft strategy has been published by The Executive Office.The report cites the experience of ,-plus Syrians resettled here since . The committee heard that cultural concerns and scarce language services made it dficult for refugees, especially outside Belfast.It stresses the importance of learning the lessons from the Syrian refugee scheme.“With Afghan — and almost certainly Ukrainian — refugees due to arrive soon, Northern Ireland needs to implement a refugee integration strategy with appropriate service provision throughout the region, and do so at pace,” it adds.Most ReadDoctor faces tribunal over ‘cover-up’ of child’s deathFloundering council’s £,-a-day boss quits just days into role – putting fourth person in charge in three monthsThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsNorthern Ireland braced for strong winds as Met Eireann issue gale warning for islandPortadown man transports  vulnerable Ukrainians across Polish border in London black cabTop VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayVideo: CCTV shows the moment thieves rob Moneymore store of k of stockPlayVideo: Two children hospitalised as car overturns in west BelfastLatest Northern IrelandGlentoran - Cltonville: Paddy McLaughlin insists win is ‘no bigger than beating Warrenpoint’ in title race’s latest twistDoctor hid fact that hip surgery on -year-old patient who died was unnecessaryI won’t let son’s killer control my le, says devastated mother of Jason Lee MartinJamie Robinson: Referee in the dock faces Seaview sanction as Crusaders consider stadium ban pending disciplinary decisionNI is ready to welcome refugees, says local charityLatestWe are all human – Virgil van Dijk relieved to qualy despite Inter Milan lossJohnny Sexton expects big things from Marcus SmithGlentoran - Cltonville: Paddy McLaughlin insists win is ‘no bigger than beating Warrenpoint’ in title race’s latest twistRussians pressure Ukrainian cities as fighting continuesUniversal Music Group suspends ‘all operations in Russia’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He has previously labelled the proposals to move the four wards as ldquototally unacceptable.Mr McGrath contends there is no historical, cultural, economic or educational link between Downpatrick and Comber or Newtownards, areas currently in the Strangford constituency that would be in the proposed Strangford and Quoile constituency.He said other political parties have made their stance clear via their respective submissions to the Commission, but was left ldquoaghast with Sinn Feinrsquos response which indicated that it was content with a number of areas including Malone Heights, Roughal Park, the Strangford Road, Ardenlee and Saul Acres developments and all of Saul and Strangford being removed from South Down to form part of the suggested new constituency.ldquoThe net result would be residents on either side of the Saul Road voting in dferent constituencies and I cannot comprehend the rationale for this, said Mr McGrath.The MLA said when he makes his presentation today, he will make it clear to the Commission ldquoin no uncertain terms that the proposal to move the four Downpatrick wards and much of Crossgar, Annacloy and Teconnaught into the proposed Strangford and Quoile constituency is ldquounacceptable.He added: ldquoLet us retain our links with places like Castlewellan, Newcastle and the wider South Down area and do not use Downpatrick as a scapegoat for their attempts to address wider electoral issues in Belfast or other parts of the North..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"150th anniversary of Downpatrick church  ","story":"THE Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh is to speak in Downpatrick to mark the th anniversary of St Patrickrsquos Church in the town.Archbishop Eamon Martin will celebrate mass on March th as part of a special St Patrickrsquos Novena mdash nine days of prayer mdash in the church where generations of Catholics have worshipped since .Poor Clares Sr Martina Purdy and Sr Elaine Kelly mdash who pioneered St Patrickrsquos Camino walk in Downpatrick two years ago mdash will help launch the Novena at the invitation of parish priest Fr John Murray.On March , Sr Martina and Sr Elaine, a former BBC correspondent and a former barrister respectively, will share their faith story, entitled lsquoOur Friend Patrickrsquo.The Dean of Down, the Very Henry Hull is also to take part in an ecumenical celebration on March  while the Bishop of Down and Connor, the Most Rev Noel Treanor, will celebrate Sunday mass on March .Fr John Murray, PP, said the St Patrickrsquos celebration would remember all the thousands of people who have attended mass and celebrated the sacraments in the church in St Patrickrsquos Avenue since its foundation.ldquoIt is an occasion to give thanks for those countless lives of witness and faith and to look forward to the future with confidence and hope in Christ, he said.ldquoIn , Fr Patrick OrsquoKane and the parishioners of St Patrickrsquos could not have imagined the events of two world wars and the rise and fall of Communism, the Second Vatican Council and the many other huge milestones that have come to dominate the landscape that is the th century.ldquoThey could not have imagined that  years after the church was built that we are just emerging from a pandemic.

They help to develop the museum and its collection and act as its ambassadors within the community. Members organise relevant activities as well as supporting the museumrsquos own programme of events.These activities include lectures, tours, literary and musical events, for social, educational or fundraising purposes. The Friends make grants, from their own funds or by acting as a conduit for other grant-aiding bodies who are unable to give money directly to the Museum. Such grants are for curatorial or educational purposes.At the inaugural meeting of the Friends in  the curator, Dr Brian Turner, spoke briefly about the work of the museum and plans for the future.He emphasised that community support and participation was vital and was at the root of everything the museum stood for.The first committee was elected with Patrick Forde as chairman, Dr Maurice Hayes as vice-chairman, Conac Hanna as treasurer and Noel McCann as secretary. Other committee members included Professor Ronald Buchanan, Frank Maxwell and Wendy Osborne. Since then, many other local people have given their time and skills through the committee.The Friends come from all parts of our community and even further afield. The main source of income is through annual subions, with occasional gts. However, there is also some capital as a result of a direct grant from the Northern Ireland government in . This was given in recognition of the Friendsrsquo potential for improving community harmony through peaceful exploration of our common cultural heritage. It is estimated that they have given the museum about pound, towards a great iety of projects during the last  years.However, perhaps more important is the long-term commitment the Friends have shown to the museum. They give their time, goodwill, skills, knowledge, experience and advice, on a voluntary basis, to help the museum in many ways. With their close association to the Museum they have witnessed the reduction in staff and understood the impact of the proposed restructuring.Friends in the art world, such as Richard Croft, Betty McCord and Jim Manley, have supported the museum by generous donations of their own work. Some have used their contacts to acquire works with large discounts whilst others have been able to alert the Museum to items for sale in auctions.The Friends donated Mixed farm, Slievenaman, an oil painting by Tom Carr, to mark the th anniversary of the museum, in . In , they donated Mourne Hayfield, a watercolour by Chris Dearden, to mark the th anniversary of the museum.They also purchased Silent Valley, a watercolour by Jim Manley, in , Landscape, Tyrella, an oil painting by Daniel OrsquoNeill, in  and part funded Down Cathedral and Southwell School, tempura on board by Patric Stevenson, in .The pieces of glass made by Alison Lowry, and which can now be seen at the entrance to the Cell Block, was part funded to mark the th anniversary of Friends. The inidual pieces are representations of objects associated with the lives of prisoners held in this building. The Friends also supported a residency for Australian artist Christina Henri commemorating women prisoners transported from Down Gaol.Friends with musical connections have organised tin whistle classes. The Friends also paid for a local harpist to play in galleries on summer Sunday afternoons and for the choral society at a Christmas event.Keen gardeners have brought plants into the museum to sell and opened a private garden to visitors to raise money.Car boot sales were another popular method of fundraising and the museum courtyard provided a useful venue for several organised by the Friends.Technical, photographic and conservation projects have benefited over the years from the Friendsrsquo assistance. Equipment and materials included a laminator, scanner, digital camera and archival storage. A drone pilot course was funded.The loan of St Patrickrsquos Head shrine from another museum was only made possible by its prior conservation, which the Friends paid for. One of the most important projects was the initial cataloguing of the D J McNeill Collection, by means of a placement, largely supported by the Friends.Young people have been encouraged to enjoy learning about history by Friendsrsquo funding for prizes for school competitions, poster packs for schools, and programmes for The Young Archaeologistsrsquo Club. The Education Service was assisted by the purchase of a photocopier and replica pots for children to handle.Publications have always been an important part of the museumrsquos work, in disseminating information about the collection, for setting objects in their historic context and most importantly, their relationship to people. To this end, the Friends have match-funded the annual Down Survey, - and .They assisting with the publication of two townland maps, which were freely distributed to schools and community groups. Books included A man stepped out for death, Thomas Russell and County Down, a collaborative publication to mark thebicentenary of the United Irish Rising of  and Aspects of Audleystown by Brian Turner, a book designed to help iniduals and groups study their townlands.

The conversion took UCD into a -point half time lead.The second half was dominated by Ballynahinch with the wind at their back and a big crowd roaring them on.Their maul was proving to be a real weapon and Kyle McCall was again the beneficiary with a try after  minutes after a superb maul.Tommy Donnan then had what seemed a certain try disallowed after another excellent maul, but when flanker Olly Loughead barged over on the hour mark to close the gap to eight points the home faithful could sense a famous win.However, UCD scored with their only attack of the second half through scrum half Richie Fahy to give the students some breathing space.Despite laying siege to the line, all the home side had to show for the last quarter was a penalty try with two minutes remaining and the students held on for victory and virtually assured their Division A status for -.Ballynahinch look destined for a nail-biting two-legged play-off against UCC to decide who goes down, but will hope to play themselves into better form over the final few weeks of the season.All support welcome at Garryowen this weekend.Ballynahinch : Nacho Cladera Crespo, Tom Stewart, Kyle McCall, Cormac Izuchukwu, Tom Martin, Tommy Donnan, Olly Loughead, Bradley Luney, Conor McAuley, Greg Hutley, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Rory Butler, Ronan Patterson, Conor Rankin, David Cooper, John Dickson, Kyle Gill, Gareth Gill, Ruari Meharg, Yasser Omar..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dougan goal cancels out Sam’s strike in derby  ","story":"THE local derby between Drumaness Mills and Killyleagh YC ended in a stalemate in quite horrendous conditions on Saturday.The Mills, who are currently on the back of a strong run of form and had won well at the reverse fixture a few weeks ago, would have been confident when welcoming old rivals Killyleagh for their Premier Division clash.The match at Meadowvale began at a high pace with lots of commitment shown by both sides in an effort to secure an early foothold in the game.In the early exchanges Rory Mason, Adam Keaney and then James McGivern all had half chances which they would have expected to have done better with.Somewhat against the run of play and with  minutes on the clock, Killyleaghrsquos Sam Carson rled the ball high into the top right hand corner of the net from the edge of the box with the home goalkeeper, Marc Reid, rooted to the spot. A fine goal at any level.Killyleagh were noticeably revitalised and buoyant following their goal, however, clever work from Callum Dougan on halfway sent Adam Kearney through in search of an equaliser with  minutes on the clock but he blazed over with the goal at his mercy.Killyleaghrsquos Conor Hamilton was becoming more and more influential in the game and continued to probe and prompt throughout, although he will be rueing his miss when he seemed better placed to score to put his side further ahead.On  minutes Rory Mason broke at pace and found Dougan, who forced a smart save from Aaron Carberry in the Killyleagh goal. Kearney, following up, trickled the rebound towards goal before it was hacked to safety before crossing the line.The Mills continued to press and a surging run down the right from Ben Campbell resulted in a fine ball across the face of goal but without anyone reacting it went out for a throw on the far side.Killyleagh had a corner in the th minute and in an example of the conditions, the now swirling wind took the ball directly out of play and with that the referee blew his whistle and brought the half to a close.Half-time: Drumaness Mills FC  Killyleagh YC .Clearly unimpressed with his sides first half showing, Drumaness manager, Mark Kerr, made two changes at half-time. Off went Rory Mason and Adam Kearney to be replaced with Eoin Rooney and Keegan Domican.As the game settled after the restart on  minutes, Campbell blazed a half chance over when well-placed following a corner for the home side.The next attack did bring the equaliser the home outfit craved. The ball fell to the feet of Callum Dougan after a Mills attack down the right looked like coming to nothing and he despatched it to the back of the net with aplomb. The clock ticked by with  minutes gone and both sides were now level.On  minutes Daniel Bell replaced Conor Carew in the engine room for The Mills and as the game heated up and became quite frantic around the  minute mark, McGivern was booked for two strong challenges in quick succession.As the game entered the final few minutes, Marc Reid made a top level save with an acrobatic reflex to push the ball onto the roof of the net when it didnrsquot seem possible showing shades of Gordon Banks.The away team were now pushing hard for the winner they craved and were blown up for an offside call on  minutes with Naseem Ouldhamiat through on goal.As the dust settled and a level of calm was restored the referee blew for full-time.A local derby which was keenly contested throughout and a draw was probably a fair result on the balance of play..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"First half nightmare for Ballynahinch at home  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH lost out to Portrush on home soil in their latest Ulster Intermediate League encounter at the weekend.lsquoHinch began strongly and on the attack from the first whistle as Alex Millar was quickly able to play the ball out from the back and up to Matthew Martin.The Ballynahinch player played the ball up to Kyle Patterson on the left wing, who was able to slot the ball in off the back post to put his side on the scoresheet.Portrush were quickly on the counter attack down the right-hand side only to be stopped by Ashley Brown and lsquokeeper Aaron Donnell.Portrush were determined to level the game and were able to slip the ball from the baseline through a crowded circle before putting the ball in at the back post.Leslie Harrison played the ball out to Scott Leetch on the right, who was able to pass up to Craig Harkness and over to Michael Carney and Jason Campbell up front.They were able to create chance after chance, but were denied by the Portrush lsquokeeper and their defence.lsquoHinch came out in the second quarter looking to add to the scoreline.

The part of the track closest to the residents will be some - metres away.But Shan Slieve Drive householders say that is too close. In their petition to planners they say that the nearest gardens to the track are just  metres away and  dwellings and two major residential homes for the elderly are within  metres of the site.ldquoThe noise generated by the use of the track is likely to be highly detrimental to residents over a wide area, they claim. ldquoSuch a track is likely to operate from Easter until the end of September at least at weekends and almost certainly daily from am until pm during July and August.

She said items are even thrown at passing cars in the townrsquos main streets.The discussion centred on the possibility of including Killyleagh in any further council bye-laws to prohibit drinking in public.The councillors urged the committee to contact the council to make them aware of the need for the bye-laws.BISHOPSCOURT ndash The owners of the former Bishopscourt airfield have outlined their plans to turn it into an international standard motor-cycle race track.Owners David Beattie and John Grfin believe the track can become one of the best circuits in Britain in the next two to three years.They pledged the former RAF base will be transformed over the coming weeks into a circuit as good as any in Ireland.And they have promised to bring over some of the top names in world motor-cycle racing, with the eventual target a world championship grand prix race.The duo gave a detailed outline of their proposals at a special press conference held in Strangford on Thursday night. It was ostensibly geared towards announcing the first race meeting at Bishopscourt for  years on March  ndash but as a result of the local controversy which has surrounded the project, they took the opportunity to answer many of the criticisms.Mr Beattie said: ldquoWe believe racing at Bishopscourt will put this end of the county on the map.ARDGLASS ndash A claim has been made this week that Ardglass fishermen will not benefit from a trawler decommissioning scheme announced by the Government.Local SDLP councillor Mr Dermot Curran says Ardglass trawler men will be allowed ldquovery littleany of the pound million which has been earmarked for the scheme.The pound million is intended to over the entire UK fishing fleet over a two-year period. The money will be paid to owners wishing to leave the industry, therefore reducing fishing capacity.Mr Curran said the money on offer is too little to help local fishermen.ldquoThere are  boats in Ardglass. A number of owners want to leave the industry, but this will not let them get out, he added.Mr Curran said Northern Ireland fishermen were in dficulty, with some living on the breadline.Accusing the

budgets then staff may be laid off.Addressing his schoolrsquos annual prize distribution on Wednesday night, Mr Hanna said it was wrong for schools to have to make the decision on how many teachers should be employed and their levels of pay.ldquoOn introduction the Government was at great pains to assure us that the purpose of LMS was to enable schools to decide their own priorities in the

Land at the rear of Russell Park is not deemed a flooding risk.Late last year, politicians said they are keen to see a wide-ranging development plan for the town centre location and while they accept that it may not be possible to deliver everything that will be in the blueprint at the same time, they want to aim high and also target potential funders to finance what will be an ambitious project.Downpatrick area councillors met with senior council officials last week to discuss proposals for the development of the park with the focus on maximising the opportunities that Dunleath offers.It has been agreed that a paper detailing plans for the new skateboard park and pump track will be outlined at a forthcoming meeting of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee.A working group has been set up to oversee the future of the park and its members have taken a close look at the existing sports pitches, with many keen to provide at least one G or G pitch which would provide a facility that could be used all year round.Downpatrick councillor, Oonagh Hanlon, described the development plans for Dunleath as ldquoexciting and praised the local authorityrsquos sensible approach to maximise its potential.She also conceded that while parts of the park present challenges as they are included within a flood plain, there is agreement aiming local politicians on the way forward.ldquoWe need to press ahead with what is achievable in the short term at Dunleath Park, whilst keeping an eye on a longer-term strategy.

The food serves as a stress reliever and in many cases initially the person is not aware of what they are doing.In this day and age of dieting, health and fitness, it is sometimes dficult to ascertain the dference between someone who has an eating disorder and a person who is simply weight conscious.The main ingredient present in a person with an eating disorder is the use or abuse of food to cope with dficult feelings, whereas a weight conscious person may simply want to lose weight for a wedding, an occasion, to fit into an outfit.It is the psychological and emotional implications that separate the weight conscious person from the person with an eating disorder. Unfortunately, some embarking on a weight loss trail start out innocently to lose lsquoa few poundsrsquo, however over a period of time a personrsquos brain and body chemistry can be affected by the diet they have chosen and as a result the brain and bodybecome impaired.Possible causesThere is no single cause for eating disorders, as there are many factors pertaining to them. The common thread seems to be a supersensitive nature, low self esteem and an inability to respond appropriately to uncomfortable feelings.The good news is recovery is possible and a person can restore their relationship with themselves and with food. All iniduals have their own unique personal issues that contribute to their eating disorder, so treatment has to be tailored to the iniduals specic needs, personality and lestyle.Who develops disorders Anyone can develop an eating disorder, regardless of age, sex cultural background, etc, and it is not unusual for an eating disorder to surface in middle age. Research suggests that there may also be a genetic disposition to eating disorders and a link to certain personality types.However, there are certain factors pertaining to eating disorders and anyone can develop a disordered pattern of eating. A traumatic event, disordered perception, being abused, being bullied, a long term illness, a death, negative influences from a family member or a friend can all have a part to play in the symphony that can create issues around food.What are the categories There are several categories of eating disorders. However the main culprits are anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and other related disorders.These disorders centre around extreme or potentially dangerous eating and weight control behaviours which include binge eating, starving, purging, chewing and spitting and over exercising.There are two less known eating disorders mdash night eating syndrome and orthorexia nervosamdash as well as further categories under the title of EDNOS , but today Irsquod Like to explore the three most common types of eating disorder.AnorexiaThe first case of anorexia was in  in France and the first paper on anorexia was written by Sir William Gull in .Anorexia is the relentless pursuit of low body weight either by curtailing food intake or restricting particular foods thought to be fattening. This can result in emaciation and the risk of collapse or death.Some people exercise compulsively to burn off the lsquoperceivedrsquo excess of calories from the small amount theydo manage to eat. The focus based on food is an attempt to cope with control and to feel some sense of power in their lives.It is not about simply wishing to be slim like models in magazines. Starvation causes the disorder to take control and this alters brain and body chemistry that results in further distortions, in thinking and emotional reasoning. As the illness takes more of a hold, a person starts to become exhausted as their energy levels are compromised due to lack of nutrition. This, together with an increase in negative energy, may account for the heaviness they feel.In all cases this heaviness is mistaken for fatness, hence they engage in a constant struggle to keep losing weight. It is a war on food that must be maintained despite the already severe weight loss that the person has incurred.Anorexia checklist:Weight loss in a short space of timeLoss of periods for womenFeeling cold all the timeDizzinessDry, rough, pale discoloured skinSevere restriction of foodFood rituals, such as chopping food into small pieces, counting bits of foodBloated stomach Loss of bone massMood swingsPerfectionistic attitudesInsecuritySelf-worth becomes based on what is eaten or not eatenIntense fear of gaining weightDistorted perception of body shape, weight, personality and amount of food eatenRigid and obsessive behaviourWearing baggy clothesAvoiding companyIn some cases some take laxativesBuzz from starving ndash sense of power or worthConviction that they are OK despite concerns of otherAs you can see, the above have far reaching effects on a personrsquos health and well-being, and as suchleft untreated can be fatal.The long term effects can lead to women becoming infertile or have dficulty getting pregnant. There is also a high risk of developing osteoporosis for both men and women.BulimiaThe term Bulimia nervosa literally means lsquoox hunger of nervous originrsquo. This hunger is driven by an emotional need that food cannot alone fill. Usually this person feels this void or gap or emptiness and they seek to use food to fill it. Unfortunately, as many find out, the emptiness cannot be filled by food, as it is emotional, physical and spiritual.Sufferers characteristically binge eat or over eat and end up feeling bloated, worse, too full. After their eating episode they then vomit and or take laxatives in a bid to prevent themselves from gaining weight. Others also over exercise in a bid to burn unwanted calories. As with anorexia, control and the abuse of food to cope are also present.Bulimia usually follows dieting and starts later than anorexia mdash in late adolescence. It may follow anorexia. It can continue for many yearsleft untreated, thus many older women have the illness. The period after childbirth is another time when women are at risk.Bulimia is also associated with low self esteem, lack of confidence and over-evaluation of weight and shape, and a need to control weight. Bulimic behaviour is very addictive as, while vomiting and exercising the brain releases endorphins, chemicals which are the bodyrsquos natural pain killers.The ritual confers a sense of emotional release, so what starts off as a way of controlling calories, becomes a way of getting this emotional release ndash which will be repeated whenever a person feels emotional or physical stress.Bulimia checklist:Frequent weight changes.Sore throat, swollen glands, tooth decay, bad breath.Preoccupation with an overestimation of body shape and weight.VomitingLaxative abuseRigid and harsh exercise regimesFear of putting on weightDepressionMood swingsElectrolyte and fluid imbalancesPoor skin condition and hair lossLethargy and tirednessHeart palpitationsInternal organs damageUncontrollable urges to eat vast amounts of foodAnxiety, guilt and shame attached to self and behaviourFeelings of isolationBuzz from vomiting, sense of release reliefBuzz from perceived weight lossEasy weight gain.Again, like anorexia, the above can have a far reaching effect on mental, emotional, physical and spiritual well being. In extreme cases bulimia causes heart failure because when a person induces vomiting, they lose potassium from the body.Potassium is a mineral which regulates the sdrenal glands, the nervous system, the heart and energy levels of the body. The adrenal glands in the body are responsible for handling stress effectively. Other dangers include rupture of the stomach, choking, drying up of saliy glands.Binge eatingLike bulimia, binge eating disorder has only recently been recognised as a distinct condition. It was in  that it was first acknowledged as an eating disorder in its own right.BED is very similar to bulimia in all respects, except that the person does not purge to dispose of unwanted calories. It is believed that there are more people suffering from BED than anorexia or bulimia.People who binge or overeat and who do not purge usually struggle with their weight, although not all are overweight. Being overweight , of course brings with it the risk of a host of other physical illnesses and most sufferers feel depressed, out of control and ashamed of their behaviour.Binge eating checklist:Binging in secretEating very rapidlyEmotional eatingCanrsquot stop when had enoughSensing the eating behaviour is not normalEating despite feeling very fullsometimesFeeling out of control when eatingShame, depression, guiltCompulsive eating when not hungryFantasies about being a better person when thin.As many people with weight issues are judged by society, a supportive and nurturing environment is necessary in order for the inidual to feel safe. Here again, education is a vital component of recovery from any eating disorder. Therapeutic interventions work at both physical and emotional levels to deal with the urges, cravings, to change eating habits, look at thought patterns and rules, becoming more emotionally resilient.

The North Antrim MP urged the Treasury to make a temporary cut to fuel duty and VAT to help motorists in NI who he said are paying £ per week just to drive to and from work.The North Antrim MP said: “Within a rural area like Northern Ireland, many who work in our schools, hospitals and manufacturing have no access to public transport and depend on their car.”He said: “Party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has written to Chancellor with serious proposals which would help working families. It is time for the Government to step up and address a problem which has been predicted for weeks.”Other proposals made by the DUP include cancelling the planned .% increase in National Insurance contributions and offering targeted extra support to households in greatest need.UUP leader Doug Beattie has written to Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic asking for immediate action to bring about a reduction in VAT on energy costs across the United Kingdom.He said: “If this can be done, it will give the most vulnerable hope that we can get through this present crisis which will help the material and societal wellbeing of the people of Northern Ireland.”He added: “I am extremely concerned that energy prices are soaring exponentially throughout the United Kingdom creating real societal dficulty.”Sinn Fein leader Michelle O’Neill said the Tory government must do more support workers and families struggling with cost of living.She also blamed the DUP for “walking away” from the Executive thus preventing a budget from being set while also preventing ministers from taking further action. In a letter to PM Boris Johnson, Ms O’Neill called on the British government to abandon its plans to hike people’s taxes from April and to introduce a windfall tax on high-profiting energy companies.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It comes in behind Pembrokeshire at first place with  beaches, Devon with , Cornwall with  and Anglesey with .The research comes as people are looking to continue to holiday at home as Wales and the UK begins to re-open and international travel is still looking unsure. It was carried out by Uswitch and can be viewed here: https:www.uswitch car-insurance guides uk-dog-friendly-beaches-mapped In their list of  beaches from across the UK, Ogmore Beach comes in third place behind Cayton Bay in North Yorkshire and Oxwich Beach near Swansea.MORE NEWS:Coronavirus: One in three adults in Wales now fully vaccinatedDream seaside home has seven bedrooms and an amazing al-fresco entertaining areaLaurence Llewellyn-Bowen joins campaign to transform oldest Vale homeThe Uswitch guide says that Ogmore Beach is best for fishing, walking and dog-friendly pubs and the car park costs £ a day, with dogs allowed on the beach all-year round and there are no restrictions. They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe app would let users know real-time data on public transport and the road network, and the estimated time to get somewhere by car, train, bus or bike.A huge upgrade in traffic monitoring, new bus lanes, and a state-of-the-art new traffic control room also form part of Cardf council’s plans for an ‘intelligent transport system’.Buses could also be ordered like taxis, taking a route based on the demand for the service determined by public requests.The council will consult the public on its plans to roll out the changes for the system, which it hopes will encourage people to walk, cycle or take public transport.Cllr Caro Wild, cabinet member for strategic planning and transport, said: “We want to ask the public their views on our draft strategy to build an intelligent transport system in Cardf. We do have systems in place already, but they are not integrated, and many are coming to the end of their le, as they have been superseded by newer technology.“We want to reduce harmful emissions, improve air quality and make Cardf a healthier city to live and work in. One of the best ways to do that is to change the way we move around the city, encouraging public transport, cycling and walking as preferred ways of getting around.“By , we would like to see % of all journeys made by sustainable forms of transport. To do that we will need to double the number of people travelling by bike or by bus. To achieve this, we need better infrastructure which is managed by an integrated, intelligent transport system.“It would act as the nerve centre ensuring bus corridors, cycleways and improved pedestrian crossings and pavements are recognised as a key part of the network, and helping to make travel on Cardf’s roads as efficient as possible.”One goal in the new policy is integrated ticketing, which would see people taking public transport be able to use the same ticket for a train and a bus, similar to in London..removeA new traffic control centre would be built for council staff, emergency services, bus and train companies, and enforcement officers. The new control centre would help monitor traffic across the city, respond to incidents quicker, reducing congestion.The A will pilot a ‘smart corridor’ scheme with buses given priority over cars. If successful, these could be rolled out on other main roads in Cardf.A public consultation on the intelligent transport system is expected to take place in summer, before getting signed off by the cabinet in autumn.Cllr Wild added: “Through the development of the transport user app, integrated ticketing and smart technology, residents and commuters will be better informed, so they themselves can make informed decisions on the best way to travel on any given day at any given time.“Our draft strategy looks at the use of data and technology to reduce congestion, incentivise active travel to make our highway network more efficient, and will help deal with incidents on the highway more effectively.“The opening of the bus station in  will act as a trigger point to implement new services and technology, so it is important that we do this work now.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityPre-election surveys showed liberal Lee Jae-myung, an ex-governor of South Korea’s most populous Gyeonggi province, and his main conservative challenger, former prosecutor-general Yoon Suk Yeol, with neck-and-neck support, way ahead of  other contenders.The winner will take office in May and serve a single five-year term as leader of the world’s th-largest economy.Mr Lee and Mr Yoon conducted one of the most bitter political campaigns in recent memory.Both recently agreed thatthey won they would not carry out politically motivated investigations against the other, but many believe the losing candidate could still face criminal probes over some of the scandals in which they are implicated. vw,vw,px, px\"Lee Jae-myung, the presidential candidate of the ruling Democratic Party, on the campaign trail in Incheon, South Korea Critics say neither candidate has presented a clear strategy on how they would ease the threat from North Korea and its nuclear weapons.They also say voters are sceptical about how both would handle international relations amid the US-China rivalry and how they would address widening economic inequality and runaway housing prices.“Despite the signicance of this year’s election, the race has centred too much on negative campaigning,” said Jang Seung-Jin, a professor at Seoul’s Kookmin University, adding that neither leading candidate laid out a convincing blueprint on how they would lead South Korea.The election comes as South Korea has been grappling with a Covid- surge driven by the Omicron iant. On Wednesday, South Korea’s health authorities reported , new virus cases, another record high.After voting began at am, mask-wearing voters waited in long queues at some polling stations before putting on vinyl gloves or using hand sanitiser to cast ballots. People infected with coronavirus were to vote after regular polling ended on Wednesday evening..removeAbout  million South Koreans aged  or older are eligible to vote, out of the country’s  million people. About  million cast ballots during early voting last week.Turnout was more than % seven hours into voting on Wednesday, when including early voting ballots, the National Election Commission said. vw,vw,px, px\"People queue to cast their votes in the presidential election at a polling station in Seoul Election officials said vote-counting may take longer than usual because of the extended voting time for Covid patients and that the winner may not be clear until early Thursday.Ahead of the vote, Jeong Eun-yeong, a -year-old Seoul resident, said she was agonising over which candidate is “the lesser of two evils”.“Nobody around me seems happy about voting” for either Mr Lee or Mr Yoon, she said. “We need a leader who would be really devoted to improving the lives of working-class citizens.”While both candidates share some similar economic and welfare policies, they have clashed over North Korea and other foreign policy issues.Mr Lee, who has often expressed nationalistic views, is calling for exemptions to UN sanctions so that dormant inter-Korean economic projects can be revived, and hopes to mediate between Pyongyang and Washington over the North Korean nuclear crisis.Mr Yoon has said he will sternly deal with North Korean provocations and seek to boost trilateral security co-operation with Washington and Tokyo. vw,vw,px, px\"South Koreans are voting for a new president, with an outspoken liberal ruling party candidate and a conservative ex-prosecutor considered the favourites On confrontation between Washington, Seoul’s top military ally, and Beijing, its biggest trading partner, Mr Lee said picking a side would pose a greater security threat to South Korea. Mr Yoon wants to place a priority on an enhanced alliance with the United States.After North Korea’s latest reported ballistic missile launch on Saturday, Mr Yoon accused North Korean leader Kim Jong Un of trying to influence the results of the South Korean election in favour of Mr Lee.“I wouldhim some manners and make him come to his senses completely,” he told a rally near Seoul.Mr Lee wrote on Facebook that he will push for a diplomatic solution to North Korean nuclear tensions but will not tolerate any act that would raise animosity.South Korea’s constitution limits a president to a single five-year term, so Mr Lee’s party colleague, President Moon Jae-in, cannot seek re-election.Mr Moon came to power in  after conservative president Park Geun-hye was impeached and ousted from office over a huge corruption scandal.With conservatives initially in shambles after Ms Park’s fall, Mr Moon’s approval rating at one point hit % as he pushed hard to achieve reconciliation with North Korea and delve into alleged corruption by past conservative leaders.He eventually faced a strong backlash as talks on North Korea’s nuclear programme faltered and his anti-corruption drive raised questions of fairness. vw,vw,px, px\"A voter casts a ballot in the presidential election at a polling station in Seoul Mr Yoon had been Mr Moon’s prosecutor-general but resigned and joined the opposition last year following infighting over probes of Mr Moon’s allies. Mr Yoon said those investigations were objective and principled, but Mr Moon’s supporters said he was trying to thwart Mr Moon’s prosecution reforms and elevate his own political standing.Mr Yoon’s critics have also attacked him over a lack of experience in party politics, foreign policy and other key state affairs. He has responded that he would let experienced officials handle state affairs that require expertise.Mr Lee, a former human rights lawyer who entered local politics in , has established an image as a tough-speaking, anti-elitist who can get things done and fix establishment politics, but his opponents call him a dangerous populist relying on isions and demonising opponents.Mr Yoon has launched a political offensive against Mr Lee over allegations that he is a key figure in a corrupt land development project launched in the city of Seongnam when he was mayor there. Mr Lee has tried to link Mr Yoon to that scandal. Both of their wives have offered public apologies over separate scandals.Some experts say that whoever wins is likely to struggle to bridge conservative-liberal isions.“Both candidates have failed to create their own, distinctive images because they became absorbed in party allegiances amid partisan animosity, so the race was defined by negative campaigning,” said Shin Yul, a politics professor at Seoul’s Myongji University.“Whoever wins will be tasked with an important but dficult task of healing the isions.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: South Koreans vote for new president after tight and bitter election race article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityFrom ice cream cone creations to vegan and gluten-free chocolate, I wanted to see which Aldi products are genuinely worth buying and whether the more luxurious, grand designs were good value.I must place a disclaimer here, I am a big fan of simple eggs made with tasty, good quality chocolate.For me, it isnt about novelty designs, chocolate shards spiking out and the price tags to match.So when I took a look at Aldis Easter selection, I decided my mission was to find an egg that looks great but tastes even better.One product that really intrigued me was Dairyfines chocolate ice cream egg- a blonde chocolate and wafer cone topped with a milk chocolate scoop, finished with mini eggs and biscuit crumb, as well as a popping candy cone base.Resembling the popular Cornetto ice cream, I was genuinely amazed by the attention to detail when I reached the end of the cone and discovered chocolate-covered popping candy and milk chocolate.It was a real treat to eat and I think Id have been bouncing off the walls in joy I received this as a kid.The one thing that really struck me about Aldis Easter egg offering was the effective use of recyclable materials, leaving you guilt-free when it comes to packaging. Not even the ice cream egg was covered in excess single-use plastic.The cone tasted almost like Caramac -thats a sweet up your street, this is the egg for you. The dferent combinations of chocolate and salty biscuit crumbs sprinkled on top left my sweet tooth feeling more than satisfied.  With the chocolate ice cream egg, you really have a bit of everything and I think its a worthwhile purchase.Salted caramel Easter eggsThere is one major theme in Aldis Easter egg and chocolate collection for : salted caramel. Some of Aldis salted caramel options, pictured. I recruited a salted caramel expert, otherwise known as my boyfriend, to help review the full salted caramel selection. .removeI thought salted caramel was something that didnt really y in quality - yet some of these eggs really stood out as the best. In my humble opinion, one of the best chocolate eggs from Aldi is the Moser Roth salted caramel egg  with hidden truffles, part of the Free From range.Despite not containing milk, egg, wheat and gluten, it gives out little bursts of salted caramel flavours with every bite and it wasnt overly rich. It would have been easy to eat the whole egg in one sitting, not to mention the tempting truffles hiding inside the box. For serious salted caramel fans, the ChocoChanger salted caramel eggis the choice to go for.From the moment you open the box, a strong aroma of caramel jumps out while the chocolate pops with creamy, salty sweetness.One of the more surprising salted caramel items was the rich, vegan, dark Belgian chocolate office bunnies- you couldnt have too many but one every so often would really hit the spot.Moser Roths luxury egg box from Aldi. If salted caramel is your idea of heaven, Id definitely recommend heading to Aldi for a browse. One of the most delicious chocolate treats from Aldi was the indulgent assortment of hand decorated chocolate eggs  with dferent types of fillings.From dark chocolate orange and speculoos to pistachio and macadamia, these chocolates are definitely ones youll struggle not to eat in one go. The flavours really worked well together - an ideal choice for people who love dferent types of chocolate and something visually appealing. One tasted like sticky toffee pudding while the raspberry chocolate had such delicate berry hints - absolutely perfect.Hazelnut filled eggs and hazelnut chocolate rabbits from Aldi. Now Im not the biggest hazelnut fan but Aldi has played an absolute blinder with this flavour in .Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny  leaves you with no words, just \"Mmmm\". Adorned with a cute green bow and bunny charm, the bunny looked great and tasted even better than you could expect.The smooth chocolate melts in your mouth while the hazelnut really hits the spot. If you love Ferrero Rocher, you need to try Aldis mouthwatering crispy hazelnut luxury filled eggs .A mix between Nutella and Ferrero Rocher, these chocolate eggs have a biscuity yet smooth texture with a gorgeous nutty aftertaste. Meanwhile, the Moser Roth Belgian milk and dark chocolate almond eggwas something unique, featuring salted almond butter.The combination of sweet yet salty almond butter with two types of chocolate was well balanced - though it did have a strong aftertaste, meaning its not one for those who can take or leave almond.There was just one Easter egg which left me wanting a little bit more than I got: the Dairyfine Chunky Egg Fruit and Nut .This chocolate egg is described as a thick Belgian milk chocolate egg packed with fruit and nut pieces - a combination Ive been known to enjoy.The chocolate didnt taste as special while the nuts were rather small and didnt have the crunch I yearned for. Saying that, it might be down to personal choice and you could completely disagree.The verdict: Which Aldi chocolate Easter eggs are worth buying From the selection I tried, there are three clear winners: Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny, Moser Roths Free From salted caramel egg with hidden truffles and the Dairyfine chocolate ice cream egg.You can browse the full Easter egg collection from Aldi via the website hereThe Aldi website has even more eggs on offer - featuring cookies and cream, Eton mess and chocolate orange flavours"},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/national/uk-today/19973551.taron-egerton-shares-health-update-collapsing-stage-west-end-play/res","title":"taron egerton shares health update collapsing stage west end play","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.
