Some of these products might appeal to teenagers but if they are under age they cannot buy it from us.  Meanwhile Juul, one of the world\u0027s biggest vaping companies, has attacked the sale of e-cigarettes with flavours that appeal to children, saying it would never sell flavours such as \u0027gummy bear\u0027 or \u0027cotton candy\u0027 which are \u0027clearly\u0027 targeted at kids.Among Mr Walker\u0027s range are bottles that look like Haribo sweet packets, blueberry jam flavour, cookies and Sours based on Sourz sweet fizzy drinks. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of ASH (Action on Smoking and Health) has called for the products to be banned.She told Mail Online: \u0027I\u0027d warn anyone who sees McVapes for sale not to buy them as they\u0027re not on the list of notified products and that means that there\u0027s no guarantee they meet the necessary standards and they shouldn\u0027t be on sale in the UK.\u0027I\u0027m concerned as well that whoever\u0027s selling them may well not be checking that they\u0027re not selling to under 18s which is also illegal.

Its sales rose to £71m from £59m in the previous year.The industry\u0027s claim that vaping brings benefits to health - especially in young people - is hotly disputed.          Those who are attracted to colourful packaging like this and experiment with e-cigarettes are at higher risk of smoking within two years than those who have never tried it, studies found          Mr Walker, who sells thousands of McVapes, added: \u0027We don\u0027t sell to under 18s.

He was last spotted exercising at the Meadows Rehab Centre in Wickenburg, Arizona, last yearBut the real drama lies elsewhere. For despite being one of Hollywood’s most recognisable stars, Spacey has apparently disappeared off-screen as well as on it.Nothing has been seen or heard of the double Oscar-winning actor since the first allegations emerged over a year ago in October 2017.On both sides of the Atlantic, where Spacey owns multi-million-pound homes, the question is being asked with growing urgency: where is Kevin Spacey? ‘He’s become a total recluse,’ one friend told The Mail on Sunday.‘No one has heard from him. He’s vanished. It’s almost unbelievable that someone of his stature can pull it off in a world where everyone has a cell phone.’One producer described Spacey as having ‘one of the most recognisable faces on the planet’ and added: ‘I was with him when he walked into a restaurant in Beverly Hills and the whole place applauded.’It may be a long time before he garners applause again.His downfall began on October 29, 2017, when Star Trek actor Anthony Rapp accused Spacey of sexually assaulting him in the star’s New York apartment in 1986 when Rapp was just 14, triggering a string of similar complaints.          As the new series of the US political drama House Of Cards was screened earlier this month there was a gaping hole. President Frank Underwood, portrayed  by actor Kevin Spacey was killed off by uneasy producers and script writers following sexual assault and harassment allegations made against the actor  last yearTo date, 30 men have made public allegations about the actor. While no formal charges have been filed, police in LA and London are investigating allegations of sexual assault, including rape. In the UK, there are six active investigations. The Old Vic theatre in London, where Spacey was artistic director for 11 years until 2015, said it had received 20 complaints of inappropriate behaviour during his tenure.Spacey issued a swift and contrite apology, ended years of rumours about his sexuality by ‘coming out’ as gay and checked into sex rehab clinic The Meadows in Arizona alongside disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.But unlike Weinstein – who has been photographed going about his daily business, visiting his lawyers’ offices and picking his children up from school – there has been no sign of Spacey anywhere.The Mail on Sunday has spoken to – or attempted to speak to – dozens of Spacey’s friends, colleagues and acquaintances in the UK and the US in an attempt to piece together his movements.Final season of House of Cards gets middling reviews as...\u0027It brought the #MeToo movement very close to home\u0027: Tom...Share this articleBut it is clear that Spacey’s vanishing act may be his best coup de théâtre so far.The last known pictures of the actor are fuzzy paparazzi shots taken at the £25,000-a-month rehab facility in November last year.There, Spacey was supposed to undergo a 45-day sex addiction ‘detox’ but, we can reveal, checked out after only 21 days.‘He left early,’ said one friend, on condition of anonymity. ‘He only stuck it out for three weeks.’Where he went after that remains unclear – although there are plenty of associates who claim to know where he is.One well-connected British socialite who knew Spacey during his Old Vic days insists that he is living in seclusion in the Cook Islands, a string of 15 tiny islands in the middle of the South Pacific.‘He’s living as a hermit in the Cook Islands,’ she said authoritatively. ‘He’s keeping his head down until this blows over.     One well-connected British socialite who knew Spacey during his Old Vic days said he is living in seclusion in the Cook IslandsHe still has a lot of rich friends from his Old Vic days. He has enough money to stay hidden.’But a source who worked on House Of Cards insists that the actor, whose real name is Kevin Spacey Fowler, is in hiding in France.‘He’s been in the South of France living on a big estate,’ the man said. ‘He’s been working out like crazy, doing massive oil paintings and keeping a low profile.’It may well be, sources say, that he has put his formidable acting prowess to good use in order to avoid detection.One source said: ‘Kevin is travelling under his real name of Kevin Fowler.’ Intriguingly, the source added: ‘I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s not been seen because he is going out in public wearing a disguise. He’s spent his life transforming himself into other characters – why not now?’Certainly, the star has not been seen at any of the homes in his international property portfolio.Spacey is said to have visited New York since the scandal broke but stayed with a ‘wealthy friend’ connected with the theatre world.A doorman at Spacey’s former Manhattan home – now sold – said: ‘We’ve not seen him here for a long time, well before the scandal.’Another former associate suggested he is ‘hiding in plain sight’ in a rented ranch in Thousand Oaks, a suburb of Los Angeles which recently suffered a double tragedy of a mass shooting and a wildfire.‘Kevin’s been staying at a friend’s place in Thousand Oaks,’ the associate said. ‘He’s become a hermit and never goes out.’The actor has also not been seen at his £2.3 million London flat.With the exception of Spacey’s estranged brother Randy, not one person was prepared to go on the record to discuss the star.One person who worked closely with Spacey claims to have received a call from the actor in which he was ‘genuinely baffled that everyone has turned their backs on him’.‘He doesn’t understand why no one has stuck up for him,’ the colleague said. ‘He sounded quite indignant.’But no one else, it seems, is surprised. ‘It’s typical Hollywood, no one will say a word about him because he’s just too toxic,’ his elder brother Randy, 62, said yesterday. ‘My brother was always an arrogant p**** and now karma has come round to bite him in the butt.‘He was the goose who kept laying the golden eggs, so people protected him. Of course people close to him knew about his extra-curricular activities, but while he was making money they turned a blind eye.’Randy has had no contact with his famous sibling for 15 years after giving an interview about their childhood which he says sent his ‘control freak’ brother ‘ballistic’. But he says he believes that Spacey is ‘lying low’ in the belief the ‘water will cool’.

We even had an office Christmas party come down and visit us. It was incredible.\u0027 Every year the couple nominate three charities to benefit from the donations they receive from parents who visit with their children.They have been doing the display for 10 years and over that time they have raised thousands for a variety of animals charities.This year they are raising money for the PDSA and local charities, Roger\u0027s Wildlife Rescue and Kitty in the City.Mr Farnes said: \u0027Last year we raised £1,000 and we hope to do the same again this year.\u0027           Lyn Farnes with her nine-year-old daughter Roni-Jo outside their home in Hove, East Sussex, showcasing last year\u0027s display. Every year the couple nominate three charities to benefit from the donations they receive from parents who visit with their children"},{"url":null,"title":"Little Louis affectionately grabs Prince Charles face never seen photographs","story":"    The newly-released photos show Prince Charles enjoying his 70th birthday celebrations, pictured here with his youngest grandson Louis      Pick polka dots like the Duchess of Cambridge in Alessandra RichSold out!

No one at the General Medical Council, the watchdog responsible for vetting the background of medics, checked whether her documentation was genuineIt meant that for more than two decades from 1995, Alemi was free to treat thousands of mental health patients in the NHS, apparently prescribing medicine, making assessments and even sectioning some of the most vulnerable in society.The deception by Alemi, thought to be of Iranian extraction, was only discovered after she was convicted of trying to fake the will of an elderly woman to steal her £1.3 million fortune. A judge described her as \u0027despicable\u0027 and jailed her for five years last month.The Daily Mail learned about the GMC\u0027s review after being alerted by an investigation into Alemi\u0027s background by Carlisle\u0027s News and Star newspaper.Children as young as TEN are having hip and knee...NHS \u0027let down\u0027 aristocrat Lady Beth Douglas, 18, who died of...Share this articleThe fraudster, who could have earned up to £100,000 a year working as an NHS psychiatrist, enjoyed the trappings of wealth – buying bottles of expensive champagne as investments and driving a red Lotus Elise sports car.It is understood that when she came here, Alemi showed officials a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery certificate.In reality, her only qualification was a degree in human biology.Last night patients\u0027 groups called for a public inquiry as police confirmed their investigation into Alemi was ongoing. John Woodcock, independent MP for Barrow and Furness, in the Lake District, where Alemi was most recently working, said the case was \u0027hugely alarming\u0027.           Alemi, who could have earned up to £100,000 a year working as an NHS psychiatrist, had also been investigated in 2012 after failing to disclose a conviction for careless driving\u0027If this had been one inidual that had slipped through the net it would have been concerning, but the idea that it could be a systemic loophole that has been exploited is hugely alarming,\u0027 he said. \u0027It is understandable that patients are calling for an inquiry – this is of sufficient magnitude that that may well be necessary.\u0027The GMC admitted its checks had been inadequate and confirmed an \u0027urgent investigation\u0027 was looking into the backgrounds of 3,000 doctors who came to work from Commonwealth countries, before 2003, in the same way.Incredibly, Alemi had been investigated and given an official warning by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in 2012 after failing to disclose a conviction for careless driving.She also sectioned psychiatric patients for treatment without the authority to do so, and was banned from working for 12 months as a consequence. Despite this, no one thought to examine her background or the reliability of her qualifications.One woman, who claimed one of her relatives had been poorly treated by the fake psychiatrist, wrote on Facebook: \u0027The way she (Alemi) treated my relative was appalling and now that I find she was not a qualified psychiatrist, and was allowed to treat patients for 22 years, I am beyond livid.\u0027Joyce Robins, of Patient Concern, said it seemed \u0027incredible\u0027 that someone could slip through the net in such a fashion. She added: \u0027There definitely needs to be a public inquiry – how many patients will she have come into contact with? Patients will be horrified that the proper checks weren\u0027t in place.\u0027GMC chief executive Charlie Massey said the doctors being checked represented just 1 per cent of the 300,000 medics on the register and that vetting was much more rigorous today than it was in the 1990s.But he admitted: \u0027It is extremely concerning that a person used a fraudulent qualification to join the register.\u0027 Last night, the GMC could not say exactly where Alemi had worked during her career, although she is understood to have had links to West Yorkshire, Lancashire and Scotland.She was working as a locum old-age psychiatrist at Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust in 2016 when she met 84-year-old Gillian Belham.Alemi befriended Mrs Belham, but when she was accused of stealing watches from the pensioner, police discovered she had been working to take control of her finances – even deceiving some of her friends into being signatories on a new will. The Cumbria trust said it had launched a review.The Department of Health said: \u0027We expect the GMC to investigate how this criminal was able to register as a doctor and put measures in place to make sure it can\u0027t happen again.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"The law change make marriages legal says polyamorous woman","story":"    Mary Crumpton is polyamorous - meaning she believes in having more than one partner. Mary  made a lifetime commitment to John Hulls (left) earlier this year despite being married to Tim Crumpton (right) People who are polyamorous consent to their partner\u0027s being in a relationship with somebody else.Naturally Mary\u0027s husband Tim Crumpton gave her his blessing to be married and even walked Mary down the aisle of the special blessing ceremony. Mary lives with Tim and John under the same roof in Chorlton, Manchester and is in equally committed and loving relationships with both of them.What\u0027s more Mary also has two boyfriends who live nearby and if any of her partners wanted to start seeing another woman at the same time, she\u0027d be happy for them.Although Mary is married to both Tim and John, it\u0027s only her commitment to Tim which is legally recognised. Mary\u0027s situation has spurred her to try and change the law and she it now is getting ready to lobby for new marriage rules. \u0027John was already living with me and Tim before John and I had our ceremony,\u0027 explains Mary, 45.\u0027He moved in with us in 2015 so we\u0027d already got into a stable and happy domestic situation, so it\u0027s not changed anything practically, but it has changed things emotionally for me.\u0027It\u0027s lovely to be able to feel that I\u0027ve made that commitment to John, so that he\u0027s not \u0027in second place\u0027 any more.\u0027We got to the point where John and I both felt that we wanted to make that lifetime commitment, but obviously in this country you can\u0027t marry more than one person.\u0027Tim was fully supportive of mine and John\u0027s commitment to one another.\u0027 Mary and John\u0027s ceremony took place at Chorlton Unitarian Church. They made vows to each other, and Tim and John made extra vows, promising to honour and respect Mary\u0027s commitment to the other man.\u0027The church is very forward thinking, they were the first to do homosexual marriages and civil partnerships so they are very inclusive and respectful of ersity,\u0027 says Mary.\u0027I went to the church and said that I\u0027d like to have a wedding with John. I told them I knew it wouldn\u0027t be a legal wedding, but I wanted it to be a wedding in every other respect.\u0027They ran it by the committee and everyone was fully supportive.\u0027That\u0027s quite an amazing thing because as far as I know, it\u0027s the first polyamorous wedding ceremony that\u0027s happened in a church in the UK.\u0027People have had handfastings in fields, but an actual church saying yes we will do this for the first time, we\u0027ve made history and I\u0027m proud of that.I hope that other churches will follow on.\u0027The way we did it, with the help of a minister, Laura Dobson, we structured a service, with a walk down the aisle, the white dress.\u0027There wasn\u0027t a dry eye in the house! Everyone was really moved by the whole thing.\u0027We kept a lot of the things that are in a normal service, we kept all those normal wordings in - we promised lifetime commitment. Clearly we weren\u0027t going to say excluding others because I\u0027m married to Tim as well!\u0027It was lovely, having all the family there and everybody being so supportive. There were lots of people who\u0027d never seen anything like this before and got used to it through seeing it happen, coming up afterwards saying: \u0027Mary that was amazing, I didn\u0027t get it before but I can see that it\u0027s really working for you\u0027 so that was lovely.\u0027Since then everything has been great. Tim and John get on great, they\u0027ll go off on bicycle rides together - they joke that I\u0027m a bit of a wild one and it takes two of them to keep me in line!\u0027          Mary at her wedding to second husband John earlier this year          Mary\u0027s two wedding rings. Mary is lobbying for a law change that allows people to be married to more than one personMary is keen to push for change to marriage laws so John has the same legal rights as Tim, who she married in 2013.\u0027In our hearts, he is my second husband, I have two husbands, but clearly legally, Tim\u0027s the only one,\u0027 says Mary.\u0027There are plenty of people in my situation who have more than one partner they would like to commit to for life, be it same sex or different sex, and we\u0027ve got a lot of Muslims in our country now and I don\u0027t quite know how it works if they bring their wives here, maybe they have to pick one to be their legal wife, and I don\u0027t think that\u0027s fair.\u0027I think that I want to have a country where we respect people\u0027s choices, in terms of their relationships and if that means that a Muslim man wants to marry three women and have those women respected in law as his wives, he should be able to do so.\u0027And if I want to have two husbands, then I\u0027d like that to be respected in law as well, and I don\u0027t see any reason why it shouldn\u0027t be.\u0027At the moment, because I\u0027m not legally married to John as well as to Tim, if I was knocked down by a bus tomorrow and was in hospital, Tim would be my next of kin and gets to make all the decisions and John would not be recognised.\u0027Clearly Tim and John are close and therefore of course Tim would consult John, but if they disagreed about a decision, what would happen then?Google executive leaves the company with no severance after...Me, my husband and my boyfriend: Woman, 34, shares her bed...Share this articleJohn\u0027s rights are not respected. \u0027Other things like, if I die and I haven\u0027t made a will, everything would go to Tim and John would get nothing. I have to make a will to make sure everything gets split between them.\u0027But if I\u0027d been able to legally marry John as well as Tim, then I wouldn\u0027t have to go that extra mile, it would just be automatic.\u0027There\u0027s things like that, where John has no legal rights because I can\u0027t marry him legally and that upsets me, and there are a lot of people in the country that this affects, who are in a similar situation, who are having to do work-arounds to make sure that any partner they are not married to get fully respected.\u0027I would really like to see a change in the law. We\u0027ve done marriage for people in homosexual relationships, this is the next thing that needs to happen.\u0027I think there needs to be a big campaign, people need to write to their          Mary and Timothy Crumpton who walked her down the aisle at her second marriageMPs, get the issue raised in parliament and go from there really.\u0027That\u0027s my target for next year, do some research and get as many people on board as possible to make it happen.\u0027There\u0027s lots of people who aren\u0027t polyamorous but know people who are, and I\u0027ve said this to them and they say absolutely, quite right, you should have your other relationship respected and legalised, that\u0027s perfectly reasonable.\u0027I think there\u0027s lots of people from the Muslim community who would be in favour as well. I think the next thing is put together a team of people and try to take the campaign forward.\u0027The first thing was lets talk about it, lets get other people talking about it and get it more accepted and less judged, and go from there. So watch this space.\u0027Mary says there are more people living in polyamorous relationships in the UK than people might realise.\u0027There are lots of people living like this, there\u0027s a UK poly group, there\u0027s a Manchester poly meet-up group, people get together. They have confidentiality rules because a lot of people haven\u0027t told their families or workplaces.\u0027When I first started looking into it I thought there wouldn\u0027t be anybody, but there\u0027s loads of people.\u0027The Manchester polyamorous community is quite big, they have meet ups a couple of times a month, there\u0027s a lot more people living this way than you would imagine.\u0027You could have a married couple next door, and you think they are going out with a friend but actually it\u0027s their partner, because they are discreet about it.\u0027Since Mary last spoke out about polyamory, Tim has started seeing someone, but far from being jealous, Mary says she is pleased that her husband is happy, and would give her blessing to any of her partners if they wanted to pursue relationships with more women.\u0027They are very welcome to (have other relationships). My husband Tim has recently started seeing a new lady, and that\u0027s going really well,\u0027 says Mary.\u0027They\u0027ve all been on dates occasionally but not really developed any relationships particularly.\u0027This is the first time Tim has formed a bond with someone, so hopefully this one will pan out. I\u0027m very, very pleased for him. It\u0027s very exciting.\u0027I think jealousy arises because of fear of losing somebody.\u0027My relationship with Tim is so good, and I know that we love each other so much that I don\u0027t feel in the slightest bit threatened by him falling in love with someone else.\u0027I know it\u0027s not going to affect him and me at all. Knowing that, I can just sit back and be really pleased for him that he has some extra happiness in his life.\u0027It\u0027s no different to if he\u0027d joined a darts team and was suddenly going out every week to play darts, I\u0027d be pleased he had a new interest.\u0027I see him having a new partner as the same thing, I\u0027m pleased he\u0027s got something new in his life, bringing him some joy.\u0027I know the person and she\u0027s lovely so I could not be happier, I\u0027m really happy to finally see him having that as well.\u0027I\u0027ve had the joy of being in love with more than one person and he\u0027d been open to it but it hadn\u0027t really happened, so to see him exploring that is just great.\u0027People are used to the idea of you having a second child, if you have a second child it doesn\u0027t mean you love the first one any less so people understand that love is not a limited resource.\u0027I just say, romantic love works the same way as that kind of love, I can love more than one person at the same time, actually, a lot of people can.          Mary lives with Tim and John under the same roof in Chorlton, Manchester and is in equally committed and loving relationships with both of them\u0027A lot of people have been in that situation of being in a relationship with one partner and loving someone else, and they either pretend that they haven\u0027t got those feelings, or they have an affair, neither of which are great outcomes.\u0027A lot of people do understand is that it is possible to love more than one person, the only difference is people in my situation talk about it and find a way to make it work.\u0027As for whether or not she\u0027d consider another relationship herself in future, Mary is thinking practically.\u0027Even though I say love is not a limited resource, time is. There are only seven days in a week, to try to have more partners than that would be a challenge,\u0027 she says.\u0027I suppose if you had a partner who was long distance, who you only saw once a month then maybe.\u0027I always say never say never. If Prince Charming walks in tomorrow and I fall in love with him I\u0027ll just have to find a way round that.\u0027I do know people who are in polyamorous relationships who have six or seven partners, but that\u0027s generally partners who are not all living together, because time is an issue.\u0027For me it\u0027s really important that I am giving quality time to everybody I\u0027m involved with.\u0027If you have too many partners, to my mind, for me, I would find it difficult to do justice to the relationships so it\u0027s about having that balance of allowing love to blossom and flourish where you find it, but equally being sensible about how much time you have got, how much you can commit to.\u0027Mary wants to carry on being open about polyamory, as she feels many people still don\u0027t really understand what it\u0027s all about.\u0027I\u0027ve been called a slag. People would find out and say: \u0027Oh, you\u0027ve got two men, that\u0027s disgusting and perverted\u0027 so I can understand why people feel they have to hide it,\u0027 says Mary.\u0027I thought someone needs to stand up and say \u0027this is how some of us live, and it\u0027s okay\u0027.\u0027I knew there would be some backlash, it has in some ways been a challenging thing to do but I felt someone had to do it.\u0027A lot of people have the wrong idea about it, they think it\u0027s all leaping into bed with people, sleeping around.\u0027There are some people who do that, there\u0027s a whole community of swingers, and that\u0027s what some people do and there\u0027s nothing wrong with that. That\u0027s fine, it\u0027s just not me.\u0027It\u0027s about love. Although I have more than one partner, I am quite old fashioned, I don\u0027t just go straight in with people, I have to know that I am in love with someone before I am fully intimate.\u0027That\u0027s something people didn\u0027t understand, they thought: \u0027Oh you just want to s**g around\u0027. There\u0027s nothing wrong with that, it\u0027s just not me.\u0027I want genuine love and relationships with more than one person at a time.\u0027          After she first spoke to the M.E.N about her lifestyle, Mary was overwhelmed by messages from people from the UK and beyond, after the story was picked up by the international media.Most of them thanked her for speaking out, as it enabled them to tell their families and friends that they are also polyamorous.But it did not come without its downsides, with Mary even receiving death threats from people who did not agree with her lifestyle.\u0027It was a bit mad, I got so many messages, literally hundreds of private messages on Facebook from people tracking me down,\u0027 says Mary.\u0027It was overwhelmingly positive, but there were some negative. I had death threats: \u0027What you are doing is immoral and against God\u0027s law, I\u0027m going to come to your house and kill you.\u0027\u0027One guy even found out where I live, took a photo of my front door and sent it to me with a message saying: \u0027I wasn\u0027t joking, I\u0027m going to kill you tonight.\u0027\u0027Before I had a chance to do anything about it, he deleted the account so it was untraceable. So yeah I put the chain on that night!\u0027That\u0027s one of the reasons I chose to speak out about it, because we live in a world where if someone is doing something a bit different, people are very judgemental.\u0027But people used to be very judgemental about being homosexual, but now it\u0027s so much accepted - people know that people fancy people of the same sex- and I think that\u0027s where we need to get to with different relationship styles.\u0027We need to get to a point where people just say: \u0027Okay, you happen to be polyamorous, you\u0027re monogamous, we\u0027re all just living our lives and if people understand how it works, that\u0027s the first step.\u0027I got people from all over the world messaging saying thank you for speaking out, saying: \u0027I showed this article to my dad then told him I was the same way.\u0027\u0027I think I managed to explain it quite well so people could see it\u0027s not some weird, perverted cult. It just so happens that I love more than one person, and that\u0027s okay.\u0027]  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/16/4DE1F7CB00000578-0-image-a-149_1530633320806.jpg","title":"Lingerie tycoon Tory peer spoken just THREE TIMES three years House Lords","story":"    June 17: At a yacht race with boyfriend Doug Barrowman, in white T-shirt, three days before missing a vote on the EU Withdrawal Bill          January 10: With fighter Conor McGregor while the Lords debated the Data Protection Bill and domestic abuse legislation          Wimbledon: July 15 -  Enjoying the tennis in a month when she did not attend the Lords once out of 15 days when the chamber was sittingOut of a total of 457 sitting days in the House of Lords since she entered the House, she has attended just 89 – less than two every ten working days.From June to December last year, she attended five days out of a possible 74, and has only ever spoken in the Lords three times, including her maiden speech.But she regularly travels the world to make paid speeches at business summits, occasionally using a backdrop featuring her title, Baroness Mone of Mayfair OBE.Her title has also appeared on literature for a venture capital firm she set up with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.Last week, she jetted off to the Males and promoted a luxury villa to her Twitter and Instagram followers, missing key debates on Monday and Wednesday on counter terrorism and border security.After being contacted by the Daily Mail, on Saturday she posted pictures from her ‘long-deserved romantic’ Males break, but said she would be in the Lords today.Police say woman, 82, found dead in her flat may have fled...Mother who was told by her doctor she would miscarry says a...Bomb scare at Houston airport after Boy Scout, 17, packs...Share this article    November 16: Topping up her tan just days after missing Lords debates on counter terrorism and border securityBaroness Mone, who lives with billionaire businessman Doug Barrowman on the Isle of Man, is also under fire for claiming the maximum £300-a-day Lords attendance allowance.

Disney has released a series of original sketches of Mickey Mouse and his cartoon friends to celebrate 90 years of the world\u0027s most popular mouse. This sketch was used for the first ever Mickey story to hit the small screen. Steamboat Willie, broadcast in 1928, showed the cheeky mouse chugging down a river on a boat, whistling while he worked, getting into Tom \u0026amp Jerry-esque mischief with the bear-like Captain Pete, the ship\u0027s parrot, and a passing cow. It was an immediate hit and the film catapulted Mickey into the limelight, with similar releases quick to follow Heartwarming moment woman left disabled in motorcycle crash...National Trust sparks anger by hiring marksmen to shoot wild...Grey seal mother stays close to her adorable newborn pup as...Share this articleDisney\u0027s first standalone character was Oswald The Lucky Rabbit in the 1920s. But in 1928 the rights to the character were taken by Universal Studios, who claimed him for their own.It was only in response to the row that Mickey came into being. A few tweaks to the Oswald model – an elongated nose, shorter, rounder ears – and Mortimer Mouse was born. But after a frank conversation with his wife Lillian, Disney renamed his creation Mickey. When he started out each cartoon required 15,000 drawings on some 30 different backgrounds, and took Disney\u0027s team of animators anywhere from six months to two years to create. Until 1946, Disney provided Mickey\u0027s squeaky, helium-like voice himself, something in which he took great pride.Their first recorded cartoon was Plane Crazy – an aerial caper featuring loop-the-loops and bloomers used as parachutes – but the first to screen was 1928\u0027s Steamboat Willie. It was an immediate hit and the film catapulted Mickey into the limelight, with more releases quickly following.Right from his opening scenes, Mickey was a mouse with a spouse. Mickey\u0027s 90th birthday also marks his and Minnie Mouse\u0027s 90th anniversary, and though their marital status has been the source of some speculation, Disney stated that they were wed \u0027in secret\u0027.            Mickey at 90: This sketch, originally entitled Mickey\u0027s Amateur Concert, was drawn in colour by Walt Disney in the 1930s to depict his mouse character hosting an amateur talent show. The writing at the top of the sketch reads: \u0027Okay, okay the next amateur is... quack quack\u0027 Within a few years of his debut, Mickey-awareness rivalled that of Charlie Chaplin and he was brought to life in colour for the first time in The Band Concert in 1935 using a new, technicolour film process. But fame can change mice just as much as people, and Mickey\u0027s success was so massive that his eccentricities became liabilities.In order to maintain his appeal, Mickey\u0027s negative qualities were stripped away, leaving a mouse so straight-laced and saintly that some argued he had become bland.  In 1949, Disney himself admitted the problem: \u0027Mickey grew into such a legend that we couldn\u0027t gag around with him\u0027.1934 brought the debut of Mickey\u0027s anything-but-bland frenemy Donald Duck, whose hare-brained schemes and boisterous temper tantrums picked up where Mickey left off. Between 1941 and 1965, Donald starred in 109 Disney shorts Mickey in just 14.Mickey\u0027s filmography dropped off a cliff (1983\u0027s A Mickey Christmas Carol would be his first film in 30 years), but he still had an entertainment empire to run.           A sketch shows an original work used to make one of the first Oswald The Lucky Rabbit films for Disney. Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was the Disney studio\u0027s character to have his own show, but the rights were taken from Disney in 1928 when Charles Mintz claimed them for Universal Studios. It was then that Mickey Mouse was created by Disney to compete with UniversalHe was there to meet and greet visitors at Disneyland\u0027s grand opening in 1955, won the hearts of a new generation with his on-and-off children\u0027s TV show the Mickey Mouse Club, and built up a 40 per cent share in Disney consumer product sales.Unsure what to do with him on the silver screen, Disney made Mickey master of ceremonies, family patriarch, and mainstay of merchandising.By the mid-nineties, Mickey had become a bit of a problem. He was still Disney\u0027s prize asset – far too big to be discarded – but it would be a brave executive who tried to modernise or tinker with him.When Andy Mooney arrived as Disney\u0027s head of consumer products in 2003, he couldn\u0027t believe how little the company was using the face of their franchise. \u0027Mickey is our swoosh\u0027, he remarked, referring to the omnipresent tick that Nike use. With the aim of making Mickey cool again, he appeared in 3D in the video game series Kingdom Hearts.          Who\u0027s there! Mickey is pictured holding a torch in a sketch for the 1930 Disney animated film The Gorilla Mystery, where an ape escapes from a zoo and captures Mickey\u0027s girlfriend Minnie Mouse. After a long chase, Mickey finally captures the ape A giant graffiti mural of the mouse also appeared on the corner of Sunset boulevard and the drive for merchandise was vamped up.  T-shirts made up the thrust of the campaign, and Mickey appeared splashed across the chests of Jennifer Aniston, Avril Lavigne, Lenny Kravitz, and Sarah Jessica Parker on Sex And The City.The result was a Mickey for a new age. Though still the smiling face that meets visitors at the gates of Disneyland, the release of video game Epic Mickey in 2009 brought a darker, moodier Mickey, who could be cantankerous and calculating. The game initially received average reviews, but has since gained a sequel and a cult following.Mickey may have begun life just as a mouse, but for some, he symbolised the American dream. He rose from the ashes of the Great Depression  and Walt Disney had endured years of rejections and bankruptcy before striking mouse-shaped gold.\u0027If you can dream it, you can do it\u0027 he said famously, and Mickey was the embodiment of this optimism.           Walt Disney (1901 - 1966) is pictured surrounded by his cartoon creations from Mickey Mouse to Bambi The name Disney is known the world over for being the source of millions of people\u0027s childhood fantasies.But not all Disney fans know about the man behind the name.Walt Disney was born in 1901 in Chicago, USA, and went on to become one of the greatest animators on earth.His father Elias Disney was Irish-Canadian and his mother Flora Call Disney was German-American, he had three brothers and a sister.He grew up in Marceline, Missouri where he developed a love of art from an early age, often selling drawings and paintings to neighbours, family and friends.He went to McKinley High School in Chicago where he took up drawing and photography classes and drew cartoons for the student newspaper.Obsessed with art he took night classes at the Chicago Art Institute, dropping out of school to join the Army at 16 – only to get rejected for being underage.He joined the Red Cross instead and went to live in France for a year to work as an ambulance driver, returning to the US in 1919.He moved to Kansas City where he dreamed of a career as a newspaper artist.His brother Roy got him a job at the Esmen-Rubin Art Studio, where he met Ubbe Eert Iwwerks, better known as Ub Iwerks, a well-known cartoonist.He did a stint working at the Kansas City Film Ad Company where he worked on cut-out animation for commercials.He started experimenting with camera and hand-drawn animation before he decided to go it alone and start his own business.Fred Harman was his first employee and together they struck up a deal with the local Kansas City theatre to screen their cartoons, which they called Laugh-O-Grams.The short films were so popular they made their own studio, calling it Laugh-O-Gram, and they hired Harman\u0027s brother Hugh and Iwerks from his earlier career.But in 1923 the studio had accumulated piles of debt and Disney was forced to declare bankruptcy.Despite the country facing the impending doom of the Great Depression, Disney and his brother pooled their money together and moved to Hollywood with Iwerks.There they founded the Disney Brothers\u0027 Studio. It was then they were able to create characters like Oswald The Lucky Rabbit and a series of seven films called Alice in Cartoonland.In 1928 Charles Mintz of Universal Studios stole the rights to Oswald, leaving Disney without a star character.He quickly developed the character Mortimer the Mouse, which his wife Lillian, who he had married three years earlier after hiring her as an artist, advised him should be renamed Mickey.Mickey\u0027s first film was Steamboat Willie in 1928, which due to the mouse\u0027s popularity, was quickly followed by others.Mickey was brought to life in colour for the first time in 1935 in the short film The Band Concert.Technicolour film production was used to make the colour cartoon, which Disney resisted at first, but eventually grew to love.Throughout the 1930s and 1940s Disney brought several more characters to life, including Mickey\u0027s girlfriend Minnie, Donald Duck, Goofy and Pluto, Snow White, Pinocchio, Bambi and Dumbo.In July 1955 Disney\u0027s success grew with the opening of the first $17million theme park in California.President Ronald Reagan visited on opening day and the site soon became popular with families as the place they could imagine their favourite Disney films coming to life.Since then DisneyLands have opened in Florida, Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong – with the latest opening in Shanghai in June 2016.Industry experts and historians have repeatedly claimed Walt Disney was racist and anti-Semitic but these claims have been disputed by all those who knew him.Within years of opening the California theme park, Disney was already dreaming up another one in Florida.But he died of lung cancer in December 1966 at the age of 65 – before it could come to fruition.Five years after his death his brother oversaw the launch of the Florida theme park Walt had dreamed of – under the name Walt Disney World.

Picture shows mosque in different Jakarta neighbourhood \u0027These are people who are running the country.\u0027The agency did not release details about what it found at hundreds of other mosques covered by its probe.But it said that it also found worrying signs of radicalism at seven university campuses among several hundred it spot checked as part of the probe.The spy agency\u0027s investigation was sparked by an independent anti-terrorism expert\u0027s report last year that found imams at dozens of mosques across Indonesia were expressing intolerance and support for IS.\u0027We have to avoid this because we don\u0027t want people in Indonesia fighting against each other - that will lead to (bad) things,\u0027 Purwanto said.Indonesia has beefed up its anti-terror law to give authorities more power to arrest suspects in the wake of the Surabaya attacks.But Purwanto said the agency would take a soft approach to dealing with radical imams by trying to convince them to spread a more peaceful message.Jakarta-based terrorism expert Sidney Jones said the agency should go beyond just talking with clerics about their sermons.\u0027Generally it\u0027s not enough to talk to the preacher - you have to get to the mosque development committee and look at (who is behind) the financing,\u0027 she said.\u0027And you have to understand why there is support from the local community.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Staff refuse let wheelchair bound teen sit 100 seats assistance dog","story":"    The dog (pictured) allows the teenager to have greater independence by warning her of impending seizures The Shropshire teenager has Asperger\u0027s and relies on shih tzu Chloe to help her be more independent.Abby blogs about difficulties she faces accessing services and told how a security guard moved her along despite Noel Fitzpatrick bringing a dog on stage.            The show at Birmingham Arena featured Noel Fitzpatrick bringing on a dog during the eventShe had travelled 35 miles from her home in Telford for the Welcome To My World tour even on Saturday.And she had already checked the Arena website\u0027s advice on bringing assistance dogs - but claims it made no mention of needing to book specific seats.\u0027It said assistance dogs were welcome, with no mention of having to book special seats,\u0027 she said.When she was told she couldn\u0027t sit in her booked seats, Abby cited Health and Safety Executive legislation.  But she was then shown to a disabled area whose floor she described as \u0027sticky and filthy\u0027.She was shunted to the section as two women were moved away from the area to ensure that Abby and her mother were totally alone.           The blogger, her mother and Chloe the assistance dog were flanked by four security guards at the Supervet showSupermarkets are \u0027putting lives at risk by not warning...Share this articleFour security guards flanked them, which Abby said was \u0027really intimidating\u0027.

Festus Onasanya (pictured) also used a similar \u0027method\u0027 involving fake driver details, when he was caught speeding on June 17 and August 23 last yearMs Onasanya later ousted former Conservative MP Stewart Jackson by taking the seat with a majority of 607 votes.Asked by her barrister, Christine Agnew QC, about the \u0027step up\u0027 from her role on the county council, she said: \u0027It was massive.\u0027It was more of a leap than a step.\u0027Ms Agnew continued: \u0027Did it fit in with your expectation of what the leap, or the step, might be?\u0027The MP replied: \u0027I didn\u0027t have any expectations because I didn\u0027t have any idea what it would be like.\u0027She added: \u0027It\u0027s a little bit like being asked if you can swim and you say \u0027Yes, I can swim\u0027 but then you get thrown into the ocean.\u0027Ms Onasanya told the court her first visit to Westminster was \u0027a little bit like a fresher\u0027s fair\u0027 at university.She was not given an office until September, two months after the alleged offence, and having to spend her first visit picking up her laptop, security pass and other essentials.Within weeks she was appointed to a select committee and became a parliamentary private secretary to the shadow defence secretary.But those positions were relinquished when Onasanya was promoted to the whip\u0027s office overseeing, amongst other things, party discipline in January this year.Jurors heard last week how one of Onasanya\u0027s staffers recalled seeing 5,000 unanswered emails sitting in her inbox.Described the deluge of correspondence, she said: \u0027It\u0027s like if you switch your phone off for maybe a month and then turn it on and all the messages come through one after the other.\u0027She agreed that there was \u0027no system\u0027 in place to handle the flood and conceded that some \u0027extremely important\u0027 messages may have gone overlooked as a result.\u0027When I turned on the laptop and went into my inbox it started off with about 50 emails,\u0027 Onasanya continued.\u0027I thought that was not too bad. Then it went from 50 to 70 to 100, 700.\u0027I had over 2,000, and that was me starting.\u0027Onasanya\u0027s musician brother Festus has admitted three similar allegations of perverting the course of justice, the court has heard.Prosecutor David Jeremy QC told jurors Festus was slapped with six penalty points for failing to identify the driver and hit with a further three for speeding all in July 2017.He had earlier been banned for a year after being caught with excess alcohol back in June 2008.Ms Onasanya told jurors she did not know about the convictions at the time she was alleged to have committed an offence last summer.The MP, from Peterborough, denies one count of perverting the course of justice.The trial continues. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09e0206b5a59b8bc2ade5251168f074945ac465a/46_328_3132_1878/master/3132.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e93452a82d28266f58fc043c04029135","title":"home is where the art is margaret drabble on gainsboroughs family portraits","story":"He was known as an expensive painter who captured high society, but a rare exhibition of Gainsborough’s works at the National Portrait Gallery reveals a poignant story of parental loveThomas Gainsborough and his wife, Margaret, had three daughters, the eldest of whom, Mary, died in infancy. We may see her with her parents in Gainsborough’s earliest family portrait, which he painted c1748 when he was about 20. The well-dressed group, complete with dog, poses formally but comfortably in a wooded rural landscape, with the little child standing pink-cheeked, doll-like and a little stiffly between her mother and father. The painting, as has often been pointed out, marks Gainsborough’s claim to gentlemanly status, as a social equal of the wealthy landowners and titled gentry who were to be his principal subjects. Little about it suggests the affectionate concern and informality that were to glow from his later paintings and drawings, mostly unfinished, of his two surviving daughters (another Mary, another Margaret), gathered together at the National Portrait Gallery for the first time. These tell a moving, intimate and ultimately sad story of parental love, and catch informal moments of domestic life in an age when childhood was recognised as something more than a necessary preparation for adulthood, as a period with its own particular joys and sorrows.Gainsborough came to be known as the expensive painter of expensive people in expensive dress, and some critics have unkindly remarked that he was better at costumes than at people – “flashy” is the word the art historian Michael Kitson once used. (I had always assumed portrait sitters chose their own clothes, to show off the glories of their wardrobe, but we learn here that sitters for Joshua Reynolds and George Romney and possibly Gainsborough himself sometimes wore costumes chosen for them – an interesting sidelight on the relationship between artist and subject.) We know that privately Gainsborough preferred painting landscape, but landscapes did not sell. Family finances depended on “this curs’d Face Business” and commissions from wealthy patrons “with their damn’d faces”, and money motivated his move from his native Suffolk to Bath, a showy and rich resort that was the centre of fashionable leisured life. He lived there with his family from 1759 to 1774, and painted the high society of Vanity Fair: men in high public office, men and women of rank, a few successful artists, musicians and physicians. Satins, jewels, ribbons, buckles, brooches, bonnets and fantastic hairstyles were his trade. There was a lot of money in hats: his sister, who lived next door to him in Bath, was a milliner.But at home he could paint what he wanted. And he wanted to paint his wife and daughters. His evolving relationship with his wife Margaret is manifested in several gently maturing images: she gazes boldly at the artist, sometimes a little coquettishly, sometimes sternly, always both posed and composed. Margaret was a confident woman (though he at one point called her “weak”), and she had brought money and (in her view) status to the marriage. Born Margaret Burr, she was the illegitimate daughter of the third Duke of Beaufort, and the annuity paid to her enabled her husband to embark on his career as an artist. They married young, when she was already pregnant. She seems to have thought highly of her own noble blood, referring to herself at one point as “a prince’s daughter”, and, although she kept a firm grasp on the household economy, the family accounts suggest that she, like everyone else in Bath, enjoyed spending good money on fine clothes. She liked to hold her head high.Gainsborough’s paintings of his wife bear witness to a long and on the whole companionate marriage, at times strained by his often intemperate behaviour. But his sketches and paintings of his daughters tell another story. Completed before the move to Bath, the most celebrated of these is The Painter’s Daughters Chasing a Butterfly, an astonishingly touching and sensitive work that captures the two prettily but casually dressed young girls, in silvery white and yellow, in pursuit of a cabbage white butterfly landing on a thistle. The elder seems to be gently and a little anxiously restraining the younger. It is an image of childhood loaded with admonitory symbolism. Butterflies, like bubbles, belong to the iconography of the ephemeral, and remind us of our frailty. John Bunyan, in an emblem poem, had described an eager boy foolishly pursuing a “silly butterfly”, which speaks for “painted nothings and false joys”. And we remember that Thomas’s first child, his first Mary, had died as a baby. We are right to be watchful.But the painting also brings us into the emergent world of William Wordsworth, the Romantic poets, and the not-so-pathetic fallacy: maybe, just maybe, Mary is trying to restrain her impetuous little sister not from harming herself on the thistle but from harming the butterfly? In one of his poems Wordsworth describes himself and his sister Dorothy (named Emmeline in the poem) chasing a butterfly: “A very hunter did I rush upon the prey … But she, God love her, feared to brush the dust from off its wings.” That Wordsworthian delicacy is present in this portrait.It is good to note that this very personal and not quite finished painting of childhood was given (or less probably sold) to Gainsborough’s acquaintance and neighbour, the Rev Robert Hingeston, headmaster of Ipswich School, when the ambitious and upwardly mobile painter left Suffolk for Bath in 1759. It hung there for many years in a schoolroom before making its way to the National Gallery, and as Ann Berningham points out, its owner “would well have appreciated the composition’s moral message”.In Bath, the father sketched, drew and painted the daughters many times, as they engaged in everyday activities – playing with a cat, learning to draw. They were useful models, and they were to hand, and he exercised his skills on them, possibly as a relief from the grandeur and pomposity of sitters such as Countess Howe and the plantation-owning Byams. His impromptu pieces tell us much about their family life, and how much the girls, whom he fondly nick-named “Molly and the Captain”, or “Molly and Peggy”, were valued. Anxious for their future, he was solicitous about their health, and arranged for them to have drawing lessons, not merely to acquire a ladylike accomplishment, but in case they had to earn their own bread. Like the hard-up heroines of many a 19th-century novel, if all else failed they could try to sell their artwork. He didn’t want them to dwindle into “fine ladies with their tea-drinkings, dancings and husband hunting”. None of their art survives, but we can see them at work with their sketch books on their knee.He also included them as figures in some of his scenes of rural life. Most poignantly, we see Margaret, dressed as a gleaner and seated with a sheaf of wheat on her lap, in a small oil painting that belongs to the Ashmolean, and is the surviving half of what were once two portraits: she looks melancholy and vulnerable, her cropped brown hair tied back in a plain white bonnet. The flesh tones are blue and pink and grey, as are the tones of the clouded autumn sky above her. There is no playful energy here. Her head is graciously inclined, her eyes sorrowful and apprehensive, as she patiently awaits her fate. And the fate that overtook these girls was not wholly kind.Gainsborough painted only one formal double full-length portrait of them, accompanied by a slightly ridiculous fluffy white dog: it is in private hands and very rarely seen, so go to see it now. It was painted after his move from Bath to London in 1774, one that reflected his rise in fame and status, and possibly their own sense of their growing social importance. Contemporaries suggest that they began to suffer from delusions of grandeur, delusions nourished by the snobberies of Bath, and by too much talk about their noble connections. (Admirers of Jane Austen, once herself described as a “husband-hunting butterfly”, will remember her dislike of Bath, and the foolish pretensions of Persuasion’s Sir Walter Elliot.)These country girls from Suffolk had now reached Schomberg House in Pall Mall, in the heart of the capital, yet what had they got to show for it? Bath was an ideal hunting ground for husbands, but their matrimonial prospects had not prospered. Both seem to have fallen in love with the same man, the oboist Johann Christian Fischer, who married Mary, disastrously, in 1780 they parted in a matter of months. Margaret never married. The sisters ended up living together quietly in Acton, Mary by now having some form of melancholia or dementia as well as what an acquaintance called “vain pomp and self complacency” her health in Bath had not been good, and now deteriorated. A visitor from Ipswich summed up their situation: ‘‘Margaret is odd in her behaviour and her sister quite deranged.” Bath had undone them. Their father prospered, but, ironically, we now value his landscapes and his family sketches more highly than his extravagantly sumptuous courtly portraits. The happier, simpler, freer childhood of those girls lives on, and so does their father’s love.• Gainsborough’s Family Album is at the National Portrait Gallery, London WC2H, from 22 November. npg.org.uk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72449415df47e7de973d2dc209b2a7f58533bfa4/0_0_1124_1500/master/1124.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dbb39c347918dcb3d5302968493af7e 720w","title":"recycling the old masters in pictures suzanne jongmans","story":"Dutch artist Suzanne Jongmans creates photographs that echo the old masters, but with a modern twist: she crafts intricate costumes using recycled plastics, old blankets and used packaging.

Certainly, whenever I have spent time in leave-voting areas, I have always felt deeply ambivalent: sick and tired of the delusions that sit at Brexit’s heart, but also keenly aware that in some of the most neglected parts of England and Wales, a huge chunk of the people who voted for it did so because they had not been listened to for decades. As the whole saga groaned on, if I had a position, it was that Brexit probably had to happen – but that in its inevitably awful consequences might lie some eventual realignment of our politics, and the final death of an exceptionalist English fantasy with no place in the 21st century.Now, as much as similar thoughts still arrive on a daily basis, I wonder. Most of the Conservative politicians who championed leaving the EU and were then given the job of carrying it out have deserted their posts. The story of how key leave campaigners cheated their way to success may only just have started to unfold. And every month brings stories, too often overlooked, of how Brexit will blight the places that supported it: this week it was news about a doomed ball-bearing factory in Plymouth, in business for 50 years and now owned by the German company Schaeffler, but set to close with the loss of more than 350 jobs – partly, says the company, because of the “uncertainties surrounding Brexit”.This much we know: whatever the stories of the millions of people who ended up backing it, Brexit originated in the failure of successive Conservative leaders to adequately deal with a tribe of uncontrollable Tory ideologues, and in the ingrained tendency of post-Thatcher Conservatives to play fast and loose with the livelihoods and security of the rest of us. In an awful instance of irony, the misery and resentment sown by the deindustralisation the Tories accelerated in the 1980s and the austerity they pushed on the country 30 years later were big reasons why so many people decided to vote leave. What also helped was a surreal campaign of lies and disinformation, both during and after the referendum campaign, waged by entitled people with their eyes only on the main chance.These things are part of a vast charge sheet not only against the modern Conservative party, but an alliance of old and new money that has set the basic terms of British politics for the past 40 years. Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson were educated at the same exclusive school as the prime minister whose idiotic decision to hold a referendum gave them their opportunity. Nigel Farage and Arron Banks are archetypal examples of the kind of spivs who were given licence to do as they pleased in the 80s. For all their absurd bleating about “elites”, we all know what these people represent: the two faces of the modern English ruling class, who have long combined to be nothing but trouble.Which brings us to the question that, for all my lingering ambivalence, I cannot shake off: if the Labour party leadership is so radical, and allied with the best leftwing traditions, where is its anger about what these people have done?While some of us have been spitting feathers about the deceptions perpetrated by rightwing leavers, Jeremy Corbyn has seemed barely interested. Is there some kind of awful equivalence between the rightwing Brexiteers, who see national crisis as the ideal seedbed for a free-market utopia, and leftwingers who think socialism is similarly best assisted by disaster? Whatever the explanation, and whatever the levels of support for leave among Labour voters, a supposed party of opposition – and a leftwing one at that – accepting a project birthed and then sustained in the worst kind of rightwing political circles is a very odd spectacle indeed. This, surely, will also be the verdict of history.As things stand, Labour’s position is apparently built on two fairly incredible beliefs: that it could somehow negotiate a much better Brexit, and that it wants a general election, which parliament is very unlikely to grant. Even if a contest did happen, unless the Tories were mad enough to plunge us into the chaos of no-deal, what exactly would it be about? With Brexit both falling apart and defining the entirety of day-to-day politics, Labour’s crafty fudging of the issue in 2017 would be impossible. Would its central offer be the difference between the current plan, to stay in a customs union for an unspecified period, or Labour’s guarantee to do so permanently? Might voters basically be asked to choose between the negotiating nous of Tories and the supposedly superior talents of Corbyn, Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry? Contrary to Labour’s hype, there is no chance of any deal delivering “the exact same benefits” as the status quo, nor of the party’s fabled “jobs-first” Brexit: with his usual bloodless candour, Donald Tusk this week reminded us that our passage out of the EU is “a lose-lose situation and that our negotiations are only about damage control”. As if anyone needed reminding, this would apply to a Labour government as well.The country currently has three options, and parliament seems unlikely to be able to sensibly choose between them: the current withdrawal deal or something very like it, the unimaginable chaos of no-deal, or no Brexit. Self-evidently, leaving the EU without an agreement would be by far the most nightmarish, which is one of the reasons why Labour’s determination to vote down May’s deal is not without hazards. But in the midst of such imperfect options, and with heavy reservations, I think I know what we need to avoid national disaster: a Labour party ready to move beyond Corbyn’s hollow claim on Sunday that another referendum is merely “an option for the future”, and embrace what is now known as a people’s vote, with a recommendation that Britain should stay in the EU.Given that the Labour leadership has seemingly dug in, the only hope of any such move lies with MPs, and pressure that could be exerted by the party’s vast membership. Clearly, after two wasted years, even beginning to embed the idea of questioning and then abandoning Brexit in places where a majority voted for it would be an onerous task. Doing so would require enough working-class voices – where, for example, have the big unions been? – to convincingly speak to people and places that voted to leave the EU but have the most to lose from its consequences.Labour would have to find a courage that it has so far failed to discover, and sideline the anti-EU mindset of its own leader. Vocal remainers both inside and outside the party would need to realise that any move in this direction would have to be part of a policy offer that even the boldness of, say, John McDonnell has so far only skirted. All told, it would involve something to which even these supposed radicals are averse: risk.But what is the alternative: to carry on swallowing not just the endless deceptions of the leave elite but the also the disastrous effects their awful arrogance will have on people and places across the country?British Conservatism is in decay and disarray to mark its gravest postwar crisis by accepting its most heinous project would be a strange thing to do, and an evasion of our politics’ central fact: that Brexit is a class issue, and all else follows from that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2cf04a32433155a8c2ca674f81f74e108694864/0_0_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=410016930a6bdbb2fec599b4a4e33244","title":"lose weight blame friends impressionable eater research","story":"As we approach Christmas party time, I make my usual annual psychological commitment: time to get healthy, I tell myself, so that December’s excess doesn’t have too much of an impact on my waistline. I vouch to get off the sauce, get on the exercise bike a bit more, stop eating so much cheese. Somehow, I decide, this will result in a new, fit, lithe me.But there is a problem. The problem is that I made this vow in the summer, too, in the run-up to the summer holiday and in the spring, in the run-up to my book coming out and in January … you see where this is going. Every month, every week, a meaningless commitment that I believe will change my life. Spoiler alert: it never does.Now, however, new research suggests that I can just blame my friends. A study has found that people are far more likely to make unhealthy eating choices if they are with a friend who chooses a fatty option on the menu. It’s called altruistic indulgence – a form of solidarity, a way of saying: “Don’t worry, your terrible diet is OK.” It’s the “Sod it, let’s get some shots” of restaurant dining.I’m an impressionable eater. My husband has noted that all it takes in a shop is for an assistant to talk to me for me to make a purchase. I will sometimes even team up with the assistant and back up their sales pitch outside the changing room: “She’s right you know, wenge is absolutely your colour.” Food is the same.I’m always faintly impressed by people who can say no to a host who offers a slice of tart. I’m always too worried it will make me look uptight (I am also far too desirous of tart). But I have remarked that there are others who do. Is this a case of a simple lack of willpower? Some will say yes, and this is where the fat-shaming that remains so prevalent comes in. Obesity becomes a question of strength and weakness, and all other factors fall by the wayside, despite the fact that these factors – hormones, genetics, mental health, addictive chemicals in junk food, food placement in supermarkets, advertising, technology – all have scientific underpinnings. The difference between being fat and not has never been as simple as the ability to say: “No pizza for me, thanks.”We are bombarded by conflicting dietary advice. Last week, a group of US scientists got together and said it’s high time that we end the “diet wars” that have plagued so much obesity research – that is the eternal grudge match of fat v carbs. What matters for most, they argue, is the quality of the fats and the carbs that you are eating. “Nutrition and human physiology is much more complicated than nuclear physics,” said the study’s lead author, Professor David Ludwig.We want a one-size-fits-all approach, a quick fix. Women are primed from an early age to monitor their friends’ diets. My generation grew up reading other women’s food diets in magazines: one particular feature was called Fridge Raiders. The magazine would take a photo of some D-list celebrity’s fridge, and then a nutritionist would trash their diet. “She’ll be the size of a house if she keeps consuming this many boiled eggs.”So looking to our friends feels natural to many of us. What I have noticed, with regard to many of my slimmer friends, is that although we may collude in a pizza on a Tuesday, they will not view this as an excuse to throw any healthy eating plan out of the window. For their next meal, they will compensate with a salad. Oh, and they will exercise.These are useful lessons to learn. We are forever looking to other people and cultures for inspiration on how to lose weight. Call it French-Women-Don’t-Get-Fat syndrome (a book that fails to take into account just how much French women smoke). Following the routines of others can help to an extent, but it can also be a fast track to misery, as was hilariously illustrated by the book I’ll Have What She’s Having, in which Rebecca Harrington tries out many infamous celebrity diets. “This is a flavour profile that would appeal to a cat,” she wrote of Liz Taylor’s weight-loss tuna salad.This leads me to conclude that rather than imitating others’ diets, we really need to start recognising that all bodies are different and that a tailored approach to healthy living is needed. For me, tragically, that means no more cheese in the house."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c63d53f16bfdef4692428d9a6061473b9b391dda/0_8_2183_1310/master/2183.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ebd10d7a9bd88ddcad8b6579f76ad98","title":"may remainers brexit britain europe","story":"Hard Brexit has been making all the running while businesses that were supposed to be united against cutting ties with Europe have been silentIt’s been the silence of the lambs. Theresa May took her case today to the Confederation of British Industry and was unnecessarily polite. Where have all you remainers, you Brexit sceptics, been these two years, she should have cried? We were told the massed ranks of British capital and commerce, of the City, agriculture, the professions and academia, were united against cutting ties with Europe, inside or outside membership of the EU. We were told that London’s finance, leisure and social services faced employment devastation. Where are these voices? Why has hard Brexit been left making all the running?As soon as the referendum result was announced, the defeated remainers tried to pretend it had not happened. They demanded another referendum, which inevitably sounded like sour grapes and a denial of democracy. Some insulted Brexiters and others wasted time going to court. They even joined hard Brexiters in deriding such compromises as versions of the Norway option, the single market and a customs union. The case for soft Brexit went by the board. Remorselessly, Brexit came to mean hard Brexit.Industry’s lobbyists even pretended they did not mind what happened, so long as business had “certainty”, which sounded suspiciously like self-interest. They somehow assumed that May’s negotiators would stay this side of insanity. Yet when she said she would admit only skilled immigrants, massively against London’s interest, the capital stayed silent. Its mayor, Sadiq Khan, has been a broken reed. Labour was left voiceless, a morass of uncertainty and unable to form a soft Brexit coalition. It has been reduced to the point where, in parliament, it is now shackled to the Tory right, to hard Brexit and anarchy.At no point did remainers and pragmatists form a coalition to shout from the rooftops the necessity for Britain to stay in Europe’s common economic space. They ided and diluted their forces. When the inevitable compromise finally surfaced last week in May’s withdrawal deal, there was no lobby to give it purchase. Hard Brexit, now a de facto no-deal Brexit, was left totally in the ascendant. On every television screen, its champions went unchallenged, talking rubbish about reopening negotiations, about “rule-taking, not rule-making” and fantasy “deals with the rest of the world”.The case for remaining in some form of single market with the rest of Europe is overwhelming. Many opinion polls suggest that is what most Britons want, even outside the EU. One day I am sure it will happen. But the cost and chaos of getting there has been immeasurably increased by the failure of former remainers to fashion an argument and give it political traction.

If you answered the resurgence of fascism, skyrocketing inequality or climate change … you are wrong. The correct answer is mobile-payment apps.In New York, most people I know use a payment app, such as Venmo, which lets you send money to friends as easily as sending a text. While such apps are convenient, they have also made everyone super cheap. Once upon a time, you would treat your friend and then they would treat you, and it would all work out eventually. Now, it is common to transfer exact payments for the smallest things. If someone buys you a coffee, for example, you can expect a $2.87 Venmo request to follow. Payment apps have turned us all into petty monsters.To be fair, we are not just petty over cash. We are living in an age of pettiness. This is largely thanks to the internet and review sites such as Yelp. If your $2.87 coffee is cold, you are no longer forced to move on with your life you can post a scathing review containing every petty detail of your traumatic experience.Pettiness hasn’t just proliferated it now has a certain cachet. Being overly concerned with trivial matters used to be the sign of a small, rather spiteful mind now it is the sign of a popular Twitter account. Being incredibly petty has also, as one Canadian man discovered, become a good way to go viral. Adrian Pearce made headlines last year for keeping, but refusing to unwrap, a Christmas present a girlfriend gave him in 1970, shortly before she dumped him. He is now back in the news because he has persuaded the ex-girlfriend to come to his Christmas celebration this year and open the gift. Not to be petty, but I really hope she Venmo-charges him for whatever she bought."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7d9aaa36a3ad4ac043865901c1d84aac1cfed16/0_50_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7f08a0b5ab9859094df40c755954e77","title":"voter intimidation republicans democrats midterm elections","story":"Door-to-door canvassers tell stories of husbands who bully, silence and control their wives into voting conservativeProgressive organizer Annabel Park told the story that made me start to wonder. “I can’t stop thinking about this woman I met while doorknocking for Beto in Dallas,” Annabel wrote on social media a few days before the midterm elections.“She lived in a sprawling low-income apartment complex. After I knocked a couple of times, she answered the door with her husband just behind her. She looked petrified and her husband looked menacing behind her. When I made my pitch about Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke, her husband yelled, ‘We’re not interested.’ She looked at me and silently mouthed, ‘I support Beto.’ Before I could respond, she quickly closed the door.”Annabel told me afterwards, “It’s been on my mind. Did she get beaten? That was my fear.”There’s a form of voter intimidation that widespread and unacknowledged. It’s the husbands who bully and silence and control their wives, as witnessed by dozens of door-to-door canvassers across the country I heard from.I started asking around and found that a lot of get-out-the-vote ground troops had witnessed various forms of such bullying, intimidation and silencing in relation to this election and in earlier elections, too.Wives asked their husbands directly who the two were going to vote for. Many seemed cowed. Husbands answered the door and refused to let the wife speak to canvassers, or talked or shouted over her, or insisted that she was going to vote Republican even though she was a registered Democrat, or insisted there were no Democrats in the house because she had never told him she was one. A friend in Iowa told me, “I asked the woman who answered the door if she had a plan for voting, and a man appeared, behind her, and said, quite brusquely, ‘I’m a Republican’. Before I could reply, he shut the door in my face.”Another friend reported, “A woman I texted in Michigan told me, ‘I am not allowed’ to vote for the candidate.” Many canvassers told me those experiences were common. I did not find stories of the reverse phenomenon – wives dominating their husbands, or husbands pushing their wives to vote for the Democratic candidate. Of course I talked to people canvassing for Democrats, and domestic violence takes place across the political spectrum, but the bullying seemed to be mostly either to oblige the wife to lean to the right or to not participate at all.“The wife spotted me and jumped up from her table to intercept me at the door before I could knock,” one canvasser from California told me.Without saying any words, the wife softly put both hands out in front of her body, palms facing me. She moved her hands from side to side as though to tell me, “No thank you, please go away without making a noise.”She was one of many who appeared to be afraid of their husbands.Going door-to-door is an extraordinary experience. You see demographics break down into actual faces, stories, shabby or manicured front yards, see subisions and slums, see people who are clear and fierce or indifferent or confused about the upcoming election. You meet people where they are, and where some of them are is in fear of the man of the house.My friend Melody had a Nevada man who never turned off his leaf-blower roar at her over the din, “This is a RED house! This house is Republican!”Melody told me: “I say I’ve come by to speak to Donna. ‘No, she doesn’t want to speak to you.’ I consider saying, ‘Looks like this house is kind of purple, since Donna is a Democrat.’ But then I think, ‘Maybe he doesn’t know. Maybe she just goes into that booth and votes the way she wants without telling him.’ But what if she doesn’t go into a booth? What if they vote at the kitchen table? Does he supervise her ballot? Is she afraid to fill it out according to her own wishes rather than his?”No one knows to what extent this domination may prevent women from voting according to their own beliefs and agendas or participating at all.Of course there are plenty of right-wing women who are enthusiastically voting for the conservative of their choice, but when you look at the enormous gender gaps between Democrats and Republicans or hear the myriad door-to-door stories, you recognize that there are many marriages between Democratic women and Republican men, and many Republican men who intend to control their wives’ political expression.The problem matters for voting rights whether or not it influences outcomes, and it’s also a reminder that many women are not free and equal in their domestic lives. Yet another canvasser reported that one of those husbands, this time in Turlock, California, told her, “And if she needs to know how to vote, I’ll just take her in the back and beat her.” He was sort of joking but sort of not.This ordinary, ugly scenario raises another question, about whether voting by mail takes away the privacy of the voting booth and the ability for women to act on their beliefs without consequences. And it’s a reminder of why women’s long quest for the vote in the US and elsewhere was such a radical thing. Insisting women should vote was insisting that we should be equal and independent participants in public life, with the right to act on our own behalf and in our own interests.The women’s suffrage movement clashed with laws that defined women as, essentially, the property or wards of their husbands who had the right to control their bodies, their labor, their earnings, and their assets. It clashed with custom, which held that women’s sphere was private life and role was deference and obedience to the man of the house. Despite the last of those laws ending in the 1990s (when the last US state recognized marital rape as a crime), that clash is not in the past tense.Last week, Mark Harris, a preacher fond of Ephesians 5:22 – “Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord” – won North Carolina’s ninth congressional district, and Ohio Republicans made more attempts to take away women’s right to control their fertility. The conservative agenda is, of course, what you could call marriage inequality, an asymmetrical relationship in which men hold disproportionate power.The right to vote according to your own conscience and agenda is not really so different than the right to control your own body or have equal access and rights in the workplace. It’s a right that we’re meant to have because the laws say we’re all equal. But we’re not. As with the myriad Republican measures to prevent citizens from voting on the large scale – Crosscheck, voter ID laws, limits on polling places and voting hours – this domestic tyranny is an attempt to limit who decides what this country should be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d7b690789f8b74ecf2891c0c2af977579365fb4/0_0_5229_3137/master/5229.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb7fc797f0d0da3ec9684e655a60ba3f","title":"national trust criticised after hiring marksman to cull wild boar stourhead estate","story":"Animals to be removed from Stourhead estate after complaints from ‘intimidated’ visitorsThe National Trust has been criticised for planning to cull wild boar at its Stourhead estate in Wiltshire.It said it had taken the “difficult decision” to remove the animals from its land following reports that members of the public were feeling intimidated by the prospect of coming face-to-face with a wild boar. The charity added it felt it needed to sanction a cull to protect its staff.The trust said: “Following recent reports of an unlicensed reintroduction of wild boar on land adjacent to the Stourhead estate and several reports of members of the public being confronted and intimidated, we have taken the difficult decision to remove the animals from the estate.“We only made this decision after considering the alternatives and after consulting with Natural England. Unfortunately, there are some instances where humane control is necessary – for instance where there are safety concerns for our visitors, staff or volunteers or to protect other species or habitats. We never take this decision lightly.“Any cull of wild boar will be carried out by an experienced and licensed marksman who conforms to National Trust standards of safety and animal welfare.”The 2,650-acre estate is known for its lake, which reflects classical temples, grottoes and rare and exotic trees. It has attracted visitors in the autumn when the colour of the trees can be particularly striking.Matt Mellen, an environmental campaigner from Frome in Somerset, said: “I think its inappropriate for the National Trust to be hiring marksmen. I think a lot of National Trust members wouldn’t want their membership fee spent on that. There must be more humane ways to keep them off the Stourhead lawns – such as electric fences.“There used to be wolves and bear and lynx in the UK but compared to countries like France and Germany we have very low levels of wildlife.”Richard Bray, also from Frome, spotted two boars in a cleared area on the edge of a wood while driving to work. He said: “I stopped to take a picture of them, they took no notice of me at all, they didn’t seem bothered. The idea of culling them makes me a bit angry.”Fred Nicholls, who farms about six miles from Stourhead, said he saw wild boars regularly in woods near his property. He said: “They’ve been there for years. The general public need to be made aware just how dangerous they can be. You can’t have them about. They cause too much damage and they are a danger to the public.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4eecd7f74330e6adca1e7b6d733c23012c566ff/32_18_1771_1062/master/1771.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f24e5903f04059d52706bfea8bfa7a46","title":"harry redknapp im a celebrity debut nick knowles","story":"“They’ve got a football manager on the other team. That’s a bit of a problem because he’s probably good at tactics,” said Rita Simons (once of EastEnders), peering suspiciously at Harry Redknapp before the first full-team challenge on I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here!, which involved extended paddling in a boat incapable of holding everyone who wanted to paddle in it.“Yeah, but does he know tactics for rowing across a lake?” wondered Anne Hegerty (of quiz show The Chase). And this is the key question: how will the skills honed over years spent on a variety of English football pitches translate to the deliberately torturous snake-pits and rat-holes of rural Australia?Early signs were certainly promising, though Simons and Hegerty should perhaps have spent less time worrying about Redknapp’s tactical insight and more time pondering their own approach, which involved instantly sinking their boat and thus leaving Redknapp’s reds to win the task at their leisure. It turned out that Redknapp had indeed been responsible for this success, even if his active contribution to it appeared minimal. “Harry was captain, he came up with a plan and we just stuck to it and did it Harry’s way,” said Nick Knowles (DIY SOS host).Redknapp is the eighth former footballer to enter ITV’s jungle-themed campsite, with John Fashanu – runner-up 15 years ago – the most successful of his predecessors. At the start of the broadcast he claimed that he had “never seen the show” and was “not going to watch it before I go in because it might scare me”, though actually knowing ex-contestants such as Rodney Marsh and Neil Ruddock has probably been more helpful than any number of videos.Last week Ruddock predicted that Redknapp would “snap and really have a go at people” should they fail to meet his exacting standards, though that remains to be seen – his team, who lost the only challenge before his arrival, went unbeaten thereafter and he went on to trill that he had “loved every minute of their company”. “Harry don’t like whingers,” Ruddock added. “If anyone whinges, Harry just tells you to get on with it.”This stoicism was clear from Redknapp’s first significant involvement in the show, which saw him insert his arm into a box full of unknown nasties and rummage around in search of plastic tokens. While Hegerty – performing the same task for the other team – appeared chronically terror-stricken, Redknapp had the unruffled demeanour of someone who has to deal with significantly viler creatures in the Sky studio on an average Sunday afternoon. “Oh my God, it feels like a great big crab or something,” he said, with an air of complete calm, as he fumbled with a great big crab.“I love animals, all animals,” he told an interviewer in 2013. “Apart from cats, I’m a little bit scared of cats.” Five years and the chance of actually meeting creatures a little more fearsome than the ones that prowl the area around his Dorset home – which amounts to his pet bulldog and the occasional slug – had shifted his position somewhat. “Am I scared of anything? Yeah, everything,” he told Fleur East (2014 X Factor runner-up).On this showing he is more likely to be feared than fearful, particularly after telling his teammates, moments after being introduced to them, that he had once run over his wife, omitting the crucial facts that it was an accident and that she survived with nothing more than a hurt ankle. They exchanged concerned looks and said nothing, the subject thus becoming the first in the entire programme that did not inspire John Barrowman to immediately burst into song.On ITV2’s spin-off programme Extra Camp, aimed at anyone not sated by the 105 minutes shown on the main channel, they laughed at Redknapp for failing to grasp basic Australian toilet slang when he suggested he might be good at “emptying the dummy”, though it could just as easily have been interpreted it as a direct threat against one of his rivals.By the time of Redknapp’s first involvement the programme had been on for 45 minutes, in which time a starting cohort of four contestants had competed in pairs for the right to choose their next teammates by means of a lengthy, vertiginous and wind-assisted flag-fetching exercise. The victors got to pick any two from Redknapp, Knowles, East and Hegerty (Redknapp turns out to be a big fan of daytime quiz shows, swiftly identifying Hegerty as “the brainy lady off The Chase”), and for no apparent reason did so while hovering in front of them in a helicopter. Redknapp, at 71 by some margin the oldest of the contestants, was left behind.It was to be the last time that would happen, as Redknapp’s tactical acumen and team-building skills saw his small squad go the remainder of the show unbeaten, securing along the way the more luxurious campsite and bonus food rations, though he was unimpressed with both the campsite – “I’ve got to be honest, I thought it would be a bit more luxurious than what it is” – and the rations. “I don’t think I can eat emu,” he sniffed. “I definitely honestly thought there was a caravan round the back here where they’d be serving bacon sandwiches.”Redknapp ate his emu. He doesn’t like whingers.It had, all things considered, been an excellent start to Redknapp’s reality TV career. Two challenges, two victories and Holly Willoughby, standing in as co-host for the indisposed Ant McPartlin, already has him down as her favourite, declaring herself “a bit obsessed”. Plus having heard what he did to his own wife his teammates will be unusually keen to stay the right side of him. As Darren Bent will testify, reminding Redknapp of his wife is often a bad idea. Though unlike the former Tottenham striker, on that now infamous night in 2009 when a glaring miss inspired Redknapp to quip that “my Mrs could have scored that one”, you get the impression that the septuagenarian former manager will, when it comes to it, have no problem heading home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b6977fbe80af8631331adf9c60b02961682cb83/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b18530db8c31052880842b203a68f563","title":"womens super league talking points from the weekends action","story":"Jade Moore is Reading’s unsung hero, Jordan Nobbs’s injury is a blow for Arsenal and the vacant Everton job has huge appealFara Williams stole the headlines again by scoring two more goals in Reading’s 4-1 win over Brighton, but there was another key player more quietly effecting proceedings a little further back. It is almost exactly a year since Jade Moore suffered an ankle injury that was to end last season and it is probably no coincidence that since her return to the starting XI against Bristol in their last match Reading have secured back-to-back wins for the first time this season. It has been a frustrating 12 months for her – maybe even more so because she is a physio herself – and Reading have missed her presence. To have her back is a major boost for them, and now they are steadily climbing the table again. Moore is not a provider nor a goalscorer, she’s a breaker-upper, a dictator in midfield, a strong tackler and a leader on the pitch. To get her back is like a key signing for Reading, and with her and Williams in the team they can be a real force. Williams just never stops impressing. She’s just the complete player, dangerous with both right and left feet and good with her head. Reading have had to deal with quite a lot of injuries, and still have a few players to come back, but they are clicking into gear now.• Suzanne Wrack: the next goal for women’s football is to balance the booksBirmingham City are another side who have been unlucky with injuries, and they are currently without two international strikers in Rachel Williams, who had major knee surgery in September, and Ellen White, who has a stress fracture in her back. They are both long-term injuries, and if Birmingham were over-reliant on their attacking prowess to roll teams over they would have fallen well away by now. But instead Mark Skinner has built his team around defensive solidity and organisation, and they continue to be the tightest, meanest, stingiest team in the Super League. They play so well as a unit, defending from the front and catching teams on the counter: as a player you absolutely dread playing teams like that. They and Arsenal, in very different ways, are the most consistent teams in the league and the sides I would least want to be facing, and that they are doing it with no stars in their side except perhaps the goalkeeper, Ann-Katrin Berger, makes it even more impressive. Birmingham have six clean sheets in eight games, only conceding against Arsenal and Manchester City, and they scored against both of those as well. So far this season Birmingham have beaten the teams they should beat, and when they are the underdogs they give their opponents a good run for their money. West Ham just didn’t have the answers on Sunday, and Blues ran out comfortable winners.• Referee suspended over using rock, paper, scissors instead of coin tossThe Arsenal juggernaut keeps on rolling: another week, another convincing win, and more goals for the key attacking trio of Danielle van de Donk, Vivianna Miedema and Jordan Nobbs. If it wasn’t for Kirsty Levell pulling off a string of fine saves in the Everton goal the winning margin would have been even more overwhelming. However hard she tried, though, Arsenal’s attacking quality eventually shone through. But the game ended on a sour note with what looked like a potentially serious injury to Nobbs, who required lengthy treatment to a knee injury before being taken from the field. We can only hope that there is no long-term damage, because not only is she Arsenal’s captain but with nine goals to her name and a string of assists she is crucial to their success in attack. Arsenal’s squad is already stretched after Kim Little broke her leg last month, and though Lia Walti has come in and successfully filled that gap their squad is not strong enough to cope with many more setbacks. They have rarely been able to name a full bench, and have had only three substitutes on occasions, so any injury to one of their key attacking trio could well slow them down. Just as well they already have a six-point cushion at the top of the table.The 4-0 defeat to Arsenal was Everton’s first game since they sacked Andy Spence. He was a manager I had known for a long time, who had worked at the club for well over 10 years in various roles, and it is a club that is close to my heart, but I felt his departure was an important for this league. Though Arsenal got rid of Pedro Martínez Losa last October, there is no real tradition of mid-season managerial change in women’s football but in the new professional set-ups it is right that professional managers are held to professional standards. There has to be accountability in football, and as we’ve seen with Fulham in the Premier League the team that are bottom at this stage of the season will often look to make a change. I’m not taking Andy’s departure lightly, and I don’t want women’s football to go to the extremes we sometimes see in the men’s game, but it was his second season and he probably had targets to hit. Defeat to Yeovil was the final nail in the coffin. A full-time, professional role such as this will be attractive across the sport now: standards in women’s football are rising, the perception of women’s football and women’s sport in general is much healthier, and there will be many coaches – men and women, English and foreign – who see the Everton job as an attractive prospect. For me, sad as it is to see Everton struggling, this is more evidence that this is a new era for women’s football and that is exciting.In the summer Lauren Hemp, an exciting 18-year-old English forward, moved from Bristol to Manchester City. On Saturday the winning goal in a 2-1 victory over Liverpool was scored by Ella Rutherford, another exciting 18-year-old English forward. Bristol seem to keep producing these electric strikers. It was Rutherford’s first goal for Bristol after signing from Millwall in the summer but their other goalscorer, Lucy Graham, now has seven to her name and she is only 22. It was Bristol’s third win of the season, enough to put them safely in mid-table, and Tanya Oxtoby has been doing an awesome job with them in her first season in charge. It’s also quite refreshing to see one of the league’s less-fancied names like Bristol beat Liverpool – it’s not a scoreline you often see in football. It was Liverpool’s third defeat in a row and though the first two of that run, against Chelsea and Manchester City, were maybe to be expected, this one will hurt them. Their next game is against Birmingham, so it’s not going to get any easier."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ccb9e20ecdab57671159f625bf51894eac0b97/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6e7363c927b96a6b0f5d53b005880c","title":"tell us who do you share your home with","story":"As part of a new series in the ’s Weekend magazine we are looking for interesting pairs who live togetherOur notion of the traditional household is changing.

What’s behind the trend, and can exercise really change your shape?The hottest gym in LA right now is Bünda: Portuguese slang for bum, the “home of the better butt” – a gym entirely dedicated to working your posterior. It promises a “total body change”: “Once you Bünda, you will never look back … well, maybe for a selfie.”The trend has hit UK gyms, too, with a number now offering a range of classes focused only on glutes, from “BadAss” to the “Kylie Butt Lift” – named after Minogue, not Jenner. But it is the rise and rise of Jenner and the Kardashian family, whose bottoms have grown with their bank balances, that has led to a seismic shift in workout culture. While many women have, of course, always taken pride in well developed glutes, the emphasis on a firm, or “juicy”, bottom has now overtaken the flat stomach as the fitness holy grail in mainstream women’s health magazines.Instagram is the biggest platform for the trend, with #squats having reached 16.3m mentions and #glutes 4.6m as fitness influencers such as Tammy Hembrow and Katya Elise Henry profit from millions of followers wanting to know how to achieve their own butt transformations. With the Kardashians’ big bums and tiny waists the beauty benchmark for many young women, despite their multiple rumoured surgical enhancements, fitness trainers are finding that their clients increasingly approach them with unrealistic demands.“People bring me a photo of the bum they want, and I have to say: ‘OK, let me talk you through the picture’,” says personal trainer Kelechi Okafor. “They did not do this from training. These people manage to have humungous backsides, but their thighs, hamstrings and calf muscles are non-existent. I’m having to take a step back from taking on so many clients because it is so draining dealing with people’s expectations.”Some fitness experts say the trend is not just about aesthetics, and endorse glute-activation warm-ups as the best way to start a workout and get the body firing on all cylinders. Pilates trainer Hollie Grant says any form of glute activation helps people to bring their pelvis back to a more neutral position. “Most people have lazy glutes because, when they are sitting down, it lengthens and stretches the glute muscle. That has the effect of switching it off.”Grant enthuses about the benefits of strong glutes in preventing knee injuries and back problems, and also for postnatal women whose gluteal muscles have lengthened during pregnancy as a result of the relaxin hormone. “Plus, when your glutes are firing, you’re quicker at running and more powerful at doing squats and deadlifts.”Jim Pate, head physiotherapist at the Centre for Health and Human Performance in London, agrees that getting our glutes active is positive. “Glute exercises such as squats, deadlifts and lunges are good because they are compound – meaning they use many muscle groups, including the core.”But both Grant and Pate warn that the idea of “spot training” to isolate and train just one part of the body is a fallacy. “Over-focusing on one muscle group is going to mean that other areas are neglected and will remain undeveloped or, worse, will deteriorate if neglected over time,” says Pate. “Imbalances in different muscle groups’ strengths that are used together can result in poor functional performance or injury. An all-round programme will result in better, more sustainable results than passing fads.”With all the focus on women’s bottoms, there is a small group of health professionals hoping for a positive impact on the less visible muscles in and around our glutes: the pelvic floor. Amal Hassan, a sports and exercise medicine doctor, is one of the founding members of the Pelvic Floor Patrol, which aims to improve health services for women with pelvic floor dysfunction.“Your glutes support your pelvic floor,” she says. “So if you’re at risk of pelvic floor dysfunction and you’re not firing your glutes in functional movements – so sitting to stand, going upstairs – those deep pelvic muscles can become tight and cause pelvic pain, pain on sex, or propagate symptoms of incontinence or prolapse through weakness.” Even so, glute activation can be difficult to achieve, and Hassan advises using a resistance band to pinpoint the correct muscles.Additionally, she says, postnatal women should first prime the pelvic floor – by exhaling and lifting the muscles – before attempting loaded glute work such as weighted squatting, deadlifting, or even standing in the saddle at a spin class. Untucking the bottom can also help with posture.Okafor is dismissive of the idea this is a “body positive” movement just because it allows for a few curves. “We’re told this trend is progressive and inclusive, but body shaming and fat shaming is still going on. It’s not as if now that bigger bums are in we’re embracing everybody. It’s only a particular aesthetic that’s acceptable. What is progressive about that? We’re just creating real-life Barbie dolls.”Both in the UK and the US, many black fitness professionals are angered by the fitness industry’s new interest in larger bottoms that has led to, for instance, tennis star Serena Williams – her body a product of her sporting talent and discipline – grossly caricatured, while the same attributes in white women are considered desirable. “Remember when Caroline Wozniacki stuck towels down her skirt making fun of Serena?” says Okafor. “When it’s on a black woman it’s something we all laugh at – ‘look at this barbaric woman with her big bum’ – but a non-black woman with the same body is profitable.” Chrissy King, a personal trainer and powerlifter based in Milwaukee, who blogs about intersectional fitness, says “It’s the profitability of this cultural appropriation that is the burn. White women have been able to take something that black women have always had, popularise it and make money from it when black women can’t.”So should we rush out and join an ass class? The fitness professionals agree that strong gluteals are important for a well-functioning body. But as King asks her clients: “Do you want a bigger butt because, societally, you think this will make you feel more accepted? To me, this just feels like another example of fitness capitalising on women’s insecurities about their bodies.”Like Okafor, King is battling the way society pressures women to exercise to look a certain way, rather than focusing on fitness and strength for health and functionality. She despairs of the approach of many personal trainers and fitness influencers on social media. “I see the same things all the time – fitness videos filmed at an angle that shows their butt from behind.” She laughs. “Personally, I film my squatting videos for technique. No one would ever judge a squat technique from behind.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29154973f074960f0af69cc6dd7f29cd56de0967/0_50_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09e9e989b476cafc49db8d6d0e45625a","title":"guardian passes 1m mark in reader donations katharine viner","story":"Business model showing way for journalism to ‘regain its relevance’, says editor-in-chiefMore than a million people worldwide have contributed to the  in the last three years, with 500,000 paying to support the publication on an ongoing basis, according to  News and Media’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.She said the business model was showing a new way for journalism to “regain its relevance, meaning and trusted place in society”.Viner told the Society of Editors’ annual conference in Salford that many contributors donated specifically because they wanted the  to stay free and outside a paywall, so “progressive journalism can have the widest possible impact”.“Many readers didn’t understand the challenging commercial reality facing all news organisations, but once we told them more, they expressed real interest in wanting to support the ,” she said. “This was helped by the fact that any money made by the  has to be spent on journalism, because of our ownership structure with no shareholders or owner.“This entirely new revenue stream of monthly and one-off contributions is now a crucial part of our plan to get the  to break even by next April.

The former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre criticised Rusbridger in his lecture on Sunday night.“His record on investigations in the public interest was exceptional, a model for how to hold the powerful to account,” Viner said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9decace90bb0a15a7e8889e2046f27a3ce61b2be/0_72_6585_3951/master/6585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02a76ce2cdd66493d5bfd7d4376ac655","title":"support guardian readers future journalism","story":"By supporting our journalism, you can become part of a global community of over a million  readers with a shared set of core values and a vision for a more hopeful worldThank you to the 1,000,000  readers who have offered us their support over the past three years.

But we are still a long way off from making our way to the red planetSpace flight is now a venerable industry. Humanity’s first space explorer, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, orbited around the globe on 12 April 1961, more than half a century ago, when Britain remained a colonial power and people were still using halfpennies to buy their fish and chips.Since then, more than 550 people have blasted themselves into the deep black abyss, although not all agree on how far up you need to go until you hit space, so there is no internationally accepted figure. Only a 10th of those have been women, in big part due to sexist policies by Nasa and Russia’s Roscosmos space agency.The Soviet Union pulled ahead with the first space walks, but US president John F Kennedy’s announcement that America would put a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s focused the space race squarely on that goal. Apollo 11 touched down on our dusty grey neighbour on 20 July 1969.A total of 12 men walked on the moon over the next few years, all Americans, but no one has been back there since 1972. In fact, no one has left the outskirts of the Earth since then.We imagine astronauts floating in free space or bouncing in moon craters, yet the majority of those lucky enough have instead spun around in low Earth’s orbit – between 99 and a few hundred miles high. That’s where the vast array of communications and navigation satellites live, speeding at thousands of miles an hour to avoid plummeting back to earth.Even though we did not go back to deep space, humans have begun to live and work outside the Earth’s atmosphere, often conducting experiments on themselves to determine the effects of weightlessness, or microgravity, on the human body.By 1986, the Soviet Union had launched the Mir space station. When it eventually fell to Earth (thankfully unoccupied) and burned up, our current space outpost, the International Space Station (ISS), was launched. Since 2000, humans have been living in space constantly. There are three up there at the moment, speeding around the globe once every 90 minutes.A lot, and until we properly understand how weightlessness affects humans, we won’t be able to send this era’s pioneers further afield to places such as Mars or wandering asteroids. Scott Kelly, a US former fighter pilot and long-time Nasa astronaut, spent a year bouncing around the cramped capsules of the ISS in an attempt to understand the long-term impact of space flight. He doesn’t hold the record for the most extended foray into the void – that is claimed by Gennady Padalka, who spent two and half years of his life up there on several missions – but the Kelly experiment had a natural advantage over others: he has a twin.Comparing their bodies throughout, scientists were able to assess how bones, muscles and other parts of the body deteriorate in space. There is even a gym on the ISS where astronauts can keep their muscles – no longer needed to prop them up – from slowly wasting away. But they need to wear a harness to keep them from floating off the treadmill. One big issue is that eye problems develop, but Kelly found his body recovered fast on return. He and his twin seemed in similar shape – good news for future deep space missions.Only three countries, China, Russia and the US, have human space programmes as it remains prohibitively expensive. However, they have provided lifts for space travellers from 40 countries, including a member of the Saudi royal family and even paying customers, such as South African millionaire Mark Shuttleworth, aged just 28.Astronomical. The ISS is the most expensive machine ever constructed with a price tag at around $150bn (£115bn). Nasa’s space shuttle programme, which kicked off in the early 1970s by promising safe and affordable access to space, hoped to cost just a few tens of million dollars per launch. But as the shuttle was thrown in the scrapyard in 2011, the agency estimated the total cost at $209bn — nearly $1.6bn per flight.Following the big fight over the shuttle, which looked fantastic but also restricted space adventuring to Earth’s orbit as well as costing a fortune, the US took a side seat in launches. Most astronauts are now sent by the Russian space agency, which sells round-trip rides on its Soyuz spacecraft for between $21m and $82m.Anyone involved in space travel will scoff at this, but it’s a good question, and space agencies often don’t communicate their achievements enough. Almost every sector of human progress has benefited from sending people into space. Just the act of attempting the feat forced scientists to invent new systems. The Apollo guidance computer was a predecessor to the microcomputer, now found in all smartphones. Clothes are more fire-resistant because of research on space fires. Remotely monitoring the health of astronauts has led to revolutionary systems for helping patients on Earth. Diseases behave and develop differently in microgravity, which assists scientists in finding cures.The first space race was part of the chest-beating of the cold war, but since then human space exploration has been more about countries working together than against each other. The ISS is a massive collaboration between five space agencies (Nasa, Roscosmos, Japan’s Jaxa, the pan-European agency ESA and the Canadian Space Agency) and was assembled over a period of 13 years from 1998, slowly adding capsules like Lego.A big exception to this is China, which has gone it alone with its space ambitions, never sending an astronaut to the ISS. In 2006, Beijing reportedly tested lasers against US imaging satellites in what appeared to be an attempt to blind or damage them, and US lawmakers later banned cooperation between Nasa and China’s state agency.However, the future of any effective human space flight is certainly likely to be cooperative rather than antagonistic. Since 2011, national spaces agencies in 14 countries have attempted to coordinate their dreams into a single vision. The most recent plan, published in January this year, said they had agreed to “expand human presence into the solar system, with the surface of Mars as a common driving goal”.Don’t start the countdown just yet. To get to Mars, most people in the human space flight community feel we need to first go back to the moon. “It’s the only logical step,” says Ian Crawford, professor of planetary science and astrobiology at Birkbeck, University of London. “I’m all in favour of sending people to Mars, but the technology, competence, the experience – I think it’s still out of reach”.The moon has several advantages. It’s only three days away, rather than a several-month round trip to Mars, and has been touted as a location for a research station similar to the one in Antarctica. From their celestial laboratory, scientists could study the impact of radiation exposure and near-weightlessness on the body at a closer distance to Earth, but still within deep space, all while preparing for trips further afield.Well. Not quite either. The Global Exploration Roadmap suggests first building a space station as an orbital base from which to send astronauts back and forth to the moon. This will look similar to the ISS except, instead of rushing around the Earth, it will orbit the moon.It is a mammoth feat and it would be wise to expect serious delays. “Where we go in space is decided by a combination of what people would like to do and the reality of time and budgets,” says Henry Hertzfeld, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, Washington DC, and a former policy analyst at Nasa. “The idea of putting people on Mars has been around for a long time. If you read the policies, it is clearly a long-term vision without a date. But we probably are still lacking the technology to keep people for a long time in deep space.”The US and Russia have been giving way to new players. In 2003, China became the third country to put a person into orbit and India plans to follow in 2022. But the sector-changing impact is undoubtedly coming from the private space.In what is being coined the “billionaire’s space race”, Elon Musk, founder of Telsa electric cars, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Virgin boss Richard Branson all want to send private citizens to space. Their companies, SpaceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic, are set on making human space travel cheaper.They join a handful of commercial space flight companies that already work as contractors for national space agencies. Aerospace industry titans Boeing and Lockheed Martin send heavy launchers into space, but that costs at least $350m per launch – several times more expensive than SpaceX’s new $90m Falcon Heavy system.SpaceX has around $10bn worth of launches already booked and saves costs through reusable spacecraft, where even the rocket boosters land themselves back on the ground and can be dusted off for reuse.And while it is looking increasingly likely that the ISS will be defunded in the next decade, several private ventures are considering either taking over or rebuilding their own space stations.As government agencies prioritise the moon, others are looking straight at Mars. Musk has said his life goal is to create a thriving Mars colony as a fail-safe for humanity in case of a catastrophic event on Earth, such as a nuclear war or Terminator-style artificial intelligence coup. For this, SpaceX is developing the Big Falcon Rocket (BFR), which he claims could send crewed flights to the red planet by mid-2020.Musk says the BFR is partly inspired by Tintin’s rocket and will be the biggest ever made at close to 40 storeys high and capable of ferrying as many as 100 passengers per trip, depending on how much luggage they want to put in the hold.As well as a healthy satellite launch business, SpaceX is raising money by selling tickets on the BFR for a trip, some would say a jolly, around the moon. Yusaku Maezawa, a Japanese fashion billionaire and art collector, is funding such a mission slated for 2023 and says he is going to invite artists with him for the week-long trip to re-engage the public in the wonder of our universe.An astronaut’s guide to life on Earth, Chris HadfieldTo space and back, Sally RideEndurance: A year in space, a lifetime of discovery, Scott Kelly"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/861dc014078b095b54c388646741dbb9635366f5/0_597_4432_2658/master/4432.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2ab3413de2a80a6b7f9cdc7be9fe9e6","title":"alex rodriguez interview aaron judge uk boston red sox new york yankees london baseball","story":"Alex Rodriguez is famous. Very famous. You’d probably know that Alex Rodriguez is famous without knowing who he is. He’s one of those people who, in that abstract way, just looks famous. He is probably still one of the most famous sportsmen in America, and certainly one of – if not the most – famous baseball players.Which is a problem considering he retired in 2016. Rodriguez was – still is – a cross-cultural celebrity in a way that most of the current crop of Major League Baseball players are not. Being one of the best players the game has ever seen helped, as did a history with performance-enhancing drugs, a very public private life and a feisty on-field persona. But if you asked an average American who did not regularly follow the sport to name a baseball player, there is a good chance they would say Rodriguez, rather than anyone still playing.It is not a particular surprise then, that “A-Rod” is the man MLB chose to publicise next summer’s games in the UK, when the New York Yankees (his old team) and their great rivals, and current World Series holders, the Boston Red Sox face each other twice in London. But how difficult is it to sell a new sport to a country with little cultural history with it, without many “stars” to help?“We have to lead with our best players and start telling stories,” says Rodriguez, sitting in a room overlooking the London Stadium, which will host the two games. “Aaron Judge is the one who jumps out of the screen because he’s like a Game of Thrones character.Judge, the Yankees outfielder who was MLB’s rookie of the year in 2017, is perhaps the best candidate to be the next “face of baseball”, but there are not many others. Mike Trout, the LA Angels outfielder, regarded by some as not just the best current player but among the greatest of all time, could probably walk down Broadway and not turn many heads. Likewise Bryce Harper, who this winter could sign a contract worth $400m with whoever has that sort of cash lying around, and Mookie Betts, the Red Sox’s leader and reigning American League MVP.It could be they just do not want to be famous. Perhaps it is detrimental to their game. Rodriguez pauses for a moment when asked if it would have benefited his game had he been less famous. “I wish a lot of things were different that would have made me a better player,” he says, carefully. “If I was advising a young Aaron Judge or a young Alex Rodriguez, I would certainly say that less is more. It would have probably made me better and also my team better as well.”But maybe iniduals are not needed for baseball to take hold in the UK – maybe the spectacle itself is enough, starting with the fiercest and longest-running rivalry in the sport. “These are two titans,” says Rodriguez. “It’s goliath versus goliath. Any time the Red Sox win – and they’ve won a lot of late – it makes it even more interesting. The Yankees want to be the biggest and the baddest. They have been for over a century, with 27 championships, so they’re really inspired and motivated to take the throne back.“When you think about history in sports in America, part of that is Yankees v Red Sox. It’s been almost 120 years of a rivalry. My first game ever at was as an 18-year-old at Fenway Park, and I’ve been going back for over 25 years – I’ve never been to a game that hasn’t been sold out. It’s hard to describe the electricity. We’re leading with our best, and we’re coming here with the best America has to offer.”What then for baseball in the UK? The Red Sox and the Yankees is easy enough to sell, but they cannot come back every year. Cleveland against Kansas City might tax the marketing department a little more.Still, Rodriguez seems pretty confident that Britain doesn’t need celebrity like his to sell the game. “Baseball is made for Brits. You guys love history. I think you guys are going to fall in love with it.”The Boston Red Sox will play the New York Yankees at the London Stadium on 29-30 June.

Huw Jones embodied both traits in their 26-20 defeat by South Africa at Murrayfield, laying on a try for Pete Horne but being stripped of possession for one of the Springboks’ scores. A first home loss for a year has not disheartened Gregor Townsend, who believes his team are still learning by the match, but the depth of their squad will be tested when the head coach makes changes for the visit of Argentina this weekend. South Africa go to Wales and must wait to find out if their captain Siya Kolisi is cited after what appeared to be a headbutt on Horne. Stuart BathgateWales have for most of this decade struggled against tier-two opponents in the autumn, making wholesale changes and finding too many of their reserves are not up to scratch. Not any more and as their head coach, Warren Gatland, contemplates a first clean-sweep autumn with his side seeking a fourth successive victory over South Africa in Cardiff, he is facing a rare dilemma before the World Cup. In the past, selection for the tournament has been a matter of finding players to make up the 31. His problem now will be who to leave out and as someone who has never been afraid to make bold choices, high-profile players know that reputation will not be enough to secure their place. Paul ReesThe way people were reeling and careening around Dublin on Sunday morning, it felt like the earth might have tilted beneath our feet. And maybe it really did. Steve Hansen thinks the ground has shifted. Ireland, he said, are now the best team in the world. Some thought he was kidding. It can be hard to tell when he’s pulling your leg, and after all the All Blacks will still be top of the rankings on Monday morning, just like they have been every week for the last 469 weeks. But consider this: in the last 18 months, the All Blacks have lost four Tests and drawn another, while Ireland have been beaten only once. Hansen might not have been playing mind games so much as just telling the plain truth. Andy BullJapan have profited from their greater exposure to tier-one nations. England provided their 12th such opponent since the last World Cup, and while the Brave Blossoms are clearly profiting from hosting next year’s tournament, the international fixture schedule from 2020 will guarantee emerging countries more matches against the leading sides. Japan are in the same World Cup pool as Ireland and so are in effect playing for second place. Scotland will be their target and while Gregor Townsend’s side are improving, their away form remains unimpressive and they will face a side who are robust in contact and innovative in attack. England were on the ropes in the opening half, Alex Lozowski’s tackle on Michael Leitch at the end of it almost match-turning. Paul ReesFrance’s third victory of the year was typically hard-earned and not sealed until the final 12 minutes. The wing Teddy Thomas is back in favour after being dropped for disciplinary reasons, along with the No 8 Louis Picamoles and flanker Arthur Iturria, after February’s defeat in Scotland. He scored two tries as France showed more ambition in their 28-13 victory than last season. The second was created by Gaël Fickou, a centre who has yet to fulfil his early promise. Here his ability to draw defenders and create space gave France an added dimension, but they remain some way behind Ireland and Wales. Argentina had pushed Ireland hard the week before but they are still seeking a balance between tight and loose. Paul ReesA taxing year for the Wallabies ends at Twickenham on Saturday when they will renew acquaintances with Eddie Jones. They duly recorded an expected victory over Italy, but not before they had been given an early refereeing reprieve and they lost their No 8 David Pocock with a stinger that makes him doubtful for the England game. They look a side in need of a break rather than another match, but they showed up in patches and in Taniela Tupou, making his second Test start, they had a lively, ball-handling tight-head who was surprisingly light on his feet for someone who is more than 21 stone. It was another hard-luck story for Italy, gallant and impressive at times but prone to familiar lapses in concentration. Paul ReesRichard Blaze, the former Leicester lock, has been brought into the England women’s set-up as forwards coach this season and his work is paying idends. The Red Roses pack were impressive in the 27-19 victory over Canada in Doncaster on Sunday with a driving maul that would have gone down well at Welford Road. England have some new forwards who will make a big impact in the coming years. The young Saracens tight-head prop Hannah Botterman is a force in the loose and the switch of Shaunagh Brown from the back row to the front row will give Blaze more options in his pack. Brown, a replacement in Doncaster, brings an extra athleticism to the pack. Canada are no pushovers up front but England, with Abbie Scott and Sarah Hunter making a big impression again this autumn, are a match for any pack in women’s rugby. Ian MalinJacob Stockdale’s for Ireland paid homage to Beauden Barrett’s try against Australia, Jesse Kriel and Peter Horne finished slick moves at Murrayfield and Michael Leitch scattered defenders at Twickenham, but an off-loading orgy in Cardiff ended with Aled Davies skipping out of tackles.\u0026nbspAny one from a number in green but Peter O’Mahony was a giant among giants. Strong over the ball, he forced a number of turnovers, saved a certain try when anticipating Barrett’s kick and foiling Ben Smith, and read the game adroitly. A selfless, old-fashioned blindside flanker who gets his hands dirty.Jérôme Garcès’s decision to review Sam Underhill’s try at Twickenham was further vindicated in Padova when another French referee, Pascal Gaüzère, penalised Tito Tebaldi for offside when he intercepted after a lineout against Australia and scored. Replays showed the Italy scrum-half was onside, leaving his coach, Conor O’Shea, to lament the inconsistency.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/566eb1ac8474a6262a9fba8bbce97a46791f2a07/0_367_1486_891/master/1486.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3f8eddb740ecc12cc0c35c3cb0239cb","title":"sheikh ahmad al sabah stands down ioc forgery allegations olympic","story":"Sheikh Ahmad al-Sabah, whose influence and wealth made him one of the most powerful figures in the Olympic movement and football’s governing body, Fifa, has stood down as an International Olympic Committee member pending an ethics committee hearing into allegations of forgery.The 55-year-old Kuwaiti, a softly spoken man with distinctive curly shoulder length hair who is never knowingly without his bodyguards, has been an IOC member since 1992 and chairs the Olympic Solidarity Commission which controls how money generated by the Games is allocated to national Olympic committees.He is also the president of the Olympic Council of Asia and the Association of National Olympic Committees and was increasingly seen as a kingmaker in the corridors of the IOC, having helped deliver victories for Tokyo 2020, president Thomas Bach and wrestling in recent years.However Sheikh Ahmad’s reputation took a knock last year when he resigned from Fifa’s ruling council after being linked with Richard Lai, the Fifa audit and compliance committee member who was banned for bribery.And on Monday he stepped down from his IOC roles following allegations by Swiss prosecutors that he and four others made fake videos as part of a plot against two Kuwaiti government officials.In a statement Sheikh Ahmad said he would be “willing and ready to attend the hearing as and when decided”.“Sheikh Ahmad has every confidence and trust in the Swiss courts and IOC Ethics Commission’s impartial due processes and that he will be completely exonerated,” it added. “It should be remembered that Sheikh Ahmad has had the honour of being an IOC member for 26 years and he fully intends to continue serving the IOC again at the earliest opportunity.”Last year when Sheikh Ahmad resigned from Fifa’s ruling council after being linked to Lai’s bribery and corruption case in the United States he “vigorously” denied any wrongdoing – and said he was stepping down to avoid becoming a distraction at Fifa.Court documents in Lai’s case did not directly name Sheikh Ahmad but referred to someone who “at various times” was a “high-ranking official of Fifa, the Kuwait Football Association, and the Olympic Council of Asia”.In a second statement announcing his resignation, Sheikh Ahmad said it was in Fifa’s “best interests” for him to go. Lai, who admitted taking $950,000 in bribes in a US court, later agreed to pay more than $1.1m in forfeiture and penalties."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/224e7b45b5f330b6fac23ff938745ac79c74ae1e/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db8b0677544469135de5049b0147b2c6","title":"magnus carlsen v fabiano caruana world chess championship game 8 live","story":"Carlsen takes nine minutes before responding with 12. ... f5.

Hello and welcome to London for today’s eighth game of the world chess championship between Norway’s Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana of the United States. Play resumes today after with the best-of-12-games match deadlocked at 3½-all following seven consecutive peaceful results.Carlsen, 27, has been ranked No 1 for eight straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he defeated Viswanathan Anand for the title in 2013. Caruana, 26, is ranked No 2, having earned his place at the table by winning the candidates tournament in March. No American-born player has won or even competed for the world title since Bobby Fischer in 1972.\u0026nbspIt marks the first title match between the world\u0027s top two players since 1990, when Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov faced off for a fifth and final time.\u0026nbspThe match will consist of 12 classical games with each player awarded one point for a win and a half-point for a draw. Whoever reaches six and a half points first will be declared the champion.The time control for each game is 100 minutes for the first 40 moves, 50 minutes for the next 20 moves and then 15 minutes for the rest of the game plus an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 1. Players cannot agree to a draw before Black\u0027s 30th move.\u0026nbspIf the match is tied after 12 games, tie-breaks will be played on the final day in the following order:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp• Best of four rapid games with 25 minutes for each player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp• If still tied, they will play up to five mini-matches of two blitz games (five minutes for each player with a three-second increment).\u0026nbsp• If all five mini-matches are drawn, one sudden-death \u0027Armegeddon\u0027 match will be played where White receives five minutes and Black receives four minutes.

The next four – last Saturday’s Game 2, Monday’s Game 3 and Tuesday’s Game 4 and Thursday’s Game 5 – were mostly safer, conservative affairs. Then came Friday’s Game 6, where Carlsen was outplayed by Caruana in the middlegame and pushed to the limit before saving a draw with incredibly precise defending under pressure. They played to another draw in yesterday’s Game 7, one that left a somewhat downtrodden Carlsen lamenting his gun-shy play and missed chances to be more aggressive in the aftermath.This is Carlsen’s second consecutive world title defense that’s opened with seven straight draws. The 2016 match with Russia’s Sergey Karjakin unfolded the same way until Carlsen’s gamble for a win with white in the eighth game backfired and he was made to resign under time pressure, only to hit back with a six-and-a-half-hour grind on Thanksgiving Day that forced the tie-breaker where he retained his title for a second time.Will we finally get a decisive result today? We’ll soon find out with Game 8 kicking off at the top of the hour.Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here’s his report from Sunday’s seventh game, which left a somewhat downtrodden Carlsen lamenting his missed opportunities to be more aggressive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/746888c0e985a5b1c026f89485d5af0cd4915b6f/0_211_6854_4112/master/6854.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3096a19d20e9a7e430565eb890319d40","title":"cinderella review coliseum oldham panto","story":"Coliseum, OldhamKevin Shaw’s colourful panto is an enjoyable sugar rush seemingly powered by E-numbersFine Time Fontayne and Simeon Truby make their first entrance as the Ugly Sisters wearing purple and orange. The colour clash is par for the course in a show seemingly powered by E-numbers, one where designer Celia Perkins never lets a turquoise go by without pairing it with a lurid pink. In place of hats, the sisters have wafers as if they’re a pair of upturned ice creams, colourful balls of confectionery cascading down their frocks. You couldn’t eat a whole one.The sugar-rush design typifies Kevin Shaw’s production. This panto is a lovingly made dessert, its ingredients bright, bold and possibly bad for your teeth. It’s too good-natured not to enjoy, but almost entirely lacking in savoury notes.In particular, the script by Fontayne and Shaw has a blink-and-you-miss-it economy that irons out the jeopardy. The reason Shorelle Hepkin’s Cinderella is forgiving of her sisters is supposedly her sweet temperament, but, early on, she has little to forgive them for. Likewise, there’s nothing at stake in the prince’s ball because nobody tells her about the midnight-pumpkin rule until her time is up. And, rather than the Ugly Sisters and their stepmother (an excellent Sue Devaney) accepting a punishment, they blandly promise to do better.Although the spirited song-and-dance routines and he’s-behind-you participation keep the energy up, we could do with a clearer sense of who is guiding us through the story.

Next year, she will direct the European premiere of a play based on Khaled Hosseini’s novel A Thousand Splendid Suns in Birmingham.“Hampstead theatre is where I fell in love with new plays,” she said. “When I first arrived in London from a city with no producing theatre and a school with no drama department, I had very little experience of theatre. I saw every production there for the first five years of my London life, usually more than once. My first job was as a Hampstead script reader. My career as director of new plays is almost entirely due to Hampstead theatre. It is very dear to my heart – so to be its new artistic director is just wonderful.”Silbert also becomes Hampstead’s joint chief executive alongside Greg Ripley-Duggan, who has been at the theatre since 2010.The Hampstead Theatre Club opened in 1959, around the corner from Hampstead underground station, and was founded by the director James Roose-Evans. Three years later, it relocated to a studio space in Swiss Cottage. Since 2003, it has been based nearby in a new building. The theatre comprises a main house and a downstairs stage, devoted to new writing, that Edward Hall opened in 2010. Several of its mainhouse productions, including the Kinks musical Sunny Afternoon, have transferred to the West End its recent hits have included Tony Kushner’s Caroline, Or Change, which transferred to Hampstead from Chichester Festival theatre and opens in the West End later this month.Angela Maxwell, chair of the board of trustees at Birmingham Rep, said Silbert is leaving the theatre in a strong position. “Her drive and commitment in promoting ersity, championing accessibility for artists and audiences, and maintaining the Rep’s longstanding value of nurturing and premiering new work has been second to none.”Silbert’s first season at Hampstead, in September 2019, will mark the 60th birthday celebrations of the theatre."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc3df6978171a599a7301b3270046e2fb801c00e/0_267_5228_3137/master/5228.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32751f896ec382d1aa4b00fab7b8b7f6","title":"facebook gives 45m to fund 80 local newspaper jobs in uk media","story":"Social media firm to finance trainee ‘community’ journalists schemeFacebook will donate £4.5m to fund 80 local newspaper jobs for the next two years, as the company faces further questions over its relationship with the media and long-term impact on the news business.The social networking company will make the money available to subsidise the cost of trainee journalists based in newsrooms across Britain with the objective of providing “reporting from towns which have lost their local newspaper and beat reporters”.Facebook has always previously insisted it is more interested in working with publishers to build their revenue rather than giving direct cash transfers to pay for journalists. This scheme, the first time Facebook has attempted such a scheme anywhere in the world, is being arranged in the form of a cash donation to the National Council for the Training of Journalists, a registered charity.The organisation will then ide it up in coordination with the local publishers, with trainee journalists on the scheme given formal training and then employed directly by local newspapers for the duration of the two-year pilot scheme.“Our experience of working with Facebook has been a very positive one,” said the NCTJ chief executive, Joanne Butcher, who acknowledged there were concerns in the publishing industry about the company’s impact on the news business.“The view I have is that Facebook is sincere in its hope that this will lead to the creation of more relevant, timely local news. In terms of our charitable objectives we are there to attract, train, and qualify outstanding journalists.”As yet, there are no details of where the jobs will be based, although recruitment for the new positions is expected to start from January. The scheme will place an emphasis on finding trainees from a range of socio-economic backgrounds and include school leavers, in a bid to make newsrooms more representative of the audiences they serve. Salaries are expected to reflect trainee status the NCTJ says a typical wage for such a job is about £17,500 a year.Regional newspaper groups insisted they would continue to run their own trainee schemes and not simply use the new reporters – who are expected to focus on “community” reporting rather than court or specialist journalism – to replace existing jobs.Five of the largest regional publishers, which cover outlets in most major cities, will be invited to apply to the fund: Reach, Newsquest, Midlands News Association, Archant and JPI Media, the new owner of the defunct Johnston Press titles, which went into administration at the weekend.“We know that we’re in a difficult industry,” said Laura Adams, the content director at Archant, which publishes titles including the Eastern Daily Press and Islington Gazette. “Our teams have shrunk and we’ve had to make many different efficiencies but this is positive because we can invest.”Google, which is separately battling regulation of its Google News service, has given cash sums to publishers for many years through its News Initiative programme.Traditional publishers have an uneasy relationship with Facebook and Google, which some blame for taking away the advertising revenue that previously subsidised large regional newsrooms. However, both send substantial traffic to websites, with publishers becoming increasingly reliant on them for readers.Facebook helped revolutionise the news industry during the early part of the decade with chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg’s vision of a personalised newspaper, sending enormous numbers of readers towards stories as publishers reconfigured their newsrooms to ride the viral publishing boom.But a series of scandals involving misinformation on the network, in the wake of Donald Trump’s election as US president and the 2016 EU referendum, has caused it to re-evaluate its role in the news ecosystem – meaning many publishers have seen a decrease in the numbers of readers referred by the social network.On Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Zuckerberg told a staff meeting that the company was suffering from “bad morale” as a result of “bullshit” attacks in the media, and reiterated his willingness to fire employees who leaked information. The remarks were then leaked to the media."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7b7c5de6b16c53c52520ff54d4432787be9caa7/77_0_3281_1969/master/3281.jpg?width=160\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=170797696b8a3c681aa8df6b022a96ff 320w","title":"mark zuckerberg faces more calls to attend facebook misinformation hearing","story":"Brazil, Latvia and Singapore join coalition of parliaments seeking answers from Facebook chiefThree more countries have joined an “international grand committee” of parliaments, adding to calls for Facebook’s boss, Mark Zuckerberg, to give evidence on misinformation to the coalition.Brazil, Latvia and Singapore bring the total to eight different parliaments across the world, with plans to send representatives to London on 27 November with the intention of hearing from Zuckerberg.Since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke, the Facebook chief has only appeared in front of two legislatures: the American Senate and House of Representatives, and the European parliament. Facebook has consistently rebuffed attempts from others, including the UK and Canadian parliaments, to hear from Zuckerberg.“We believe that there are important issues to be discussed, and that you are the appropriate person to answer them,” Damian Collins, the chair of the UK’s digital, culture, media and sport select committee, and convenor of the grand committee, wrote in a letter to Zuckerberg released on Monday.He added that an article in the New York Times on Thursday, in which the paper alleged a pattern of behaviour from Facebook to “delay, deny and deflect” negative news stories, “raises further questions about how recent data breaches were allegedly dealt with within Facebook.”The addition of Brazil to the mix, with a population of 209 million, means that the eight countries now represent a higher combined population than that of the US, at 389 million to 326 million people. The country has also been a flashpoint for disinformation on the site, with misinformation campaigns on Facebook and its messaging service WhatsApp being cited as a major contributor to the election of its far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, in early November.Ireland, one of the other countries in the committee, also has the potential to cause damage to Facebook the company’s international headquarters is based outside Dublin, and the Irish data protection authority is Facebook’s chief European regulator.Collins, in his latest letter, offered Zuckerberg the option of giving evidence via video link, if he was unable to arrive in London personally, adding: “We call on you once again to take up your responsibility to Facebook users, and to speak to their elected representatives.”Facebook did not reply to a request for comment from the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fb9851b2e020b80309f83b07ac0fcb7b47f4e99/0_280_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=523ed9e12d395602be590eda44f775bc","title":"tim cook tech firms prepare inevitable regulation cambridge analytica","story":"Apple CEO predicts Congress will pass laws targeting big US technology firmsBig US technology companies should brace themselves for “inevitable” regulation, according to Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook.Cook predicted the US would pass new laws targeting technology firms “at some point” to prevent the misuse of personal data, after a leak of Facebook user information to Cambridge Analytica that resulted in Mark Zuckerberg being hauled in front of Congress.“Generally speaking, I am not a big fan of regulation,” Cook told Axios. “I’m a big believer in the free market. But we have to admit when the free market is not working. And it hasn’t worked here. I think it’s inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.”Cook argued that tech companies should embrace new regulations. “This is not a matter of privacy versus profits, or privacy versus technical innovation,” he said. “That’s a false choice.”In March, Cook sharply rebuked Zuckerberg and Facebook’s business model, saying detailed profiles of iniduals compiled by internet platforms should not exist. He called for “some well-crafted regulations” to prevent the information of users being put together and passed on without their knowledge.The Apple boss has been sounding the alarm on mass data collection by Facebook and Google for years. He has been careful to distinguish between Apple’s business model – selling products to customers for a profit – and that of internet platforms that, he said, are “gobbling up everything they can learn about you and trying to monetise it”.In a speech in Brussels last month, Cook used even stronger language when he said mass data collection from companies such as Google and Facebook was “surveillance” and “weaponised against us with military efficiency”.It emerged in October that Google failed to disclose a data leak for months, fearing a regulatory clampdown: a bug in Google+ allowed third-party app developers to access the data not just of users who granted permission but also that of their friends."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ff8bba8c500347faf78fbf9dbde2c72a31597c0/0_307_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14e4bc68f35fbeb2e4d31a87677e7670","title":"share your caribbean highlights for the chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Send us a tip on affordable experiences in the Caribbean, be they places to stay, activities and attractions, or bars and restaurantsPalm-fringed beaches, rum punch and infectious reggae beats … Carnivals, rainforest and a laid-back vibe … The Caribbean is one of the world’s most alluring holiday destinations, and we want to hear your highlights – especially for those not on an A-lister budget.

It ended with no joint statement from the leaders – a first in Apec history – and with the fight for dominance in the Pacific region between Australia, the US and Japan on one side and China on the other, coming out into the open. Here are five key things that occurred over a dramatic weekend:As the leaders gathered in matching red and yellow satin shirts for the obligatory photograph, their smiles belied unresolved negotiations that occurred over the weekend. The agreement that usually comes out of these summits was thwarted by tensions between the US and China over trade and security, meaning that for the first time in Apec history, the summit closed without a joint statement from the leaders.Papua New Guinea prime minister Peter O’Neill said the breakdown in talks was due to “the two big giants in the room”.Tensions were always going to be high between the US and China, countries which have been involved in an escalating trade war and which are currently in a battle for influence in the Pacific region.This was the summit in which the unspoken tug-of-war for the Pacific came out into the open.Chinese president Xi Jinping was attending Apec as a guest of government and arrived days before other leaders touched down. He visited roads and a school, built with Chinese money, and held a meeting with Pacific Island leaders, all of which were seen of ways for China to shore up support in a region that it has identified as geo-politically crucial.Speaking to business leaders he also raised the prospect of a “hot war” in the region.“History has shown that confrontation — whether in form of cold war, hot war or trade war — will produce no winners,” he said.Meanwhile, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison hosted a barbecue with Pacific Island leaders at the Australian high commission.Mike Pence, the US vice president, used a speech at the summit to implicitly warn Pacific nations off accepting financial help from China. He said infrastructure loans, which have been deployed by Beijing with Pacific countries, had “opaque” terms, and threatened the sovereignty of small nations.During the summit, Tonga confirmed that the Chinese government was allowing it to defer repayments on a reported $160m loan received from China for building projects. The deferral is for five years and was announced just before onerous repayments were due to start.In what was seen as a clear attempt to block China’s influence in the Pacific, the US announced it would partner with Australia in developing the Lombrum naval base on Manus Island.The atmosphere was so fraught at the summit, and leaders were so keen to influence the final communique, that at one point Chinese officials attempted to “barge” into the office of PNG’s foreign minister in an 11th-hour bid to influence a draft summit communique.Police had to be called to stop the office invasion, three sources with knowledge of the situation told AFP. But a Chinese foreign ministry official, Zhang Xiaolong, denied the incident, telling reporters: “It’s not true. It’s simply not true.”One of the most controversial aspects of the preparation for the summit was the purchase of 40 Maseratis by the Papua New Guinean government to transport world leaders around for the summit.Questions were raised about whether the cars would actually be used during the summit after New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern said she would not travel in a Maserati during the summit and diplomatic sources told Reuters that most leaders would travel in special armoured vehicles.During the summit photographs emerged showing at least a dozen of the cars were sitting idle in a Port Moresby warehouse.The government claims the cars will be sold on afterwards, meaning they would recoup the money spent on them, but locals raised doubts that the luxury cars, which retail in Australia for between $209,000 and $345,000 each, would be able to be incorporated into the PNG economy, where car-jackings are common, the status symbol is a Land Rover, and Maseratis are unknown.There were numerous reports that non-Chinese media outlets were banned from reporting on meetings held by the Chinese president, who arrived early for meetings with the PNG prime minister and Pacific leaders.On Friday, ABC journalist Natalie Whiting reported that only China’s state broadcaster CCTV had been allowed to plug in to get audio of an event between President Xi and Prime Minister O’Neill.Later, non-Chinese media were kicked out of Xi’s meeting with Pacific Island leaders and bussed out away from the venue. This included media from the Pacific countries whose leaders were meeting with Xi. It was a move described by Reuters Beijing correspondent as “a real own goal for China, which is always banging on about mutual respect and trying to convince the public there’s nothing nefarious about their play for influence in the Pacific.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9db502d3f9b46eae09e35c58ab8593512d1add6/12_0_4720_2832/master/4720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23ec49a774ee68467fcba15a8d2ad091","title":"iran thrive us sanctions foreign minister javad zarif","story":"Javad Zarif insists restrictive measures will strengthen Iranian resolve to resistIran’s foreign minister has said his country will not only survive newly reimposed US sanctions but it will thrive.The Trump administration announced sanctions this month covering banking, oil exports and shipping, aimed at forcing Tehran to stop what the US described as its “destabilising activities” in the Middle East.Speaking after meeting the British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, in Tehran on Monday, Javad Zarif said: “We are used to pressure and we are used to resisting pressure. Sanctions always hurt and they hurt ordinary people, but sanctions seldom change policy, and that has been the problem with US sanctions all the time. They do not take people back to the negotiating table. In fact, they strengthen the resolve to resist.“We will certainly survive. We will not only survive – we will thrive. We have tried to minimise the impact on the population but the ordinary people are going to suffer, the economy is going to suffer.”Speaking to the , Zarif said he was confident the Iranian oil industry would find markets, even though the US measures have pushed down exports sharply. “There are always markets for oil, it depends on the conditions and the price,” he said. “I believe Iran will always sell oil.”Zarif also challenged claims by the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, that the sanctions had been constructed to exempt humanitarian supplies, such as food and medicine.“The US has imposed financial sanctions on Iran,” he said. “When you want to transfer money, the bank does not ask whether it goes for food or other items – that is why sanctions always hit food and medicine.“The US is not living up to its promises. We believe all sanctions are unlawful, and against UN security council resolutions, but the US is not even truthful to the commitment they have made.”Zarif said Iran was frustrated by the slow pace of EU moves to help European companies that want to continue trading with Iran.A clearing house known as a special purpose vehicle, designed to allow European companies that trade with Iran to bypass the sanctions, is due to be set up within the next few months. It has been seen as critical to reassuring Tehran that the EU wishes to reward Iran for signing the 2015 deal on its nuclear programme by expanding business with the country.“What is important is that Europe has made the political commitment but, unfortunately, so far as practicabilities are concerned, it has been very slow,” Zarif said. “Hunt gave me commitment that the UK believes in the nuclear deal, but we also need to see some action.”On Yemen, where Iran stands accused of stoking the civil war by backing Houthi rebels, Zarif said his country had been pushing for a ceasefire for years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d76b3ff9b15a121aca43a7d8476f1e8dd123e0df/0_52_2981_1788/master/2981.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65df5dcc82f7bcf75aaf4398f8a346ba","title":"israeli education minister naftali bennett vows not to resign in reprieve for netanyahu","story":"Naftali Bennett was expected to quit after Gaza truce but has given the PM another chanceBenjamin Netanyahu has won a reprieve from the threat of early elections in Israel after a senior member of his cabinet announced he would not resign and break up the coalition government.Naftali Bennett, the hardliner education minister, was widely expected to quit during a press conference on Monday morning but instead said in a surprise announcement that his Jewish Home party would give the prime minister another chance.Bennett, a security hawk, had considered following Netanyahu’s defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman, who left the Israeli government to protest against Netanyahu’s decision to agree to a truce with the rulers of Gaza, Hamas.The Tuesday ceasefire followed the most intense round of fighting since the war in 2014, as militants and Israeli forces battled each other with rockets and airstrikes.Bennett had threatened to bring down the government if he was not appointed defence minister, a portfolio Netanyahu gave to himself on Sunday. If the education minister had left, he would have stripped the prime minister of his parliamentary majority and triggered early polls.Netanyahu, who would become Israel’s longest-serving prime minister if he remains in power after July, had said in a last-minute appeal on Sunday that it would be “irresponsible” to dissolve the government and call early elections during the current period of volatility in Gaza.Bennett, who has been fiercely critical of Netanyahu but whose party’s support in parliament has prevented the leader from losing a one-seat majority, said he would delay during this tense time for the country.“If the prime minister is serious in his intentions, and I want to believe his words from last night, I am saying here to the prime minister we are removing at this moment all of our political demands and will help you in the huge mission of making Israel win again,” Bennett said in a statement that was broadcast live.He acknowledged his gambit to take the defence ministry had failed. “I know I’ll pay a political price – not the end of the world, you win some, you lose some,” Bennett said.Israeli governments serve four-year terms and Netanyahu must call elections by November 2019. However, the country’s political system often produces unstable coalition cabinets meaning polls would normally be held before full terms have been served, and the prime minister could still face an early challenge.A deadly Israeli military crackdown on a protest movement in Gaza, followed by bouts of violence with armed Palestinian groups this year, have led to calls from Israeli rightwingers for heavier action, even as senior army figures have warned against a war. Israel has fought three conflicts with Hamas during the past decade."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3702968.1542636103!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"parents of newborns to get seven weeks paid leave each by 2021","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister of State Mary Mitchell O’Connor, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Minister for Children Katherine Zappine and Minister for Children Simon Harris,  and friends at the launch of First 5, a new strategy for babies, young children and their families. Photograph: MaxwellsParents of new babies will be able to take up to 14 weeks of paid leave to care for their child in its first year by 2021, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has promised.The measure for fathers and mothers builds on the two weeks of paid parental leave announced in Budget 2019 - which takes effect from next year - and is additional to existing entitlements such as maternity benefit. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe, when presenting the Budget last month, said he hoped to extend the parental benefit “over time” but Mr Varadkar said this morning it would be achieved within three years.The measure is a central plank of First 5, a new Government strategy for babies, young children and their families unveiled today.The 10-year plan, which promises a broader range of options for parents working and caring, a new model of parenting support and a dedicated child health workforce, was launched by the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Minister for Health Simon Harris and Minister for Children Katherine Zappone in the Department of Children’s new headquarters on Baggot Street in Dublin.Research has consistently shown that interventions designed to improve the health, welfare and learning of a child work best the earlier they are delivered in its life.A new parenting unit is to be established in the Department to make available a “continuum” of services, ranging from universal to targets, including parenting programmes, according to Ms Zappone.A move to a graduate-led workforce for early learning and care, and the extension of supports to all paid childminders and school-age childcare services, will also form part of the plan, she said.Additional investment would continue to reduce the out of pocket cost of pre-school care to parents as well as compensating providers so they can deliver services on a sustainable and high-quality basis, she said.Minister for Social Protection Regina Doherty said additional funding will be provided for a hot school meals pilot programme to start next year. The pilot will apply to 7,200 children but if successful the scheme would be extended more widely in future years and put on a permanent basis.Mr Harris said he plans to develop a dedicated child health workforce, focused initially in areas of high population density and disadvantage. The Taoiseach said there could be no better investment by the Government than in the early years of a child’s life. “The Government wants to make life easier for families, while also providing children with the best possible start. The first five years of a child’s life only happen once, but the impact of their experiences during this period can last a lifetime,” Mr Varadkar said“This is the first strategy of its kind in Ireland, setting out a road map for change and development over the coming decade. Building on the many positive developments for young children in recent years, including family leave, subsidised Early Learning and Care, free GP care and a new Children’s Hospital, First 5 will significantly enhance early childhood in Ireland.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Gerard Mooney (38) of Castle Hill, Castlerea also admits to harassing woman prior to attackVictim gives statement at sentence hearing of serial sex attacker Patrick NevinNew DCU centre for early childhood studies aims to place Ireland at centre of global mapDesmond Duffy told trial he was acting in self defence when partner of 36 years diedExtension of supports to all paid childminders among plans in First 5 strategyFAI requests minute\u0026rsquos silence for man (30) found in water ahead of match\u0026lsquoThe smallest piece of information could help close this case and bring justice to the family\u0026rsquoPatrick O\u0026rsquoDea (51) pleaded guilty to sexual assault and rape on dates in 1994 and 1995EU Ombudsman O\u0026rsquoReilly believes it is in the public interest for documents to be releasedGareth Brophy accused over fatal shooting of man outside Dublin shop in 2016Deficiencies in Poland\u0026rsquos judiciary does not amount to real risk to Artur Celmar\u0026rsquos rights, judge findsResearch establishes link between temperature, sunlight and alcohol consumptionApplication for 300-bed development seeks use of council landFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader describes Taoiseach\u0026rsquos remark on confidence talks as \u0026lsquosilly\u0026rsquoINMO says low pay is making it impossible for health to recruit sufficient nursesSecond confirmed sighting of killer whales off Skerries coast in the last two weeksLegislation due on scheme resulting from North\u0026rsquos Historic Institutional Abuse InquiryProblems on line between Bray and Dalkey resulted in suspension of services during rush hourAdditional cost of about \u0026euro500 will be borne by many couples having average-sized eventsMeasure being examined aims to stop unwanted people \u0026lsquosneaking into Britain\u0026rsquo via State"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3702271.1542571610!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord varadkar s speech was like a hobbit s front door very low key","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar  addresses the delegates. Photograph: Nick BradshawThrilled delegates knew they were in for a white-knuckle ride when Simon Coveney almost fist-bumped Regina Doherty onstage and then gingerly punched the air before inciting the Fine Gael mob to act like hooligans.The headline act was about to explode upon their ardfheis and the Tearaway Tánaiste wanted the crowd to make some noise.“In six minutes’ time,” he tantalised, “our party leader and our Taoiseach will walk to this stage.”Leo taking himself forward, in tune with the theme of the day.The country would be watching.“I know that this party has a reputation for being polite and mannerly and a little contained sometimes at events like this one,” devil-may-care Coveney told the crowd. “But not today, please! I am asking you to make a statement, to be heard, to let people know how united and strong we are as a political party right now behind Leo Varadkar.”There was a brief, polite pause and then the inflamed foot soldiers burst into a frenzy of genteel clapping. Guests in the diplomatic seating area were worried in case the rabble-rousing Minister for Foreign Affairs might start wrecking the gaff. But Simon settled down and there was no need to call security.Due to upstaging issues, seconds in command don’t often do the wind-up speech for party leaders. They are too far up the pecking order, too close to the crown. Somebody who won’t thieve some shine from the star – usually an up-and-coming candidate or a knockabout crowd favourite – is chosen.On Saturday night, the former rivals for the country’s top job stood together, recast as Ireland’s Brexit warriors.“We work together night and day to protect Ireland,” Coveney declared, just in time for the live TV broadcast and the showcasing of the wonderful Two Ts to a national audience.A wide black curtain was pulled back to allow Leo make his entrance from the back of the hall. They had to do this because after Simon’s podium paean (tough, calm, intelligent, educated, ambitious, compassionate, generous, change maker), Leo couldn’t fit his head though the double doors.He got a tremendous reception as he did some minor flesh pressing on his way to the stage, the Kongos song “Come With Me Now” pulsating from the sound system.“Woah come with me nowI’m gonna take you downWoah come with me nowI’m gonna show you how”As you do.Some bright spark put a joke early on in the script. It involved using one of the props – “ordinary” party members sitting woodenly in long rows behind the Taoiseach who had, apparently, asked him questions earlier which he would address in the speech. This was a way of getting over the makey-up “I met a man out along the road who told me . . .”These people had names, and when Leo mentioned them he swivelled his head towards the props to indicate that Tom or Lynda or Vera or whoever actually existed, and was there among them.Lorraine, it seems, wanted to know about extending the Confidence and Supply deal with Fianna Fáil.“I told her the truth. I said it’s not easy negotiating with the Fianna Fáil front bench,” said Leo, winding up for the big punchline.We feared we might suffocate in tumbleweed but a person began to clap, very loudly, and everyone joined in. Or at least that part of the hall which wasn’t wiped out by the lead balloon which was falling on them.The Taoiseach was clear Fine Gael would not go down the populist road of other parties by buying votes with all sorts of expensive promises like tax cuts and the like. Then he promised he would get middle income earners out of the top tax bracket and make sure more of them qualify for childcare subsidies.“As they should . . . They’re worth it! You’re worth it!”People may scoff and say that money should be used for far more pressing causes, but we noticed one of the private security men in the black bomber jackets standing at his position, hands held low, enthusiastically applauding.It certainly went down well with the crowd.Going forward was thrust forward quite a lot in a speech which was not backward about coming forward. It will come as no surprise that “Taking Ireland Forward Together” is Fine Gael’s new off-the-shelf slogan, from the clunky and unoriginal side of the marketing aisle.Did the Yanks see them coming and sell it to the party? Taking Ireland For . . . a ride? A fool? A small fortune? Hours of happy slogan and poster vandalising in prospect here.There was also a strangely jarring American word in Leo’s speech when he told the nation “Only Fine Gael can be trusted to protect your job, your pocketbook and your pension.”Then again, everyone knows Fine Gael ladies keep their pocketbooks in their fanny packs beside their cellphones.All in all it was a Hobbit’s front door of a speech – very low key.He isn’t a great speaker. If he was, Simon would have said it. But the delegates loved him, and he made up for his flat address by staying behind on stage for the best part of an hour posing for photographs with delegates.But the evening was rescued in style by the big screen in the Ballroom and a memorable rugby match. Leo was among cheering delegates urging on the home team to a memorable win over the All-Blacks. An elated crowd left Citywest in buoyant mood, all keyed up and ready for action.Heading home happy and sweatin’, even if the man who was supposed to do it wasn’t responsible. That doesn’t matter, Leo was exalted by association. A lucky general, along with everything else.Earlier in the day, for the benefit of party members and not for general release, a spoof video of various Ministers trying to be funny was aired.It was an entertainingly awful “spin the wheel” game where Cabinet members answered light-hearted questions. The whole farrago took place with whacky sit-com music running in the background.“Are you ready to play the game?” the Minister for Justice was asked.“I’m ready to roll . . .,” answered Charlie Flanagan, perpetrating a mortifying thumbs up.Then Heather Humphreys spun the wheel unenthusiastically.“What item did Leo Varadkar famously put in the dishwasher in 2017?”What did the Tánaiste have to promise his five-year-old daughter to make sure she would greet Pope Francis?“A kitten. A live one. It’s known as The Holy Spirit in our house,” replied Coveney.One viewer said his toes were curling so much he could scratch his arse with his foot.As soon as Leo left the stage, his team sent an email to all his subscribers.“I’ve just finished. Can you help?”Where to start . . ."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

supermarket stores charging three times much larger","story":"Express supermarkets charge vastly more than superstores, according to a new investigationExpress supermarkets are charging customers up to three times more for their groceries than superstores from the same chain, an investigation has found.Some fruit and vegetables have a mark up of up to 177 per cent as smaller shops charge more for the same product.Branded items do not have consistent prices across stores from the same chain either, according to the investigation by the BBC.The analysis found that a Tesco Express store sold a banana for 25p, while the local superstore sold it at a fraction of the price for 9p.Similarly at Marks and Spencer, a banana costs 40p in the convenience store and 18p in the big shop.Mr Kipling\u0027s French Fancies cost £1.95 in a Sainsbury\u0027s convenience store, and £1.60 in the supermarket.The BBC visited a variety of shops between September and October this year to compare prices.At Sainsbury\u0027s and Marks and Spencer stores in Birmingham, and Waitrose shops in Shropshire, 45 of 50 items cost more in the convenience location, while at the Tesco Express, 39 of 50 items cost more than in the superstore.The shops all said the mark-ups were due to smaller shops facing higher operating costs, including higher rents and increased rates for longer opening hours.Sylvia Rook - Lead officer, Chartered Trading Standards Institute, told the BBC: With normal economy and supplier demand, it is often the case that smaller shops, and those in more remote areas, will charge more.I always think that when you look at service station petrol prices on motorways, that is very telling, because they are normally hugely more expensive but they are open 24 hours and have higher overheads.With smaller stores, deliveries are also harder to get to them.Brexit deal latest news: David Davis urges Theresa May to delay EU summit as resistance to her deal growsJohn

thousands london commuters left stranded told not travel","story":"Tens of thousands of London commuters left stranded and told not to travel amid rail chaosTens of thousands of passengers on some of the busiest rail routes in the country were warned not to travel on Monday morning because of over-running engineering works.No South Western Railway trains were running between Surbiton and London Waterloo - the UK\u0027s busiest railway station - and evening commuters are bracing themselves for much of the same disruption Monday afternoon, with the chaos expected to continue all day. It is the latest disruption to hit SWR following a spate of problems involving signal and points failures.A long-running dispute over the role of guards on trains has also crippled services because of strikes.Monday morning\u0027s chaos was caused by delays in the tracks being handed back to South Western Railway by Network Rail engineers, according to the train operator. A Network Rail spokesman told The  this delay was due to tamping - the process of realigning the tracks - having to be pushed back because of a damaged rail. Among those caught in the misery was Labour MP for Tooting Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, who said teachers and nurses were not able to get to work. She told The : Tens of thousands of commuters rely on the South Western Railway service every day. To cancel hundreds of trains and advise people to not travel is simply not good enough. While some employers will be sympathetic, there are essential services which rely upon people getting to work. Key NHS staff will not be able to get to clinics and hospitals and teachers will be late for school - the knock on effects ripple far beyond the station barriers. This comes at the same time our fares are increasing nationwide and people are being asked to pay more to travel on our rail network - it is utterly unacceptable.Passengers at stations were told: We have been informed of over-running Network Rail engineering works between London Waterloo and Surbiton. This means that trains cannot run between London Waterloo and Surbiton.Customers are advised not to travel. Woking, Surbiton, Raynes Park and Earlsfield stations are currently closed.Disruption is expected until the end of the day.The Network Rail engineering works were originally due to be cleared by 04.30 this morning however, the works will now not be cleared until 08.30 at the earliest.Until the works clear no trains can leave Wimbledon or Clapham Junction depots.Normally-packed commuter trains were cancelled, leaving tens of thousands of passengers stranded.South Western Railway said due to trains and crews being displaced by the delays, workers who eventually get to work this morning will probably face the same issues on their way home later today.A South Western Railway spokesman said: Passengers are asked to delay the start of their journeys this morning as all lines from Surbiton into Waterloo are blocked due to over-running engineering works.Network Rail engineers are working hard to reopen the lines as soon as possible but passengers are advised to check the website before starting their journey as currently services are having to be cancelled and erted.We are sorry for the disruption and will update our website as soon as we have a clearer picture of when lines may reopen.Southern services between East Croydon and London Victoria were also disrupted because of over-running engineering works and Thameslink trains were also affected. The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union called for the resignation of Transport Secretary Chris Grayling because of the latest bout of travel chaos.General secretary Mick Cash said: The chaos into Waterloo this morning is just another example of the fragmentation and ision on Britain\u0027s privatised railways where maintenance schedules and budgets are hacked to the bare bones while private operators like SWR are left with a free hand to rob the network blind in the name of profit.What we need is reintegration and a coherent system with all elements of the rail operation working together in one publicly-owned framework, with investment rather than exploitation as the watchword.While the crisis on our railways deepens, the Transport Secretary Chris Grayling is markedly absent while he ponders his self-interest and a possible resignation from the May Government. He should go, and he should go now.He added: With Waterloo closed and London and the South plunged into rail chaos this morning, RMT is now picking up reports of wholesale cancellations on Northern Rail due to a shortage of fleet, reinforcing the point that this is a national crisis.Both Arriva Rail North and South Western Railway have a track record of hacking back on staffing and budgets to bump up profits and today\u0027s Monday meltdown is the consequence of their actions.The case for public ownership is now overwhelming.A Network Rail spokesman said: We would like to apologise for the disruption to passengers\u0027 journeys on South Western this morning. This is due to over-running engineering works in the Hampton Court area.Currently all four lines are blocked and no trains are able to run between Surbiton and Waterloo. Network Rail workers are on site and hope to resolve the issue as soon as possible.Passengers are urged to check before they travel via National Rail Enquiries or with their train operator.Meanwhile, SWR announced that there will be an amended timetable in place on Saturday because of another RMT strike in the guards\u0027 dispute.Was your commute delayed or disrupted?  Were you inconvenienced by over-running engineering works?

No injuries were reported but both trains were damaged and there was serious disruption to services until the middle of the following day.The collision happened while major Network Rail engineering work was being carried out at London Waterloo to boost its capacity.The RAIB found that the passenger train was erted from its intended route because a set of points - movable sections of track which allow trains to transfer from one line to another - were incorrectly positioned due to uncontrolled wiring being added to the signalling system.This occurred after a man employed to test the equipment failed to meet expected standards and did not fully consider the potential consequences of adding the wiring, the report stated.An underlying factor in the collision was that Network Rail and its contractors had failed to address the full requirements of the staff responsible for the signalling work.The RAIB found parallels with the Clapham Junction disaster in which three trains collided near the south London station on December 12 1988, killing 35 people and injuring 415 others.An accident inquiry chaired by Anthony Hidden QC found the primary cause of the crash was incorrect wiring work, which led to a signal failure.Several of the Hidden report\u0027s recommendations to reform the way railway signalling is designed, installed and tested in the UK - such as through tighter control of procedures - were not followed in the London Waterloo incident, according to the RAIB.The RAIB stated: The major changes to signalling design, installation and testing processes triggered by the Clapham accident remain today, but the RAIB is concerned that the need for rigorous application is being forgotten as people with personal knowledge of this tragedy retire or move away from frontline jobs.This deep-seated, tacit knowledge is part of the corporate memory vital to achieve safety.Loss of this type of knowledge as previous generations leave the industry is a risk which must be addressed by organisations committed to achieving high levels of safety.The RAIB made three safety recommendations, one of which stated that Network Rail should improve the knowledge and attitudes needed for signal designers, installers and testers.Please review our commenting policyJohn Worboys to stay in prison after new Parole Board panel rules he is not suitable for releaseQuadruple stabbing in north London linked to minicab shooting, police believeComment: Mrs May\u0026#39s deal is a punishment beating for a country that has dared to claim self-governmentMother of teenager who took her own life after rape trial \u0026#39appalled\u0026#39 by girl\u0026#39s thong being used against her in Irish caseRunning club sparks terror incident after using white powder to mark out  circuit routeExpress supermarket stores are charging three times as much as their larger counterparts, investigation finds What  readers really think about Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit dealHospital worker arrested on suspicion of poisoning patients amid neglect allegationsBrexit deal latest news: David Davis urges Theresa May to delay EU summit as resistance to her deal growsOutcry as Chinese writer gets 10 year prison sentence for gay erotic novelComment: Why is Nicola Sturgeon failing to exploit Brexit chaos in Westminster?Giant 15ft great white shark caught in net off popular Sydney surf beachStop shooting, or the penguin dies: Dynasties and the tricky ethics of documentary-makingCountries hardest hit by malaria see rise in casesTheresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal should face Commons vote before her meeting with EU leaders, David Davis saysLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowFormer England footballer Paul Gascoigne charged with sexual assault on board trainTrans murderer serving life will receive £80k gender reassignment on the NHSComment: Mrs May\u0026#39s job rests on proving Michael Gove right that her Brexit deal can be salvagedPolice plea to public as shocking attack on Met officers filmed and shared by witnessSpain threatens to reject Brexit orce deal over Gibraltar as EU infighting eruptsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/12/31/16/ISSgulfmexico.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-3682066  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= Earth from the ISS  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/12/31/16/ISSgulfmexico.jpg","title":"arecibo message decoded meaning google doodle reply audio response explained","story":"Created with Sketch.Subscribe  registerSubscribeJoin us Subscribe  registerJoin us SubscribeLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 14 daysSee the optionsThe hoax \u0027reply\u0027 to a signal beamed into space might be the best possible resultClick to followThe Independent TechWhen the Arecibo message was sent into space in 1974\u0026nbsp– blasting the most powerful signal ever broadcast deep into the universe – it was a pioneering attempt to reach out to aliens, wherever they might be.When a response came back in 2001, it was a hoax that showed just how much some people hope we can actually communicate with extraterrestrials.

Pressed into a field in Hampshire, it seemed to mirror the look of the original Arecibo message, which gave a host of information about life on Earth that the originators hoped would be decodable to people anywhere in the universe.Where the original Arecibo\u0026nbspmessage had shown blocks of information including depictions of important chemicals like carbon, an illustration of DNA and a picture of a human being. The hoax reply was probably too perfect: carbon was swapped for silicon, the DNA was altered and the human being was replaced with a big-headed alien of the kind seen in science fiction.Arecibo Message anniversary honoured in Google DoodleIt was of course a hoax: among other questions, sceptics wondered why aliens wouldn\u0027t simply have sent a radio message, as we did, rather than dropping down to Earth to press a picture of themselves into crops and then failing to actually alert anyone. But it was a demonstration of the way the original Arecibo\u0026nbspmessage and the search for alien life that it grew out of continues to occupy the minds of people around the world.Scientists don\u0027t ever expect to actually receive a reply to the Arecibo message: it was powerful but specific, pointed at a galaxy cluster that will actually have moved out of the way by the time it travels the 20,000 light years to its destination. It was probably most useful as a demonstration of the technology and a thought experiment that led people to think about what such a message might actually need to say.Similar efforts have been launched that could have more positive results, however. A new initiative called Breakthrough Message – part of a broader group supported by a Russian billionaire and Stephen Hawking, which aims to find life elsewhere in the universe – has invited people to consider how best to write and send a message out into space, though has cautioned that for the moment it will not send out those messages.But some fear that a response wouldn\u0027t come in the form of a message at all. Instead, it would be something altogether more dangerous – and that\u0027s why they advise that we shouldn\u0027t send further signals like the Arecibo message, for fear that they would only put us in peril.Stephen Hawking, for instance, famously said that we should be wary of sending out messages into the universe for fear that they could be answered by someone looking to wipe us out – or, perhaps worse, someone who might wipe us out purely by accident. ‘If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn’t turn out well for the Native Americans, he said in a 2010 documentary.And such criticism was even in place when the Arecibo\u0026nbspmessage was first sent. Just days after the dispatch was shot into space, the Royal Astronomer of England,\u0026nbspMartin Ryle, launched an intense blast of criticism at the idea, arguing that it might only alert aliens who are malevolent or hungry, and asking the\u0026nbspInternational Astronomical Union to ban any future messages.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The CBI’s John Allan will use his speech at the group’s annual conference to call on MPs to highlight the importance of compromising in order to “open a route to a long-term trade arrangement and (unlock) transition – the very least that companies need to prepare for Brexit”.Tory MP says \u0027we stand at the bar of history today\u0027- liveMay faces defeat over release of economic impact of her Brexit plansMay says Brexit deal will stop EU citizens \u0027jumping queue\u0027 into UKStop the posturing – MPs like David Davis have no idea about BrexitA compromise would not be perfect, Mr Allan is expected to say, but “most importantly, it avoids the wrecking ball that would be a no-deal departure.”Mr Allan will also highlight a number of examples of businesses losing out on investment due to Brexit uncertainty. ““In the past few days alone, I’ve heard of a life sciences firm in the North West that has cut almost all investment in the UK – putting it instead in Germany and China,” he is expected to say.“I’ve heard a Northern Irish tech firm that has stopped winning contracts because their aerospace customers are worried about Brexit. And a construction firm says it now costs an extra £20,000 to build a house, due to a shortage of materials and labour since Brexit. “These stories are repeated across the country. 80 per cent of firms have already cut or postponed investment because of the risk of a no-deal exit.”The CBI conference begins at 10am on Monday 19th November, with the PM and various business figures scheduled to address attendees.

It is a compromise. But it is hard-won progress,\u0027 said Ms FairbairnThe money that firms are being forced to spend in preparation for a potential no-deal Brexit next March is a waste, the director-general of the CBI has complained.In a speech to the business lobby group’s 2018 conference on Monday Carloyn Fairbairn said “not one penny of it will create new jobs or products”.This is what day one of a no-deal Brexit could look like“Brexit is consuming government – every politician, every civil servant. And it is also consuming British business,” she said.“Our firms are spending hundreds of millions of pounds preparing for the worst case – and not one penny of it will create new jobs or new products.“Investment is flooding out of the right areas like skills and tech, and into areas which do absolutely nothing to help our productivity. Some of it is leaving our country altogether. While other countries are forging a competitive future, Westminster seems to be living in its own narrow world, in which extreme positions are being allowed to dominate.”Despite the almost universally hostile political reception for Theresa May’s draft Withdrawal Agreement with the European Union, unveiled last week, the CBI\u0026nbsphas called on MPs to back it since it avoids the risk of a cliff-edge for firms on 29 March 2019.“The Prime Minister’s agreement is not perfect. It is a compromise. But it is hard-won progress,” said Ms Fairbairn.A no-deal Brexit next March would be expected to ground UK flights and result in severe disruption of haulage deliveries through UK ports.UK-based manufacturers and retailers which have “just-in-time” supply chains have warned of major problems in such circumstances and said that they have limited facilities for stock-piling.Last week, Ms May told the House of Commons: “We can choose to leave with no deal, we can risk no Brexit at all, or we can choose to united and support the best deal that can be negotiated”.In her speech, Ms Fairbairn\u0026nbspagain castigated Labour’s nationalisation plans, saying that when it was last tried in the 1970s “it ushered in one of the darkest periods in our country’s modern economic history”.But she also had a message for those hardline Brexiteers who have presented leaving the EU as an opportunity for wholesale deregulation.“Extreme market ideology does not get us much further. Becoming a hustling cowboy nation with minimal regulation is not what people want. Nor is it what business wants,” she said.On immigration, Ms Fairbairn\u0026nbspalso rejected the recent advice from the independent Migration Advisory Committee that the Government should, post-Brexit, only allow in skilled workers who can command a salary of more than £30,000 and also the Governments pledge to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands.“What has been proposed so far won’t work,” she said.“The idea that anyone earning less than £30,000 can’t contribute to our economy, for instance. Together, we could do so much better – through a jointly developed immigration policy, one that avoids false choices, that does away with arbitrary targets, and focusses instead on the people we need to build our economy.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The dollar’s soaring, the dollar’s plummeting.But why? What moves currency markets? Why do exchange rates fluctuate, often dramatically?The answer is supply and demand. If demand for a currency goes up its price will rise. If demand falls, its price will tend to fall.But what can determine supply and demand?First, expectations of national economic weakness. Think of things like war, or a natural catastrophe, or some other radical change of circumstances with economic implications. A good example is the impact of the Brexit referendum on sterling. So what’s going on? Bad macroeconomic news implies lower economic activity and less inward investment from abroad due to lower returns. That makes investing money in a currency less attractive to external investors, so there’s less demand for a currency from abroad. The result? The exchange rate goes down.Second, expectations of national economic strength. This works the other way. It can be sparked by unexpectedly good GDP figures. Perhaps a new oil or gas discovery. Sometimes it’s driven by political decisions. Think of US dollar currency’s response to Trump’s election victory, with him having promised tax cuts and an infrastructure spending splurge in the campaign. These were all expected to lift the growth rate, at least in the short term. Macroeconomic strength means interest rates likely to rise to head off domestic inflation. Rising domestic interest rates mean better returns which means more demand from abroad. The result? The exchange rate goes up.But it’s important to remember that the value of a currency is a relative measure. A nation’s currency is always valued in a foreign currency. So sterling is measured in dollars or euros or yen or rand or the Mongoloian togrog, you name it. If the value of another country’s currency rises that means yours can fall, even if nothing has really changed about the economic outlook for your country. When the dollar rises against the pound it can be because the US economy is doing well. It doesn’t necessarily mean the outlook for the UK economy has got any worseAnd a final word of caution. Don’t make the mistake of believing that currency moves are always based on rational and careful assessments by currency traders and investors of underlying economic conditions. In the short term – and possibly even the long term – there is a very large dose of knee-jerk sentiment, herding and, sometimes, blind panic involved.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It still isn’t clear who was most at fault for the IT disaster that continues to do down the bank’s good name, and we’ll probably never know for certain. It is clear that Debbie Crosbie may be entering the lion’s den when she joins next year.\u0026nbspTSB appoints Debbie Crosbie as new chief executive TSB owner Sabadell hit by IT failure costs with more expectedTSB sheds 20,000 current accounts in wake of massive IT failure In case you’d forgotten, TSB was spun out of Lloyds, enjoying a brief time as an independent business before Sabadell moved in. Following the deal, it was decided that TSB should move off Lloyds’ IT system, for which it was paying a pretty penny, and onto one provided by its new owner.Trouble is, the transfer went disastrously wrong, resulting in people being locked out of online banking, and creating a political and media furore. TSB’s poor employees, who spent hours on end in its branches dealing with furious customers, went through hell too.\u0026nbspThe bank further compounded the issue by initially trying to downplay it and by failing to keep aggrieved customers properly informed about what was happening.\u0026nbspPester was slow to apologise and then went and told MPs on the Treasury Committee that all was well and they should think about switching to TSB when members of the MPs\u0027 own staff had told them they couldn’t access their accounts that morning.\u0026nbspPutting right what went wrong will be a tough ask for anyone, but on the face of it, Crosbie looks like a smart choice on the part of Sabadell, and the bank’s embattled chairman Richard Meddings, to do that.She’s currently the chief operating officer of CYBG, another ‘challenger’, which hasn’t been free of IT problems. So she knows the territory, and presumably has a good idea of what it takes to succeed with a mid sized bank in the British market.\u0026nbspBefore TSB can do that it needs to convince its customers, regulators and MPs that it can be trusted and is fit for purpose.

The CBI’s John Allan will use his speech at the group’s annual conference to call on MPs to highlight the importance of compromising in order to “open a route to a long-term trade arrangement and (unlock) transition – the very least that companies need to prepare for Brexit”.Tory MP says \u0027we stand at the bar of history today\u0027- liveMay faces defeat over release of economic impact of her Brexit plansMay says Brexit deal will stop EU citizens \u0027jumping queue\u0027 into UKStop the posturing – MPs like David Davis have no idea about BrexitA compromise would not be perfect, Mr Allan is expected to say, but “most importantly, it avoids the wrecking ball that would be a no-deal departure.”Mr Allan will also highlight a number of examples of businesses losing out on investment due to Brexit uncertainty. ““In the past few days alone, I’ve heard of a life sciences firm in the North West that has cut almost all investment in the UK – putting it instead in Germany and China,” he is expected to say.“I’ve heard a Northern Irish tech firm that has stopped winning contracts because their aerospace customers are worried about Brexit. And a construction firm says it now costs an extra £20,000 to build a house, due to a shortage of materials and labour since Brexit. “These stories are repeated across the country. 80 per cent of firms have already cut or postponed investment because of the risk of a no-deal exit.”The CBI conference begins at 10am on Monday 19th November, with the PM and various business figures scheduled to address attendees.

It is a compromise. But it is hard-won progress,\u0027 said Ms FairbairnThe money that firms are being forced to spend in preparation for a potential no-deal Brexit next March is a waste, the director-general of the CBI has complained.In a speech to the business lobby group’s 2018 conference on Monday Carloyn Fairbairn said “not one penny of it will create new jobs or products”.This is what day one of a no-deal Brexit could look like“Brexit is consuming government – every politician, every civil servant. And it is also consuming British business,” she said.“Our firms are spending hundreds of millions of pounds preparing for the worst case – and not one penny of it will create new jobs or new products.“Investment is flooding out of the right areas like skills and tech, and into areas which do absolutely nothing to help our productivity. Some of it is leaving our country altogether. While other countries are forging a competitive future, Westminster seems to be living in its own narrow world, in which extreme positions are being allowed to dominate.”Despite the almost universally hostile political reception for Theresa May’s draft Withdrawal Agreement with the European Union, unveiled last week, the CBI\u0026nbsphas called on MPs to back it since it avoids the risk of a cliff-edge for firms on 29 March 2019.“The Prime Minister’s agreement is not perfect. It is a compromise. But it is hard-won progress,” said Ms Fairbairn.A no-deal Brexit next March would be expected to ground UK flights and result in severe disruption of haulage deliveries through UK ports.UK-based manufacturers and retailers which have “just-in-time” supply chains have warned of major problems in such circumstances and said that they have limited facilities for stock-piling.Last week, Ms May told the House of Commons: “We can choose to leave with no deal, we can risk no Brexit at all, or we can choose to united and support the best deal that can be negotiated”.In her speech, Ms Fairbairn\u0026nbspagain castigated Labour’s nationalisation plans, saying that when it was last tried in the 1970s “it ushered in one of the darkest periods in our country’s modern economic history”.But she also had a message for those hardline Brexiteers who have presented leaving the EU as an opportunity for wholesale deregulation.“Extreme market ideology does not get us much further. Becoming a hustling cowboy nation with minimal regulation is not what people want. Nor is it what business wants,” she said.On immigration, Ms Fairbairn\u0026nbspalso rejected the recent advice from the independent Migration Advisory Committee that the Government should, post-Brexit, only allow in skilled workers who can command a salary of more than £30,000 and also the Governments pledge to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands.“What has been proposed so far won’t work,” she said.“The idea that anyone earning less than £30,000 can’t contribute to our economy, for instance. Together, we could do so much better – through a jointly developed immigration policy, one that avoids false choices, that does away with arbitrary targets, and focusses instead on the people we need to build our economy.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

James Moore considers whether there is any room for social responsibility in the corporate world, or if we should just ditch the spiel on valuesClick to followThe IndependentBusinesses are stakeholders in society, and vice versa“These guys are mad. Call off the invasion. Their system’s going to eat them so we won’t have to. They have these company things that they’re allowing to bust the whole place up. Let’s just sit tight and clean up once they’re done wrecking it.”That’s what an alien might very well say upon looking at the way the titans of the capitalist system have been operating.\u0026nbspYou want examples? Ten years on from the financial crisis that caused a brutal recession and a lost economic decade from which we have still to fully recover and it isn’t hard to find people who’ll tell you that the banks could easily do it again.Tech giants make money from people taking out ads that are designed to corrupt democratic elections, while other companies wreck the environment.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, the carnival of corporate scandal adds a new float every few months. Yet according to the Nobel prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, whose influence permeates through the Anglo-Saxon capitalist world, they’re all only doing what they’re supposed to do: increasing profits by whatever means necessary within the law.\u0026nbspIn his seminal work Capitalism and Freedom,\u0026nbspFriedman baldly stated that “the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits”.\u0026nbspHe had no truck with companies having any regard for\u0026nbspthe societies in which they operate, much less furthering socially useful goals such as\u0026nbsp“providing employment, eliminating discrimination, avoiding pollution and whatever else may be the catchwords of the contemporary crop of reformers”.\u0026nbsp“Businessmen who talk this way are unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades,” he opined.\u0026nbspThat view is at odds with what you’ll often hear from modern executives, who like to talk about how important the “values” of the businesses they run are\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspbig up their role as “good corporate citizens”.\u0026nbspFacebook isn’t about making money. It exists to “connect people”. “Don’t be evil”\u0026nbspfamously used to be at the centre of Google’s corporate philosophy until it was quietly removed.\u0026nbspNow it says: “The Google Code of Conduct is one of the ways we put Google’s values into practice. It’s built around the recognition that everything we do in connection with our work at Google will be, and should be, measured against the highest possible standards of ethical business conduct.”Isn’t that nice? Milton must be turning in his grave. You hear similar things on this side of the Atlantic. I once suggested to a very senior executive at a rather famous FTSE 100 company over dinner that his talk about values was basically window dressing, and that cash was king. He became visibly upset.\u0026nbspYet Friedman would have found nothing to take issue with in the investor presentations put out by the aforementioned executive’s employer.\u0026nbspHe might have found today’s fiction of corporate social responsibility frustrating, even infuriating, but he wouldn’t need to scratch too far below the surface to be reassured.The Pew Research Centre recently pointed out that today real\u0026nbspwages\u0026nbspin the US, adjusting for inflation, have about the same purchasing power as they did 40 years ago. Only those at the very top have made real gainsThe majority of western companies and western executives subscribe to and live by his doctrine in nearly every respect, even if they’re sometimes reluctant to admit it.\u0026nbspThat shouldn’t surprise anyone. They are legally required to do so.\u0026nbspBritain’s Companies Act of 2006 –\u0026nbsppassed by a Labour government by the way –\u0026nbsphas the fiduciary duty of directors to shareholders at its core.It states that a director must act “in the way he (sic) considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole”.\u0026nbspIn the case of big public companies, the members are shareholders, who invest in them, as Friedman stated, for the purpose of making money.\u0026nbspCapitalism red in tooth and claw rules, say his fanboys, because it has proved far better at delivering prosperity to those living under it than any of the alternatives (Friedman was writing at a time when the main one was Soviet-style communism).\u0026nbspSo, you corporate executives, it’s time to bin all that fluff about values. Go get yourself some CREAM (Cash Rules Everything Around Me, with apologies to the Wu-Tang Clan).\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe trouble with that view is it isn’t working so well any more, at least not for the masses, which might explain why extremists of one sort or another are finding such favour, extremists who are mostly bad for business – and yes that includes those on the right, in case you hadn’t noticed Donald Trump’s trade war.\u0026nbspThe Pew Research Centre recently pointed out that today real wages in the US, adjusting for inflation, have about the same purchasing power as they did 40 years ago.\u0026nbspOnly those at the very top have made real gains. Since 2000 their real wages have risen by a cumulative 15.7 per cent, to $2,112 (£1,628) a week – nearly five times the usual weekly earnings of the bottom tenth ($426).\u0026nbspReal wages for the average American worker actually peaked 45 years ago, a couple of years after Friedman published a piece expounding on his profits argument in The New York Times Magazine.\u0026nbspSimilar issues are at work in the UK labour market. Pawel Adrjan, UK economist at Indeed, a job site, recently noted that average pay is still below its 2008 pre-crisis peak.“If real wages had continued growing at their pre-crisis trend, the average person would now be earning £130 more per week than they actually do,” he said.\u0026nbspIn the boardroom it’s a different story. In a 2015 report, the High Pay Centre noted that CEOs in the UK had seen their pay increase by a factor of five since the late 1990s\u0026nbsp– despite no evidence that this resulted in better corporate performance, productivity or economic performance.\u0026nbspThe latter point was eloquently made by Charles Cotton, senior performance and reward advisor at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and\u0026nbspDevelopment, during a hearing of the parliamentary business committee in June.\u0026nbspYet despite the occasional shareholder rebellion, there is scant sign of any real slowdown. A more recent report by the centre found that CEO pay leapt by 11 per cent in 2017, more than four times the pace at which the average worker’s pay increased.\u0026nbspFriedman argued\u0026nbspthat a corporate executive has direct responsibility to his employers “to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Mark Zuckerberg meets world leaders – in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.President Barack Obama talks with Zuckerberg during a town hall style meeting at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California, 20 April 2011David Cameron talks to the Facebook founder during the internet session of the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French president Nicolas Sarkozy meet Zuckerberg at the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011Zuckerberg talks to Sarkozy at a G8 summit in Deauville, France, 25 May 2011Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets the Facebook CEO at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 30 April 2015Zuckerberg with former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda in Tokyo, 29 March 2012Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Zuckerberg at a townhall meeting at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 27 September 2015Zuckerberg with other business leaders and the Chinese President Xi JinpingPresident Barack Obama talks with Zuckerberg during a town hall style meeting at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California, 20 April 2011David Cameron talks to the Facebook founder during the internet session of the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French president Nicolas Sarkozy meet Zuckerberg at the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011Zuckerberg talks to Sarkozy at a G8 summit in Deauville, France, 25 May 2011Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets the Facebook CEO at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 30 April 2015Zuckerberg with former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda in Tokyo, 29 March 2012Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Zuckerberg at a townhall meeting at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 27 September 2015Zuckerberg with other business leaders and the Chinese President Xi JinpingBut, while they conform to that for the most part, when it comes to the question of their pay –\u0026nbspthey clearly break the rule. They and the non-executive directors who set it frequently act in ways that are ultimately opposed to shareholders interests.\u0026nbspThe situation reached its nadir in the UK with Persimmon Homes and its potential payment of £600m, slated to be shared among just over 130 executives. CEO Jeff Fairburn was due to receive more than £100m through it, although a public furore eventually saw him agreeing to reduce it to £75m.\u0026nbspThe company had been successful on his watch, it’s true, but that success was largely fuelled by the government-funded help to buy scheme, which underwrites mortgages for the first-time buyers Persimmon targets.\u0026nbspIt thus owed much of its success to a de facto public subsidy.\u0026nbspThe chair, and the chair of the remuneration committee who resigned in the midst of the scandal, admitted that the bonus scheme should have been capped, but this was too late to save the shareholders they were supposed to represent, who ended up handing over nearly 10 per cent of their company to its executives. No wonder one commentator referred to it as an act of “corporate looting”.\u0026nbspFiduciary duty? Forget about it!\u0026nbspPart of the reason for the repeated occurrence of this sort of thing is the way the modern company has become, in effect, ownerless – widely held by erse groups of institutional investment funds which buy and sell electronically, rarely vote on company resolutions and sometimes may only be on the shareholder register for a matter of days, even hours.\u0026nbspRemuneration committees would have you believe that they seek to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders, despite their lack of oversight, by making them shareholders too. CREAM for all!Facebook has had its reputation trashed, and paid fines, while also dealing with new rules. There might be worse to comeThe problem with that analysis is executives get their shares for free, and if something is free you don’t really value it. They rarely put their own money at risk. Perish the thought.\u0026nbspThis too often leads to them throwing caution to the wind in pursuit of potentially huge payouts. Why not?If their employer fails really badly, keels over and dies halfway down the track from an overenthusiastic application of the whip, they may lose their jobs. But corporate executives are rarely out of work for long.\u0026nbspTake a look at the career of Andy Hornby, as an example. The HBOS CEO had his hand on the tiller when the bank fell off a cliff, and the government had to step in and find a rescuer (Lloyds) which it then had to bail out.\u0026nbspMr\u0026nbspHornby, who was sharply criticised in a report by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, ought to have been unemployable after that. But it wasn’t long before he found a new role as the chief executive of Alliance Boots, before moving on to bookmaker Coral.\u0026nbsp​RBS’s Fred Goodwin wasn’t so lucky thanks to his status as the bogeyman of British banking. But nearly all of his boardroom colleagues had secured alternative work within a couple of years of that bank’s collapse. One wonders what will now happen to those who spent time in the Carillion boardroom. Its executives also went for the bonus long shot jackpot. Expansion and profits uber alles, until the roulette wheel threw up a double zero.There was no bailout in that case, but the taxpayer was nonetheless left with a hefty bill in the wake of yet another glaring example of the capitalism Friedman advocated eating itself. But there are some companies that have eschewed Friedman’s ideas in another, more laudable respect, and with intriguing results.I’m not talking here about the corporate social responsibility\u0026nbspprogrammes most big businesses like to run. They’re often little more than extensions of the marketing budget, designed to send a message to consumers: “Hey you lot, come spend with us. You can feel good about it because even though we screw up the environment, look we’ve built a well in Senegal and we let our people go and help inner-city kids in their lunch hours.”I am instead thinking of those businesses that have actively sought to promote ersity (a favourite of the current crop of reformers) through their hiring\u0026nbsppractices.\u0026nbspFar from suffering through doing so, they have benefited, and handsomely.\u0026nbspMcKinsey, a management consultant renowned for its hard-headed intellectual rigour, sought to study the impact on the\u0026nbspcorporate profitability of hiring both more women and more staff from a minority ethnic background.\u0026nbspIts report –\u0026nbspDelivering Through Diversity –\u0026nbspshows that companies that do this make more money.\u0026nbspThe firm examined 1,000 companies from 12 countries for the 2017 study.\u0026nbspThose with workforces in the top 25 per cent for ethnic ersity were 33 per cent more likely to see higher than average profits than those in the lowest. When it came to gender ersity the figure was 21 per cent.\u0026nbspThe findings particularly stressed the importance of these groups being hired to both management roles (where they are often hardest to find) and in revenue-generating “line”\u0026nbsppositions from where executives are typically drawn.\u0026nbspCompanies that do so comply with Friedman’s demands that they maximise profits by taking his prescription and doing the opposite. \u0026nbspBut the question of whether the “profit at all costs” aim isn’t still destructive remains.\u0026nbspPutting profits first has left Britain with water companies that impose hosepipe bans while gallons upon gallons of water pours into its streets from leaking pipes.\u0026nbspIt has produced the railway debacles that have shattered the faith of the public in privatisation.\u0026nbspIt was for the purposes of bringing in a few extra dollars that Facebook allowed itself to be used by those seeking to influence the US presidential election and the Brexit referendum.All these demonstrate how self-defeating corporate behaviour that puts profits above society can be. The water industry is now dealing with tougher regulation, while the government is poised to announce a review into how rail services are delivered.\u0026nbspIf Labour comes to power both industries face nationalisation, an idea that is finding increasing favour with the public.\u0026nbspFacebook has had its reputation trashed, and paid fines, while also dealing with new rules. There might be worse to come. There probably should be.\u0026nbspWould all this have happened were these businesses to have taken their “social responsibilities” more seriously?It\u0027s not just in the field of hiring that companies would benefit from thinking a little more carefully about what they do and how they do it.\u0026nbspEco-friendly buildings? That’s your energy bill down.\u0026nbspSocially responsible businesses could serve to benefit shareholders, at least those with a time horizon beyond five minutesAct to cut emissions and curb other environmentally damaging behaviours? The costs of environmental destruction could be reduced, resulting in, for example, lower insurance premiums.\u0026nbspSocially responsible businesses could serve to benefit shareholders, at least those with a time horizon beyond five minutes.\u0026nbspIt’s worth considering the experience of Nationwide and John Lewis, one a member-owned mutual, the other an employee-owned partnership, at this point.\u0026nbspThey aren’t without their failings. Nationwide, for example, is as guilty of overpaying its executives as some banks.But as a rule, they manage to balance both long-term financial success, something their owners are still interested in, with a more enlightened stance towards the society they operate within than some of their peers.John Lewis’s constitution is a particularly worthy example. It sets out employee partners’ rights and responsibilities and defines “how power is shared and our collective responsibilities to others”.Mutuals and partnerships fail just as public companies do. But as often as not it is when they follow the destructive playbook of the latter, with too little oversight brought to bear on over-powerful and overpaid executives seeking to maximise profits above all else and taking silly risks to do so. \u0026nbspPerhaps it’s time to consider a revised Companies Act to better balance shareholders’ interests with those of other stakeholders. A very senior Tory, from the party’s sane (non-Brexiteer) wing, pooh-poohed this notion in conversation with me. They argued that an employee, for example, could never be ranked alongside the shareholder owner. But why not? As I’ve tried to demonstrate, it might ultimately work in their favour.\u0026nbspJohn Lewis, where the employees are the owners, hasn’t been immune from the challenges afflicting the high street. But most of its stock market-listed department store rivals would kill to be in the position it is in.\u0026nbspWorks councils are commonplace in Europe, as is employee representation on boards, something Theresa May briefly talked about before beating a hasty retreat. \u0026nbspJohn Lewis chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield to step down in 2020Diversity makes companies richer says McKinsey. Investors take noteIt is true that they haven’t necessarily\u0026nbspserved to curtail executives’ worst instincts –\u0026nbspit isn’t hard to find examples of excessive pay at German companies for example. But look at Germany\u0026nbspand look at Britain and ask yourself which has the better way of doing things. Would anyone other than a die-hard nationalist say anything other than “Vorsprung Durch Technik”?\u0026nbspBritain, and other western nations, have also given businesses responsibility for functions they never had when Friedman was writing.\u0026nbspSo, yes, society does have a big stake in how they are run, and governed. It is high time that was recognised. Society needs seats on the board, a place in the constitution,\u0026nbspa role in corporate thinking. So do workers.\u0026nbspWhen Tony Blair coined the phrase “stakeholder” it was widely criticised as a buzzword (he was rather fond of them).\u0026nbspBut businesses are stakeholders in society, just as society is a stakeholder in businesses.\u0026nbspThe betterment of one\u0026nbspfavours the other, not least because, as that McKinsey study shows, more society can ultimately lead to more money. More CREAM for everyone.It’s time for us to recognise that and to start looking at ways of reforming the system. It really isn’t serving us very well.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It failed to see it – but that failure puts a limit on how big the rock can be, since if it was large enough it would have been spotted, according to a new paper published in\u0026nbspthe Astronomical Journal and coauthored by scientists at NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.Asteroid could have been spacecraft sailing past us, say scientistsThat helps to lead credence to the theory that the relatively small object is being pushed along by gas that was being thrown out of the object. That gave the effect of adding thrust as it travelled through the solar system, speeding it up.It was that strange speeding up behaviour that led scientists to suggest that it could be an alien probe, sent past Earth by a distant civilisation. The extra propulsion could be caused by the object working as a lightsail, designed to be carried along by solar radiation, Harvard scientists recently suggested.The alternative and more accepted theory of frozen gases inside the object being expelled and pushing it along was dependent on Oumuamua\u0026nbspbeing smaller than typical comets inside of our solar system. With the determination that it probably is, the research seems to suggest theories about it being an alien spacecraft are less likely.Oumuamua has been full of surprises from day one, so we were eager to see what Spitzer might show, said David Trilling, lead author on the new study and a professor of astronomy at Northern Arizona University. The fact that Oumuamua was too small for Spitzer to detect is actually a very valuable result.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightSocial jet lag is a new phenomenon where people shift their sleeping patterns backwards and forwards during weekends and holidays. It is thought to be exaggerated by disruptive things like phones and social networks that encourage people to stay up and follow the news, and\u0026nbspit is thought to affect a vast proportion of the population.Usually, people are forced to wake up much earlier than their biological clock would suggest, as they get up for work. At the weekends, people will often move back again, going to sleep later and making up for it with lie-ins in the morning.This is the reason you\u0027re not sleeping wellNow a new study has found that appears to be causing social jet lag, where people are disrupting their sleep pattern between the week and the weekend.The new research came from a study that looked at\u0026nbspthe Twitter activity of more than 246,000 users from 2012 to 2013. Those tweets were tagged with geographical location, allowing researchers to use them to understand when people were going to sleep and waking up.It found that people across the US seemed to sleep in and tweet later during times that saw large amounts of holidays. Previously, scientists had suspected that social jet lag might change with the seasons and the amount of daylight – and while it does differ through the year, that appears to be more a consequence of the way people\u0027s social schedules change, rather than anything seasonal in itself.We started the study expecting it to be a solar or seasonal effect – that your internal clock will shift in the summer and that will lead to decreases in social jet lag, said Aaron Dinner, professor of chemistry and one of the study\u0027s senior authors. But in fact, that\u0027s not what we found at all. People get up later on weekdays in the summer because their social constraints are relaxed. Weekend behaviour – and presumably a person\u0027s biological clock – does not change much over the year in most counties.The researchers also found that the data about sleep correlated with obesity rates: places that tweeted until later also saw higher rates of obesity. They also correlated with sleep data taken from more traditional studies.I was impressed that so much could be learned from this purely public data set that was not at all intended to tell you about sleep, said Michael Rust, associate professor of molecular genetics, cell biology and physics and the study\u0027s other senior author. In fact, we could rediscover things like the correlation with obesity or levels of social jet lag based on time zone that were found in other studies where people designed surveys to ask about sleep directly.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I got to dance twice, went up in a hot air balloon twice, and I loved it twice.”Silverton\u0027s dance partner Aljaž Škorjanecand said: “Every week going out there and delivering incredible performances, for someone that has never performed in her life I am so incredibly proud of you.

My mum was over visiting and pointed it out to me and was utterly shocked - so I checked it immediately.I thought she surely must’ve been mistaken but to my horror she was right. I think someone celebrating the life of a man who’s caused such terror is outrageous. And if it’s a joke, it’s not remotely funny.”Fellow resident Victoria Adcock, 42, said: “It’s obviously a prank. People being outraged are just playing into the prankster’s hands. They should just take it off and forget about it.”Claire Newbigging, 37, said: “I’ve not seen it first hand but it’s got to be a joke.

A third of those who replied were undecided.\u0026nbspThe majority (63.3 per cent) backed a second referendum when asked how the government could give people a say on the terms of Britain’s exit from the bloc, while 10.9 per cent suggested a public consultation.About 10 per cent said they trust the government to do a good job, and 7.4 per cent said the UK should just leave the EU.Kajal Odedra, executive director of change.org UK, said people feel “bombarded but gagged by Brexit”, regardless of whether they voted to leave or remain in the European Union.EU to decide whether Brits will need visas in event of no-deal BrexitVoters in most vulnerable Tory seats \u0027back fresh Brexit vote\u0027Every day takes us closer to giving the people the final say on BrexitThornberry says Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumCorbyn rejects calls for Final Say referendum, despite Labour backlashJohnson insists May can be forced into Final Say referendum on BrexitWriting exclusively for The Independent, Ms Odedra said: “The choices the government makes in negotiations are critical.\u0026nbsp“But they are being made far away from the public with no consultation whatsoever.\u0026nbsp“When we asked change.org users, only 7 per cent of those polled felt they have been given a chance for their voices to be heard since the referendum.“And 85 per cent felt they didn’t have any say in shaping the government’s Brexit strategy.”Leave voters were more likely to feel heard by ministers at about 23 per cent, while only 1.4 per cent of Remain voters said they had been listened to, according to the poll.Young people were also more likely to feel ignored than older voters, the findings show, with just 8.3 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds reporting that they believe their voices are being heard.Around a quarter of over-65s said they felt listened to, compared to 20 per cent of those aged 55 to 64, and 10.5 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds.It comes after a special parliamentary event heard that\u0026nbspmore people back a fresh referendum than oppose one in all of the 67 most marginal Tory seats.The YouGov survey of 25,000 people\u0026nbspalso found that a majority of voters in the Labour constituencies that voted Leave in 2016 now back a fresh referendum, by an average of 59 per cent in favour compared to 41 per cent against.It also comes as more than 3,000 people were expected to attend a major rally in London to urge\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspto reject a bad Brexit deal.Cross-party MPs have backed the call,\u0026nbspincluding Tory Jo Johnson, who resigned from government last week over Theresa May’s Brexit strategy, Labour’s David Lammy and SNP\u0026nbspWestminster leader Ian Blackford.Liberal Democrat MP\u0026nbspLayla Moran, who backs the Best for Britain campaign,\u0026nbspsaid: “No one voted for this pathetic little deal which actually hands over our sovereignty, making the UK a rule taker rather than a rule maker. It is the opposite of taking back control.”Caroline Lucas, former Green party co-leader,\u0026nbspadded: “The only solution is to take the final decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the public with a People’s Vote.“On Brexit, it’s clear we have a parliament in stalemate that can’t deliver a clear choice for the future. So it’s time to let the British public do it instead.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Peer demolishes second referendum bid with THIS point about 2016 vote                Tory peer TEARS into Barnier during heated Brexit debateConservative MP Sir Bernard said Westminster\u0026rsquos revising Chamber must not be allowed to grow \u0026ldquoexponentially and axing the 200 peers over the coming years was the \u0026ldquoobvious step.He said: The House of Lords is of vital importance to the UK\u0027s political system, carrying out important scrutiny and revising functions, but it is a problem that the size of the Chamber continues to grow exponentially.My Committee is calling for the number of peers to be reduced, and then capped, at 600, as recommended in the Burns report.This is an urgent window of opportunity and the Government and other party leaders must seize this moment of consensus to ensure the number of peers is reduced to 600 over the years ahead.Sir Bernard Jenkin wants the number of peers in the House of Lords capped at 600 (Image: )The committee of MPs have highlighted how the reduction rate proposed in the Burns report would take up to 11-years to implement.It has called for party leaders to agree to strict retirement targets in order to accelerate reaching the new target.MPs said a sharp fall in numbers could be achieved with a commitment from Prime Minister Theresa May following a \u0026ldquotwo-out-one-in policy.They have also called for a body to justify new appointments to the Chamber, which would be allocated to pparties based on their vote share in the most recent general election.Sir Bernard, the MP for Harwich and North Essex since the 2010 general election, has also laid out plans for a new 15-year term for newly-appointed peers.                Labour peer MOCKS organisers of second Brexit referendum marchMPs said the fall in peers could be achieved by Theresa May following a two-out-one-in policy (Image: )He said this was a \u0026ldquodesirable but not essential part of the recommended reform, but also described it as \u0026ldquoperhaps the most radical element of the scheme.The PACAC chairman added: \u0026ldquoThe introduction of 15-year term limits for new life peers is perhaps the most radical element of the scheme and it will immediately create two classes of peer with all existing peers remaining appointed for life, and all new peers for a fixed term.There are members of both Houses who have been highly effective parliamentarians for far longer than 15 years, and this fixed term could remove peers at the peak of their effectiveness.But Sir Bernard said the proposals outlined by the committee would just be \u0026ldquoa minimal incremental reform and \u0026ldquowill fall far short of the aspirations of many who wish to see abolition or an elected Upper House.Sir Bernard Jenkin said the proposals would just be a minimal incremental reform  (Image: )He concluded: Adopting this reform does, however, not remove the pressure for more fundamental reform of the second chamber.A spokesman for the Lord Speaker\u0026rsquos Committee said: We are pleased the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee have recognised the importance of the Burns committee recommendations to reduce the size of the House of Lords.We welcome their agreement that a capped membership of 600 is appropriate and new Members be appointed on a \u0027two-out, one-in\u0027 formula in line with general election results.In the first year since the Burns report was published, the House of Lords has met the recommended targets in reducing the size of the House but it is important that progress is maintained.

It implies that it is possible for the UK to be outside the single market and customs union while having access to European markets without there being any border frictions.\u0026ldquoIn other words, the UK could continue to trade freely with Europe, without being legally bound by EU trade rules.Former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair (Image: Harry Murphy Web Summit via Getty Images)Jacob Rees-Mogg immediately criticised the draft deal (Image: Jack TaylorGetty Images)He stressed it would be impossible to harmonise the two objectives.The ex-Prime Minister also expressed doubt about the \u0026ldquocomplex backstop agreement to prevent a hard border in Ireland, which would create a single customs territory between the EU and the UK.While it would only kick in should Britain\u0026rsquos future relationship with the EU fail to keep the border open, some critics warn it could keep the UK trapped in a customs union with Brussels indefinitely.Mr Blair said: \u0026ldquoThe argument is that the backstop will keep the Irish border open, and that the UK will remain in a customs union for a transition period determined by London.

His favourite food was biscuits soaked in spirits.On Jumbos journey from London to the US, he needed a daily allotment of whisky to keep him calm.He also used to eat anything thrown at him by visitors, including childrens toys and coins - hundreds of which were found in his stomach after he died.Last year, Sir David Attenborough investigated the le of the elephant claimed to be the largest to have ever lived in a BBC documentary.Sir David said: “I’m going to look beyond Jumbo’s celebrity for the real elephant behind the myths.“How big was he in reality  And what is the truth behind the mysteries that surround his tragic death ”Sir David and his team were given unique access to Jumbo’s remains at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, shedding light on the unforgettable true story behind an amazing elephant.When the team analysed Jumbo’s bones, it discovered evidence of how his le in captivity damaged him physically.After finding an unusual layering of old and new bone in his hip, Dr Richard Thomas, from the University of Leicester, said: “He has many signs of stress and strain-related injuries.“They must have been incredibly painful for him but may have reflected the use to which he was put.”Often pictured giving rides to visitors at the zoo, it seems Jumbo may have been harmed by the ones who loved him most.And Jumbo had more than just a damaged hip.Dr Thomas added: “When we look at the knee we see all sorts of kind of changes in the bone that we wouldn’t really expect to see in an elephant his age. Remember Jumbo’s only  and still growing.”So Jumbo could have suffered from painful joint problems more associated with old age.Sir David concluded: “His bones are more like an elephant in its s or s.”PT Barnum claimed Jumbo was the largest African elephant on the planet, standing at around ft.But by analysing his leg bone, the team discovered he was around ft in at the time of his death.A typical wild African elephant of the same age measures around ft in.However, a crack in Jumbo’s leg bone reveals that he was still growing when he died.Dr Thomas said: “Male African elephants continue to grow until they are  so Jumbo had another  years of getting bigger.”He may not have been as tall as Barnum claimed, but according to Sir David: “He could have matched that claim had he lived.”Jumbo’s calm nature during the day was in contrast to his behaviour at night.Sir David said: “He would become possessed by terryingly violent rages in which he would smash the timbers of his enclosure.”Jumbo was also prone to hurting himself in his confusion, even breaking off both tusks on one occasion. When they grew back, he ground them down against the stonework of his enclosure.His keeper, Matthew Scott, is said to have given him whisky to try to calm him down.The zoo’s superintendent, Abraham Bartlett, was convinced Jumbo was suffering from musth, a natural condition affecting young male elephants when they become sexually mature. It can cause them to become extremely aggressive.But Dr Vicki Fishlock, a researcher in Kenya, disagrees.She argues that musth would have caused Jumbo to be violent towards his keepers, too.And as Sir David pointed out: “There is nothing in the historical records that Jumbo was ever violent towards people.”A new clue emerged when the team found evidence of malformed teeth when studying Jumbo’s skull.Dr Thomas said: “We can think of elephant teeth a bit like conveyor belts. They have six teeth but only one will be in wear on each side at any one time.“Another one will be coming in underneath to replace it at the time which that tooth falls out.”If a tooth does not wear down enough, it will not fall out and will block the new tooth, bending it out of shape. This would lead to terrible toothache.”And Professor John Hutchinson, from the Royal Veterinary College, believes his toothache could have been made worse by the sticky buns pushed through his bars by visitors to the zoo.”Sir David said: “Anyone who’s had toothache knows that it seems worse at night when you have no distractions, so maybe this is one of the explanations for Jumbo’s terrying nocturnal rages.”Dr Holly Miller, from the University of Nottingham, took samples from Jumbo’s femur and rib bones to discover more about the food he was eating.She said: “We’re definitely seeing some suggestion that he’s not getting the iety of diet that other elephants should.”In the wild, African elephants have a ied diet of grass, leaves, twigs and even bark. Dr Miller says the pathologies of Jumbo’s teeth show they were soft and coming through at the wrong angle because they were not being used in the right way.“They’re not being used to grind down the right food.According to a report at the time, his stomach was filled with English pennies, whistles, keys and rivets.It has been reported that Jumbo used to habitually eat coins which had been thrown into his enclosure - and the evidence supports this.Jumbo’s stuffed body was then kept at Tufts University in Massachusetts but was lost in a fire.Jumbo’s tail still remains, from which Dr Miller analysed hair to give a snapshot of his diet almost right before he died.It revealed a high amount of nitrogen, which suggests his body was under stress and was extracting as much nitrogen as possible from his diet to help repair it.In September , Barnum’s circus went to Canada to perform in St Thomas, Ontario. Written records show that Jumbo was suffering from a sort of wasting disease at this time.After the show, Jumbo and a small elephant called Tom Thumb were being loaded on to the circus train when a freight train came hurtling towards them.Accounts of what happened next dfer, with Barnum claiming Jumbo sacriced his own le by running towards the train to save his friend Tom Thumb.But Sir David found more clues on a visit to the Elgin County Museum in the town where Jumbo died.Curator Mike Baker showed him a photo taken shortly after the collision, saying: “You can see abrasions on his hide which match very nicely with the one good graphic from soon after the collision.”It shows the train coming up behind Jumbo, which would have caused the scrapes on his body.Examining the drawing, Sir David said: “That is the circus train with the box car that Jumbo was going to get into, and the locomotive would outrun him and hit him in the rear and that’s the end of poor Jumbo — not what Barnum said.”And with no evidence of fractures on the skeleton, he concludes the most likely cause of death was internal bleeding - leading to a tragic end to a sad and short le.Even after his death, Jumbo was not allowed to rest.He was displayed in a gala in New York and paraded for four years as a roadside attraction.Dumbo will be released in theatres in March .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I sense, like the recently axed Big Brother and The X Factor, it’s been living off its reputation for a couple of years.Enjoyable as it’s been, the basic issue with this run has been the lack of a central figure in the mould of Syed Ahmed, Katie Hopkins or the late, great Stuart Baggs to take the series by the scruff of the neck.Some have shown vague promise but the closest thing it’s had to an alpha bell-end is Captain Pangea himself, Kurran Pooni, who was marked out less by his all-round uselessness than by the wrist he broke arm-wrestling back at the house, and his insistence he was “ per cent stepping up as project manager” just before he  per cent stepped down.There was no dodging the bullet, though, last week, when Lord Sugar demanded he PM a marketing campaign “for a noo airline” with accompanying adverts “and a noo unorm as well”.Kurran wasn’t underselling the sense of destiny he felt at this responsibility. “Everything in my le has led to this moment,” he claimed, presumably ’cos he hadn’t done anything  up until that moment.The great thing about this task, though — like all the best Apprentice episodes — was that the laughs were shared round equally.So while advert director Kurran was recreating the Club Tropicana video on Southend seafront, Camilla and Jackie were designing a stewardess’s unorm for the party-themed Jet Pop that wouldn’t see the light of day eveneasyJet suddenly opened a brothel chain in Amsterdam.A horrible thought occurred, though, as she was market-researching at Heathrow.She’s not going to wear that thing pitching to  industry experts at BA HQ, is she  She bloody is, you know.She gave it the full doors-to-manual flirtation as well. So everyone’s mind was already in the gutter before Jackie finished the audience off with the news: “It’s very easy to wipe down, as well.”In the normal course of events, reducing Claude Littner to a helpless giggling wreck would be enough to lose any task.The other team, though, Typhoon, had contrived to come up with something almost as bad, Manage Air, a business-targeted operation whose corporate logo looked like a satanic pentangle and theme tune was AC DC’s Highway To Hell.There was a genuine sense of tension in the boardroom then, which would’ve been ruinedSugar had played it all for laughs.He didn’t, though. He let the contestants hang themselves with their own words before firing Kurran, who could leave with a sense of “job done”.He’s created a bit of Apprentice folklore, after all, and hopefully reminded everyone this show is far from dead.Naturally, in the final taxi scene, he also remained convinced of his genius, boldly declaring: “My advert was gold.”The first and possibly last time in his le where he’s not just  per cent wrong, he’s  per cent right as well.Glorious television.Dianne: “Stephen Fry.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Sesame Street’s Big Bird lives in what street ”Oliver: “I don’t know.”Joe Lycett: “A bird in the hand is worth two in the what ”Jon: “Foot.”And Bradley Walsh: “Which former EastEnders star presents the Sky One series Extreme World ”Zoe: “Barbara Windsor.”CELEBRITY Hunted contestant and former Commando Johnny Mercer MP has faced a stark choice this past month.The eternal humiliation of being beaten by Chris and Kem, off Love Island, on the Channel  hide ’n’ seek game.Or two weeks in a confined space with a clearly smitten Kay Burley.Heroically, he chose the latter, enduring her attention and pet namewith the same sort of grit that probably saw him through three tours of Afghanistan.Then, last week, he sneaked off for an unscheduled visit to his we, Felicity, and Burley completely lost her s***.Lost it so badly, in fact, that she threw herself at the mercy of a passing bread truck driver, which led to the best update of the series: “Kay Burley is currently in a -ton lorry, on the M, between junction  and .”She was quickly grassed up, of course, then apprehended at the Warburton’s depot, without the need for a vet or a tranquilliser dart.But while it’s a poorer show without the old mad-whack, there’s still plenty of mileage left in this gripping series.AJ Pritchard is cornered in Shropshire, Olympic silver medallist Louis Smith has just been found hiding in his mate’s Jacuzzi showroomand Baldrick-brained duo Chris  Kemhave somehow given everyone the slip.But as for Johnny Mercer  He’s probably smuggling himself back to the Mouth of Hell fort, in southern Helmand, just for the relative peace and quiet. Paul Merson: “For me it’s six and a half of one and a dozen of the other.”Graeme Souness: “The only one with potential is Martial and Pogba.”Dion Dublin: “Liverpool are in second and a half gear.”And Charlie Nicholas: “Pogba’s either brilliant or a showpony. He played OK last week.”THIS week’s Doctor Who episode introduced us to the Demons Of The Punjab, who turned out to be nothing of the sort.They were just morbid sods who mope around the universe “honouring those who die alone”, like soldiers, holy men and Brendan O’Carroll on For Facts Sakes.No actual science-fiction storyline to speak of then.But that’s not really the point of this viewer-shedding series, which has already got on its high horse about sexism, Donald Trump, American segregationist racism, men giving birth and gun control.Kind of inevitable, then, that the BBC would eventually pour a bucket of its self-loathing sick all over the British Empire, via the partition of India in , with an episode that was every bit as historically powerful as Carry On Up The Khyber.The key dference, of course, was that Bungdit Din and his Burpers weren’t actually being used as a means of brainwashing children.Because If you were expecting Doctor Who to present the flip side of Britain’s relatively benign rule in India , then you’ll also be waiting for the episode where Jodie Whittaker lands in a Soviet gulag and starts teaching children about the brutal idiocy of Marxism.The BBC just doesn’t do anything other than its own left-of-centre view, these days – or irony by the sounds of things.As it’s just been revealed there’ll be no festive episode of Doctor Whobecause it’s “run out” of storylines.Run out  RUN OUT How the hell can a series run out of ideas when it hasn’t had any yet This Morning, Thursday: “Coming up, at quarter to , the rise of the penis filler, Doctor Ranj is here to answer your questions.”The show’s other penis filler, Martin Lewis, will answer them on Monday.IT seems almost wrong to single out just one programme from Sunday’s beautul Armistice Day coverage, but the year’s most meaningful TV awards should probably all go to BBC’s They Shall Not Grow Old, made by Peter Jackson, whose astonishing film gave a voice, laughter, tears and colour to some of the extraordinary men who survived the - trenches.Those of us who watched it, on Sunday, are unlikely ever to forget the experience. Those of you who didn’t, must catch up with it on the BBC iPlayer.Be sure, though, to watch it right through to the credits’ last chorus of Mademoiselle From Armentières, where it names the veterans who have all long since passed but whose memories and souls have never seemed more alive and unforgettable.“It’s quite hard to put your finger on it.”I’ll bet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s quite unusual in a politician.But then I suppose Trumpo isn’t your usual politician.The US President was at it again in France.The idiotic French President Macron has dug up that idea about a European army, run by those genius minds at the EU.Those of us not keen on the EU always worried about this ridiculous notion — but we were told by pro-EU politicians that it would never happen. Another lie.Macron said Europe should have its own armed forces to guard against interference from Russia, China and — the USA.What a rude and stupid statement to make in the run up to Armistice Day.When French people would do well to remember that it was us — and the Yanks — that saved their benighted country.Sometimes I wonderit was worth it.Trump was right on the case, with one of his famous tweets.He des­cribed Macron’s comments as insulting.And he added thatit wasn’t for the Americans, the French would be speaking German by now. Quite right.And he’s right, too, that the EU nations do not pull their weight when it comes to funding the real alliance against our real enemies, Nato.They all like to snipe from the sidelines at the USA.And resent the Americans for their power, influence and success.And for bailing them out of the last war.But then they expect the yanks to spend vast amounts of money protecting them all.Germany, one of the richest countries in the world, spends only . per cent of its GDP on forces for Nato. That is as pathetic as it is typical.The French themselves spend only . per cent.We’re second only to the Americans in our spending — but even then I would argue that it’s not enough.Our Armed Forces have been cut to the bone over the past two decades.Would we be able to retake the Falkland Islands now,Argentina invaded  I doubt it.The truth is that Nato is the one alliance of which we should be glad to be a member.It is an alliance of largely civilised, largely democratic countries which has held fast against tyrants, despots and warmongers for  years.Most notably, of course, the Cold War, in which the Soviet Union was defeated without a shot being fired.But now Trump is getting a bit tired of Nato because the US always has to spend, spend, spend.And with the Europeans thinking again of having an EU army there are many who think the days of Nato are numbered.That would be a terrible mistake.An EU army to replace Nato It would be bureau­cratic, incompetent and short-funded.And it would surrender before you could say “Macron”.THE Lord Mayor of Sheffield is a ludicrous dingbat called Magid Magid who has been coughed up from somewhere deep in the bowels of the Green Party.Shortly before Remembrance Day he posted a publicity shot of himself online wearing a white poppy and a T-shirt saying “never again!”A good moment, then, to ask the vital question: Have you ever met someone wearing a white poppy who wasn’t a complete and utter moron We wear red poppies to commemorate the terrible loss of le in battle.People wear white poppies to commemorate themselves and their fatuous sensibilities.It’s called showing off.WAGES have risen at the fastest rate for almost a decade.They went up by nearly three per cent in the three months to September, compared to a year earlier – and about time, too.

Suppose we had to submit to a trade and tarf regime designed solely to benefit the other .I hope both sides could agree that such an outcome would be the worst of all possible worlds. And yet, that is where we appear to have ended up.First, under the transition, we shall explicitly be non-voting members for two years.As Brussels has spelt out with brutal clarity, the only change will be that Britain loses its Commissioner, its MEPs and its vote in Council.Then, under the backstop, that status, or something very like it, will be imposed on us in semi-perpetuity.Surely no one — Remain or Leave — can favour such an outcome.I have been arguing since polling day for moderation.I was prepared to accept any compromise, including European Free Trade Association and including Chequers, provided it restored the supremacy of our laws.But the purgatory that now beckons is surely, by any definition, worse than either staying or leaving.From the start, our objective was simply to reach a deal — any deal.Our negotiators, shell-shocked by the referendum result, approached the talks in a spirit of damage limitation.They never seriously contemplated walking away, and the other side smelt their desperation.To be fair, our officials were not helped by the noises coming out of Westminster.How would you expect EU negotiators to react when senior British politicians urge them to hang tough and force a second referendum We might view Tony Blair, John Major and Nick Clegg as has-beens but, believe me, they are seen in Brussels as men of influence.So we fell into a pattern. Britain would make some new concession in the hope of unlocking a deal.Then Brussels would pocket the concession and demand more and — incredibly — British Remainers would cheer.The UK agreed to hand over more money than was due accepted the EU’s absurd and illogical sequencing made an unconditional security guarantee offered to copy EU standards and promised not to be more competitive than its neighbours.Each time, the EU brusquely demanded “more movement”. Each time, Britain rushed to comply.Which brings us to where we are — facing colonial rule from Brussels, of the sort the EU imposed on Bosnia following the Yugoslav war.I am not one of those Brexiteers who half-favoured no deal all along.On the contrary, I was proposing moderation even before the vote, and have repeated that call many times since.But, paradoxically, our reluctance to countenance no deal has made such an outcome likelier.We have reached the point where the terms on offer are less attractive than either a World Trade Organization-based Brexit or a second referendum. This last point is critical.I suspect that two contradictory arguments will now be wheeled out before wavering MPs.Europhiles will be told that the deal, backstop and all, is better than “crashing out” on WTO terms.Conversely, Eurosceptics will be told thatthey don’t approve the deal, Parliament might vote to extend Article , thus imperilling Brexit.These two lines of argument can’t both be true, of course and, in reality, neither of them is.We’re invited to believe thatBoris Johnson and Jo Johnson, from opposite ends of the Brexit spectrum, both oppose the deal, it can’t be too bad. In fact, both Johnsons oppose it because it is a lamentable failure of statecraft.Boris was no Brexit headbanger: He came out for Leave only after the EU refused to give David Cameron any powers back.And Jo is no Remoaner: He has spent two years in Government trying to deliver a reasonable Brexit. If neither of them will back the deal, that tells us something.There is still time — just — to recover our position.As things stand, the backstop has no legal force.The moment it finds its way into a treaty, it will be binding. If any MPs oppose the current approach, now is their chance to act. There won’t be another.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The public was reassured our sovereignty would not be surrendered to any meaningful degree.The Tory and Labour leaders both knew this was a lie. But they kept quiet when signing us up in  and when holding the first referendum in .Voters were betrayed from the start. And the pattern was set.In  John Major signed the Maastricht Treaty, creating the EU, without risking the public vote that saw it initially rejected by the Danes and Irish.In  Tony Blair — who now shamelessly praises fork-tongued civil ­servants for hoodwinking eurosceptic ministers — feared he would lose a referendum on handing new powers to the EU. So he refused to hold it.His successor Gordon Brown, never big on honesty when a lie served him better, pretended this Lisbon Treaty was too insignicant to bother voters with.The EU is founded on deceit. “When it becomes serious, you have to lie,” says President Jean-Claude Juncker. Voters are bullied into reversing inconvenient referendums or denied a say at all.And so to Mrs May, the Brexit deal her Cabinet agreed last night and the revealing EU leak yesterday which makes crystal-clear Brussels’ intentions to keep us in its vice-like grip for ever.That plan being to lock us into its Customs Union for all time, unable to make our own trade deals, powerlessly swallowing its orders and obeying its rules.Our Government knows we cannot legally escape this central pillar of the EU — which we voted to “leave”, remember — without consent from Brussels that it will never give.This is not some minor afterthought, to be bargained away, which is why MPs rejected it in July. It is crucial to the reclaiming of our sovereignty which a .million majority including many Sun readers, voted for in .It is crucial to our post-Brexit prosperity. It looks crucial, too, to whether the deal lives or dies. Yet, knowing exactly what the EU intends for us, the PM still brazenly insisted yesterday that we WILL make our own trade deals.How, Mrs May  We cannot.

Men who take care of women, give compliments and know what they want. I will be waiting for you to take my innocence.”It also lists a series of rules for the process, stating that “documents of my virginity will be provided by local health authorities”, the buyer “also has the further possibility to check me up again with a doctor he trusts” and “we will spend  hours together at the hotel where the winner is staying”.Payton said she didn’t want to ask her parents, who are originally from South America, for any financial help and would “probably” never tell them.She said: “I think they would think it’s kind of stupid, I don’t think they would get angry, they would just ask me why I would do something like that.“I guess I’d lie .

They want Britain to have a unilateral way out of the Irish backstop plan that could keep the UK in the customs union for many years otherwise.Allies of Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt and Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom say they could both quit by the end of the week unless Mrs May relents. But dfering tactics emerged among the rebel Cabinet group last night.Michael Gove has told friends he won’t now resign eventhe PM refuses ALL the Pizza Club’s demands. The Environment Secretary also thinks they have a greater chance of talking Mrs May out of agreeing a “single customs territory” with the EU as part of a joint vision for a future trade deal.Brexiteers fear the new phrase - in the far shorter Political Declaration that will accompany the orce deal - will spell an end to any hope of controlling our own trade deals where, and could be even worse than her Chequers plan for a soft Brexit.International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and Transport supremo Chris Grayling are also expected to sit tight now. The Pizza Club will try to meet today to draw up a plan of action, but by late last night no time had been set for the get together because of clashing diaries.One former Brexiteer minister, who has already resigned, told The Sun: “The only way to make your case heard by the PM is to put your job on the line. Dominic Raab and Esther McVey did that, but the others haven’t had the balls to yet and probably now won’t, so whatever they ask for is futile.”To the dismay of Brexiteers yesterday, Mrs May argued that the backstop plan to ensure the Irish border stays open wouldn’t workeither side could pull out of it.The PM told Sky News: “Just think aboutyou took out an insurance policy, andyou were coming up to the point where that insurance policy was being used, and suddenly people pull the plug on it for you  What would you think ”She added: “We agreed the withdrawal agreement in principle last week. The focus this week will be on the future relationship”.The PM also revealed she will fly to Brussels mid-week ahead of the summit to press the case personally for her vision of a future trade deal, pledging “an intense week” ahead. The draft Political Declaration that sets a course for the future relationship published last week was just seven pages long, as opposed to the orce deal’s  pages.But Mrs May also revealed she hopes she will be able to persuade round Brexiteer doubters by painting in a more complete vision. The PM argued: “It’s the future relationship that actually delivers on people’s concerns in the withdrawal agreement”.She also warned coup plotters who want to replace her as Tory leader to think again, saying: “It is not going to make the negotiations any easier, and it won’t change the Parliamentary arithmetic”.While admitting it has been “a tough week”, askedshe had considered stepping down, Mrs May said: “No, I haven’t”.The PM will mount a fresh bid today to sell her deal by saying it will halt EU migrants from being able to “jump the queue” to get into Britain. She will tell the CBI’s annual conference this morning: “Getting back full control of our borders is an issue of great importance to the British people”.Writing for The Sun online today, former Cabinet minister Priti Patel says of the current future trade deal blueprint: “The EU is tightening its grip on us and we get nothing – certainly no trade deal - in . This agreement effectively means that the EU has taken back control.”The DUP also called on the PM to renegotiate the backstop last night, arguing it splits Northern Ireland from the EU. Its Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said: “It is clear that it is time to work for a better deal which does not undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will again rule out voting for Mrs May’s deal next month unless she deepens customs ties with the EU. In his own speech to the CBI, the Opposition boss say he would negotiate “a new comprehensive and permanent customs union”The Tories’ sticking plaster plan for a temporary customs arrangement, with no clarity on how long it will last and no British say, can only prolong the uncertainty and put jobs and prosperity at risk.Two opinion polls yesterday revealed Labour has opened up a three point lead over the Tories after days of party turmoil over Brexit. As the Conservatives descended again into a full blown civil war, an Opinium poll for the Observer found the Tories have dropped five points to % while Labour has gained three to stand on %.And a ComRes poll for the Sunday Express and Sunday Mirror showed Labour on % versus versus the Conservatives on %.Alongside her woeful and deeply unpopular -page withdrawal agreement was a much sketchier seven-page political declaration that outlined ambitions for our future trading relationship with the EU. It said very little.Before negotiations formally start, it is vital Mrs May gets a lot more from the EU. Without doing so, she almost certainly won’t get the numbers to pass her Commons vote.Despite Mrs May’s stark failings, the Tories must also avoid imploding.A leadership battle will be bloody and even Tory Brexiteers are split. Dominic Raab, who resigned last week as Brexit minister, yesterday admitted he would back Mrs Maythere was a vote of no confidence... What does thatsay about the viability of a coup And voters, already irritated by Tory squabbling, will punish themthey are dragged to the polls yet again.The terrying prospect of Jeremy Corbyn in No, with all the damage Britain’s first Marxist PM could unleash, should be enough to stop the Tories from tearing themselves apart.To unite her party, the PM must start showing some energy, zeal and optimism about Britain.Our future, and hers, depends on it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Businessman Roger Kendrick demanded the Prime Minister think again and rip up her -page orce deal. But he faced an audible backlash by pro-EU fellow business chiefs at the Confederation of British Industry- which he slammed as the Confederation of European Industry. Mr Kendrick is the ex-partner of Anne Marie Morris, a Brexit-backing Tory MP who has sent a letter of no confidence in Theresa May. He also served as agent for Ms Morris - who was suspended for using the n-word, but has been readmitted to the Tories - in the general election last year.

Think again about the economics of the whole thing rather than listening to the petitions of the CBI, which is really the Confederation of European Industry. Fellow attendees at the CBI groaned in dissent at the comment. Mrs May told him the portrayal that you have given of what has been agreed is a little inaccurate - prompting cheers by the pro-EU business body. Theresa May has a Brexit deal, but the danger is looming that it will be defeated in the House of Commons. Even getting it past her Cabinet forced Esther McVey and Dominic Raab to resign. Now she faces two more hurdles - an EU summit with  leaders on November , and then the vote in Parliament at some point before Christmas.

She has to overcome two more major hurdles -  EU leaders at a summit on November , and finally a vote in the House of Commons. At both stages she could be thwarted - especially the last one. MPs are threatening mutiny over the Northern Ireland backstop, a customs backup plan that could leave the UK trapped in Brussels orbit. After months of very little to report things could now move very quickly in a frenetic round of diplomacy. A lot is unknown, but here is the most likely timetable in the weeks and months ahead.  Disclaimer: Labour still hasnt guaranteed it could back a second referendum, and with such chaos over Brexit, no one can quite predict what will happen!Brexit timetable - key dates in what happens next IF everything goes to plan Tuesday  November : After months of stalled talks over the Northern Irish border, and  days after the Brexit vote, a deal was finally reached at a technical level between the UK and EU. Wednesday  November: Ministers flooded to an emergency Cabinet meeting from pm that ran for more than four hours to sign off the deal. This was the first of three danger moments for the PM, and ministers were ordered to either back the deal or quit. Thursday  November: Cabinet ministers Esther McVey and Dominic Raab both resigned over the Brexit deal as Mrs May gave a statement to Parliament defending it. At the same time key Brexiteers launched a challenge to her leadership, forcing Mrs May into a defiant statement in Downing Street.  Sunday  November: An emergency EU summit with  other leaders in Brussels to sign off the deal. This will be danger moment number two for the Prime Minister, when she has to face down pro-EU leaders like Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel. But its likely shell face more trouble at home than in Brussels, where EU officials have already spent months working out the detail. Thursday  December: The next scheduled European Council summit. This is the last chance saloon to agree a deal with the other EU leadersno emergency summit is scheduled. Already its much later than the ideal date, which was meant to be October. Otherwise there wont be time to sign it off before Brexit Day. Theresa Mays Cabinet has signed off a -page draft Brexit deal with Brussels - and it has enraged Tories. Here are some of the reasons why:The transition period can be extended - and we dont know how long for Goods face being checked between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK We need the EUs permission to quit the backstop European courts will still have a big hold on the UKFOR THE FULL GUIDE CLICK HERE Thursday  December: BEFORE this date, there will be a vote in the UK Parliament on the deal. MPs should get a vote on two elements - the withdrawal agreementand the future framework . This is danger moment number three for Theresa May - and by far the worst one. If any of the crunch moments will force her from office, it will be this one. She will almost certainly have to resign or face a vote of no confidence. She claims the UK will leave with No Deal anywayshe loses. But Labour say she should be forced back to the negotiating table call a general election or even trigger a second EU referendum.  January to March : Dozens of national and regional parliaments across the EU will hold their own votes on the Brexit deal. Meanwhile, No Deal planning has to ramp up in case everything doesnt come together in time.  March : Brexit Day. If theres a deal, this will be a total anticlimax because a transition will be in place. If theres No Deal, planes could be grounded, ports jammed up and customs checks thrown into chaos at pm.   December : If theres a deal, this is when the transition period - which continues pretty much all the EU rules we have now - is supposed to end. Only at this point will the much-discussed Brexit deal actually kick in. Talk has been floated of extending this date by a few months. After December : If theres still no deal to stop customs checks on the Northern Ireland border, under current plans a backstop would kick in. This could keep the UK tied to EU customs rules, until a proper agreement is reached, in exchange for keeping the Northern Ireland border open. What happensa deal is voted down   If MPs do not vote for the PM’s deal then the UK defaults to a no-deal Brexit. Such a scenario could trigger a crisis in the financial markets, plummeting sterling and adding to an unprecedented political crisis. Theresa May has a Brexit deal, but the danger is looming that it will be defeated in the House of Commons. Even getting it past her Cabinet forced Esther McVey and Dominic Raab to resign.

What then  Constitutionally, the Government must decide what happens next. Ministers have to come to Parliament by  January to make a statement setting out their proposals. Will the PM quit or face a leadership challengeshe loses the vote   Few Tory MPs seem happy with Mrs May’s leadership but important factors have somehow managed to keep her in power to date, and they haven’t changed. Tory MPs know they are likely to face voters’ anger and there is no agreed successor. If she resigns it could still be messy. Will there be an election  Theresa May would also have to lose an vote of confidence in the Commons in order for an election to occur. What is the latest stage at which a no-deal Brexit can be reversed   Some argue the only real deadline for a deal is  March . As long as a deal has been struck, and approved by Parliament in a meaningful vote by Brexit day, then Article  can be extended in order for the legislation to be passed. This could mean that evena deal was voted down the first time round it could be put in front of MPs again, possibly early next year.

UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights Philip Alston called welfare cuts a political choice. And he declared: Government policies have inflicted great misery unnecessarily, especially on the working poor, on single mothers struggling against mighty odds, on people with disabilities who are already marginalised, and on millions of children. But Ms Rudd - who replaced Esther McVey on Friday - prompted shouts of anger as she branded Mr Alstons comments wholly inappropriate and extraordinarily political. Speaking today just  minutes into her first Commons QA of her job, the Work and Pensions Secretary said: Ive read it over the weekend.  I must say I was disappointed to say the least by the extraordinary political nature of his language. We on this side of the House will always engage with professionals, with experts, with NGOs. We are not so proud we dont think we can learn as we try to adjust Universal Credit for the benefit of everybody. But that sort of language was wholly inappropriate and actually discredited a lot of what he was saying.  It came after Labours Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary attacked Tory ministers of being entirely dismissive of the UN report. Margaret Greenwood warned the government has been determined to press ahead with rolling out Universal Credit despite warnings disabled people could end up in destitution. She called on Ms Rudd to end the governments state of denial and stop the rollout. The UN rapporteurs report said the roll out of the Universal Credit treated “claimants like guinea pigs” and threatened to “wreak havoc in real peoples’ lives.” The Mirror are demanding a halt to the expansion of Universal Credit and for a review to take place. We say there are three options:Redesign UC to be fit for purpose Axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable Introduce a brand new systemSign our petition to stop the rollout of Universal Credit across Britain and to replace it with a fairer system by signing our petition. Mr Alston said during his visit he has spoken to people who “depend on food banks and charities for their next meal, who are sleeping on friends’ couches because they are homeless and don’t have a safe place for their children to sleep, who have sold sex for money or shelter, children who are growing up in poverty unsure of their future.” “The Government has remained in a state of denial, and ministers insisted to me that all is well and running according to plan, he added. Ms Rudd looked solemn later in todays QA as she vowed to ensure Universal Credit is compassionate. She told the House of Commons: I know there are problems with Universal Credit despite its good intentions - I have seen them for myself.

The inequality, austerity and neglect that drove so many to vote for Brexit isn’t dealt with at all in this deal. That is why Labour is opposed to the Government’s Brexit agreement and is determined we achieve a better deal for Britain’s workers and our country. We have set out an alternative plan for a sensible jobs-first Brexit. The Prime Minister’s deal leaves Britain’s businesses and workers in an even more uncertain state. Labour would negotiate a permanent customs union with a UK say on future trade deals, which all but the hard-right privatisers think is necessary for our economy.  While claiming to take back control, the Government’s “backstop” risks locking Britain into an indefinite halfway house it cannot leave without the agreement of the EU. This is an unparalleled and unacceptable loss of sovereignty, which Labour will not accept on behalf of our country. Labour would negotiate a deal that guarantees our country does not fall behind the EU on workers’ rights, or protections for consumers and the environment. We won’t let this Government use Brexit as an excuse for a race to the bottom in protections and to rip up rights at work, or expose our children to chlorinated chicken by running down standards.  We would also seek a sensible deal that guarantees a strong single market relationship. A downgraded Canada-style deal is popular only on the extremes of the Tory party. It would be a risk to our economy, jobs and public services. A good plan must also include a radical programme of investment and change. Theresa May must now go back to Brussels and negotiate a better deal. If she can’t or won’t do that, she must stand aside and let Labour negotiate a deal which works for the whole country and offers the stability and fairness people are crying out for.

Running hard to avoid falling over is a bad choice for a Prime Minister who’ll know privately her unpopular, chaotic plan is a far worse deal for Britain than remaining in Europe. Surrendering sovereignty to minimise economic damage is May’s cowardly compromise. A braver PM would denounce forcefully the cost-free easy Britannia bonanza fabricated by fibbers Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage, then champion another referendum. The uncomfortable home truths about stockpiling medicines and food as well as troops on the streets put into perspective the Leavers’ mythical poundmillion a week saving promise on the side of a bus. Timid Theresa May doesn’t come clean because she’s afraid of insulting five Cabinet Brextremists organising against her including Michael Gove and a Liam Fox suddenly believing any deal’s better than no deal.  She might survive a no-confidence vote of Conservative MPs in the coming weeks. But May is not strong and stable. She is living to die another day and her botched plan is barely worth the name. So a sovereign Parliament gains a glorious opportunity to take back control next month. Jeremy Corbyn’s immediate task is to convince his Westminster waverers the choice isn’t May’s mess or accidentally crashing out of Europe without a leline. Tory Leaver Zac Goldsmith declaring he’d have voted Remain in place of May’s mayhem. Brexit paymaster Arron Banks said last Sunday he’d do the same. They are rats abandoning the Quitter ship. The , who marched in London for another referendum were mocked as the longest Waitrose queue in history yet Ukip MEP Patrick O’Flynn attracting just four people to his protest outside No  was another sign which camp has the momentum. Time is running out but anything is possible before March  – an extension before departure, a referendum, a general election. The only certainty is the future’s unpredictability.

The huge rat ran out from underneath some rubbish he was clearing and straight into the jaws of rescue dog Max, a Manchester Terrier Cross Pinscher.Terry laid the giant rodent out next to a tape measure and it was  inches from tip to tail.He also said it was more than double the weight of the average rat he catches, tipping the scales at about g.He said: I found this one at the back of a property in a road in Bournemouth, its a bit of a troubled spot. There are lots of vacant properties and commercial kitchens, its a very industrious area.Dog accused of racist hate crime for fouling outside a houseI had my dog Max with me, hes good t snfing out the source of entry at properties. I was clearing some debris at the back of the building and this rat bolted out of it.Max reacted very quickly and just grabbed hold of it and shook it, killing it.Looking at it I could tell it was one of the biggest Id seen so I decided to get the tape measure out and it was  inches, the biggest Ive ever caught.The weight of it was absolutely unbelievable, it was so heavy. The average rat weighs about g, I think this was easily g. As the manager of TP Pest Control Services, Mr Walker has more than  years experience as a rat-catcher, but said they have got much bigger in the last five years.He said: Theres no doubt about it, I think there are definitely ft long rats in the UK. Its just a matter of time until someone catches one.If you go back a few years ago the averagewas maybe  inches, but they are definitely getting bigger.I caught a in one last year and another guy caught one that was  inches and this is in. To my knowledge, those are the three biggest people have actually shown with a tape measure.Lots of people say theyve seen one but unless you have the proof, who knows.I think its because we are creating more waste, our society is getting more obese and the type of waste we are throwing away is fattier. Thats what the rats are feeding on so they are getting bigger too.I dont think it helps that a lot of councils have changed to fortnightly bin collections. Theres all sorts of accumulative reasons.Most of my work now is rats and its growing year on year."},{"url":null,"title":"boy born size coke can","story":"NewsBoy born size of Coke can and given  hours to live celebrates becoming a teenLeyton Duke-McKennas mum was told by doctors her baby would never walk or have any quality of le after he was born unconscious at just  weeksShareCommentsByTom Evans:,  NOV NewsLeyton was born at  weeks and was the size of a can of Coke \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA boy who was given just  hours to live after being born the size of a Coke can has defied the odds and celebrated his th birthday.Leyton Duke-McKenna was born unconscious at just  weeks on November  in .His mum Paula McKenna, , says she was told by doctors to prepare for the worst after the birth of her premature baby.

But she refused to give up hope, and the family is now celebrating Leyton becoming a teenager. Mum-of-ten Paula had a dficult pregnancy with a number of complications. She said: “The first time I went into labour I was  weeks. I was sat on the toilet in hospital and the amniotic sac fell into my hands. “I had to press the emergency button and all the nurses came running.

Leyton has faced some ongoing health issues, and didn’t start walking until he was five years old, but is now in his junior year at Palmerston School in Aigburth and is “happier than ever”.  Paula said: “I started to believe what the doctors were saying, that he’d never walk.But he walks and he talks and he’s a little character who never complains.He’s in his own little bubble, I’d love to be in his world.” Paula, who kept expanding her family to become a mum-of-ten, said Leyton is her miracle child.

Michelle Elliott, , also goes by the name of Selkie Shell and has been practising witchcraft for three decades. After watching a video of an orangutan fighting a digger that was destroying its homeland, Michelle decided enough was enough. Now, shes rolling up her sleeves and conjuring up spell after spell from her home in Mawnan Smith, Cornwall, to get witches from around the world to join her to fight deforestation and environmental issues.  Michelle said: It all started when I watched a video on YouTube showing an orangutan physically fighting a digger that had just cut down a tree in the Amazon, he was fighting to protect his home. It really affected me, especially as years ago I had a profound vision that when the animals start to fight back, we are at the crisis point of mass extinction. Teaming up with other witches around the world, Michelle wants to cast a global spell to bring about positive changes for our planet. She hopes the spell will help restore the natural balance and save the world from pollution, fracking, intensive farming, deforestation and extinction.  Michelle continued: I figured why not try to use my gts for the good of the planet. So I took a leap of faith and set up a Facebook group called The Cauldron of Changes, and then invited people to join me every Saturday evening for a focused  minute meditation to manest positive changes for our Earth. A former games cashier at Butlins, Michelle is now a full-time self-employed wise woman.  Her day-to-day jobs include psychic healings, oracle readings, house and health dowsing and charm making. She has a collection of hats, some of them are pointy, and her home boasts a cauldron, called Awen. Michelle added: The group has since gone from strength to strength and I now have people from all over the world and from very dferent backgrounds and religions, all focusing and working magically with me each week.  And what is truly wonderful about this global spell is that everyone focuses in their own way. There are some people who say prayers, some who drum and chant, whilst others sit comfortably in their armchairs and relax into a meditative state of mind. The important thing is that we all focus together at the same time and for the same reason - that is the real magic!

The inquisitive six-month-old leans forward in mother Kates arms and plants his tiny fingers over Prince Charles face - causing him to burst out laughing. The heir to the throne can also been seen squeezing his eyes closed to avoid a mishap, while the rest of the family giggle at the youngsters antics. In another stunning photograph of the pair, Charles cuddles Louis on his chest and gently places his cheek on top of the tots head. The new images follow several other official photographs released over the past week to mark Prince Charles th birthday and show the strong bonds between the Prince of Wales, Camilla and their grandchildren. Prince Charles beams with pride playing with youngest grandson Louis They feature the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall along with Charles two sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, and their wives Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle. Prince George and Princess Charlotte are also present in the family photos to mark their grandfathers big day. The pictures were taken in the garden at Clarence House in early September by Getty photographer Chris Jackson, a favourite of the royal family. Clarence House initially released two new images - one formal and another more candid snap - showing the Cornwalls, Cambridges and Sussexes posing together around a bench.  Prince George, five, sits on his grandpas lap, with Charles clutching his sides asabout to tickle him, and three-year-old Charlotte flashes her trademark cheeky smile next to her step-grandmother, Camilla. Prince Louis, who was just over four months old at the time, is held by mum Kate and can be seen giggling. In one photo, taken in a moment where half the group were distracted from their formal poses, the family can be seen laughing at something beyond the camera.  Meghan and George have broken out into raucous laughter while Charles, William, and Charlotte, ever the professionals, keep a steady eye on the camera with a wide grin. Camilla, cuddling into her step-granddaughter, points towards the photographer to show Charlotte where to aim her gaze. Meanwhile, Kate and Prince Harry have somewhat bemused grins on their faces - as does baby Louis. In other photographs, Charles is seen at the wheel of his Aston Martin DB Volante at Highgrove, as well as feeding his chickens.

Simon Fletcher, , damaged both of his knees after taking part in a  metre dads race on June . Competitive Simon felt a pop before falling to the floor in searing pain at the finish line of the race at his sons primary school in Burnley, Lancs. He was rushed to Royal Blackburn Hospital where he was told he could not bend or bear any weight on his knees. Consultants at the hospital said it was the first time they had ever treated a patient who tore patella tendons in both legs at the same time. The patella tendon attaches the bottom of the kneecap to the top of the shinbone.  Production manager Simon, who was supposed to celebrate his th wedding anniversary on the day of the accident, said: The dads race is notoriously competitive but Ive never known someone to be taken away in an ambulance before. All I remember is running fast then stopping suddenly, hearing a pop, feeling searing pain and then falling to the floor. Someone from the school ran for an ambulance, I was just laid on the floor I couldnt physically get up. I remember the pain and really trying to get up. It was so freaky how it happened. I dont even know, to this day,I won.  Simon underwent a three-hour operation to reconnect the torn tendons and his legs were put in braces. He spent a week in hospital before being released in a wheelchair. Simon could not use stairs because of his injury and had to move in with his parents, who have a bungalow. He also had to take time off work and was unable to help his we, Jane, , with their two children. Simon added: It must have been a few years since the last time I ran in the race. I got out of my chair to run and I honestly dont know what happened. My son witnessed it and it has hit him very hard since, he wanted to be with me in hospital and at home rather than school. Other parents have been really supportive and everyone helped on the day. Following the accident, the dad from Nelson, Lancs., set himself a target of walking again by the end of October - in time for the familys holiday to Disneyland in Florida, where he would celebrate his th birthday.  He visited CrossFit Pendle almost every day to build up his muscles and improve his mobility. Crossfit is a specic fitness program that combines a wide iety of al movements into a timed or scored workout. The program involves pull-ups, squats, push-ups, weightlting, gymnastics, running, rowing and a host of other movements. Simon said: I knew I had to get myself back on my feet for our family holiday with our children Amelia and James. The dad of Amelia,  and James, nine, stopped using his wheelchair after about  weeks and started using a walking frame and crutches. He began to learn to walk unaided from October  - just three weeks before jetting off for the familys -day trip to the USA. Simon succeeded in his objective and took his wheelchair on holiday only as back-up, but only used it in the airport and when his legs were tired. Speaking about his current health, he said: Im not there yet, but am certainly well on the road to recovery. I think I might askwe can do an egg and spoon race next year.

Children diagnosed with a severe allergy took part in a trial where they were given increasing amounts of peanut protein over a year. The trial found that participants not normally able to tolerate exposure to even a tenth of a single peanut could eventually cope with two whole peanuts. It is believed that by gradually building up tolerance levels, allergy sufferers could protect themselves from accidental exposure. Researchers from Evelina London Childrens Hospital and Kings College London took part in a study which suggests immunotherapy treatment, already used to treat pollen and bee sting allergies, could protect people from le-threatening reactions. Sophie Pratt, , from Kentish Town in north London, enrolled her six-year-old daughter Emily, who has had a peanut allergy since she was one, on the study.  The study has completely changed our lives, she said. Before Emily took part we were uncomfortable being more than twenty minutes away from a hospital and she wasnt able to attend play dates or parties without me or my husband being there. We had to constantly study food labels to ensure peanuts were completely eliminated from Emilys diet. Her allergy was very severe so even a small amount of peanut could lead to a very serious reaction. The impact on our family le was huge. Ms Pratt said by the end of the year-long trial Emily was able to tolerate around seven peanuts. The PALISADE study recruited nearly  children aged four to  from the US and Europe to take part in the largest-ever peanut allergy treatment trial. Participants were split into groups who received either a capsule of peanut protein or a dummy powder. Doses were gradually increased every two weeks for a period of six months, before continuing on a maintenance dose of peanut for a further six months.  The results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found about % of children and teenagers could tolerate at least mg of peanut protein, compared with just four per cent of participants on the dummy placebo. Professor George du Toit, paediatric allergy consultant at Evelina London and the studys chief investigator, said: Peanut allergy is extremely dficult to manage for children and their families, as they have to follow a strict peanut-free diet. Families live in fear of accidental exposure as allergic reactions can be very severe, and can even lead to death. Until recently there has been nothing to offer peanut allergy suffers other than education around peanut avoidance and recognition and self-treatment of allergic reactions. Peanut allergy, a potentially le-threatening condition, has doubled over the last two decades and affects about  in  children in the UK. The allergy is rarely outgrown and is the most common cause of food allergy deaths. The PALISADE study was funded by Aimmune Therapeutics, which manufactures the peanut protein used during the trial.

Staff at the universitys school of journalism have reportedly been warned writing words capped up could frighten the students into failure. Teachers are also reportedly being told to avoid the use of the word dont and negative instructions. A memo reportedly says lack of clarity when explaining tasks can lead to anxiety, adding that staff should also avoid the use of capitals. Lecturers are instead being told they should write in a warm and helpful tone. According to The Express, a memo says: Despite our best attempts to explain assessment tasks, any lack of clarity can generate anxiety and even discourage students from attempting the assessment at all. The memo says to avoid the overuse of do, and, especially, DONT. One staff member reportedly said they used upper case letters for emphasis. But according to reports, the university said its guidance was based on best practice from the latest teaching research. A tweet posted by the university today said it hadnt banned capital letters, but a statement said it is best practice not to write in all capital letters. Professor Margaret A House OBE, Vice-Chancellor at Leeds Trinity University, told .“At Leeds Trinity University we support our students to be the very best they can be. We’re proud to offer a personal and inclusive university experience that gives every student the support to realise their potential.“We follow national best practice teaching guidelines and the memo cited in the press is guidance from a course leader to academic staff, sharing best practice from the latest teaching research to inform their teaching.For every assignment, academic staff have an ‘unpacking’ session with students so the students are clear on what is expected. The majority of universities do this. It is also about good communication and consistent style. For example, it is best practice not to write in all capital letters regardless of the sector. “We are absolutely committed to enhancing and enriching the student learning experience at Leeds Trinity, where staff and students are a name not a number.We support students to achieve their full potential, and we are proud that this is reflected in the University’s employability statistics with % of our graduates in employment or further study within six months of graduation, and also in our very successful alumni community.”  Last month,reported that sign language clapping is being encouraged over regular clapping at The University of Manchesters student union to avoid triggering anxiety. The University of Manchester Students Union passed the resolution to encourage the British Sign Language version at student union events at the first Senate session of the academic year on September , according to student newspaper the Mancunion. It was argued that the loud noise of traditional clapping and whooping pose an issue to students with anxiety or sensory issues. BSL clapping – or, jazz hands – would be a more inclusive form of expression, the paper said.

Edward wanted to ensure his guests were fed well and any visitors to Sandringham were required to sit on the device and be weighed upon arrival and departure to seethey had put on pounds during their stay. If the royals Christmas food is anything like that of the average Brit, everyone will be putting on a few pounds.  Seward also spoke of how unusual it was for the Queen to extend an invitation to a family member of an in-law. “It is unusual for an outsider to be invited, but the royal family does change, she told Grazia. “I’m sure the royals will do everything in their power to make Doria feel at home.’” The royal family usually spends both Christmas and New Year at Sandringham House and have done so since , when Windsor Castle was being rewired causing the royals to relocate.  On Christmas Eve, the family lay out their gts to each other on trestle tables and exchange them at teatime.Presents are usually cheap and fun. Last year, Meghan reportedly gave the Queen a singing hamster which went down well with the Corgis.Prince Harry allegedly once gave his grandmother a shower cap which said aint le a bitch on the front.On Christmas Day the family attends morning service at St Mary Magdalene church, which dates back to the th century.

Just hours earlier, dad Sunny had been putting Khadijah in her car seat when the flesh on her hands and legs started blistering.By the time they got to hospital, the blisters had spread all over her body.  She was rushed straight into theatre and doctors started pumping her with fluids and antibiotics, while Sunny and we Nida sat in a room desperately waiting for updates.During the agonising wait, doctors came in and said Khadijahs heart had stopped but they had managed to restart it. However, they warned she did not have long to live. That’s when we started phoning family to come, Sunny said. Tragically Khadijahs condition rapidly deteriorated and despite doctors attempts to resuscitate her, she died with her parents by her side. The day before, they had spent a lovely day out at a park, but Khadijah didnt seem well so they took her to hospital.The staff thought it was a virus and sent her home, Sunny added. However, the next day we Nida was convinced something was seriously wrong with her daughter and they knew they needed to take her back.Sunny and Nida, who have three sons aged eight, five and three, are still coming to terms with the sudden death of Khadijah, who was also born with a complex heart condition. Just last month, Sunny stood for hours next to a billboard in Birmingham showing the final photo of him and Khadijah as a thank you to Birmingham Childrens Hospital and the care they gave her. People reacted by calling Sunny an inspiration and a brave man with a good heart.  Paying tribute to Khadijah, Sunny said: The boys know their sister is in heaven. Even our youngest points to the sky and says up when we talk about her. Khadijah was a little busy body, very talkative and lively. She loved babies, always wanted to be mum when she was playing. And she was very strong and resilient because she went through so much. She had a fighting spirit few adults have.

Its been six months since we lost our daughter Khadijah and, although the pain will never go away, its moments like this that are part of the healing process, he told Birmingham Live. When she passed away, we had lots planned like charity dinners, appeals and aid trips and I said to my we shall we cancel everything  And she said no you have to carry on, these people need your help. So thats what weve done. Sunny runs ISA Foundation, a charity that delivers aid where its most needed. He and his team helped , people in Lebanon earlier this month, mostly thanks to donations that have come in via Green Lane Mosque in Birmingham.  This is the seventh time weve been out there to support the Syrian refugees displaced from their country, said Sunny, a former policeman who runs a security and logistics firm. Theyre still staying in makesht shelters no-one expected them to be there for three to four years. Now that winter is coming, we went to support them with donations of food, winter clothing and fuel for their heaters to help them survive the harsh winter. He added: The temperatures get very low, our winter is nothing compared to there. And the children are just in slippers and flipflops. They dont even have shoes and socks and theyre living in mud.  Our dogs live in better conditions in their kennels here than those refugees do. The area where they visited is hard to reach so the last time these refugees received aid was when the ISA Foundation visited them last year. Its heartbreaking, really emotional, said Sunny. I have to wear sunglasses otherwise theyll see me crying all the time.  Theres a little girl who was born in the camp and has Downs syndrome. Shes walking now and she came running over to me. She looks a bit like Khadijah. Her parents dont know about her condition and what lies ahead for them. I spoke to a widow with four kids whose father was shot by a sniper in the war. She says she hasnt the courage to tell them their father has died so she just tells them hes making a long journey. Its so emotional.

campaign on loan at Aberdeen from Celtic, said: “We were looking to go out to Albania and get a solid victory, which we did – four goals and a clean sheet. So that will give us the confidence and momentum going into tomorrow night which we all know is a big game.“It will be nice to be on home soil again and hopefully we can carry this result on to Tuesday night.”Christie was at the heart of most of the major talking points in Albania.He set up ex-Aberdeen wide man Ryan Fraser for his first goal in national team colours after  minutes before home skipper Mergim Mavraj was sent off six minutes later by referee Vladislav Bezborodov for a headbutt on the former Inverness Caley Thistle player.Just before the break Christie won a free-kick at the edge of the box, from which Stuart Armstrong’s strike at goal was judged to have been handled, and striker Steven Fletcher converted the penalty.Christie then played in James Forrest for him to score his first Scotland goal before his Celtic team-mate grabbed his double when he converted a Fraser cut-back in style.Christie said: “It was a brilliant game to be part of, especially in the second half.“The second goal just before half-time was crucial and going into the second half we were really comfortable and that showed.“James got the goal to put us - up and we stamped our authority on the game. It is a great team to be part of.”Livingston striker Dolly Menga was banned for two games after the West Lothian club chose not to appeal against his charge for putting his head towards Christie in a goalless Premiership clash eight days ago, after it was initially missed by the officials.However, Russian referee Bezborodov noted Mavraj’s transgression after he had first fouled Forrest and dismissed him down the tunnel.“That’s two in a week,” said Christie.“I wasn’t sureit was the captain who made the initial challenge but I was trying to get the ball off him for the free-kick and he seemed to get really aggressive and put the head towards me. I am happy that the officials saw this one.”It is exciting time for Christie, who has only recently become a regular in the Celtic side and who signed a new three-year deal with the Scottish champions last week.He said: “It has been a bit of a whirlwind. I have found myself very lucky that they have put me into a team full of great players all around me.“We are playing some great football with Celtic just now and coming away at international level, I really enjoyed playing in that team on Saturday night.“Callum McGregor was sitting in behind me as I am used to and when you have players like Ryan Fraser and James Forrest running off the ball it makes my job easy.”"},{"url":null,"title":"who are the top men between the goalposts","story":"In the first part of the EE’s Scottish football report card, Aberdeen legend Bobby Clark and top goalie coach Paul Mathers discuss the five best defenders in the Premiership right now..

Allan McGregor:Clark said: “Allan has been superbly steady both in Scotland and in England for a long period of time.“He is also someone who has been involved in Scotland squads over the years.“I’ve seen Allan feature a couple of times this season for Rangers and he is a very good goalkeeper.“He is very experienced and he is one of the reasons Rangers could win silverware this season.”Mathers said: “Allan makes a lot of important saves that people don’t notice, like when he rushes off his line and makes saves.“Or one-on-ones that maybe aren’t the flashiest but are really good saves.“He reads the game very well, and because of that he can act sharply to get off his line and stop goals.“In terms of shot-stopping, he is very good and this year at Rangers you can see he is trying to play out with the ball at his feet.”. Zander Clark:Mathers said: “He’s got great presence in terms of his size and makes important saves.“He is a modern goalkeeper, he kicks well and distributes the ball well and fits in well as a modern goalkeeper.“I coach him at St Johnstone and we are working on making him more composed and calm under pressure.“In the first game of the season he made a big mistake, but since then he has been exceptional and made important saves in every game we’ve played this year.”Clark said: “He is not someone I have seen too much of. But St Johnstone have been solid for a number of years and a goalkeeper is an important part of that.”. Zdenek ZlamalMathers said: “I’ve been quite impressed. He is a big guy and he is quite a character when you see his warm-up of swinging on the crossbar.“So far this season he has started well and made a lot of good saves.“But the test is coming up for him in the next few weeks where Hearts have lost a few games and conceded a few goals and people might start questioning him.“His confidence and mentality will be tested, can he deal with making mistakes  That is a big thing. Can he handle the scrutiny ”Clark said: “Zdenek is another that I haven’t seen too much of, but I’m hoping to see more. Hearts have had a good start to the season andyou want to be up near the top of the league the goalkeeper must play their part.”"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 34","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowWe head Loch Caolisport for this week#s reader#s photograph.It was taken by Delores Firth of Ormsary from her garden looking down towards Loch Caolisport and Ellary.Delores said: #The cloud formations were my real focus when I took this picture.#Send your favourite photographs to the Argyllshire Advertiser for publication.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

It starts with an idea focusing on a particular topic and then grows around that.#Kirsteen said: #Every moment a song comes together for the first time, hearing us singing it is such a buzz.#When asked what they thought of MOJO, Alana said: #Genuinely, MOJO was amazing. It was the first time we’ve performed an entire set of all our own work, which was pretty special.#Kirsteen said: #MOJO and the reception we got performing our own music for the first time was very special.#When asked where they would most like to perform, there was some surprisingly touching answers.Alana said: #I personally would love to play in Nashville, the country capital in the Bluebird Cafe.

Fiona Coughtrie, , and Stephen Thomson, , were caught metres away from targeted store Aldi in Prestwick after pinching the generator on June . The blundering thieves made attempts at a getaway but were snared a short distance away at the traffic lights on Ayr Road. Ayr Sherf Court heard the stolen electrical device was worth pound.. Defending Coughtrie, of Galloway Avenue, solicitor Tony Currie said: “Slightly unusual as I don’t think either of them have a caravan. “It requested both of them to carry the item out of the shop. “This is an offence that was against a background of a chaotic lestyle and drug issues.” Mr Currie explained the pair were then caught “literally straight at the traffic lights”. Sherf John Montgomery commented the theft attempt was “rather pathetic”. Defending Thomson, of Elba Gardens in Ayr, solicitor Ian Gillies said: “Mr Thomson and Miss Coughtrie were living together but they’ve decided to part – and I don’t think that’s a bad thing. They’ve been getting themselves involved in drug-taking. “Mr Thomson could do with some support.” Sherf John Montgomery told the pair: “You both tell me that you want to change – well I can provide you with an opportunity to do that with a community payback order. “If you don’t comply with the terms of the order you’ll be brought back before me and we know what will happen.” Coughtrie and Thomson were ordered to be under supervision for  months.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnCourtsPrestwickAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre.

Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13594714.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_ayr-u.jpg","title":"ayr united appear itv show","story":"NewsAyr United appear on ITV show The Chase as Bradley Walsh asks questionsThe Honest Men appeared as an answer on hit ITV show The Chase yesterday .Share.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByLochlin Highet:,  NOV NewsThe Chasers \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have been flying high at the top of the Championship - and now theyve made prime time national TV.

more than , bin collections each year.Figures released through a freedom of information request show that over the last five years, council bin crews have failed to empty more than , bins from around , households.Furthermore, the number of bins missed each year has been rising since , when , bins collections were missed.Three years later, in , that number had risen to ,, and already this year , bins have been missed.Opposition councillors have lined up to criticise the figures, particularly in the wake of allegations that Scottish Borders Council is considering moving to three-weekly bin collections when the budget is proposed in February of next year.Hawick and Denholm councillor Clair Ramage said: ldquoBin collection is a very emotive subject and as councillors we receive many complaints over this very issue.ldquoTo see that there has been a rise in the number of missed bin collections is extremely alarming and has to be investigated as a matter of urgency but this is only the tip of the iceberg.ldquoIn the last month we have been informed that Scottish Borders Council is considering tri-weekly uplts, a change that I am completely opposed to.ldquoAt the moment Scottish Borders Council is struggling as we have seen householders use their recycling bins for general waste when their general waste bins are full.ldquoThis creates other problems, the recycling vehicles are then contaminated with general waste and have to pay penalties to the processing company.ldquoIf bi-weekly lts are not working then tri weekly lts will create even more problems, for example fly tipping.ldquoI realise that budgets are tight but the combination of missed bin collections resulting in rubbish spilling over encouraging vermin is not something that as a community we should accept.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer also commented: \"I do not recall missed bin collections being a statistic that is regularly shared with councillors. Perhaps the fact that for whatever reason , bins have failed to be collected explains why this is not on public record.ldquoI am regularly receiving complaints from constituents who find their bins still full on the pavement after the collection date.ldquoWhile of course there will always be occasions when the council have no control of the situation the figures being produced certainly challenge the current collection policy.ldquoCan you imagine the problems this would causethree-weekly collection was to be introduced  I for one will not support such a move and would ask the council to explain to council tax payers why this problem exists and what they are doing to resolve it.According to data collected by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework, which is a comparison network for Scottish councils, . per cent of Scottish Borders are satisfied with their local refuse collection.However, this is below the Scottish average of . per cent and is the second lowest of the rural and island councils that Scottish Borders Council is grouped with.The council also spends pound. per premises on waste disposal, which is below the Scottish average of pound..Leader of the opposition and Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell said that Scottish Borders Council officers work hard to recty issues, but residents need to be aware of how to report missed bin collections.He said: ldquoI will be interested in the councilrsquos conclusions on the long term trend. As I recall there has been a gradual introduction of food waste collections into the larger communities in the last few years, so the number of total collections may have increased at the same time as the number of missed collections has increased.ldquoBut I am concerned to see the detail of missed bin collections. I had expected, and can see, that the number of missed collections is higher in the winter months when the teams can have dficulty getting round in the snow, but it is worrying that the level of missed collections never drops below  in any one month. ldquoThe public needs to know that there is a very easy mechanism of reporting missed collections on the councilrsquos website and, in my experience, refuse and recycling staff at Scottish Borders Council do follow-up on issuesthere is a systematic cause.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said that the number of bins left unemptied each year is actually very small compared to the number the council collection.The authorityrsquos waste management service says it collects around .m bins each year, meaning the number of missed bins equates to less than half a per cent.The spokesperson said: ldquoThe number of missed bin collections over the last five years will be dependent on a number of factors including: the provision of a new weekly food waste service to around , households in  access issues due to obstruction and road closures vehicle breakdowns adverse weather service error an increase in the number of new homes which bins are collected from each year and bins not being presented by householders by am on scheduled collection days and incorrectly reported as missed.ldquoIt is not possible to determine the exact cause of any increase in missed collections but the increasingly challenging winters experienced across the Borders will be having an impact.ldquoThat was the case this year, when the extreme winter conditions experienced in January, February and March caused signicant disruption, with three full days where collections were unable to be carried out across the Borders.ldquoHouseholders reporting a missed collection over this period will have contributed signicantly to the increase this

four-fold in the space of a year.According to figures just released by the Trussell Trust, foodbank use in the Borders has risen by  percent in  months - the highest percentage rise of any local authority area in Scotland.The Trussell Trust, which support a network of  foodbanks operating out of more than  centres across the UK, have reported that between April and September , a total of  emergency food parcels were issued in the Scottish Borders  to adults and  to children.And many other locally-organised foodbank services arent even included in the figures.In comparison, the same period in  saw just  being issued.Despite the percentage increase, the number of parcels issued this year in the Borders remain the lowest in Scotland over the same period.The figures also report a UK-wide increase of  percent in providing emergency supplies to people in crisis.The charity claims the rise in reliance on foodbanks coincides with the UK Governmentrsquos Universal Credit rollout, which was introduced in the Borders during the summer.The charity says the inability of benefit levels to cover essential living costs and issues with payments remains the most common reasons for referral to a foodbank.They said: ldquoUniversal Credit is not the only benefit people at foodbanks are experiencing problems with, but the new system is increasingly driving referrals due to benefit delays, which include waiting for a first payment or having problems with a new claim.The charity is calling for the five week minimum wait for a first Universal Credit payment to be reduced.Emma Revie, Chief Executive of The Trussell Trust explained: ldquoWersquore seeing soaring levels of need at foodbanks. The time to act is now. If the five week wait isnrsquot reduced, the only way to stop even more people being forced to foodbanks this winter will be to pause all new claims to Universal Credit, until funding is in place to reduce the five week wait. Foodbanks cannot continue to pick up the pieces ndash we have to make sure our benefits system can protect people from hunger.Commenting on the figures, Tweeddale MSP Christine Grahame said: ldquoThese are truly heart-breaking figures for the Borders, which bring into sharp focus the devastating impact the Tory government is having on our local community.ldquoThe fact that people cannot afford to eat is a disgrace in any circumstances, but we can see from the statistics that in the previous year there have been  incidences where emergency food has been given to children specically ndash this is an abomination in a developed country such as ours.ldquoWhile sustained Tory cuts have created this problem, we can see that where Universal Credit has rolled out, which is the case in the Borders, it has made things worse.ldquoMichelle Ballantyne MSP who is the Toryrsquos Social Security spokesperson, represents the South of Scotland which covers the Borders ndash despite her ardent defence of Universal Credit in parliament recently, she must see now how devastating this roll out has been.\"I call on her to review her position and urgently press her colleagues at Westminster to halt the roll out of UC, so the fundamental flaws can be addressed.In response Michelle Ballantyne MSP said: ldquoWhile Ms Grahame might be correct that foodbank usage has risen across the UK, she might want to look closer before placing all the blame with the UK Government.\"We should also remember that, despite this increase, foodbank usage in the Borders is still at the lowest number in Scotland.ldquoI would consider it narrow-minded to attribute the entire increase with Universal Credit there are many other factors contributing to foodbank usage across the country.\"Aberdeen City Council and Perth and Kinross have also implemented Universal Credit around the same time as the Borders and the same report notes that foodbank usage has actually decreased in these areas.ldquoHer assertion that Universal Credit is the sole reason that foodbank usage is rising in the Borders just doesnrsquot add up.ldquoI appreciate there are issues with Universal Credit and the UK Government has said they will address them. An example of this is the announcement that there will be increased work allowances which will give a boost to hundreds of thousands of people including a pound boost for couples with children.ldquoI suggest that Ms. Grahame spend less time scaremongering and instead focus on how we can address the drivers of poverty instead."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-of-the-week","story":"This weeks Pet Of The Week, from Borders Pet Rescue, features Willow and Mittens.The charity told us: \"This lovely pair of nine-year-old sisters came into the centre as they couldnt live with the dogs in their previous home.

They really need to look at something.ldquoI donrsquot mind paying, but I canrsquot travel by busI know the toilets wonrsquot be operational. I have to now go up to Hawick and get the train. Therersquos a lot of us in that situation.Councillor George Turnbull , who serves as the ruling administrationrsquos executive member for finance, replied: ldquoMy understanding is that it is one of the many items which will be coming before the council meeting towards the end of November, because I know the council have been in discussion with a private company.ldquoI think theyrsquove been looking at every facility which is still open at this present time.ldquoIn the report that is to come before the council there will be recommendations of dferent levels: some may be closed, some may be refurbished, the charging system might change, but Irsquove not been privy to the draft report.The decision to look into privatising the toilets followed a damning report put to the council in June that showed the decision to charge for using public toilets had netted just a third of the income that Scottish Borders Council had hoped for.The current p charge for using  of the councilrsquos public toilets in the Borders was agreed by a full council meeting in February, following a report in which officers assured members that charging for toilet provision would generate an income of pound, a year.However, the report put to councillors in June estimated that the total yearly income would be just pound,.That analysis, put forth by neighbourhood services manager Jason Hedley, relied on anecdotal evidence to explain the shortcomings in income generation.He wrote: ldquoWhat is apparent from financial monitoring is that revenue income received to date is signicantly less than the estimated levels that were forecast.ldquoA revised full year of income of pound, is now being estimated, a shortfall of some pound, which in turn was expected to also cover the cost of the implementation of comfort schemes.ldquoA signicant body of anecdotal evidence around payment avoidance has been received and observed, including from elected members.ldquoThis centres around tailgating , the lsquogood Samaritanrsquo , families paying one fee for multiple usage or antisocial behaviour, where people vandalise doors or wedge them open, allowing free access to all.A full meeting of Scottish Borders Council will be held on Thursday, November , when councillors are expected to receive a report on the procurement exercise and receive recommendations from council officers on the next course of action for the regionrsquos public toilets."},{"url":null,"title":"how-did-community-action-team-do-in-the-borders","story":"THE regionrsquos Community Action Teamhas released its second quarterly report, providing a snapshot of the teamrsquos performance over a six month period.The CAT was launched in April as a collaboration between Scottish Borders Council and Police Scotland as a way to tackle anti-social behaviour and drug related crime in the Borders.The team is funded via a pound, grant from Scottish Borders Council, and tackles community priorities by fining offending motorists, carrying out high-visibility foot patrols and conducting drug searches of people and properties.The CAT has also led visibility patrols during the common ridings and festivals season, and confiscated alcohol from young people at those events.Between April and September, the team has issued  parking tickets, which is an increase of . per cent on the same period last year, and has issued  road traffic fixed penalty notices and carried out  static roadside checks.Officers have also conducted  personal drug searches and  property searches.

Perhaps a little too early for the jumpers, I attended the Memorial Hall eager to feast upon the much-anticipated performance of these young thespians.Could they really deliver this magical Christmas story and live up to the incredible reputation set by their mentors, Innerleithen  District Amateur Operatic Society  You bet your bottom dollar they did!From the moment the music started and the curtain opened on this stunning production, I along with the audiences were captivated.Playing the hopeful orphan was Freya Wilson. She already looked the part with red hair and freckles, and with stunning vocals she belted out classics lsquoTomorrowrsquo and lsquoMaybersquo, which I have no doubt produced a few tears from the audience. She embraced the character with her cheeky charm and wit, and carried out the role of the ever-optimistic character beautully.Hatching a plan to escape the orphanage and find her parents, Annie is helped by her urchin friends, who had the crowdrsquos toes-tapping and knees bouncing to a fantastically choreographed lsquoHard Knock Lersquo.

What was in the champagne bottle, I do not know, but the teenager stumbled about the stage, and conveyed the child-hating orphanage boss to comic perfection. Hanniganrsquos flirtatious manner with Officer Ward , who brings Annie back after running away, had the audience chuckling, and truly convinced us of her distaste for the girls in her care with a jaw-dropping performance of lsquoLittle Girlsrsquo.Anniersquos capture isnrsquot the end of her adventure, itrsquos only just begun, as she s in perfect time to meet Grace Farrell.Miss Farrell is gracefully played by the suave and sophisticated Ava Church, dressed impeccably as the rsquos private secretary to Oliver Warbucks. Annie cheekily seizes a golden opportunity to spend Christmas with Mr Warbucks, and is swept off to live the le of royalty at his mansion.Annie soon melts the heart of wealthy businessman Oliver Warbuckswho gave an endearing performance as the billionaire. The two gave a heart-warming rendition of lsquoI Donrsquot Need Anything But Yoursquo. This will be Thomasrsquos first and last performance with KIYT, but Irsquom sure it wonrsquot be last wersquoll see of this talented young man.After promising to help Annie find her parents, in step the villains of the show ndash scheming Rooster Hannigan and his ditzy blonde girlfriend Lily St Regis.Together with Miss Hannigan, the three plot to swindle Mr Warbucks out of a , dollar reward by posing as Anniersquos parents.Alex Paterson pulls off the flashy self-assured gangster brilliantly, and with his money-grabbing side-kick Lily St Regis, the two are perfectly paired bringing not only the comic element to the show, but impeccable American accents, which polished off their characters.Now at this point I must declare my motherly interest, as Lily was played by my daughter Neve Scott. It is very dficult for one to critic her own child. However, I am very proud to call her a vain, blonde bimbo, red-lipstick wearing, smoking, winey voiced, floozy!The three baddies gave a show-stopping performance of lsquoEasy Streetrsquo which had the audiences in stitches.True to the classic, their evil plotting is foiled and Annie has her happy ending after being adopted by Mr Warbucks. The whole cast came out in glorious chorus for the finale of lsquoTomorrowrsquo.There is one furry four-legged actor who deserves a mention for his tail-wagging performance, the adorable Harry who is no stranger to the spotlight after his dog debut as Toto in the Operarsquos lsquoThe Wizard of Ozrsquo. Stardom beckons for the pooch, whom Irsquom sure could be crowned a Peeblesshire Pet Idol in the future!Praise swept over social media for the young cast last week, leaving many hoping this will be the first of many shows by the talented KIYT cast. But there was one vital element missing from this show.

the referee’s whistle brought the first half to a close and allowed time for everyone to draw breath.Sary Rahma put the home side ahead with  minutes to go and celebrated in some style – possibly his last goal for the home team and maybe the winner The dream finish to a successful stay eluded him, as the home side collapsed in the final quarter to surrender the initiative and points.The extraordinary game also had a thumping free kick from Martin McCallum that almost demolished the cross bar, before he rounded the keeper to narrow the deficit with five minutes left.

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change

authorities across the country had seen spending on maintaining their roads cut by  per cent since .Iain Gray, East Lothian MSP, said the latest report which revealed the state of the countyrsquos network was a ldquodirect result of cuts to local authority funding by the Scottish Government.He said: ldquoThe condition of roads is a problem across Scotland. This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices. Money will have to be found and some services which are lsquonice to haversquo may have to see new or increased charges. Working out whether cuts or charges are the best way forward, whilst protecting the vulnerable, will make this yearrsquos budget no easy task. This process starts again now and the Conservative Group will play the fullest role it can in determining a responsible approach to our vital infrastructure.Councillor Stuart Currie, SNP Group leader, said: ldquoMore investment is required in roads to ensure that we keep up the momentum.ldquoIt is concerning that the current level of investment is not enough to prevent conditions deteriorating further. I am hoping that the budget will provide an opportunity to improve the position."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-lodged-for-140-holiday-lodges-at-former-golf-course","story":"Whitekirk Hill, which already has planning permission to revamp the clubhouse at the former Whitekirk Golf and Country Club, hopes to build ldquocirca  holiday lodges and woodland pods on the site.Debate centring on the development, which will be determined by the councilrsquos planning committee, has been ongoing for months.Tony Thomas, representing Whitekirk Hill, said: ldquoWhitekirk Hill Ltd is delighted to reach this milestone after months of hard work completing the environmental impact assessment .

Work would be spread over six phases and it is anticipated it could be phased over the next  years.The golf club opened in  and planning permission was given nine years ago to expand the facility, with plans including a -bed hotel, new clubhouse, a second course,  lodges and  homes, but that never got off the ground.Eric Martin, who lives in the village and is part of Dunpender Community Council, said residents were still looking at the plans before forming an opinion.Save Whitekirk Campaign has set up an online petition in opposition to the plans.A spokesman said: ldquoThe plans to destroy this wonderful landscape, a haven for wildle, show no respect for the countryside or local communities and are driven solely by profit. With  holiday lodges crammed on to the former fairways, the beautul landscape and its wildle will be lost forever. There is another way! A country park, managed by a charitable trust, could deliver fantastic community benefits, education and natural play spaces, as well as jobs and spend in the local community, enhancing rather than damaging the environment.The spokesman said it was ldquohugely questionable that  new self-catered lodges were needed, adding: ldquoAny search on [property rental website] Airbnb will show an average of  self-catering options available in North Berwick pretty much every week between September and May, so an additional  could actually overload and damage the existing tourism market.

Visitors will be able to access it via a walkway.The plans were originally turned down after an objection from Transport Scotland, which felt it would ldquoresult in inappropriate parking which would interfere with the safety and free flow of traffic on the A.However, at the local review body meeting, three councillors disagreed and gave it the go-ahead.Among those approving the plans was ward councillor Norman Hampshire.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy. Let us not forget that the real enemy of us all is hate."},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors-impressed-on-visit-to-elphinstone-primary-school","story":"Parents of youngsters at Elphinstone Primary School and Nursery Class received a letter this week from Education Scotland and the Care Inspectorate following an inspection visit in September.The letter outlined a number of strengths at the school, as well as areas to improve.Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, told the Courier: ldquoWe are pleased that inspectors from both agencies recognise the positive dference that nursery and primary school staff are making for the children and their families in Elphinstone.ldquoThey considered leadership, learning, attainment and wellbeing amongst other areas and concluded that the school was good across these quality indicators.ldquoIrsquom especially pleased to see Alison Cameron receive recognition for her leadership and direction so early in her time as headteacher of the school.ldquoI know that she and the staff team will continue to put pupilsrsquo learning at the heart of all they do.ldquoIrsquod also like to recognise Heather Williamsrsquo work in laying the foundations for this positive outcome during her time at Elphinstone.The letter noted strengths in the schoolrsquos work, including kind and articulate children who make the most of their learning, and the warm, inclusive ethos that creates a family feel.No further inspections are planned, with the school urged to ldquodevelop a strategic, joined-up approach to self-evaluation to ensure that all children can achieve the best possible outcomes and to continue to develop the curriculum.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokeswoman for education, echoed the comments of Mrs Robertson regarding the schoolrsquos former and current headteacher.She said: ldquoThe inspection recognised a number of areas such as the positive relationships across the nursery and school which are making a dference for children and families.ldquoThey also commented that children were making the most of their learning and were provided with real leadership opportunities at the school."},{"url":null,"title":"austerity-over-in-the-county-definitely-not","story":"Jim Lamond, head of East Lothian Council resources, dismissed claims austerity was coming to an end as a report warned of uncertainty about the future of farming, food and drink, and tourism after the UK left the European Union .Audit Scotland identied the potential problems facing East Lothian as the key sectors of its economy came under risk.

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

You must be afraid of the isions politics has produced and the invective that comes with it  It seems everyone wants to be angry.ldquoIrsquom sick of politics, he admits. ldquoIrsquom completely disenchanted with all of it. Politicians lack so much knowledge. If Irsquom honest, I donrsquot think therersquos a politician out there worth listening to, of any creed or colour. I donrsquot have any truck with any of them. Irsquom just looking away at the moment while they do what they do, which is self-aggrandizing and performing their Punch and Judy nonsense. I cannot be bothered with it.He adds: ldquoI was in that arena vaguely for a while on account of a few opinions I was invited to give.He certainly was. Oliver incurred the wrath of the Nationalists back in  when he declared independence for Scotland a \"dead dog.\"But does he now regret becoming involved in the independence debate He pauses for thought. ldquoNo, I think itrsquos important to say what you think is true. But I donrsquot like the atmosphere at the moment whereby you canrsquot say what you think. If you are not pleasing the social media mob you are silenced or destroyed. I was asked some questions and I gave an honest answer.Oliver rejects the offer of half a sconeand instead sips at his coffee cup. ldquoHow it really started for me was when I was being interviewed for Bannockburn  [his TV show] and a journalist asked me about the referendum. ldquoI remember saying, lsquoA referendum is like going shopping for food when yoursquore hungry.rsquo You donrsquot want to be making snap decisions.Because you come away with a packet of Hobnobs and a jar of Nutella  ldquoExactly. I donrsquot think we should have referendums to decide which side of the road we should drive on, never mind kicking the ball back to the general population to determine a nationrsquos destiny. Thatrsquos why we have political democracy, whereby we employ hundreds of people to read tedious paperwork, shout and bawl at each other in a room for as long as it takes. Thatrsquos why these -odd people have a job.He becomes more animated. ldquoReferendums are a bad idea. After the Scottish referendum there were immediate cries for another one. lsquoThat disnae countrsquo. Now therersquos been Europe. And that was seen to be wrong. And so you claim for another one. What do you do  Go for best of three  Or best of five Oliver smiles. ldquoIrsquove never been a card-carrying member of a political party. I used to scoff at university friends who were. In the same way I couldnrsquot understand why anyone would get excited about football. Irsquom not minded that way.Yet, but he is minded to recognise how politics overlaps into culture and issues of identity, which he loves to wax lyrical about on his TV shows. But there are those who donrsquot countenance his passion for explaining the likes of Iona and the coming of Christianity. Some, such as Professor Tom Devine, see Oliver as an irritant.The historian once attacked the fact Oliver had been asked to front a History of Scotland ndash given he didnrsquot have a degree in history.Oliver didnrsquot take Devinersquos comment laying down however, describing the historian as being like of the old grumps from The Muppets.More recently, Oliver got it in the neck when appointed president of the National Trust for Scotland, and many Nationalists demanded his removal, which seemed odd given the TV presenterrsquos passion for this space we live in.But the writer presenter took it on broad shoulders. Did his personal history prepare him for the future stre  Seems so. Hersquos used to adjustment. ldquoI was born in a council flat in Renfrew, my dad moved to Ayr to work [he was a commission salesman] and then to Dumfries. The family was ldquocomfortable, he says. It certainly wasnrsquot an Angelarsquos Ashes set in Scotland storyline. They even managed a holiday to Spain once.Yet, the man who would go on to explain the Picts and Vikings and anacyclosis to uswasnrsquot top of the class at school. ldquoI was in the upper half but I wasnrsquot so great at maths and science so I focused on English and history, which I was quite good at.Oliver was blessed with encouraging parents who most likely were baffled why their son wanted to study archaeology, University I fell in love with the prospectus given it rarely leads to a career. ldquoI did work as an excavator for a few years going on digs, he recalls. ldquoIt was fun, but there was no money in it. And during the winters it became a bit grim.One Friday afternoon he was excavating the Roman Road in Greenock, and on the Monday he was covering a peace protest in Lockerbie for the local newspaper. Why the switch to journalism ldquoI liked the idea of journalism because it was essentially noseyness about people, he explains, grinning. ldquoItrsquos a bit like archaeology in that itrsquos the chance to poke through the rubbish, to find out what people were doing and why. Instinctively, I want to know who, what, where, why and when.Journalism has been as important to his current career, he says, as his time spent scraping dirt with a big spoon. ldquoWhen Irsquove been cast in the likes of Coast as a presenter it helped me get something out of people. And this Magpie-like work taught me how to become engrossed in a subject for a day then drop it, and move onto something .The curious mind continued to search for the next adventure and in  he joined a BT internet company. ldquoI thought that may be my future. I was also fascinated to learn how it had evolved, largely financed by the US military, who wanted to knowcomputers could survive after a nuclear attack. And so they hired these hippies to find out. And then I wondered what do we do with it  What are the consequences of it He answers his own question: ldquoItrsquos created titans such as Mark Zuckerberg, and Amazon, Google and Pay Pal. He adds in soft, serious voice, ldquoNow, Zuckerberg is almost at the point he has more power than Putin, without the missiles.While working for the internet company, Oliver decided to set off for Zululand.ldquoI had met up with my close pal from university Tony Pollard one day in the Granary Bar in Glasgowrsquos Shawlands and we came up with the idea of going to Zululand to make a film [which became the BBCrsquos  documentary, Two Men In A Trench].Boldness has to be part of the reason for Oliverrsquos success. He had a good job, with a good salary, a car and an Amex account. ldquoBut I didnrsquot have a mortgage. I wasnrsquot married. I could take a chance. And I knew I had had experience. When the TV job ran out Irsquod do something .Does the job flipping suggest a malcontent  ldquoNo, when I was at BT I figured Irsquod give it a couple of years, he says with a wee hint of umbrage in his voice for me having suggested such a thing. ldquoAnd we made the film really because we wanted to go to South Africa. The voice warms again: ldquoArchaeology was my first love and we met again. It was like Friends Reunited. And wersquove been together ever since.Hersquos a television natural. But did he always feel confident speaking to the camera  ldquoYes. Irsquove always had a good memory and Irsquom lucky in that I can remember  words in the right order, he says, grinning. ldquoTalking to the camera is not a natural thing to do. Itrsquos like a golf swing. But some people can do it. And I enjoyed being with these like-minded people. It was quite collegiate. I loved it from the get-go.Oliver landed on the box at the right time. ldquoI was   when television began to happen for me. I had few delusions about my own reality. Irsquod been in a few dferent jobs, had the rougher edges knocked off by le experience. Irsquod filled shelves at Presto supermarket while eating the Mars Bars. Irsquod worked on an MS till. He adds, with a wry smile, ldquoIrsquod been dumped often enough by women.Women. Yes, now hersquos married to one. And history taught him he should incorporate this woman into his future. Oliver met his future we Trudi when he was at university. ldquoI was in third year at the time, the president of the archaeology society and she was in first year, and she came in to join. I made a bee-line for her when she walked in the door.He grins. ldquoI donrsquot think she was as impressed by me as I was by her.She must have liked him a little because the pair were together for seven years. ldquoAnd it just sort of fizzled out. Then, years later, I met her wee brother Johnny and we swapped numbers and a few months after that I was back in touch with Trudi. It was asIrsquod seen her the day before.He reflects: ldquoThatrsquos another great thing about my le. Whatever happens, I know Irsquom with someone who remembers me when I was  and a silly arse. She remembers me when I had all sorts of archaeology student affectations, all patchouli oil and cheese cloth shirts. We can remember the teenagers we were.Oliver reveals he had the long hair back in the day. He didnrsquot create the soft Tarzan look for telly. He has just never bothered to have it cut. And it works for him, gives him a USP, although watching him on TV with the wind blasting into his face as he stands on a clf edge he does have to brush it away from his mouth a little too often but, I suppose, a kirby grip or a hair scrunchy would wreck the image.He laughs. ldquoIrsquove been holding out for the Head and Shoulders contract for  years but itrsquos never happened.Therersquos a calm about Oliver, even though he does become animated when he talks about the politics he says he wants nothing to do with. And he clearly loves his le, beaming at the delights of a career which allows him to take his family adventuring in the likes of Australia and New Zealand while filming Coast. Yet with three children hersquos not immune to worry, about the impact of social media, for example. ldquoPeople can have , friends, but ironically they have never been more isolated and lonelier. People go to Facebook ndash I donrsquot ndash hoping to see other people in this clearing in the forest who are equally lonely.Hersquos happy however, very happy. ldquoThe thing I most love these days is writing. I wrote as a student, as a journalist and then in TV with scripts. Irsquove written ten books or so and itrsquos something Irsquoll be able to do.And now hersquos making live appearances. ldquoIrsquove sort of blundered into them. Irsquom out there talking about our world, like Simon Reeve and Dan Snow. Maybe I can do this every year. Why not So the world will be all right, Neil  We need you to tell us it will be. ldquoWe tend to think this is a modern concern, but perhaps Stonehenge and Avebury are partly expressions of feeling the same concerns, people feeling they are little specks in the great scheme of things and wanting to be heard, to make a mark.He grins, reassuringly. ldquoWersquoll be fine, but I wonrsquot beI donrsquot do this school pick-up in time.Neil Oliver ndash The Story of the British Isles in  Places, the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, November ."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-insider-guide-stornoway","story":"But therersquos so much more to the Hebridean capital than just great views.

Irsquom going to look at the detail closely before coming to a final decision about how I will vote in the deal when it comes to the House of Commons.Mr Masterton, elected as the MP for East Renfrewshire last year, wrote on a blog:ldquoDeciding whether or not to support this deal will, short of a decision on whether to go to war, be the biggest decision MPs will make. I will not be rushed, bounced, or forced into reaching a position. To do so would be irresponsible and do you a disservice. You deserve a decision of this magnitude to be properly thought through.ldquoI have read the documents carefully and have a number of concerns. These relate primarily to the Northern Ireland backstop , and aspects of the future relationship framework where there is a real lack of detail.He continued: ldquoI now need to work through those concerns and understand the practical reality and real-world implications in a number of areas. So as of today, I am not in a position to state that I will be supporting the deal.However, he also wrote that leaving the EU without a deal would be a ldquoterrible outcome and voting against the May plan poses an ldquoinherent risk.Mr Duguid wrote yesterday that he is continuing to ldquoseek and receive assurances that the UK will leave the CFP and become an ldquoindependent coastal state.He added: ldquoEU demands for continued, guaranteed access is UNACCEPTABLE.While Mr Lamont and Mr Masterton voted Remain in the  referendum, Aberdeen South MP Ross Thomson voted for Brexit.The MP stepped up his criticism of Mayrsquos plan yesterday: \"The PMrsquos plan would create serious new trade barriers between GB and NI. As a Unionist first and foremost I can never accept that.With May struggling to cobble together a parliamentary majority for the draft deal, she desperately needs her Scottish MPs onside.SNP MP Stephen Gethins said: \"With all wings of her party against her, it is abundantly clear that Theresa May has no chance of getting her deal through parliament - leaving us all in political purgatory.ldquoRather than trying to please the Prime Minister, the Scottish Tories should be listening to their constituents who voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU.\"The best deal short of EU membership is to remain in the single market and customs union.\"It is essential that we avoid both Theresa Mays hard Brexit and a No Deal scenario - and all options must be on the table to achieve that.\"A Scottish Tory spokesman said: \"Scottish Conservative MPs know that their constituents will expect them to scrutinise this draft agreement in detail before they vote, and that is exactly what they are doing.\"Meanwhile, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will tell a forum in Dundee on Monday that Brexit in any form is likely to reduce economic growth.She will use her address at the National Economic Forum on Monday to reiterate her call for the UK to remain part of the single market and customs union.She is expected to tell delegates that leaving the single market will do \"immense damage\" to jobs and living standards in Scotland.Sturgeon will say: \"The UK Governments refusal to even consider the Scottish Governments detailed plan to keep Scotland in the single market, while accepting a dferentiated solution for Northern Ireland, which we support, potentially puts Scotland at a competitive disadvantage.\"But, perhaps worst of all, it leaves everybody completely uncertain about the shape of our long-term relationship with the EU.\"The seven-page political declaration on the future contains little more than vague aspirations and platitudes.\"But while we can expect more pages forthcoming on some aspects of the future relationship, there will be no concrete reassurances.\"The governments National Economic Forum is a regular event attended by ministers and senior figures from business, the public sector and trade unions to discuss how best to grow Scotlands economy.Sturgeon will address delegates at the Apex City Quay Hotel on the theme of innovation and inclusion.She will say: \"Put bluntly, long-term economic uncertainty is hard-wired into the Prime Ministers withdrawal deal.\"If the UK Government insists on leaving the EU, then it should remain in the single market and customs union. That is the solution which respects the outcome of the referendum, mitigates the worst economic consequences of Brexit and largely resolves the Irish border issue.\"If Brexit goes ahead - in any form - it is likely to reduce economic growth.\"But that doesnt devalue our wider efforts to support business - in fact it makes those efforts all the more important.\""},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-faces-crunch-week-as-tory-critics-plot-her-exit-from-downing-street","story":"The Prime Minister appeared to have gathered momentum on Friday after surviving a spate of resignations from her Government, but she is expected to face a series of challenges to her authority over the next few days.Conservative MPs who have angrily denounced her draft agreement with European negotiators are expected to get close to the  signatures required to force a no- confidence vote in her.A core of influential Cabinet Ministers who voted Leave in the  referendum, led by Environment Secretary Michael Gove, will also meet within days in a bid to persuade May to change course.The Tory civil war comes as senior figures in all the main parties at Westminster insist she will be unable to command a majority for her exit plan.May last week unveiled the  page draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, which was put together following fractious discussions with the EU.The UK is scheduled to leave the EU next year, but Mayrsquos problems arise from what happens after the completion of the transition period in December .Under the draft,a long-term trade deal has been not agreed by the end of , one option is for the transition period to be extended for a limited period.An alternative, in order to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, is a ldquobackstop consisting of a single customs territory between the EU and the UK.However, the backstop plan infuriated some of Mayrsquos backbenchers as they believe would prevent the UK from entering into new trade deals with other countries, which they argue is one of the main benefits of Brexit.The UK would also be unable to cancel the backstop independently and would need the agreement of the EU, an outcome MPs fear would trap the UK.Publication of the draft agreement led to the resignation of members of Mayrsquos Cabinet, including Brexit secretary Dominic Raab.It also triggered a campaign on the backbenches to secure the  signatures required to force a no confidence vote in the leader.However, the move to force a vote appeared to stall after MP Steve Baker, vice-chair of the pro-Brexit European Research Group, over-estimated the number of signatures.Mr Baker had stated on a WhatsApp group that the number was ldquoover , which would have led to a contest, but he later backtracked and said his count had been ldquoinaccurate.One senior Tory told the Herald on Sunday that the figure could reach  by Tuesday, which would lead to a vote soon after.Another Conservative insider said a vote could be an ldquoopportunity for Mayshe won it convincingly.ldquoShe would be able to say she has a mandate for the deal on the table, he said.Another threat for the Prime Minister will come when Gove, whose decision to stay in the Cabinet last week gave May a boost, meets other Cabinet Brexiteers to discuss strategy.It was reported that Gove, Andrea Leadsom, Chris Grayling, Penny Mordaunt and Liam Fox will meet and try to force May into renegotiating elements of the draft.Meanwhile, May has warned her Tory opponents that rival Brexit withdrawal plans, including the so-called Norway and Canada models favoured by her hardline critics, would not solve the backstop issue.In an interview yesterday, the Prime Minister said: \"People say If you could only just do something slightly dferent, have a Norway model or a Canada model, this backstop issue would go away. It would not. That issue is still going to be there.May appointed Stephen Barclay as her new Brexit Secretary, the third this year, but the role has been further downgraded as the Prime Minister will in future take sole control of negotiations on EU withdrawal.The job of Barclay, a Leave supporter, will be limited to the domestic delivery of EU withdrawal, preparations for Brexit either with or without a deal and shepherding legislation through Parliament.He said: \"We now need to keep up the momentum to finalise the withdrawal agreement and outline political declaration and deliver a Brexit that works for the whole UK.\"Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the Prime Minister is \"prepared for anything\", when asked on BBC Radio s Today programmeshe was prepared for a leadership challenge.He added: \"I think that whatever deal, when we see ious dferent organisations and groups talk about dferent ways of leaving the EU - Norway, Canada, all of these things - what we have to be clear about ... is all of those require a backstop.\"In another development, Irelands deputy premier has warned MPs to sign up to the Brexit agreement or risk crashing out of the EU without a deal.Simon Coveney said people were \"too quick\" to write off May, saying she has shown \"resilience, courage\" and a \"reality check\" to Brexiteers in Westminster.He warned it \"will be dficult\" to find an alternative deal that will prevent a hard border. \"If we are forced into that situation we will have to look at ways in which that can be avoided but that will not be easy,\" he added.\"It is a far more sensible approach to support what is being negotiated over the last two years as a way that we know provides the guarantees that we have looked for and insisted on that there will be no physical border or infrastructure or checks or controls and that is an issue that goes beyond commerce and trade.\""},{"url":null,"title":"johnston-press-takeover-secures-jobs-and-future-of-its-titles","story":"Newly

It would not. That issue is still going to be there.ldquoSome politicians get so embroiled in the intricacies of their argument they forget it is not about this theory or that theory, or does it make me look good.It came after a tumultuous week including the departure of Brexit secretary Dominic Raab and Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey, plus the launch of a high-profile insurrection on the back benches to remove her from office.She responded by bringing former home secretary Amber Rudd, who quit over the Windrush scandal, back into Cabinet to replace Ms McVey at the DWP.Mrs May will continue her attempts to sell the deal to sceptical MPs and the public with a live interview on Skyrsquos Ridge on Sunday.But there seems little sign of the sides coming together.Mr Burt, whose role spans the Foreign Office and Department for International Development, attacked a tweet by Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the European Research Group, in which the latter promoted a lawyerrsquos legal case against the agreement reached with Brussels.Mr Burt wrote: ldquoBe very clear.

I do not believe that everyone who graduated this year has sufficient skills in numeracy to be able to teach it to -year-olds at a reasonable standard.Cue bedlam. Here for the first time was a suggestion the slide in standards could be laid at the door of poorly prepared trainee teachers unable to pass on the essential skills required to make pupils literate and numerate.Even tabloid newspapers became interested in teacher training with the front page of next days Daily Record berating the Scottish Government under the headline \"You Do The Maths\".Scottish Conservative Party leader Ruth Davidson seized the moment demanding new literacy and numeracy tests for primary teachers at the beginning and end of their course.There was even graver concern when the education committee received a follow-up report from universities which said student teachers on some four-year degree courses could spend as little as  hours on numeracy and  hours on literacy.John Swinney, the Education Secretary, said he was ldquovery concerned by the findings and raised the issue with both universities and the General Teaching Council for Scotland.More than a year on and there is still resentment from some involved in teacher education over the way the issue played out.\"The students were not a representative sample,\" one member of university staff said. \"They were a very specic group who had already written to complain to the committee and they were the only ones selected to speak. It was unfortunate and we are still dealing with the consequences.\"Professor Ian Rivers, chairman of the Scottish Council of Deans of Education, is also concerned about the weight given to some of the statements made to the committee.\"There was no actual evidence that teachers who leave university are unable to teach -year-olds to the appropriate standard,\" he said. \"Every university does its absolute best, working in partnership with experienced teachers, to make sure our students leave able to meet the requirements and professional standards expected of them.\"The committee wanted the literacy and numeracy work we do neatly calculated in terms of the number of hours we deliver, but that is a very narrow view of what we do. All of the work on literacy, numeracy is integrated into the course as a whole so it is very dficult to provide what they wanted. That does not mean that literacy and numeracy is being ignored.\"Mr Rivers also questions the current narrative from headteachers and council officials that the quality of new teachers is not what it was.Local authorities have recorded an increase in the number of probationers having to repeat a year because they were not seen as being of an appropriate standard and school leaders have also raised concerns over quality.ldquoWe do not allow anyone to graduatetheir practice is not up to scratch and that is done with assessments by a member of academic staff from the university in partnership with the classroom teacher they have been working with,\" said Mr Rivers.\"It is very important to understand that teacher education is the starting point of a journey and not the end point. When students are on probation councils are also heavily involved in the development of skills and knowledge as the teacher moves towards becoming a fully registered member of the profession.\"The other concern that has unsettled public confidence in teacher education is drop-out rates. Figures published earlier this year showed the number of new teachers leaving after less than a year had doubled in just four years. In total, almost  probationers have left the profession since the   school year.While the reasons for leaving are not given a wider survey of probationers conducted last year highlighted a number of worrying concerns about the quality of courses and the experience of probationers in schools.Some trainees told how their ldquoappalling experiences at the hands of disinterested lecturers and on placement in classrooms had made them re-think their career path. One said veteran teachers had told them to ldquoleave whilst you still can while another suggested bullying was re within the profession and staff rooms a \"poisonous environment\".The Scottish Council of Deans of Education argues that the drop out rates are not particularly high and are generally stable. However, they acknowledge a growing concern over the ever-increasing demands placed on trainee teachers and the requirement that universities provide the Scottish Government with evidence of how they are addressing a iety of additional areas including looked after children, children with autism, LBGTI pupils, black and ethnic minority pupils and pupils with mental health issues.Moyra Boland, a senior lecturer from Glasgow Universityrsquos School of Education, said all of these areas were crucial, but questioned whether it was wise to try and cram them all into a one-year postgraduate course.She said: \"You can never get everything into the curriculum. That will never happen because there is so much to know in schools and it is such a complicated job. You never stop learning as a teacher because every class provides new challenges with new combinations of children.\"Rather than thinking about covering absolutely everything in initial teacher education in Glasgow we are much more focused on how we give our students the skills and dispositions to find the knowledge that they need to support their changing classrooms from year to year.\"Ken Muir, chief executive of the General Teaching Council for Scotland , also has concerns over what is expected of trainee teachers and believes the time is ripe for a wider review.He said: \"It would be a good time to look at whether the current system of a one year postgraduate followed by a one year probationary year adequately prepares teachers for the range of youngsters and experiences they will face.\"There are huge added responsibilities on teachers, and therefore on teacher education programmes, and an expectation that everything has to be covered which creates pressures and dficulties.ldquoWe need to stand back and ask,we want teachers to be skilled in covering a wide range of areas from sex education to additional support needs, can we cram all that into an  week university postgraduate programme \"Mr Muir said one solution was to look at a longer period of induction that allowed teachers to undertake the additional studies they require once they were in school so they could focus on the areas most pertinent to the context of their schools.There is also more radical thinking on the current structure of initial teacher education.Professor Chris Chapman, chair of Educational Policy and Practice at Glasgow Universitys Robert Owen Centre, wants to see barriers broken down between universities and schools.\"If we are building new schools we should look at teacher preparation in the design of those buildings. You could have studio classrooms or experimental classrooms where trainee teachers are working with university staff and teachers in a more regular and dynamic way.\"I would like to see university staff co-located in schools and working much more closely on a day-to-day basis with teachers and student teachers and engaging with research. That would create a much more dynamic and reflective set of teachers.\"Raymond Soltysek, a former teaching lecturer at Strathclyde University and now an independent educational consultant, argues Scotland could go much further.He believes the inconsistencies highlighted in the way universities deliver basic skills is an indicator of a system where students at dferent institutions study dferent subjects for dferent s of time and are assessed in dferent ways.\"Perhaps more radical initiatives should be explored,\" he said. \"Many have suggested ious structural changes, including taking professional teacher training back into the public sector.\"However, a model of public ownership might take the form of a National College of Teacher Education ndash a central body run by the GTCS, councils, Education Scotland, teachersrsquo bodies and associations ndash which would centralise matters such as recruitment, course design, student placement coordination and assessment. That would provide much greater consistency in what is delivered across Scotland.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  May   s done the impossible - brought Leave and Remainers together  but only against her","story":"The Prime Minister made a dignied, resilient stand last week, before a House of Commons that loathes this proposal. But theres a time when resilience turns into defiance, and then defiance turns into delusion. Theresa Mayrsquos staying power is the nations curse, as she perseveres with a orce deal which has no hope. She has finally united Leavers and Remainers, but only to the extent that theyrsquore against her. Shes lost both her Brexit Secretaries, a host of ministers and both houses of parliament. But, like Monty Pythonrsquos limbless Black Knight, she battles on regardless.MPs on all sides say the European Court of Justice will continue to have effective jurisdiction over UK laws on things like state aid, labour conditions, environmental standards and tax. Theresa May insists it wonrsquot, and that by , a deep and meaningful future trading relationship will have been negotiated, which will make the backstop unnecessary. But that is a triumph of hope over experience. No one has yet come up with a way of ensuring frictionless trade that doesnt involve either membership of the Customs Union, or accepting many of the rules of the European Single Market. If you keep all or part of the single market you keep the ECJ.This doesnt mean that the ECJ is involved in every negotiation. There is to be an arbitration  to sort out everyday problems between the EU and UK. But when it comes to a dispute on EU law, the ECJ rulings are final. That is crystal clear in Article  of the Withdrawal Agreement which says that the ECJ ldquoshall have jurisdiction to make such a ruling, which will be binding on the arbitration .Theres nothing sinister in this ndash except in the eyes of paranoid europhobes. When you join a tennis club, no one complains that your rights and liberties are being removed just because you accept the rules. The real issue is whether you have any say in the making of them. Democracy demands that members of an international trading organisation should have have a share in the decision-making process. This is where the Withdrawal Agreement, indeed the whole Brexit project falls down, because as things stand, we dont. We will be rule takers.Theresa May realised very early on that the economic cost of leaving the EU completely was just too high. She gave assurances to all those big international companies like Nissan, Siemens and Rolls Royce, who have complex, just-in-time supply chains, that she would negotiate a deal that was at least as good as the single market. She effectively promised no tarfs, border checks or regulatory issues ndash ie no ldquofriction - between Britain and the EU. She had to, or theyd have upped and left . Components for Vauxhall cars are said to cross and recross EU borders at least  times before theyre finally assembled in Ellesmere Port.But removing tarf and non-tarf barriers is precisely what the Customs Union and the European Single Market were originally created to do. The EU is first of all a free trade area, the most comprehensive in the world. When Britain decided to leave, it meant that frictions would inevitably . Theresa May has been trying to square the circle ever since: getting the benefits of a single market without being in it.Shes achieved quite a lot, to give her credit. Under her orce deal, Britain gets broad access in to the single market in goods without having to accept free movement. But the cost was always going to be some continued observance of the EUrsquos regulations, plus ECJ oversight. Weve had to agree to ldquodynamic alignment with EU regulations, meaning that when they change in future Britain will have to go along with the new rules.The obvious solution might be to just join the single market, as Norway did after . It is not in the EU, the Common Fisheries Policy or the Common Agricultural Policy. This is Nicola Sturgeons preferred option, and she said last week thatScotland even got the same deal as Northern Ireland, which is to remain largely in the ESM, she would vote for the Withdrawal Agreement. But while this Norway option has worked after a fashion, it has powerful critics. It costs quite a lot, and there have long been complaints in Oslo about ldquofax democracy - that new laws are simply faxedfrom Brussels. But hey ndash thats just how these things work. You are either in the EU or you arent.So what happens now  Mays deal wont fly, yet she stands her ground. The deal will almost certainly be rejected in parliament, even though Labour dont really have a coherent alternative. Jeremy Corbyn was scathing about Mayrsquos ldquobotched deal, but he too wants to leave the EU. Nor do Labour wish Britain to be a formal member of the Customs Union or the European Single Market. John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, says he would renegotiate the deal to achieve a ldquoclose and collaborative relationship with the single market. In other words, a better deal than Mayrsquos. But the German Chancellor, Angela Merkell, has made clear that negotiations are over. End of story.Faced with a disastrous no deal, and no prospect of renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement, the opposition parties face a very hard parliamentary choice next month. Do they join with Jacob Rees Mogg and the DUP, and vote for an economic disaster which would damage the livelihoods of countless Labour voters  Or do they suck it up, back Theresa May and then blame the Tories in future for landing Britain with such a bad settlement  If they vote down Mayrsquos orce deal, they must know that renegotiation is not now an option. Nor is a general election, because the Tories wonrsquot vote, like turkeys, for an early Christmas. The only alternative is for the opposition parties to do what they should have done months ago: unite the Remain majority in the House of Commons to demand a delay on Article , and then force May to hold a repeat referendum.If parliament cant decide what to do, the only option is to hand it back to the people who got us into this mess in the first place: the voters."},{"url":null,"title":"tumultuous-brexit-events-could-have-implications-for-scotlands-economy","story":"Arguably, the publication of the Draft Withdrawal agreement was an attempt to reconcile the un-reconcilable.

A Brexit deal that is already dead in the water with the Prime Ministerrsquos own authority at risk as the Tory Party implodes with resignation after resignation from the Government. It is increasingly clear, the Prime Minister is, or now, still in office ndash but she is not in power.The Brexit deal satisfies no one, not least the people of Scotland. Instead of coming back with a deal that protects the economy across the UK, the Prime Minister has shown utter contempt once again to the Scottish people. Despite the fact that Scotland voted to remain in the European Union, the Prime Minister has decided to ignore our interests. Yet, the UK Government has agreed a dferentiated deal for Northern Ireland ndash but sold Scotland out. Quite rightly, Northern Ireland is to receive access to the European market, but that dferentiation puts Scotland at a real competitive disadvantage. We are being left high and dry by this deal. England and Wales will get what they voted for, remain voting Northern Ireland is guaranteed a special deal to stay close to the EU, yet Scotland, with the highest vote to remain of any UK nation, has our democratic wishes ignored. Instead, Theresa May wants Scotland to pay the price of a Brexit we didnrsquot support - with lost jobs, household incomes slashed and our NHS under threat.Now I wonrsquot pretend that I expect any Tory Party leader to put the interests of Scotland before their narrow party political interests ndash the broken promises of consecutive conservative leaders have taught us not to expect anything less from them. However, the context in which this conservative leader finds herself should at least cause the Prime Minister to pause for serious consideration. Consideration of the offering we in the Scottish National Party have put to her time and time again. We will vote for a deal that delivers membership of the Single Market and the Customs Union. Such a deal would protect our economy, safeguard jobs and maintain living standards. Anything less is economic catastrophe.

She should change course.It is time for the Prime Minister toto Brussels and extend Article  to secure continued membership of the single market and the customs union. It is time for the Prime Minister to take her head out of the sand and be realistic. Thousands of jobs will be lost unless a deal is secured that will protect the future of economy. It is completely reckless to risk. Playing a game of wait and see isnrsquot good enough. There is little time left, the Prime Minister cannot sit and wait to seethe Brexiteers to come with their pitchforks. She needs to show some leadership and recognise her deal cannot get through the commons, therefore she must deliver a new deal. Only one deal will carry a majority and secure our economic future ndash and that is a deal that secures continued membership of the single market and the customs union.It has been an excruciating week for the Prime Minister, her party is ided and now she is desperate. There is only one way to see off defeat, and that is to finally put the interests of citizens across the UK first not the interests of the Tory Party. I urge the Prime Minister to take the compromise and keep us in the single market and the customs union. Should she fail, she will not be forgiven and I do not mean just by those with the pitchforks in her own party. The SNP will not allow Scotlandrsquos future to be put at risk or our economy to be ripped apart.

It was a stlingly humid, rainy day in the midst of civil war in the West African nation of Liberia when I met him back in .Along with a few other boy soldiers, J-Boy was guarding a makesht checkpoint on the Po River bridge some  miles or so from the Liberian capital Monrovia.High on cocaine and alcohol and heavily armed, the boys were in an unpredictable, volatile mood and hell-bent on extorting whatever they could from terried civilians fleeing along the road from nearby fighting.Clearly wary of our presence as journalists, my driver offered the boys cigarettes to try and relax the situation before myself and a colleague began chatting with them.Like most boy soldiers J-Boy had a swaggering, boastful air and carried his assault rle like some totemic macho badge of honour. Had he himself ever killed anyone  I eventually asked tentatively.ldquoOh sure man, plenty, plenty, he replied, grinning widely, his eyes scarily unblinking. ldquoWith this good AK, itrsquos way easy, killing, he assured me, slapping the assault rle in his lap while speaking Kreyol, the English-based pidgin spoken by many people in Liberia.It was a disquieting confession, one I had little doubt was true. The AK he was referring to of course was the AK-automatic rle, or lsquoKalashnikovrsquo as itrsquos more commonly known throughout the world.Itrsquos been said that the Russian name most often uttered across the globe is not Lenin, Stalin or Putin, but Kalashnikov. The reason is depressingly simple, for there is estimated to be as many as  million Kalashnikov rles in circulation worldwide, thatrsquos almost one for every  people.The Kalashnikov is not just any gun, but a brand name that straddles continents and is as familiar as Coca Cola. With its distinctive banana curved magazine clip, the rles familiar silhouette is part of modern iconography.Mexican drug cartel gunmen boast about their cuernos de chivo, or ldquogoat horns, because of its curved magazine. In Lebanon that same silhouette has made its way onto the flag of the Islamist Hezbollah movement while in Mozambique it features on the countryrsquos coat of arms.In other African countries, the shortened form lsquoKalash, has even become a boysrsquo name. In Britain meanwhile there is a well known racehorse named Kalashnikov, while its cultural symbolism has found its way into movies like Jackie Brown by Quentin Tarantino where black market arms dealer Ordell Robbie played by Samuel L. Jackson, praises its effectiveness for ldquowhen yoursquove absolutely, positively, got to kill every mother****** in the room.The reality of the Kalashnikov of course is anything but glamorous. It is, in effect, the modern worldrsquos most plentul and efficient killing machine, an infamous utensil of death.Had he been alive today the weaponrsquos designer, former Second World War Russian tank sergeant, Mikhail Kalashnikov, would have been  years old last week. How ironic it is that Kalashnikov himself was born almost a year to the day,  November , after the signing of the armistice on November  , that ended the First World War.No firearm of any kind has killed more people than the Kalashnikov. In the  years since its first prototype was made, the AK- has dealt death to millions. Every year, small arms kill between , and , people in the worldrsquos conflicts with the Kalashnikov accounting for a high proportion and quite possible the majority of this human toll. Kalashnikovs make up more than one in ten of all firearms globally.Despite having been around weapons for most of my working le, Irsquove always felt acutely uncomfortable by their presence. On a point of professional and ethical principle countless times Irsquove declined the chance to hold or be photographed let alone fire a weapon. It only makes an already dficult job more complex when reporters, non-combatants, are seen to be shouldering any kind of arms.Only once have I broken this cardinal rule back in the s in the remote mountains of Afghanistan.ldquoShoot, shoot, mister Daoud! insisted the Afghan commander of my guerrilla hosts for the umpteenth time, as we sat one day watching his men train at a remote camp in a craggy valley in the Hindu Kush mountains.With his holy warriors looking on, the commander slotted a full clip of the boat-tailed bullets designed to give more accuracy into a Soviet-made Kalashnikov and thrust the weapon towards me.There was an uneasy pause, but judging by the looks of the fighters around me, this had simply boiled down to an issue of initiation and acceptance, a very Afghan thing about loyalty and brotherhood. To refuse my hosts now would have made my presence at best uncomfortable, and at worst, untenable.I explained that I would do this one time only, that no photographs should be taken and that he must never ask me to do it again. The commander gave me his assurance and after only minutes of instruction, a battered plastic bottle was set up some distance away as a target.As I squeezed the trigger and the first rounds cracked against some rocks reasonably close to the bottle, the gawping bearded guerrillas who had clustered around began to grin. It wasnt a question of them ever expecting me to fire in earnest, just about passing some strange communal ritual.In the event the experience was to prove instructive, for the ease with which I was able to handle the rle made me realise why the AK- had gained its reputation as a so-called ldquouser-friendly weapon.I realised too why it had become the firearm of choice among mercenary suppliers and illegal arms dealers, who know that those who end up shouldering this oddly toy-like weapon - which fires  rounds a minute, each powerful enough to punch a hole through a personrsquos chest from  yards - will have had little or no proper military training. Or, put another way, it is ideal for everyone from Afghan peasant farmers to school-kids-turned-killers like J-Boy in Liberia or some marauding civilian gunman in an incomprehensible blood lust in a shopping mall.So robust and simple is the Kalashnikov that quite literally itrsquos a gun that child soldiers can take apart and put back together in  seconds.While not especially accurate the gunrsquos controls are unsophisticated with plenty of clearance between it moving parts meaning no matter how clogged it gets with Syrian dust or Congolese mud its mechanism is unlikely to jam and those who use these weapons like such reliability.The Kalashnikovis a weapon for ldquothe small-statured, the mechanically disinclined, the dim witted, and the untrained, observed former US marine turned war correspondent CJ Chivers in his remarkable book The Gun: The Story of the AK-.It is a weapon, he notes chillingly, that allows ldquoordinary men to kill other men without extensive training or complications. So durable is the gun that as a reporter in Afghanistan in , Chivers saw an AK- stamped with the manufacturing date of , something I too have similarly witnessed.Currently some  dferent types of Kalashnikovs are now produced in at least  countries and vast quantities of the weapons have turned up in trouble spots all over the world for decades, especially in Africa.Hundreds of thousands of them disappeared after the breakup of Yugoslavia frequently ending up in the hands of terrorists and criminals. Most of the Kalashnikovs used in the Paris attacks at Charlie Hebdo and the Bataclan theatre were purchased in Belgium and traced back to the Balkans.Recently too the war in eastern Ukraine against Russia-backed separatists has led to the uncontrolled spread of Kalashnikovs throughout the country.ldquoUkraine has turned into a supermarket for illegal weapons, says Heorhiy Uchaikin, who heads the Ukrainian association of gun owners, and estimates that Ukrainians now illegally possess as many as  million firearms the majority Kalashnikovs.ldquoIn Ukraine, a gun is like shoe polish in a shoe polish factory, Uchaikin recently observed.If ready availability makes the Kalashnikov ubiquitous, so to does its cost. According to a report by Global Financial Integrity, which monitors illicit financial flows, procuring an AK- on the black market depends on a number of factors, notably the further it travels.In Afghanistan, the gun could cost as little as  while on Mexicorsquos northern border with the US, the price would increase to ,. In Belgium where the Paris Charlie Hebdo perpetrators obtained their Balkan Kalashnikovs, it has a price tag of about ,. An authentic model would cost , in Pakistan but a locally produced model can be obtained in the countryrsquos frontier bazaars for as little as . It is also possible to obtain an AK- through the darknet where costs typically range from , to ,.The independent research group Small Arms Survey based in Geneva points also to the fact that cheaper weapons prices lead to an increased risk of civil war, independently of other conflict risk factors.Countries with more porous borders tend also to have lower weapons prices. This is especially the case in Africa, where such borders allow the supply of weapons to meet demand more readily.The Survey says that in Africa, Kalashnikov prices are the lowest in the world and falling. Income, regulatory effectiveness, war legacy, and supply cost iables all lower the price of weapons, but even controlling for these factors, being located in an African country makes purchasing an assault rle around US  cheaper than the world average.During years of working across the African continent, I have stood on many dirt airstrips watching Soviet-era cargo planes being loaded up with crates of grenade launchers, ammunition and Kalashnikovs much of which often appeared to have been beneath the radar deliveries with little in the way of accompanying ldquopaperwork.ldquoAfrican conflicts are wasteful of weapons ammunition and are always in need of more. The guys who carry this stuff in are just flying truck drivers, Alex Vine who has intensively researched the arms trade and today heads the Africa Programme at Chatham House once told me.He has a point. Back in  just before I encountered J-Boy in Liberia I flew into the capital, Monrovia, on the second humanitarian aid flight ever to have reached the country since the upsurge of the civil war a few weeks before. The aircraft was flown by a group of volunteer pilots who told me that days earlier, coming in to land on the first aid flight, they had almost collided with an unscheduled incoming cargo plane.ldquoLater we found out it was flying in ammunition and guns for President Charles Taylor, which some people said was coming from Libya, the Swedish pilot told me.ldquoIts always the same across Africa, you never know who is flying what.One member of the same pilots own crew even admitted to having ldquoferried a few Kalashnikovs and bullets in his time.Illegal trafficking in small arms and light weapons is estimated to be worth . billion to . billion every year, equivalent to about  to  per cent of the legal arms trade. With over a million Kalashnikovs still produced annually, one of the worldrsquos foremost killing machines is set to remain at the centre of the global arms trade for decades to come. Today the Kalashnikov continues to kills more people each day than all the worldrsquos tanks, warplanes and ships combined.As a servant of communism, Mikhail Kalashnikov, who died in , made no money from his invention.

We are now all reaping the bitter harvest. The country has been landed with a bad deal and the unedying spectacle of a roguesrsquo gallery of hardline Brexiteers denouncing the product of their own actions.Parliamentary arithmetic means there is little hope of this deal surviving a vote in the Commons.With Jacob Rees-Mogg and the rest of the European Research Group in open rebellion, Dominic Raab joining an ever-growing list of former Brexit Ministers, and other Ministers going and gone, the Toriesrsquo time in Downing Street should surely be up. This is beyond a party political argument.So, of course, while there is an element of drama in watching the Tory party turning on itself, the problems of Theresa Mayrsquos deal are far more serious than that.One of Labourrsquos six tests for the Toriesrsquo Brexit is whether it delivers for all regions and nations of the UK. Theresa Mayrsquos negotiations have patently not produced a deal that delivers for the people of Scotland.Scottish Labour has been clear from the beginning that we need a deal that best supports jobs and our economy. Which is why a few weeks after my election as Scottish Labour leader, I said that we needed a new comprehensive and permanent customs union ndash because you need that to protect our manufacturing industry and its supply chains. This would also be the cleanest and best way to protect the Good Friday Agreement.We also need a strong and stable single market relationship, one that is good for jobs in our service industries. And we need a deal that guarantees no erosion of workersrsquo and consumersrsquo rights and environmental standards.The Tories Brexit proposal delivers none of those things. For these reasons it has to be rejected by the House of Commons ndash and its why every one of Scotlandrsquos Members of Parliament, regardless of party, must vote down Theresa Mayrsquos deal.But the position of the Scottish Conservative Party is now totally untenable. Their leader, Ruth Davidson, and the Scottish Secretary David Mundell, threatened to resignthe deal did not protect the integrity of the UK. Theresa May ignored them ndash but so far they have clung on to their positions. It is remarkable that Dominic Raab has shown more backbone and integrity than either of Scotlandrsquos leading Tories.The SNPrsquos argument that there must be a separate deal for Scotland is not a matter of political principle. It is an exercise in cynical political posturing.For Scotland to be in a customs union, the logical position is for whole of the UK to be in customs union. A hard border between Scotland and the rest of UK would make even worse the economic damage of Brexit. And remember the UK single market is four times more important for Scotlandrsquos economy than the EU single market.But providing the SNP with the excuse to play fast and loose on this issue is yet another way in which Mayrsquos Brexit threatens the integrity of the UK.Should MPs vote the deal down then this would constitute a total loss of confidence in the Government. From there, the right outcome is a General Election so that the people can finish the job they started in  and sweep the Tories from power.A General Election and a change of government is necessary to break this Brexit deadlock and avoid the no deal outcome. A General Election and change of government would create the conditions for the European Union to stop the clock on Article  and to begin meaningful negotiations with a new government that can deliver a deal to parliament and the country.We need a deal that works for the whole of the UK and it is becoming increasingly clear that is something only an incoming Labour government can deliver."},{"url":null,"title":"future-shock-the-question-is-not-whether-ufos-are-real-its-why-the-us-military-have-only-now-admitted-their-existence","story":"If Trevor ever approached you in the city centre, all urine-stained jogging bottoms and uncomfortable familiarity, asking for change towards his train fare home, you wouldnrsquot hesitate to dig deep ndash perhaps handing over your pound smart phone too so he could check the Central Station timetable.Thatrsquos why I believed this establishment-approved Knight of the Realm when he said UFOs were real. The year was  ndash the fag end of true reality, a few years before the mass fractionalisation, isolationism and grotesque self-glorication bequeathed to us by the digital dawn. No phones, no internet, your gran could whistle the Top Ten and  million folk watched Coronation Street. Before Xhamster, Ken Barlowrsquos rampant bed-hopping was all teenagers had to learn about sex.This vacuum of yawning nothingness allowed for mass pop culture crazes that infected entire continents with short-lived delirium ndash and in , the brow of the globersquos collective consciousness was hot and sweaty with X-Files fever.In fact, so seismic was the showrsquos influence that ITV saw fit to dedicate an entire eveningrsquos scheduling to UFOs ndash showcased somewhat predictably in the familiar format of a  debate. Nothing that would scare the horses, then ndash or elderly folk too jiggered to get up and change the channel after Corrie.Saucers full of secretsIT was as a prelude to this peculiar pow-wow that host Sir Trevor greeted viewers with an unforgettable soliloquy. ldquoWersquore here tonight not to decideUFOs are real ndash unidentied flying objects clearly are real, he announced, steely-jawed, unblinking. ldquoSomething is in our skies. Wersquore here to discuss what they could be and from where they might originate.It didnrsquot matter that Trevor was likely reading some faceless producerrsquos hyperbolic spiel from an autocue. The signicance lay in the fact someone who didnrsquot cut his own hair or eat roadkill just told the nation UFOs were real.Even unbound by its ubiquitous acronym, unidentied flying objects being legitimised on ITV should have been a cultural watershed ndash a moment where even the most earthbound of cynics recalibrated their stance.Yet, nearly a quarter of a century later, the credibility of UFOs has lost much of its worth in terms of cultural currency. Even reputable sightings like the darting lights witnessed by several commercial airline pilots over Ireland last week barely registered a raised eyebrow.Perhaps, then, UFOs really are just a fading hangover from less informed times, when our species was far more susceptible to vague notions of the supernatural ndash before smartphone addiction stopped our minds from wandering, killing imagination, wonder and creativity stone dead.Perhaps Sir Trevorrsquos new gig chatting to folk with morals lower than snake testicles ndash not celebs, the monsters he salaciously affords the oxygen of publicity on his abhorrent Inside Death Row show ndash is also indicative of todayrsquos anaesthetised indference to anything thatrsquos not taking place within our own silos.The dying scream of a world quickly spiralling into an uninhabitable, fascist dystopia is being deafened by the static of digital isolation. In such a dystopian, self-obsessed reality, it might actually take something as seismic as the sight of a UFO hovering over a major city to dig us out our deep burrows and unite us again as a species.Escape the netTHE smoking gun often held up by cynics dismissing the UFO phenomenon is the distinct lack of any clear photos in this smartphone-dominated era.Certainly, two major online sites for reporting sightings ndash the National UFO Reporting Center and the Mutual UFO Network ndash have both experienced numerical declines parallel to Gary Glitterrsquos royalty cheques.The internet itself can certainly shoulder some of the blame for UFOs fading fame too. Despite the initial promise that free access to information and instant communication could birth a more enlightened, empowered and equal world, a grotesque funfair mirror reflection of reality has instead haemorrhaged.Without gatekeepers, lies are now afforded an equal  to truth, and the ensuing static serves only to discombobulate focus and perception. In the era of spin, reality distortion, Photoshop and Deepfakes, good luck finding credible evidence of your own existence never mind UFOs. The internet is rather like communism ndash wonderful in theory, but the cradle of true horror when human nature is added to the formulae.At times, however, some notable events do cut through the noise. Commercial pilots are certainly credible witnesses and last weekrsquos incident over the Irish sea proved that very strange things continue to happen in our skies ndash even odder than folk willingly paying pound for a coffee and biscuit.Some of the iniduals now coming forward to tell their stories are actually more plausible witnesses than those we trust to steer us through the clouds in a sky-dart ndash high ranking government employees and military personnel with nothing to gain and everything to lose. Yet, despite waving all manner of prestigious credentials, itrsquos likely they will be taken as seriously as folk who claim to have skinny-dipped with Nessie.Full DisclosureOVER the past few decades, there have been several ldquoofficial movements attempting to find some sort of objective truth on UFOs.The most high profile is lsquoDisclosurersquo, where ufologist Steven Greer herded  whistle-blowers ndashincluding astronaut Gordon Cooper and a brigadier general ndash for a fascinating press conference held in Washington DC in . The aim  To ldquoestablish the reality of extraterrestrial vehicles, le forms and advanced propulsion technologies. The bantz at that Christmas party must be awesome.Yet, groups like Disclosure are finding it tough to gain publicity in the mainstream media, where editors have licked a finger and held it to the wind, deeming the public has lost its appetite for such frivolity in an age filled with real clear and present otherworldly dangers.But who needs the media as a conduit when the lying, conspiring governments themselves are now releasing the most intriguing and credible UFO evidence for public consumption Perhaps most jaw-dropping of all the recently declassied military footage released by the US Defence Department is an encounter between Navy F- fighters and several unidentied aircraft. The recording captures several pilots discussing a hovering egg-shaped craft, apparently one of a ldquofleet. Another film trumps that however ndash showing an F-rsquos close encounter with what is clearly, well, an unidentied flying object.More sober mindsets will speculatethis was simply space junk catching the sunrsquos light or even an advanced craft piloted by tiny Russians. Yet, such speculation itself suggests something even more terrying than the existence of UFOs ndash that we might actually be completely alone in the universe. Or perhaps were simply in too early a stage of evolution to be interesting.The Pentagon comes cleanIF itrsquos a credible UFO whistleblower yoursquore after, perhaps someone with a lot to lose from being subject to ridicule from his peers, then Christopher Mellon is your man ndash a former deputy assistant Secretary of Defence for Intelligence for the Clinton and George W Bush administrations.Bemoaning the lack of transparent government investigations into valid sightings, Mellon recently told the Washington Post: ldquoI know from numerous discussions with Pentagon officials over the past two years that military departments and agencies treat such incidents as isolated events rather than as part of a pattern requiring serious attention and investigation.He also makes reference to his colleague Luis Elizondo - who used to run a Pentagon intelligence program examining evidence of ldquoanomalous aircraft - resigning in protest at the US governmentrsquos seeming indference to a ldquogrowing body of empirical data.ldquoNobody wants to be lsquothe alien guyrsquo in the national security bureaucracy, Mellon soberly concluded. ldquoNobody wants to be ridiculed or sidelined for drawing attention to the issue. Yet, the current attitude is a serious and recurring impediment to progress.Other declassied documents reveal that the US Air Force recently launched several F- fighters in a failed attempt to intercept an unidentied high-speed aircraft darting over the Pacic. Defence Department officials also confirmed more than a dozen similar incidents taking place off the US East Coast since .Itrsquos perhaps no coincidence that these stories emerged not long after the Pentagon itself publicly acknowledged the existence of a program dedicated to studying unidentied flying objects. The soberly-monikered Advanced Aviation Threat Identication Program ran from  to , but many officials claim its efforts have simply resumed under another name. Either way, admission of its existence has marked one of the most signicant disclosures about UFO government research since the infamous Project Blue Book, a y US Air Force study into thousands of sightings that was shut down in .Officially, Project Blue Book failed to find ldquoany technological developments or principles beyond the range of present-day scientic knowledge, yet a small number of its investigations remain unexplained. And thatrsquos the thing ndasheven one of the millions of UFO sightings is true, then the phenomenon is conclusively proven. Just one.Wharsquos like US FAR from being a spectacle confined to the toothless whispers of mulleted banjo prodigies, Scotland is no stranger to wee visits from aliens, interdimentional structures, highly evolved sky dragons and time travellers from the future. Perhaps all fouryoure in Port Glasgow.Just last year, an Airbus A with  people on board which was making its final approach into Glasgow airport, came within  feet of colliding with a ldquoblue, yellow and silver object, which pilots witnessed flying underneath it. The disturbed crew immediately contacted air traffic control, stating: ldquoNot quite sure what it was but itrsquos definitely quite large and itrsquos blue and yellow. Prestwick airport backed up the sighting, with radar detecting an ldquounidentied track history . miles east of the planes position  seconds earlier.However Scotlandrsquos most infamous UFO tale, unique in British history as the only example of a close encounter becoming the subject of a criminal investigation, is known as The Livingston Incident. Forestry worker Robert Taylor claims he saw \"a huge flying dome\" in woodland near Dechmont Law on November , , describing it as seven metres in diameter, and made of a dark metallic material with a rough texture like sandpaper.Taylor claimed to have experienced an acrid smell \"like burning brakes\" and the sensation of being dragged. When police visited the site, they found marks in the soil where the craft was said to have hovered, and further tracks following the path of two ldquomine-like objects. Taylor, who died in , never sought publicity or financial gain ndash and always stood by his account.Perhaps he would have found a more sympathetic audience in Bonnybridge, home of the infamous Falkirk Trianglersquo. This well-kent ndash and henceforth thoroughly monetised ndash phenomenon was first reported in  and the area still continues to register around  sightings a year, more than any other place on Earth ndash even more than the notorious Area  in Nevada. The fact it attracts a lot of UFO tourists who are perhaps inclined to believe in the phenomenon ndash and also want their moneys worth ndash is neither here nor there, of course.Scots UFO expert Ron Halliday says: \"One theory is that there could be a window into another dimension, other worlds, the past or the future. Even Nessie probably thinks thats a bit outlandish. Although where  would you visit but Scotlandthis planet is simply some sort of space zoo for holidaying Zeta Reticulians And finally hellipTemporal lobe epilepsy is an unenviable yet fascinating condition that many doctors deem entirely responsible for all occurances of inexplicable supernatural phenomena, from UFOs to religious communion to the indeterminate forces holding Donald Trumprsquos barnet together.Those afflicted may not be aware of their condition, unwittingly suffering brief seizures, paralysis, vivid hallucinations and ndash notably ndash an overwhelming feeling of something other in their vicinity.If UFOs are indeed a purely internally projected phenomenon, we can then safely assume such stories would likely reflect current sociological, technological and cultural fears and aspirations.Certainly during the Cold War, the beings described in these close encounters were often characterised as benign saviours who wanted to help humans overcome the prospect of nuclear annihilation.And after events such as Watergate and the Vietnam war fuelled mass distrust in government, witnesses came to describe UFOs as a threat to humanity ndash their sinister occupants often rendering abductees powerless and repeatedly probing them intimately against their will.Looks like this might just be another column about Brexit after all."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-takes-swipe-at-tory-critics-ahead-of-critical-week-for-brexit","story":"The Prime Minister warned that a change of leadership would not make it easier to get a deal past parliament or the EU, after furious Brexiteer backbenchers started moves to remove her.She told Skyrsquos Ridge On Sunday that as far as she knew the -letter threshold for letters of no confidence needed to start a leadership battle had yet to be reached.In a message to those plotting her downfall, including members of the European Research Group of Eurosceptic MPs, she said she had not considered quitting.She added: ldquoA change of leadership at this point isnrsquot going to make the negotiations any easier and it isnrsquot going to change the parliamentary arithmetic.ldquoWhat it will do is bring in a degree of uncertainty.

Well you canrsquot dredge a rocky bottom, so wersquore not doing that.As MBL developed its processes to remove alginate from the seaweed, it found marine cellulose was also produced.Dr Mark Dorris, a senior research fellow and lecturer in material science at Edinburghrsquos Napier University, has been working with that to create new bioplastic materials, the starting point of which are fibres that are ,th of the width of a human hair.Wood pulp is already used to produce nanocellulose, but Dr Dorris said when kelp is used the end result is ldquobetter than any nanocellulose in the world.This raw product can be turned into bioplastics to be used in food packagingfor products such as sandwiches andready meals, but work has also beentaking place with the Ministry of Defence to develop a ldquotransparent armourthat could be used for helmet visors and body shields by police and the armed services.The nanocellulose could also be usedto develop slow release drugs for treating colon cancer, as well as to helpconserve fragile, historic documentsand artefacts.Dr Dorris said: ldquoTherersquos loads of applications for this, medical implants, meshes. This stuff, because it is made from seaweed, is biocompatible, the wood cellulose isnrsquot.But Mr Mackie said he fears plans to develop such products could be haltedMSPs vote through the legislation as it currently stands on Wednesday.He said: ldquoWe worked long and hard to develop our process, basically we have turned the whole alginate processing upside down, to get to what is unique, nobody  does it.ldquoWersquove got this brilliant raw material, we do a wee bit of magic with it.ldquoThis is the thing I am most proud of that we have done, and when I see what these guys can do it is just incredible.For Sir David, though, his concerns for kelp remain.He said: ldquoIt is perfectly possible to harvest them sustainably by removing their fronds while leaving the rest of the plant intact.ldquoBut dredging ndash or indeed any kind of harvesting that removes the whole plant ndash is a wholly short-sighted measure that risks the wholesale devastation of our kelp beds.ldquoI urge decision makers to take the necessary action to protect these vital,and globally important, habitats."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-why-this-brexit-fiasco-could-eventually-give-us-all-peace-of-mind","story":"Forty-seven years on from that revealing little moment in political history, Theresa May now faces a vote of her own in the Commons to pretty much undo all of Ted Heathrsquos work and it makes you wonder what music might be appropriate this time round. Messiaenrsquos Quartet for the End of Time perhaps. Or John Cagersquos piece for organ, As Slow as Possible, which takes  years to perform. Or maybe even Eh-Oh by the Teletubbies. Any of them might symbolise the mess wersquore in now: the disorder, the ision, the dragged-out damage.To make some sense of it all, it might be useful to remember what Edward Heath thought he had achieved in  as well as the approach he took to some of the controversies that are still with us, such as referendums. Mr Heath said in lsquo that he believed the British people would eventually see the wider benefits of the European Community, particularly peace and prosperity. ldquoI believe they will become convinced that this is where the future of modern Britain lies, he said.For a while, they did, although Ted Heath did have to fight hard to win a majority in the Commons. He also resisted the pressure to hold a referendum, which some said was the only way to avoid the claim that the Government was dragging the country into the Common Market against its will. Mr Heath took a view that now looks impossibly elitist or hugely realistic: in a parliamentary democracy, he said, it would be irresponsible to leave a decision on so critical and complex an issue to the electorate.It obviously wouldnrsquot be easy for a politician to express that kind of view now, but there are lessons for Theresa May to learn from Ted Heathrsquos experiences ndash not easy ones though. Specically, in one respect Mrs Mayneeds to do exactly the same as Ted Heath did, which is to aim for the reasonable centre of the electorate, which still exists and which supports remaining in the EU, a soft Brexit, or some pragmatic compromise.However, it now looks like she can only achieve that result , in another respect, she does exactly the opposite to Ted Heath. Heath thought referendums contradicted the principles of parliamentary democracy ndash and they do ndash but in the circumstances wersquore in, another public vote is the only way to get us away from the extremes of Brexit. In fact, a second vote may end up being one of the few redeeming features of this process by recalibrating us back to where all the good and sensible stuff happens in politics: the centre ground.It is likely to happen because of the logistics of where we are. Theresa May did not ndash and realistically could not ndash stick to her Remain principles when she took over as leader of the Conservative party, but she has achieved the best deal in the circumstances ndash some of which were unavoidable, some of which were self-inflicted.The unavoidable bit was the UKrsquos border with Ireland ndash a hard border is impossible without being a member of the customs union ndash whereas the self-inflicted bit was Mrs Mayrsquos insistence on ending the free movement of people, which ruled out membership of the single market. In this version of our world ndash part reality, part unreality created by Mrs May ndash the deal we have is the only practical option.All of that means that the next few stages in the process are pretty much inevitable. Mrs May is still trying to appease Brexiters by promising that a wonderful free trade deal is still on the horizon but unless we can reach a deal that avoids a hard border in Ireland ndash and no one has come up with one ndash then, under Mrs Mayrsquos plan, Britain will eventually enter the backstop outlined in the withdrawal agreement. Realistically, the backstop is also likely to form the basis of the long-term relationship between the UK and the EU: in other words, a UK-wide customs union with Northern Ireland retaining some elements of the single market.However, we know, and Mrs May knows, that there is no majority in the Commons for that, which leaves only four options: three unlikely and one almost inevitable. The unlikely options are, first, a no-deal Brexitsecond, a re-negotiation of the deal, which the EU has already ruled out whatever Andrea Leadsom says and third, a general election, which neither Theresa May nor any other Tory PM would go for.Which leaves us with the fourth option: another referendum. Ted Heath was right to resist one when he was PM, but  years on, another public vote will soon be Mrs Mayrsquos only choice. She cannot appeal to the right-wing extremists who think the same way about Brexit as some Christian evangelists think about gay-cure therapy ndash that the facts of le can be changed by faith. In insisting on her version of Brexit, she has also ruled out support from the hardcore Remainers and the SNP.However, increating a situation where a second vote on Brexit is now the only option, Mrs May could be doing us all a favour. There is always a chance the result will be another vote for Leave, but the polls show a vote for Remain is increasingly likely. If so, that could help quieten the extremists of all kinds ndash Brexiter, Socialist, Northern Irish Unionist and Scottish Nationalist ndash and take us back to the centre of politics. A good result in a second referendum on Brexit might also achieve a little of what Edward Heath felt in Number  on the evening of th October : a sense that the world is in the right order, a feeling that we are doing whatrsquos best for Britain, and maybe even some longed-for peace of mind."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-says-her-brexit-plan-is-best-for-britains-jobs-as-she-faces-critical-week","story":"In a message to her political rivals, the Prime Minister stressed that Brexit was not an exercise in \"political theory\" but something that affected peoples lives and livelihoods.In Brussels, Michel Barnier, the European Unions chief negotiator, said the Brexit process was at a \"key moment\" and urged all sides to remain \"calm\".One of the remaining details to be resolved is how long a possible extension to the transition period - effectively keeping the UK aligned with the EU after Brexit - could last for. This is an option because, in theory, it would help avoid having to have a backstop period.Intriguingly, Greg Clark, the Business Secretary, talked up the prospect, saying it had ldquooption value.There has been speculation that a one-off extension,sought when the agreed transition period expired at the end of , could last until the end of .Mrs May conspicuously did not knock the idea down but stressed she would want it to be over by the time of the next scheduled general election in June , while Mr Barnier said an extension could not be \"indefinite\" and a deadline would be decided in talks this week.However, a question hangs over whether or not extending the transition would mean putting off the day the UK took back full control of its fishing waters.At present, Britain will become an independent coastal state on Brexit Day. However, the UK Government has agreed that for the transition period the countryrsquos fishing industry will comply with the regime of the hated Common Fisheries Policy until December .Given that quotas are set in December for the following  months, any extension to the transition could mean that UK fishermen would be bound by the CFP for another year. If, as Mr Barnier has suggested, the transition might extend to December , this could mean the UK adhering to CFP rules until December  more than seven years after the  vote to leave the EU.Any extension to the transition that meant UK fishermen continuing to abide by CFP rules would be anathema to Scottish Conservatives, who have threatened to vote against Mrs Mayrsquos proposed deal,this were the case.But it has been suggested the draft withdrawal agreement ldquokicks the can down the road as it simply says on the future of fisheries that both sides would use their ldquobest endeavours to come up with what happens beyond December  with an agreed plan by July .Mr Barnier and others have flagged up the possibility of slapping tarfs on UK fishing productsthere is no guarantee of continued access for EU boats to UK waters.This morning, the PM took her Brexit message to the CBI conference as she sought to win business backing for her plans.CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn told the event in east London: \"It is a compromise. But it is hard-won progress.\"She said firms were already spending hundreds of millions on preparations for a no-deal Brexit.In her keynote speech, Mrs May said: \"We are not talking about political theory but the reality of peoples lives and livelihoods. Jobs depend on us getting this right.\"And what we have agreed unashamedly puts our future economic success, and the livelihoods of working families up and down this country, first.\"But Brexit-supporting businessman Roger Kendrick challenged her over her plans, which he said would restrict the ability to strike trade deals with countries outside the EU, telling Mrs May: \"Think again about the economics of the whole thing.\"The PM told him: \"The portrayal that you have given of what has been agreed is a little inaccurate,\" adding: \"It makes sense for us to continue having a good trading relationship with the European Union...but also have the freedom, which we will have, to sign those trade deals around the rest of the world.\"In Brussels, Mr Barnier updated ministers from the  remaining EU nations on the state of the Brexit process.Austrian EU minister Gernot Blumel said it was \"a painful week in European politics\" and \"we have the orce papers on the table,  years of dficult marriage are coming to an end\".Luxembourgs foreign minister, Jean Asselborn, said: \"This deal that is now on the table is the best there is. There is no better deal for this crazy Brexit.\"Askedhe thought Mrs May could survive, Mr Asselborn said: \"I believe she can convince her party and perhaps a part of parliament which is not on her side, so that this deal can become reality.\"The question of Mrs Mays survival is one that the EU are watching closely as Tory rebels continued to attack her plan although there still remained doubt as to whether or not they had the  signatories needed to spark a no-confidence vote. A total of  have gone public. Some MPs who were said to have put in letters to Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the  backbench committee, refused to confirm publicly they had done so.The message from both the PM and the EU representatives in Brussels was that there could be no unpicking of the orce deal, although work on the blueprint for the future relationship continues.Mrs May made clear the proposed withdrawal plan had been \"agreed in full\" by both sides.However, David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, said: \"This deal is not what the people voted for. It will tie us to the customs union for years to come with no way out.\"But there is still time to negotiate a Canada+++ deal that delivers on the referendum. So lets get on with it.\"And Boris Johnson, the former Foreign Secretary, made yet another colourful attack on her plan.He used a column in Mondaysto describe the agreement as a \"-page fig leaf [that] does nothing to cover the embarrassment of our total defeat\".Calling for the scrapping of the Northern Ireland backstop, he added: \"We should massively accelerate our preparations to exit on World Trade Organisation terms, with a new Secretary of State responsible for all the cross-government work.\"There would, of course, be some disruption in that outcome, but by no means as much as sometimes predicted.\"And it is our failure to make proper preparations that has so gravely weakened our negotiations.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9061484.jpg?type=article-full","title":"facebooks-45m-fund-for-80-local-newspaper-jobs","story":"Newspaper companies and the

motion for kintore blackburn link","story":"A new #, pedestrian and cycle route linking Kintore and Blackburn is expected to be approved by councillors.Aberdeenshire Council has been providing new facilities along the A corridor for cyclists on a phased basis.Phase one began in  with a shared use path linking Kintore to the town’s business park, while phase two works have recently been completed linking Kintore with Inverurie.That route is already proving a hit with pedestrians, with an average of  daily users recorded during October.Now the local authority is seeking a decision on a favoured option for phase three works to provide a shared use path between Kintore and Blackburn.In a paper to the Garioch Area Committee which meets tomorrow , infrastructure services director Stephen Archer says the route would essentially provide a facility for cyclists wishing to commute onwards to Aberdeen.Discussions are currently ongoing with Aberdeen City Council with a view to the creation of a connection from the city to Blackburn.Mr Archer will report: “The proposal to develop the phase three works was included on the Procurement Work Plan which was approved at the Infrastructure Services Committee of March , .“A successful grant application was subsequently made to the Sustrans Community Links Programme and a % funding commitment has been made by Sustrans for the project.”A feasibility study was undertaken to identy four potential routes, with option two running adjacent to and north of the A and south via the A underpass being favoured by officers.Mr Archer continues: “While the report does not make a definitive recommendation on which route to take forward, on the basis of cost, implementation and socio-economic impact, option two is regarded as being the overall best value option.“It is therefore requested that option two is now taken forward for detailed design to create a design and tender package before the end of the current financial year that would allow the council to approach funding partners for construction funding for future years.”He will also indicate that while the third option of using the old turnpike road would perhaps not fulfil the requirements for a commuting route, it could have some value as a recreational resource to the council.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Monday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amPolice in Kirkwall are appealing for witnesses to an assault, which took place in the early hours of Sunday, to come forward.

We are pleased to confirm we have made some changes to the substation design at Finstown, which we hope will go some way to address concerns raised. We are also pleased to confirm that we will underground the proposed infrastructure at Hoxa Head.#In the coming weeks, SSEN’s project team will continue to assess the responses received as it further refines the project design.SSEN plans to submit its planning applications for the proposed substation at Finstown, the subsea cable and the underground land cable that will connect Finstown to the subsea cable later this year, while a final round of public consultation will be held in Spring  on the onshore infrastructure required to connect the ious renewable projects looking to connect on Orkney to Finstown substation.For more information on the project, including the latest visualisations of the proposed substation at Finstown, please visit: https:www.ssen-transmission projects orkney copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Albyn Housing is asking them to pay a lot more each month in some cases.The concerns were echoed by the MP Mr Blackford who said ldquofor quite a while now, he has been working with the CAB to get to bottom of ldquowhat I would generously describe as curious practices from Albyn Housing.He added: ldquoIn one case an Albyn Housing client who had just undertaken a tenancy was immediately sent a letter informing her rent was already in arrears.ldquoIn effect, they are asking for a payment arrangement in view that it is a debt, and extra payment is, therefore, being requested each month.ldquoI am sure as a charitable organisation Albyn Housing has their tenantsrsquo best wishes at heart, however, their recent practices raise many questions.ldquoThese must be reviewed to ensure that no additional hardship is being brought upon the people who take up a tenancy with them.In response, Calum Macaulay, chief executive at Albyn Housing Society, insisted his rent due date had not changed and said his organisation followed the statutory form of tenancy laid out by the Scottish Government in the HousingAct  ldquowhich states that rent is due on, or before, the first day of the month, paid in arrears.He went on: ldquoTenants claiming housing benefit previously had their rent paid directly to Albyn Housing.ldquoWe were always made aware that the payment was due, and as such, any arrears would be treated as technical.ldquoNow, with universal credit, the tenant is responsible for paying their rent direct. The society has no dealings with the DWP and we are not made aware of incoming housing payments. This means that all tenants, regardless of whether they are claiming universal credit or not, are required to pay their rent in accordance with their tenancy agreement.He said housing officers would be ldquomore than willing to help tenants make arrangements that work for them.It comes weeks after Albyn Housing had to apologise to a vulnerable tenant in Inverness after a boiler check bungle ended up leaving the single mum locked out of her flat for the night with her toddler daughter and having to rely on social workers to pay for emergency accommodation.Monday  Nov  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Throughout the coming winter we will monitor the agreed plan to make sure we cover any changes in weather using our existing resources to best effect.ldquoHowever, we all have a duty to take responsibility for our own personal safety which is why I encourage drivers to be aware of our gritting policy as it is simply not possible to treat every road at the same time.She added: ldquoPeople also need to be aware this year to the changes to Saturday and Sunday services.

May has proved she has the cricketer’s staying power, for sure, but not his passion. Her reluctance to leave the stage smacks more of inertia than of any belief in her power to deliver. Watching her make her statement in the House of Commons, as cabinet members and MPs prepared to desert her and opposition MPs hurled abuse, it was that old football chant that came to my mind: “No-one likes us we don’t care.” Except, of course, that when Millwall supporters sang the line it was an expression of defiant solidarity an “us against the world” kind of thing. For May, there is no “us” unless you count her husband Philip, who poured her a whisky after her marathon cabinet meeting. There is only her, ploughing on, never veering from her set course. Like a missile launched into outer space, she seems propelled less by hope or conviction, than by an inability to stop and the lack – so far – of sufficient resistance. Even being compared to appeaser Neville Chamberlain appears to have done little to dint her determination.Has there ever been a lonelier figure in history than May  Macbeth watching the approach of Birnam Wood, perhaps  Or Julius Caesar lured to the Theatre of Pompey by his erstwhile allies  Et tu, Dominic  Et tu, Esther  Et vos, several junior ministers most of us had never heard of  May exudes loneliness the way some people exude vitality. Long before no confidence letters started stacking up, she appeared ill at ease in the company of others, be they members of the public or world leaders. Remember that footage of her at the EU summit in   The one where she fiddled anxiously with her cuffs and searched for someone to talk to, as all around her other attendees greeted each other with hugs and air kisses  I have neither met nor read of anyone who has found in May either a force to be reckoned with or a kindred spirit. Most report her as lacking in presence and conversational gambits. In a rare personal jibe aimed at another woman, Nicola Sturgeon said she found it impossible to get any human connection. As for when May takes on Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs: Denis Healey’s famous jibe about being “savaged by a dead sheep” comes to mind.Bingeing on the latest season of the Brexit box-set is emotionally confusing. What are we supposed to feel for this robotic character who refuses to be beaten, even when she so obviously is  Not admiration. There can be no admiration for a leader whose management of everything from Grenfell to the snap general election has been so spectacularly inept. And certainly not for a leader who, while home secretary, introduced the hostile environment policy that led to the Windrush and other deportations. Respect is wrong too. How can we respect someone so out of touch with the impact of Tory policies that – even as her party is preparing to tip the country off a clf – she thinks it’s amusing to jig her way out to the conference podium  Despite myself, what I did feel for May, last week, was a sort of muted regard for her obstinacy. May is a Remainer who took on the challenge of achieving the unachieveable – a compromise that would suit everyone – presumably because she felt it was a better option than having negotiations conducted by a sovereignty-obsessed Brexiteer. It was an impossible, thankless task and she was undermined at every turn. Nevertheless, she and her civil servants put together a deal. Perhaps it’s a dog’s dinner of a deal perhaps – as Jo Johnson suggested – it will leave us a “vassal state”, but it’s more than any of her blowhard critics have done. And at least she had the guts to face down the DUP on the Irish Border backstop. May’s deal is unlikely to be passed by the House of Commons, but as any deal capable of passing through the House of Commons is unlikely to be agreed by Brussels, she was always on to a loser.Yet, while she is taking all the flak, where is the man who kicked this off this fiasco in a misguided attempt to buy off his party’s right-wingers  At a financial conference in Florida, of course. David Cameron is a shameless dilettante who takes responsibility for nothing. His catastrophic miscalculation has never stopped him sleeping at night. He left No  with nary a backward glance. The same is true of Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage, who were last week spotted enjoying a cosy drink at an upmarket restaurant, and former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who is currently in Washington.Whatever  May lacks – grace, empathy – she does not lack a sense of civic duty. Why  would she plough on, pushing a deal in which she cannot believe to a party that only tolerates her because it doesn’t know what  to do  Anyone  would have packed up long ago and headed for the nearest wheatfield.This is not an endorsement of May’s premiership, which has been characterised by a series of humiliations and mistakes, and an inability to answer questions with anything other than her sound-bite du jour. Her craven cosying up to Trump still makes me queasy.But imagine the resolve it takes to get up every day and face the public when you are assailed from all sides when you know that some of those, like Michael Gove, who have agreed to join your cabinet, have only done so in the hopes of bringing you down from within when you know no gain is ever going to come from all the pain.Imagine putting yourself through all that when you are aware your legacy will be naught. No matter how this turns out, May is going to go down in history as one of our worst-ever prime ministers.When she first became leader, the columnist Marina Hyde rfed on a Katharine Whitehorn quote which asked: “Have you ever taken anything out of the dirty clothes-basket because it had become, relatively, the cleaner thing ” May, Hyde said, was “the cleaner thing.”It was true then and it’s true now. It is a testament to the amorality of almost everyone  involved that the prime minister comes across as a person with a degree of integrity . She is the best of a very bad bunch.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4831670.1542617327!/image/image.jpg","title":"lesley riddoch now is the time for nicola sturgeon to reignite scottish independence debate","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The First Minister must move on a second Scottish referendum or the moment will have passed, argues Lesley Riddoch.An interesting exch­ange occurred on yesterday’s Andrew Marr show between the BBC presenter and guest Nicola Sturgeon.The First Minister said: “One thing is beyond any doubt, the implications of Scotland not being independent are stark. Scotland has been sidelined.”Andrew Marr replied: “So why don’t you have a second referendum ” Nicola Sturgeon responded: “You will have to wait for that statement – that will not be in the too distant future.”: Nicola Sturgeon: decision on Scottish independence vote in ‘not-too-distant future’So far, so unremarkable. The SNP leader’s been producing that “wait and see” line since last year’s snap general election. Even though it failed to convince when trotted out in response to Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens during First Ministers Questions last week when he pointed out that waiting for clarity over Brexit might mean waiting forever. Now maybe it’s no bad thing to have folk urging you to move a bit faster towards your constitutional destination of choice. But maybe it’s also a little weird.: Richard Leonard: Scottish independence vote would be worse than BrexitCommentators north and south of the Border assume the Scottish Government must be close to some kind of announcement on a second indyref, given the degree to which Scotland has been visibly carved out of the Brexit process, denied any whf of the dferential deals that proved possible for Northern Ireland, Gibraltar and Cyprus despite Scots voting more overwhelmingly to stay in the EU. But Nicola Sturgeon and Mike Russell spent the weekend promoting another cause – urging the UK to remain in the Customs Union and stay in the Single Market like Norway and Iceland. Now of course it’s a reasonable enough suggestion. Norway joined the halfway house after two referenda rejected EU membership so they could keep their recently-won political independence but win single market access for their outward facing economy. Access to the single market is not a great solution but it’s a heck of a lot more popular in Norway than full EU membershipor leaving the single market to plough the lonely free trade furrow advocated by Britain’s hard Brexiteers. But there are cultural reasons why single market access can work for Norway but not for Britain. Firstly, the arrangement means being a “rule-taker.” That may be easier for a small country that was never a full EU member in the first place than once “mighty” Britain where the very idea of “rule-taking” prompts overwrought talk about “vassal states”. Secondly, the acceptance of less-than-perfect deals is an everyday occurrence in Norway because it’s had proportional representation since  and thus daily experience of negotiation and compromise. Westminster’s first-past-the-post system, by contrast, breeds a confrontational “no surrender” approach to international relations which would make Britain a very bad fit with the small, consensual EEA nations. Thirdly, membership of the single market means accepting freedom of movement. This doesn’t particularly bother the Norwegians, who were part of a Nordic Travel Area  years before Schengen and joined that club despite remaining outside the EU to make le and travel easier for citizens and neighbours. Sadly though, freedom of movement is a massively big deal for the millions of Britons who voted to leave the EU. So while single market membership may make sense on paper, there’s absolutely no way the closet Brexiteer Jeremy Corbyn or the Ukip-fearing Theresa Maywill ever consider single market membership because it ends the illusion that control over British borders can ever be “taken back”. So, since neither the Tories nor Labour will ever accept this halfway house, why are the SNP still pushing it  Are they virtue signalling – demonstrating that the Scottish Government can embrace a rational solution to Britain’s Brexit problems evenit cannot be stomached by No   If so, why bother It’s hard to see how much more virtue the Scottish Government can possibly accumulate over Brexit. Scottish voters not living on another planet since  are fully aware that we voted to remain, the Scottish Government published an options document a full year before Westminster, political parties here are fairly relaxed about freedom of movement and even Ruth Davidson could support single market access as long as no one from London was watching. Butthis virtuous solution has no hope of being implemented, why does the SNP spend its only moment of UK-wide media continuing to advocate solutions for the whole of the UK when that makes it almost impossible to start making the case for independence As Britain’s constitutional crisis likely deepens this week, every other party will be laying out its stall – whether that is A Peoples’ Vote, A No Deal Brexit, Theresa May’s deal, a Tory leadership challenge or a general election. But Scottish independence is nowhere to be seen. Of course, everyone accepts that naming the date for another referendum is indeed impossible with uncertainty all around. But it seems that worry about naming a date is also stopping Nicola Sturgeon from making a case – and that’s becoming problematic. Scottish voters are being plunged into a Black Friday-style sale of constitutional options and voters are thinking deeply about the future . Does the SNP believe swithering Scots will hold onto their democratic currency, ignore all the whizzy offers being laid before them and keep their powder dry till the Indy Express finally rolls into town  If it takes too long, swithering voters may have ed to the Union fold.So it’s just as well the Greens have decided to move into the unoccupied political space of the Independence movement. Yesterday, Scottish Greens co-convener Maggie Chapman wrote about the need to get updated, Brexit-framed, modern arguments for independence into the public domain as a matter of urgency. SNP MP Mhairi Black made similar points.Many Yes activists are praying the SNP leadership has got over the snap election and will start talking in detail about the independence scenario it exists to promote. If Oscar Wilde is right and the only thing worse than being talked about is indeed not being talked about, then Westminster is actually winning as an institution by being the sole focus of attention right now. Playing it safe can be laudable – but not being a player at a time like this is not an option.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4831674.1542578384!/image/image.jpg","title":"jeremy corbyn urged to meet nicola sturgeon and form united front for new brexit vote","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scottish Labour figures have called on Jeremy Corbyn to meet Nicola Sturgeon this week and present a united front to overhaul Theresa May#s deal with Brussels or give the people a chance to reverse Brexit.The First Minister will go to London for talks with politicians working to thwart the Prime Minister’s Brexit plan, and said she hopes to sit down with Labour and others to formulate an alternative. The call for unity came as Mr Corbyn faced criticism for again appearing to play down the prospects of a referendum on the terms of Brexit, claiming it was “not an option for today” and refusing to say how he would cast his ballot in a so-called “people’s vote”. Ms Sturgeon described Mrs May’s draft agreement as a “blindfold Brexit” that lacked clarity on the UK’s future relationship with the EU and confirmed SNP MPs would vote against it in the Commons.“If the House of Commons says we want to go down the road of single market and customs union membership, we want more time to take this back to the people of the UK in another vote, we need an extension of Article  –there is a clear change of direction – then I believe the EU  would be prepared to look at that,” the First Minister said on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show.“But that means those who don’t want this deal coming together.“Those who don’t think the Prime Minister’s deal is the right way to go have now a responsibility to come together and coalesce around an alternative.“I will seek to have discussions this week with other parties to get us into that position.”The First Minister said she was keen to talk to Mr Corbyn “and whoever ” in the Commons when she visits London.Labour peer Lord Foulkes said the SNP and Labour leaders should meet. “We need to build a broad front on the way forward, which I hope would be a people’s vote,” he said. Scottish Labour MEP Catherine Stihler said: “Support is growing for a people’s vote, and there is an opportunity for Labour to get fully behind this and campaign to stop a reckless and damaging Brexit.“This is a time for strong leadership in the interests of the workers who our party represents.“I encourage Jeremy to engage with other party leaders, including Nicola Sturgeon, to address the Brexit crisis.”East Lothian MP Martin Whitfield said: “For Theresa May to understand that all of the parties that are in opposition are as one on this is useful for her to know.“There is an opportunity there for people to talk… that’s what needs to happen. The time has come to say that [a people’s vote] is what the majority of the country want.”He added: “If ever there was a time for people to start talking, now is it.”Last week Mr Corbyn raised hopes that opposition parties would present a united front when he joined Ms Sturgeon in signing a letter demanding MPs be able to amend the motion that puts the Brexit deal to a Commons vote.However, despite party policy stating that Labour will pursue a second EU referendumattempts to change the deal or force a general election fail, Mr Corbyn poured cold water on calls for Labour to support a people’s vote, saying it was “an option for the future” but “not an option for today”.In an interview with Sky’s Ridge On Sunday, he also told how his party couldn’t stop Brexit “because we don’t have the votes in Parliament to do so.“There was a referendum in , a majority voted to leave the EU, there are many reasons why people voted. “I don’t think you call a referendum and then say you don’t like the result and go away from it. You’ve got to understand why people voted and negotiate the best deal you can.” Asked about calls for a second referendum, Mr Corbyn said: “It’s an option for the future but it’s not an option for today,there was a referendum tomorrow what’s it going to be on, what’s the question going to be ”Asked which way he would vote in such a referendum, he said: “I don’t know how I am going to vote, what the options would be at that time.”The Labour leader will appeal to business to back his plan for a Brexit deal in a speech to the CBI conference in London today.Arguing that Labour can secure a deal with closer ties to the EU market and better protections for workers’ rights, Mr Corbyn will say: “The government is trying to force a bad deal that doesn’t meet our country’s needs by threatening us all with the chaos and serious damage to our economy of a no-deal outcome.“The Prime Minister knows that no-deal isn’t a real option.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

It’s impossible to know what thoughts were in their minds, but collectively they had remembered. raquoPlease to see the Union Flag flying from the Town Hall today Remembrance Sunday. SIC has a poor record of flag flying in my opinion from the senior flagstaff. It#s the UK government#sand Scottish Parliaments policy to encourage councils to fly the Union Flagon a regular daily basis. It#s very rare to see a flag flying any time except on the Lord Lieutenants flag flying days list ofwhich is out of date.It is troubling to hear where the British media still blame German militarism and nationalism for WW, asnationalism and militarism were ever missing from the British national outlook. All major European powers fought to gain advantage over neighbours.It is refreshing though to hear the French President tell world leaders, including Putin and Trump, that nationalism is a #betrayal of patriotism#.#By saying #our interests first and never mind the others#, you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has # its moral values,# he said, thereby insisting these sometimes exist.The European Union used to be widely regarded as a moral endeavour. It seems most of our neighbours still see it that way, as something worthwhile which tempers selfish instincts and secures peace.If Brexit goes ahead the prospect of Britain forgetting its responsibilities as a victor, as Churchill put it in, #for the immediate future of the world# looms large. Let us hope some lessons can be recalled.#Patriotism is when the love of your own people comes first nationalism, when hate for people other than your own comes first.# # Charles de GaulleSadly we see Donald Trump, #America First!, Let#s make America great again#. A nationalist doctrine of utter selfishness!We seem the same doctrine of the Alt-right gaining a foothold in the UK and Europe. Remember #The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing#,It is a sad reflection of the many, many people which has died due to war and conflict.There is one institute which promotes, encourages and sanctions war and conflict more so than any other establishment within a modern society.We have probably killed and maimed more people in the last  years than at any other time in  years. What has brought this to the fore is technology but also the institutes which have remained silent on such atrocities, this being the backbone of modern societies driven by economics, our banking systems.Never has there been so much money spent on war and conflict, never have so many countries been destroyed by war and conflict, and who stands by the sideline reaping in massive profits as a result, our banks.The Bible says # For the Love of Money is the Root to All Evils # never a truer word said with our modern banking systems.Rather sad that at a time when we remember those that saw the horror of so many European conflicts, we also saw the French and German leaders announce they want to create a #real# EU Army. I presume by #real# they mean, #the ability to kill people#. Not only was it tactless of Merkel and Macron, we surely have enough standing armed forces already in the world. Do we really need another Jane , I feel sure that Merkel and Macron were not thinking along the same lines as yourself .They stated the need for a ‘ real army’without any references to the huge revenues that could be gained from the manufacture of arms.It’s all very well trying to pass their claim off as being for the strength and safety of Europe but with no reference whatsoever to the economic   financial benefits which would bolster the banking strengths of Germany and France. What an oversight !!Too much sauerkraut and champagne probablyto blame.I wondertheir suggestion is in any way due to their much reduced popularity in their respective countries.I would have thought the present EU decision-making structure e.g. nations’ vetoes, is hopelessly incompatible with having its own military, capable of defending Europe against Russia, China and laughably, the US. How much will that cost  It will need massive further integration, possibly, to United States of Europe level , a ghastly spectre that motivated many Brexiteers to vote ‘Leave’. year more than the next seven countries put together at  billion dollars.To say that the E.U. should not work militarily together is preposterous.Europe has been ided by maniacs with delusions of grandeur,their own ego#s and agendas on too many occasions # the last fty years has brought us peace,economic stability and a continent able to feed itself.I am sure WinstonChurchillwould be very proud of that after the hell of World ,he fought like so many others for it and would be appalled at the prospect of Little Englanderism and the new Westminster faith with its no deal brexit nonsense! Hungarian Revolution of , Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, The Bosnian War, The Kosovo War, Annexation of Crimea, The Ukraine crisis, The Russo-Georgian War and that is ignoring The Troubles in Ireland and countless terrorist attacks. We have a death toll here of tens of thousand and rising! Graham Fleming at least make a stab at historical fact occasionally.John, look at the EU command structure! The most expensive army on Earth would require a  Sate agreement before it could deploy. Then it could not fire a shot. If it hit an killed an enemy how about that enemy#s human rights  Iy takes # The Europen Court # about four years to reach a design!Thank God we are not talking about a European Navy, climate change and all that, sailing ships only.All of these good things I mentioned happened within our European Union,the bad bit you mentioned truthfully# was Northern Ireland, mainly the domain and remit of the British state doesn#t bode well for the future at all,at all.Interesting that the Great War commemoration coincides with Theresa May#s abject surrender to the EU.One big threat from May#s deal is to the UK union itself with the proposal that Northern Ireland be separated from the rest of the UK and be under Brussels laws and regulations.As predicted, the SNP now want the same treatment and will use that as a #grievance# to win support for a second Scottish independence referendum.The current mess will also play straight into their hands by confirming their allegations of #Westminster incompetence#.Many events over the past four years that have commemorated the sacrice of so many people have been profoundly moving .However I have been a bit upset this year.I have noticedthat local communities were trying to #outdo# each other with their poppydisplays.Well-meant I am sure, but remembrance is not about community #one-up-man-ship#, it is very personal and I am sad that in some places it has been turned into a #best display# competition # a Halloween of who can remember best.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Monday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118338.jpg","title":"Helping mountain to reach its peak","story":"Gavin MusgroveA pound MILLION vision to revive CairnGorm Mountain has been laid out to release the resorts immense unlocked potential over the next five to  years.US-based consultancy SE Group believes the resort can attract in the region of , winter visitors per year ndash more in seasons when there are peak snow conditions ndash with the right targeted investments.But controversially they appear to have written-off any future for Coire na Ciste which accounts for one-third of the ski area and boasts the best terrain for skiers and boarders at intermediate level and beyond.Instead the report proposes that all the focus for snowsports is on Coire Cas and two state-of-the art six person chairlts should be installed.There is also a role for the funicular which is currently not running at the resort because of safety fears.However, it is seen as having a subsidiary role as snowsports uplt and to be used and maintained more for non-skiers and ski school customers.Vermont-based SE Group carried out its independent review of uplt infrastructure at the resort between February and September, earlier this year.No funding has been allocated.

It has to be through proper and proportionate channels that we bring this forward.\"She said Natural Retreats is the operator and part of the journey and had bought into it.

in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe Armadale to Mallaig crossing is among the most popular ferry routes in Scotland according to new figures obtained by Kate Forbes MSP.According to  statistics, Ardrossan to Brodick had the highest number of passengers with ,, followed by Largs to Millport , Wemyss Bay to Rothesay , Oban to Craignureand Mallaig to Armadale .Skye, Lochaber and, Badenoch MSP, Kate Forbes said she was surprised that Mallaig to Armadale crossing proved more popular than Ullapool to Stornoway .The statistics also showed that the Skye to Mallaig route was the most popular crossing for coaches across Scotland.Kate Forbes MSP said: “Since RET was introduced by the SNP Government, it’s great to see the rise in passengers.“RET is vitally important to the islands and has arguably done more than anything  to level the playing field for island communities who need to travel.“Mallaig to Armadale figures were up by  per cent compared to the fateful summer of . Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry. She also thanked the public for their cooperation during the works and the council staff for their efforts."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/homeinthehighlands17-2-360x100.jpg","title":"meet donald the new animated face of","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA local businessman from Skye has created an animated character with the aim of providing useful information to visitors to the island.Donald from Skye is an animated character and the star of a short film about the island.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8698670.1541697964!/image/image.jpg","title":"local charities urge readers to show support for vital change the future campaign","story":"Will to Give is a group of  Northern Ireland cherished charities who have come together with one aim - to increase awareness of how important gts in wills are to the causes we all care dearly for.November  -  is Will to Give week, and local charities are asking our readers across Northern Ireland to help Change the Future for the charities you care for by leaving a gt in your willWith this in mind, Will to Give is dedicating this weekto encourage readers across the province to think about making their will and perhaps consider leaving a charitable gt to their favourite cause with their Change the Future campaign.A Will to Give spokesperson said: Every day right here in Northern Ireland lives are transformed thanks to the generosity of gts left in Wills by local people.These gts make a huge contribution to our work and typically fund le-changing research projects and services which can impact on thousands of local lives and change the future for many.Your will tells the people you leave behind, about the person you are.

It is not a reflection of politics or religion and it is not red to reflect the colour of blood.The full motion read: That this Council was disappointed to learn of the decision by Cambridge Universitys Student Union to vote down a motion to promote Remembrance Sunday and therefore records its objection to this decision to ignore such a signicant event in our history.Cllr Henry continued, saying: If this is the way our young people have been taught, what hope do we have We as a nation look to our students in the hope that one day they will be our leaders in many walks of le.He also said: When the young people of Cambridge University voted overwhelmingly to de-emphasise the sacrice of the armed forces, thereby striking out any reference to the British war veterans, remembrance day and the poppy they brought untold hurt and suffering to many families who lost loved ones during the wars.What a despicable way to show gratitude to many hundreds of thousands who gave their all so as those students and indeed everyone of us can enjoy the freedom of democracy that we have today.Our freedoms cost many everything they had.It is easy to judge from a distance when you have the luxury of a safe and comfortable democracy.Cllr Henry requested that the council write to Cambridge University to: express their disgust and revulsion at the decision made by the Students Union. Speaking to second the motion, DUP Councillor Paul Reid said: The poppy is an emblem of remembrance used since .The poppy is not a political symbol, it is not a religions symbol but a reminder of those who fought for freedom.TUV Councillor Brian Collins thanked Cllrs Henry and Reid for bringing this matter to the attention of Mid and East Antrim Council.He said: This is a very emotive subject.To Cambridge Universitys Student Union, shame on you. Many a young man and women left the university and interrupted their studies to go a serve their nation, and many of them never ed to their studies.We have to remember the families. This is just disgraceful.The TUV fully support this important motion.UUP Councillor AP Wilson also supported the motion.He said: We share the disappointment with Cambridge Universitys student union.Cllr Wilson, however said he didnt think Council should get involved in: undergraduate student union politics, saying that: Sometimes there are lots of brains and not necessarily much common sense.He said that Council should do all they can to make sure remembrance was respectful and not party political.Alliance Councillor Paul Sinclair was also concerned about getting involved in student politics.He said: We should reaffirm our support for Remembrance Sunday.After a recorded vote, Sinn Fein Councillors Hardy and McKeown voted against the motion while Councillor Paul Maguire, Alliance Councillor Paul Sinclair and SDLP Councillor Declan OLoan abstained from voting. Every other resent councillor voted for the motion, therefore it was carried.Speaking afterwards, DUP Councillor Beth Clyde said: I think it is a disgrace that people wont support the memory of all that have fallen.

Sinn Fein Councillor Patrice Hardy brought forward a motion as last weeks full council meeting, which stated: This Council supports the Right to Work: Right to Welfare groups Peoples Proposal aimed at introducing a simple but vital checklist for social security decision makers.‘This Council supports the aim and will write to the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Communities for the issuance of guidance to all Decision Makers, requiring them to ensure that both due process and impact assessments are undertaken and fully compiled with in the decision making process.Speaking in support of the motion, Councillor Hardy said: For me this is about protecting the most vulnerable in our society.“It is about building protections for the many citizens in the Mid and East Antrim Council district who are in the receipt of benefits. The Right to Welfare Group are calling for a risk assessment to be carried out by social security decision makers and have developed the Peoples Proposal which is a human rights checklist. “The checklist includes the right to due process, including the right to information and representation, presumption of innocence and transparent decision making prior to the appeal stage.”Councillor Hardy spoke passionate about the Peoples Proposal and about the recent benefit changes.She said it is needed because: On average over  financial sanction are issued against unemployed people every month, while  decisions are made on a monthly basis to stop sickness benefits.People are being financially sanctioned first and then appealed afterwards while suffering forced poverty.She gave figures, saying that: , people were forced to use food banks last year, including , children. This isnt good enough.Speaking about children, she said levels of child poverty have continued to increase here.Over a quarter of all children are living in poverty. This is not just a statistic, this is a sad reality. Many children are arriving to school hungry. Every child should have the right to food and every child should be free from poverty. Seconding the motion, fellow Sinn Fein Councillor James McKeown, said: This highlights the disaster that is austerity and changes in the welfare system have brought upon people in our society. He also added: We need a fairer and more professional approach to benefits.UUP Councillor Stephen Nicholl, said: The substance of the motion is absolutely correct. The impact of the changes in welfare delivery are causing a signicant impact in society, especially on those who are the poorest in society.He added: The increasing use of food banks in areas where universal credit has been ruled out, the use of food banks have increased by %.I have seen some horrendous decisions going through. So I think anything that introduces greater clarity and greater consideration of the actualconditions is to be welcomed to try and make this a fairer system.DUP Councillor Billy Ashe said this affected everyone. He commented: We would support this motion. The benefit system is not working for the most vulnerable.He added that the community planning directorate compile a report on this subject that Council can use to influence decision making at a higher level in the future.Council unanimously voted in support of the motion.

With a limited number of tickets still available, ‘Em Two Balloons duo Gerard Jordan and Ciarán Nolan told Daily Belfast how audiences can expect all their favourite characters from previous stage outings with a wedding bringing together the West and North of the city for its fairytale finale.“This is the fourth year we have brought ‘Em Two Balloons and their Christmas show to the Roddy’s,” explained Ciarán, “we had great success last year with the Terrible Tragedy of the Twinbrook Turkey and we are back again to tell all about the Fairytale of New Lodge. We had Deck the Falls back in , Turkey last year and now this feels like the completion of part of a trilogy.”“The demand for the shows is growing each year,” said Gerard, “audiences have really taken the characters Ciarán and I play and given us such great support. At the start of November we learned that there are only  per cent of the tickets left at the Mac and people are coming in every day to get their tickets early for the Roddy’s. If there were more days in December we would put on more shows as the demand is there.”“Audiences can expect pretty much what they have experienced before, especially in terms of laughter,” said Ciarán. “There are wedding bells in the air in the production, North Belfast is meeting West Belfast and the introduction of the Glider is bringing our characters East. I mean, what’s the most exotic thing for a Westie  It’s’ getting on the Glider and heading East, seeing Stormont in real le,” he laughed. “The characters Gerard and I have created Jean and Joan, Tablets and Muttley and our two doormen Feargal and Maxi are all there as well. Countess and Winalot, the two dogs, are woofing all the way towards Christmas too. Our bride is played by me and called Mini Driver who is from the Oldpark, Feargal is our groom and the all important wedding prep forms part of the story too.”Gerard spoke of how the hard work has been going on behind the scenes since .“It’s been great how much the audiences have backed us. The real compliment is that the audiences keep growing and this year we’ve added matinees into the Mac, we want to branch out to new audiences each year and will be taking the show to Naomh Éanna on December  as well.”Ciarán said that due to overwhelming demand a handful of dates will be performed after Christmas at Fruithill Bowling Club, Gort Na Mona and St Paul’s GAC on the ,  and  of December. “We will be working on new material for  and ‘Em Two Balloons will be bringing out a new production.

If ratied, this Withdrawal Agreement should provide a degree of certainty to the business community that Northern Irelands economy will ultimately be protected\".Ibec director of policy Fergal OBrien said \"swt ratication is vital\".But Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said it is \"certainly not\" the position that the DUP is risking alienating its key supporters, such as business leaders and the UFU, by opposing the draft Brexit deal. \"Thats certainly not the feedback were getting this weekend. Weve had a lot of support from people who recognise that this deal has the potential to separate us from our business market in Great Britain.\"Its not something that many business people or farmers believe is in the best economic interests of Northern Ireland,\" he said.\"We are clear that this proposed deal breaches a red line for us in that it has the potential to create a border in the Irish Sea and to separate us increasingly from our biggest single market. We believe that will be damaging to the agri-food sector and to the economy in Northern Ireland, so whilst we respect the opinions of the business representatives and of the UFU we disagree with their conclusion and in so doing we know we have the support of many business people and farmers in Northern Ireland who share our concern about this deal.\"He described the \"idea that the DUP stands alone\" in its opposition to the Brexit deal on the table as \"nonsense\".\"The UUP, the TUV, all oppose this deal,\" he said.\"How many votes did the UFU get at the last general election \"The idea that the DUP stands alone in this is nonsense, there isnt a single unionist party so far that has backed this deal, and I have spoken to farmers and business people in my constituency over the weekend who support the stance of the DUP.\"Mr Donaldson also revealed that the DUP is \"inclined to support\" the Finance Bill - the legislation which passes the Budget into law - despite suggestions that his party could withhold its backing to pressurise Prime Minister Theresa May into changing the draft Brexit deal.\"We will of course listen to the debate very carefully and consider any amendments that are brought forward, but in principle the Finance Bill is part of our confidence and supply agreement and as such we would be inclined to support the bill,\" he said.\"The Finance Bill delivers signicant enhancements for expenditure and public services in Northern Ireland, and we need to take that into account.\"Regarding the DUPs support for Theresa May and the confidence and supply agreement which sees the party prop up the Tory government in the Commons, he added: \"The question as to who leads the Conservative Party is a question for that party, not for the DUP. The confidence and supply agreement is with the Conservative Party, not with the Prime Minister, and as such we will continue to work with the government and the focus is on the Brexit deal and on the forthcoming vote in the House of Commons, and after that we will of course reflect on the implications for our future cooperation.\"DUP colleague, Nigel Dodds MP, said \"Northern Ireland unionism stands united\" and that it was \"time to work for a better deal which does not undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom\".Meanwhile, TUV leader Jim Allister accused those supporting the government of \"lackey syndrome\" and hit out at the UFU.\"How the UFU in particular could join this chorus of embracing the break-up of the UK single market, on which they depend, is beyond rationalisation,\" he said. \"Im greatly disappointed that the UFU has abandoned the settled will of most farmers that they wish to leave the EU in all its parts.\""},{"url":null,"title":"ulster farmers union backing for draft brexit deal greatly disappointing says allister","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

power restored","story":"Concerns have been raised after residents of a street in Derry waited nine hours to have power restored to their homes after an underground cable was damaged.The incident happened at the Paddock Lane area in Ballyarnett at pm on Friday, which resulted in a number of homes experiencing a power loss.However, concerns have now been raised that it took NIE nine hours to restore power, given that many of those who live in the area are elderly.Commenting, the independent councillor for the area, Warren Robinson, said that while he understands that certain circumstances could delay power being restored, he was nonetheless concerned at how the issue was handled by NIE.“I was made aware of the problem after being contacted by some residents who were affected. “Concerns were raised in particular because this area houses a large proportion of elderly residents. “I immediately contacted NIE and was informed that a third party contractor had damaged a cable in the area and was told that a repair team were on site but NIE could not give me an estimate for when the fault would be repaired.”Cllr Robinson added: “I understand that sometimes circumstances may mean there is a delay in having repairs carried out but electricity was off in this area for ten hours and my concern would be that elderly residents were left with no information and no offers of help from NIE.”“NIE do have a duty of care to these customers, I believe they have a particular duty of care to our elderly neighbours. googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“NIE need to tell us why it took ten hours for the repair to be carried out. They also need to put measures in place wherebythere is a delay that this is immediately communicated to the affected residents.”Safety Responding, a spokesperson for NIE said that the efforts of engineers had been hampered by ‘adverse weather conditions’, adding that it had been dficult to provide customers with an exact time for when the issue would be resolved due to ‘complexity’ of the problem.“NIE Networks received reports of a fault at Paddock Lane at approximately pm on Friday, November ,” a spokesperson said. “An underground electricity cable had been accidentally damaged by a third-party contractor resulting in a small number of customers experiencing loss of electricity supply. “The damaged cable required isolation for safety reasons before engineers could begin to carry out repairs. The spokesperson continued: “We do endeavour to provide our customers with information where possible, however, it was dficult to provide an exact time for restoration on this occasion due to the unforeseen nature and complexity of the fault, as well as the safety required to undertake the repairs. “This was further compounded by our engineers operating in adverse weather conditions. Following excavation work, repairs were carried out to the damaged cable with supply to all affected customers restored by .pm on Friday.”"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic travel co derry road closed following road traffic collision","story":"The Cookstown Road in Moneymore is closed in both directions following a road traffic collision.Diversions are in place but delays are expected.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThere is no further information at this stage."},{"url":null,"title":"us investors told north west ireland gateway uk eu markets","story":"Potential American investors were told last week that the North West is perfectly placed for an investment hub for business and global companies seeking to establish a gateway to both the UK and EU markets. A number of focused engagements with industry specialists, FDI executives and venture capitalists took place throughout the week in both Philadelphia and Boston as part of the Trade and Investment mission led jointly by Donegal County Council and Derry City and Strabane District Council, presenting the compelling investment proposition that the Northwest City Region has to offer.Potential investors heard from leading global company DuPont, which has a longstanding commitment to the region, taking advantage of the unique combination of benefits that the Northwest region has to offer including an accessible, connected and business friendly gateway region with a compelling vision for greater international impact.Investors learned that companies and businesses are attracted by a talented and educated workforce, the value balance, the superb quality of le and the supportive business environment. Cathaoirleach of Donegal County Council, Cllr Seamus ODomhnaill, who led the delegation along with Cllr John Boyle Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, believes that these types of engagements are essentialwe are to raise the profile of the region as an investment location. “Having these key influencers and potential investors in a room focusing on the northwest region and sharing with them our vision and ambition as well as the practical supports and assistance available to businesses in the region is vital,” he stressed. “There is no better way to build meaningful connections and relationships than face to face engagements.”Mayor John Boyle believes that: “The strength of the region is underpinned by the strong collaborative approach which sees industry, government at both central and local level, and further and higher education institutions from both sides of the border working together to fuel further economic growth and prosperity. This is something that investors value greatly in terms of facilitating ease of access to supports in the region.” Local businesses from a range of sectors across both Council areas also participated in the mission meeting with potential clients and business partners with a view to increasing sales and expanding their businesses. Derry based Bridie Mullin Irish Linen Ltd. participated in the mission and brought her eponymous label of handcrafted quality Irish line to Boston in an effort to tap into the US market.Bridie explains that the trade visit was an opportunity to build on her own research, and to visit stores and meet with potential clients gaining a deeper understanding of what exactly the customer is looking for. It also allowed her to get an insight into the potential costs associated with exporting and logistics assisting in finalising price points for trading.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe trade and investment mission also involved engagement with educational institutions with a memorandum of understanding being signed by the North West Regional College and Philadelphia Community College and the State of Pennsylvania during the mission that sees the consolidation of relationships developed over the last two years.Samantha Traynor, Vice Principal of the North West Regional College, who also participated in the Trade and Investment Mission, explained: “The MoU represents the first step in building and consolidating a partnership through education and training with a specic focus on sharing best practice in Work Based Learning to include Traineeships, Apprenticeships including Higher Level Apprenticeships and also the continued professional development of our respective professionals in our workforce.”The week also saw the announcement by both Councils of an exciting research project with Hard Graduate School of Design, exploring how the cross-border northwest city region can be shaped in light of the economic, political and social realities of Brexit. This project is being led by Assistant Professor Gareth Doherty in Hard GSD, who is originally from Donegal. Reaching out to the diaspora was also a key objective of the mission and this manested in events in both Philadelphia and Boston, where members of the diaspora from across the region attended and shared with the delegation the opportunities and challenges faced by the diaspora and their commitment to continue to engage in a way that is meaningful and mutually beneficial. The Cathaoirleach of Donegal County Council also had the honour of accepting on behalf of Donegal Hospice a cheque of , raised by the Donegal community in Philadelphia.Speaking after the trip, Chief Executive of Donegal County Council, Seamus Neely, said: “This Trade and Investment Mission is part of the ongoing positive work being done by both Councils. We are committed to continuing with the positive work we are doing to drive forward our economy and to maximise the opportunities we have as a cross border gateway to both the UK and EU markets. “We have longstanding connections with Philadelphia and Massachusetts and these connections transcend economic, cultural and political linkages. The Golden Bridges conference has provided the Northwest region with an important  in the Massachusetts region allowing us to reach out, connect with and form meaningful relationships and collaborations with stakeholders in ious sectors that have been instrumental in progressing growth and prosperity in the region.”Reflecting on the visit, Chief Executive of Derry City and Strabane District Council, John Kelpie, said: “It takes time to make connections, develop relationships and build trust. Our ongoing positive engagement with Massachusetts has to date resulted in a number of exciting developments including the investment and success stories around One Source Virtual and Metaverse. “Results such as these are part of our key objectives in terms of strengthening the profile of the City Region as outlined in our Strategic Growth Plan and are evidence that our direct approach of travelling to the US, making those connections and building rapport, really works.”Pictured at the launch of the new research project led by Hard GSD exploring how the northwest region can be shaped post brexit are Cathaoirleach of Donegal County Council Cllr.

been given to Carryduff girl Cara Mailey.The nine-year-old has a form of dwarfism which means that living in a standard-sized world can present challenges for her.Born with achonlasia, Cara dared to dream big and applied last year to have a special den created for her by the team from the popular CBBC programme The Dengineers.The plucky and determined child is now the proud owner of a colourful sweet-themed garden den that is ideally sized to suit her height mdash and her sweet tooth.Despite the production team swamping the Mailey family home in June to carry out the work, the show was only broadcast on Sunday morning.Cara found herself a star attraction at St Josephrsquos Primary School, in Carryduff on Monday.ldquoA lot of people have been telling me I saw you in the newspaper, I saw you on TV, giggled Cara.She has made great use of her den since then.ldquoI play in it most of the time, I sometimes do my homework there and bring in my friends to play or go in just get some sweets and bring them into the house, she told the Recorder.ldquoHaving the den makes me feel a lot happier and safer as usually I would be climbing up stuff to reach things but now I can pick them up and

It is also impacting on residents being able to park outside their homes, particularly in the Irish Street, Fountain Street and Saul Street areas.Cllr Sharvin believes the combined voices of the business community and residents can see the charges reduced to their previous level to ldquosupport the economical sustainability of Downpatrick town centre.He is also encouraging people to complete the online survey or pick up a paper copy from the council offices at the Downshire Civic Centre.Cllr Sharvin confirmed he has also asked council officials to survey the condition of its three car parks in Downpatrick, suggesting the surface in Irish Street is ldquoparticularly poor.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has also expressed concern about the impact of the increased charges and believes the increasing concern is exactly the kind of issue a tradersrsquo group in the town should be addressing.He added: ldquoThe town needs a thriving business organisation to help with its continued economic regeneration and to discuss issues like increased parking charges. Such a body would provide the business community with a much-needed voice on a range of important issues.The series of roadshows to discuss parking charges moved to The Lodge in Castlewellan and the Newcastle Centre last night and takes place next Tuesday, November , at Ballynahinchrsquos Market House between .pm and .pm, before later moving to The Hub in Saintfield between pm and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Symbolic lantern walk rekindles time WWI ended  ","story":"A SPECIALLY designed beacon was lit in Killyleagh on Sunday night to mark the th anniversary of the end of the First World War.Local man Martin lsquoTinarsquo Charters, , one of Northern Irelandrsquos last survivors from the Second World War, lit the gas beacon of light at the front of Killyleagh Castle to mark the moment the guns finally fell silent.Mr Charters was accompanied by two local schoolchildren, Zac Gordon, from St Maryrsquos Primary School, Killyleagh, and Louise Craig, of Killyleagh Integrated Primary School.The cross-community event was attended by more than  people at the end of Remembrance Sunday.The eveningrsquos events began with a lantern walk from Shrigley to Killyleagh.

worlds brexit","story":"The author of a report, \"Brexit at the Border\", has said that the ldquopressure is on our political parties especially those with the influence of the DUPa \"best of both worlds\" brexit is to become a reality.Dr Katy Hayward, who is a Reader of Sociology at Queens and who has  years research experience on the impact of the EU on the Irish border and peace process, was responding to an article penned by DUP leader Arlene Foster in last weekrsquos Impartial Reporter.In that article Mrs Foster laid out what the ldquobest of both worlds would be for Northern Ireland, which included full access to UK single market, full access to the EU single market, and full access to future UK and EU trade deals.Mrs Foster said that no-one has offered this ldquobest of both worlds to Northern Ireland but Dr Hayward claims that it is possible but onlythe ldquoUK remains closely aligned to the EUrsquos single market andit stays in a customs union with the EU.Dr Hayward does not see a smooth path to any such scenario however.ldquoBut, as Mrs Foster is well aware, the most vocalMPs in the Tory party want the UK to have a far more remote relationship with the EU after Brexit. If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Brexit, of course. I’ve had my fill. Editorial ImageMy brain is tired trying to understand all its nuances. But worse than that, it is distracting me from what is the most important time of the year – Christmas. I have always loved the run-down to Christmas. It’s a time when we begin to think of others, and shop for the loved ones around us. But Brexit has come between me and the festive season making me feel ill towards anyone raising the subject when all I want to be bothered about is what size the turkey should be this year. Politicians  Do we really care tuppence for them just now  Haven’t we seen and heard enough of them spitting venom over the ‘disaster’ ahead  Surely Brexit cannot be more important than the children in Yemen, dying daily in a ghastly war which shows no sign of abating, a war which like the one in Syria could go on for years  In the middle of the Christmas preparations we are faced with many such tragedies. But Brexit is dferent. It’s a war of bickering, a war destined to open up all our political weaknesses, a war which for the Irish and Northern Irish in particular is alarming in its bitterness and the need to settle old scores.Brexit is a drawn out battle we could have done without and I for one never imagined it would put a ‘damper’ on Christmas, a time of year when the charitable gene in us is thinking of other things and people. But politicians have hard hearts. Do they know it’s Christmas and do they care At this time each year we have Children in Need, which the UK as a whole continues to generously support. Going back much further to the s we had Band Aid, an event which really did capture the imagination thanks to the efforts of a pop star Bob Geldof Ben Lowry: Theresa May has ruthlessly but reluctantly felt she had to jettison unionism in Northern IrelandThe defeat of the EU withdrawal deal is the first imperative Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Yet, despite all our efforts children in many parts of the world continue to endure war and famine and what more can we do about it Regularly we put our hands in our purses in response to television and newspaper appeals but still it doesn’t appear to make much of a dference.Charities target us especially in the run-down to Christmas and I have no problem with that. In fact giving to charity is part of Christmas. Appeals are what we expect at this time of the year and people give generously. Our charity shops are full of beautul festive cards and gts to buy and many of us contribute in this way.But Brexit is getting in the way of all the festive spirit which can do so much good for those who need help. The politics of it all has me sapped, fed up, angry and vowing, at one stage, never to vote for a politician ever again. Did we get our fingers bitten back in the s when we signed up for the Common Market  Did we ever think when we signed then that we would end up being bossed around by a cabal of politicians speaking with foreign accents who dare us to withdraw from the ghastly behemoth they created due to our own politicians not reading the fine print or having the brains to see the problems that might arise in our attempt to extricate ourselves.Here I am in the midst of wondering what height my Christmas tree should be, distracted by the possibility that Sinn Fein could well be celebrating that their wildest dream of a united Ireland may be that bit closer come December. My mind is also distracted by the worry that the DUP, their reputation as kingmakers long gone, will be outwitted by the English politicians who really don’t give a toss about us and would gladly see us unhooked and driven into the Irish sea leaving them to become little England again.Soon I will dispatch Himself into the roof space to unearth the Christmas decorations an event I usually celebrate with a glass of my home made sloe gin. But Brexit is well and truly knocking the Christmas spirit out of me. try catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/shore_1.jpg","title":"alternative london the place to be seen in the city","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business From London’s thriving bohemian hub and street art capital to a food, drink and nightle must-visit... John Mulgrew explores Shoreditch and beyond Once just the purview of the artistic and trendsetting, Shoreditch has fast become a location worthy of a trip in itself when visiting London.Nestled in the East End of the city, Shoreditch offers up a buzzing cultural environment, lots of independent places to eat and drink, and boasts one of the city’s best markets. Now, those in the north west always feel a little hard done by when it comes to connectivity outside Northern Ireland.In this case though, Flybmi now connects City of Derry Airport regularly with London Stansted. From there, it’s a regular train into Liverpool Street station, and then onwards using the tube or bus across the city.Andyou’re visiting Shoreditch, it’s hard to miss Boxpark. Sitting close to the tube station, it’s an array of black-clad shipping containers, with a host of retailers and places to eat. A bite at posh chip shop Poptata helps fuel the day.Journalists often prefer the freedom to explore a city at their own pace – picking up things along the way, without being ferried from place-to-place. But a food-focused tour from Alternative London brought out areas that might have otherwise been missed.Shoreditch is famous for the sheer volume of graffiti and art strewn around the area, but getting an insider’s view on the changes taking place in the area – including paid-for advertising now adorning some of the spaces reserved for artists from the area, or a Banksy – really helps take in as much as possible.Christiaan Nagel’s mushrooms, which can be found in several roof-top locations, led us to teashop T, taking in a salt-beef bagel at Beigel Bake on Brick Lane, followed by the modern, family-run self-styled home-style Indian restaurant, Gunpowder. The aloo chaat is a signature, with punch, depth and zing, while an almost unavoidable venison and vermicelli ‘doughnut’ is worth the visit alone.A brief half in the grade II listed Ten Bells, which has links to Jack the Ripper, was followed by a familiar trip to Old Spitalfields Market. It has a dense, tight offering of top-end food stalls, from Asian steamed buns at Yum Bun, to Portuguese custard tarts and fruit tea at Yi Fang.An unmissable food destination sits across from the market. St John Bread and Wine is one of Fergus Henderson’s London outlets. It’s a casual, laid back and sparse affair, which allows you to same some of the best British cooking available. You can stop by for a very reasonably priced, and one of the restaurant’s signature dishes, such as Welsh Rarebit, devilled kidneys on toast or, my choice on this visit, blood cake and egg. Think richer, chunkier black pudding, crispened in a pan with a rich-orange hued yolk. There are plenty of spots to socialise in and around Shoreditch, with some of London’s better beer bars included. The Craft Beer Co has a location on Old Street, while there’s a Brewdog and the Draft House, hidden in the Bower development.Arriving back to the hotel in the evening, don’t expect dull or leless environment at the Hoxton. The downstairs is thriving during the day, with the usual spectrum of aluminium-clad Apple Macs, but at night, especially at the weekend, it’s very much a nightspot in the area.Butyou’re after a decent night’s sleep, there’s very little sound making its way to the bedrooms from the ground-floor buzz.Leaving the hip surroundings of Shoreditch, and heading to the rather more touristy affair of Leicester Square, the Hotel Indigo is offers a grand view of the London skyline.The new rooftop bar is a superb vantage point to overlook the square, and pick out the city’s most famous structures. Then there’s the National Portrait Gallery – which sits just a short distance away from the Hotel Indigo.During the trip there was a Michael Jackson ‘On the Wall’ exhibition – one for Jackson fans, certainly – but the gallery itself, which is free, is worth a visit for everyone . It also hosts a ‘Friday Lates’ event – opening into the night, and with a small pop-up bar for visitors.Not far away, the Japan Centre offers up a myriad of everything the country has to offer in regards to food and drink in particular – from freshly made miso, to a ied and wide-selection of sake, it’s a stop worth making for anyone keen on trying to replicate the flavours they’ve had while visiting the country.Meanwhile, Shoryu Ramen – located very close to base camp at the Hoxton – offers some of the best casual noodles in the city. Starting off with cleanly flavoured salmon sashimi, followed by the garlic kick of the Dracula Tonkotsu – a heady allium-rich version of their -hour pork broth.For those in and around what is one of the city’s most tourist-heavy locations, Granaio is a reasonably recent addition.It’s a fairly familiar format – Italian classics and a wide-ranging menu, which will keep the majority of visitors content, at a reasonable price, considering the location. A beef tartare was solid, and a ribeye cooked correctly on the inside, despite a lack of charring on the outside.The theatre obviously plays a large part in the attraction to London, but the Immersive Gatsy experience turns a chunk of a Long Lane building into an interactive re-telling of F Scott Fitzgerald’s the Great Gatsby. It’s dferent, but impressively choreographed, and something alternative to spending a huge wad of cash on a West End show.A crisp sunny day before heading back on the train to Stansted offered a chance to try Hawksmoor. The steak restaurant now has nine locations in the UK, and focuses on dry-aged beef and all that comes with it.A Sunday lunch of rich, pink rump of beef comes with a Yorkshire pudding, stunningly crunchy roasties and a roasted bulb of garlic, and shallot – leaving them soft and packed full of umami.

These aspirations are higher than predecessors. Harder to reach than MillennialsGen Z are incredibly tech savvy and have always lived in a world of interconnectivity. Most of Gen Z are connected for more than  hours a day. No wonder they are often referred to as the ‘always on’ generation. Unfortunately, gaining and keeping their attention is extremely challenging. Gen Z much prefer Snapchat and Instagram over Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. Creators, not just consumersGen Z want to contribute, create and be part of something, they are opinionated and feel strongly that their voice should be heard.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
