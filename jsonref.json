Evans\u0027 son, Bill Evans III was stationed in El Paso as a soldier. His son Bill Evans IV told DailyMail.com that he saw a close resemblance between Lillie and Doria Ragland, her great-niece          Unknown link: Until DailyMail.com told him that Doria Ragland was his step-grandmother\u0027s great-niece, Bill Evans IV had no idea that his family story included royalty. He and his wife got up at 4am to watch the wedding and spoke of their pride    Major competition: William Evans IV played exhibition games with Babe Ruth (right) and Lou Gehrig in New York in the late 1920s. The Yankees duo were pictured in 1929 in Cleveland, Ohio, holding the ball with which Ruth hit his 500th home run  Disgraced: The 1919 World Series ended the careers of Charles \u0027Swede\u0027 Risberg (left) and \u0027Shoeless\u0027 Joe Jackson (right) when their Chicago White Sox were accused of accepting a bribe to throw the series. They were to play against Williams Evans, however, as he recounted in 1975.           When Evans played for the Brooklyn Royal Giants in the late 1920s he would play against Major League stars including Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in New York in exhibition games, finally being paid $2,000 a time when they played with babe Ruth. He kept the photograph as a memory but it is unclear where he is in the group          Author and historian Phil Dixon writes about Evans\u0027 talent in his book, American Baseball Chronicles: The Great Teams, the 1931 Grays. Dixon says that Evans, a Kentucky native, scored over 70 runs      Another pioneering story: William Evans and his wife Lillyn Brown were famous performers in the jazz age. Brown in particular was known for her cross-dressing act, performing as a man until the very end of the act when she would remove her top hat. She starred on Broadway and toured Europe and her death in 1969 was marked by a New York Times obituary          How she was: Lillyn Brown, Williams Evans\u0027s second wife, was one of early jazz\u0027s biggest stars. Her band, the JazzBo Synctopators, accompanied her and she appeared dressed both as a woman and as a man as she performed in Harlem, on Broadway and even toured Europe          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle wed on May 19 in Windsor. Bill Evans and his wife got up at 4am to watch the ceremony of a woman he now knows as a relatives\u0027My grandfather\u0027s nickname was Happy because he was a joyful person and wherever he traveled he made people happy. He was also called the Gray Ghost because he was quick.\u0027He played center field, short stop, right field, he was multi-talented. You see the longevity too, he had a long career - 21 years. He used to talk baseball all the time.\u0027We used to throw a little bit, he used to do all kinds of tricks with a baseball. Even at his older age, he\u0027d throw the ball, make it spin, throw it round his arm.\u0027 In his profile of Evans in his book on the Grays, author Dixon wrote: \u0027In 1931 the Philadelphia Tribune reported, that Evans\u0027 father was an actor of some repute during the 1920s and 1930s.\u0027Bill confirmed the claim and revealed his great grandfather was William Demont Evans, a 1920s black entertainer who worked in a double act with his wife Lillyn Brown, who would dress up as a man.The pair were big names on the \u0027Chitlin\u0027 Circuit\u0027 a group of US performance venues were it was safe and acceptable for African American entertainers to perform during segregation.The pair were themselves pioneers with their risque act: dressed in top hats and tails, they would execute a surprise ending.Her Majesty¿s new right hand woman!

Brown she had a lengthy and hugely successful career, claimed to be the first professional to sing the blues in concert, and appeared on Broadway repeatedly, her last being a revival of Kiss Me, Kate in 1952, when she was 67.Brown was also noted for recording her own blues records, was a member of the Negro Actors\u0027 Guild of America and ran a performing arts school. She was William Evans\u0027 second wife and the two did not have children - William Jr was his son by his first wife. It is unclear if the Duchess of Sussex knows of her intriguing family history.Towards the end of Evans\u0027 career he met Lillie Ragland in Tennessee, where she was from. The couple then moved to California where there was more opportunity.Bill said: \u0027My grandfather was probably still playing ball or retiring when they met. Of course they witnessed all kinds of segregation and racism in Chattanooga and Louisville.\u0027Back in the 1950s a lot of the blacks from the east coast and down south moved to California for opportunities and sure enough they found the opportunity.  \u0027Lillie became the first black realtor director, man or woman, so she was a pioneer. After Bill retired from baseball he got into the aerospace industry, I think he was an inspector.\u0027Before that, however, Meghan\u0027s aunt worked for one of the all-time Hollywood greats, Bette Davis. In his book about the 1930-31 Homestead Grays, black baseball historian Phil Dixon wrote: \u0027After retiring from baseball Evans\u0027 relocated to Los Angeles, California, at which time his wife became a maid for actress Bette Davis.\u0027  Evans\u0027 grandson Bill Evans IV had not known he was related to Meghan until DailyMail.com revealed the link. But now he has given a fascinating insight into his grandfather\u0027s career as a star player in the Negro leagues when baseball was still segregated          Bill (left), 61, and his wife Cynthia (center) got up at 4am to watch the Royal wedding after finding out about his grandparents\u0027 link to Meghan while they were on vacation celebrating their own Silver anniversary.

Above is an Instagram photo the rapper uploaded four days before the crashThere is no record of a traffic violation nor is there a police report on a car crash involving the rapper. There\u0027s no indication that Scott was driving.Scott has not filed a criminal complaint against the company nor owner Yaniv Eliyahu, but the civil suit shows he already paid $90,725.45 for repairs to the $400,000 sports car.   He was handed the bill from the shop where the car was repaired, including: $16,107.81 to straighten out the subframe $5,774 to replace the hood panel $4,836 to replace a front fender panel $11,371.10 for headlights and $9,864.95 for the front bumper face bar.The Antidote rapper had been in Miami Beach that night to perform at Diddy\u0027s party at LIV, a popular beachside nightclub. Kylie Jenner, who, at the time was eight months pregnant with baby Stormi, did not appear to be along for the trip.Then, a few weeks after the crash, Super Cars asked Scott - also known as La Flame -  for another $100,000 - something that the lawsuit described as an extortion attempt.According to the court papers, Super Cars threatened \u0027to violate the terms of the confidentiality provision contained in the settlement agreement by making specious and salacious claims to news agencies and tabloids regarding the accident.\u0027          The Antidote rapper had been in Miami Beach that night to perform at Diddy\u0027s party at LIV, a popular beachside nightclub          Scott is seen above during his performance at the night club.

The landings began the Allied invasion of Europe that beat the Germans and ended Adolf Hitler\u0027s regime. Pictured are 48th Royal Marines at Juno Beach where thousands of British and Canadian troops landed, only suffering 340 dead and 574 wounded before they began a push south the next day, beating off a determined German counter attack and joining up with Gold Beach to form a continuous front          A massive armada of ships drop off troops, tanks, vehicles, and equipment on Utah beach, one of five beaches invaded by the Allies. Landing parties took it on June 6, 1944, with just 197 casualties as resistance was light. This photo was taken after the beach was taken and shows reinforcements arriving. The bulk of the fighting for those involved took place in the weeks later as they pushed deeper into France. The original black and white photographs were painstakingly colourised, each snap taking between four and five hours to bring to colour          On the other side of the channel, soldiers load artillery equipment, vehicles, and troops aboard landing ships fitted to carry tanks in Brixham, England, on June 1, 1944, in preparation for the invasion. They later sailed over to Normandy with the fleet dodging Germany aircraft and dropped everything off on the beaches for the massive invasion          American soldiers calmly walk on to a beach in Normandy, either because it was already taken or it was one of the areas where the secret invasion caught the Germany unawares and there was no resistance. Codenamed Operation Neptune, the landings were the largest seaborne invasion in history          A landing craft form the USS Samuel Chase lands troops of US Army First Division on Omaha, the most famous and easily the bloodiest landing of the Normandy invasion where up to 4,700 of the 43,000 Allied troops were cut down by the defending Germans as they rushed ashore with heavy fire from gun emplacements overlooking the beaches, and the shore was mined and covered with obstacles such as wooden stakes, metal tripods, and barbed wire, making the work of the beach-clearing teams difficult and dangerous    U.S. troops are towed into Utah beach, with a squad of medical trucks in the background making their approach. The troops don\u0027t appear concerned, indicating the beach was already captured by this time. Allied infantry and armoured isions began landing on the coast of France at 6.30am. The target 50-mile stretch of the Normandy coast was ided into five sectors: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword          Glider crews on landing craft head back after landing ahead of the invasion force, ready to be sent in again farther behind enemy lines to attack positions from behind along with airborne parachute troops          The U.S. Coast Guard manned USS LST-21 unloads British Army tanks and trucks onto a Rhino barge during the early hours of the invasion on Gold Beach, a relatively easy landing where only 30 were killed          British Airborne Pathfinders at Harwell check their watches on night of June 5, hours before they would be dropped behind enemy lines before and during the time when their infantry comrades would storm the beaches miles north of them. They wanted to be sure they all had the same time to coordinate jumps. The airborne assault involved 24,000 American, British and Canadian troops jumping shortly after midnight          Men of the British 22nd Independent Parachute Company in the 6th Airborne Division being briefed for the invasion on June 4 or 5. The invasion was originally scheduled for June 5 but postponed for a day by bad weather. These men landed behind enemy lines under cover of darkness and needed briefings to know their role as they would be separated          British troops land on Sword Beach, the easternmost of the beaches chosen for the invasion. It was a relatively easy landing with a few hundred casualties but the going got tougher after the beach as they were attacked from heavily-defended German position and a counter-attack by a tank ision on the way to Caen          British troops dig in after taking Sword beach and prepare to advance to the strategic city of Caen. One soldier appears to be operating a radio that uses a hand crank for power. At Gold, Juno, and Sword, several fortified towns were cleared in house-to-house fighting, and two major gun emplacements at Gold were disabled, using specialised tanks          German  Tiger I tank form the Panzer VI ision camouflaged in the undergrowth in Villers-Bocage, a town well inland from the landings. These hidden positions proved decisive in ambushing advancing British troops seeking to take the town and forcing them to retreat after many vehicles were destroyed          U.S. Army 4th Infantry Division troops collapse exhausted after taking Utah beach before the even harder work of pushing south into France begins, with the port city of Cherbourg their objective. Strong winds blew the landing craft east of their intended positions, particularly at Utah and Omaha          Reinforcements not involved in the initial landings arrive to strengthen captured Allied positions and push farther into France, among a force of more than 1.4 million troops. Only two of the beaches (Juno and Gold) were linked on the first day, and all five beachheads were not connected until June 12, however, the operation gained a foothold which the Allies gradually expanded over the coming months           Lesley George Robinson, 98, the last survivor of the RAF veterans who landed at Omaha Beach, lays a wreath as fellow Normandy veterans attend a wreath laying ceremony at the Tactical Air Force Memorial besides Omaha Beach at Vierville-sur-Mer in Normandy on June 4, 2018          The handful of veterans still alive who were involved in the invasion reunited to pay respects to fallen comrades 74 years on. German casualties on D-Day have been estimated at 4,000 to 9,000 men.

Akbar Al Baker is pictured with his wife Samira Al Baker (left) and Donald and Melania Trump in 2007          Akbar Al Baker said his airline had taken steps to address gender equality, but when asked why it was led by a man, he replied: \u0027Of course it had to be led by a man because it is a very challenging position\u0027\u0027IATA also has a similar position on promoting gender equality,\u0027 he added.The comments came minutes after Al Baker - who has a reputation for hitting out at rivals and suppliers over poor performance - had joked that one of his roles as the new chairman of IATA was to be less controversial. The organisation currently has just two female CEOs on its 31-member board - Christine Ourmieres-Widener of British budget airline Flybe and Air Europa\u0027s Maria Jose Hidalgo Gutierrez, who was added Tuesday.It\u0027s not the first time 56-year-old Al Baker, who also sits on the board of Heathrow, has courted controversy with his remarks about women.Qantas caves in to pressure from Beijing and will refer to...American Airlines CEO says that airline ticket prices could...Share this articleLast year, while in Ireland to launch the country\u0027s link to Doha, he delivered a speech saying that his average age of Qatar\u0027s flight attendants is 26, so there\u0027s no need to fly with \u0027cr**\u0027 US carriers where passengers are \u0027served by grandmothers.\u0027 He later apologised for his comments. Al Baker, who has two sons with his wife Samira, became chief executive of Qatar Airways in 1997. Meanwhile, IATA\u0027s chief executive Alexandre de Juniac acknowledged that having more women in senior positions was a \u0027long-standing issue\u0027 that required further efforts from airlines and the industry body.It released figures in March showing just three percent of CEOs in the industry were female, compared with 12 percent in other sectors.Leading carriers in North America and Europe had the highest representation of women in senior roles at 16 percent and 14 percent respectively, IATA said.          Akbar Al Baker (centre) later defended the carrier, saying it was the first Middle Eastern airline to have a female pilot and that other women were in senior roles. Pictured left, IATA chief executive Alexandre de Juniac and right, Qantas chief executive Alan JoyceAfrican, Asia-Pacific and South American airlines were at about eight percent, with the Middle East having the worst at four percent, the data showed.Qantas chief Alan Joyce said at the same press conference that the Australian carrier had achieved a strong turnaround in profits partly due to its pursuit of ersity, with women making up 40 percent of senior management.But he said it was \u0027going to take a long time to fix some of the issues that are inherent in our society\u0027, such as girls not studying science and technology in schools, which impacted their numbers in engineering and flying roles.Gloria Guevara Manzo, the first female president of the World Travel and Tourism Council, said investors needed to start pushing companies to do more.\u0027When you have ersity, your company\u0027s results are better,\u0027 she told Reuters earlier on the sidelines of the Sydney airline talks. \u0027It\u0027s not just for the sake of it.\u0027          It\u0027s not the first time Al Baker has courted controversy with his remarks about women.

Sprinter Eric Liddell (left) and New Zealand flanker Michael Jones (right) opted for faith over playing sport on SundaysElsewhere this week, the Pope blocked a move by German bishops to allow Protestants married to Roman Catholics to receive communion in Catholic churches.A majority of German bishops voted this year to publish guidelines that would have made it easier for Protestants to receive Catholic communion.But it was prevented on the grounds such a move would dilute Catholic identity.It¿s OK to play sports on Sundays, but don¿t miss Mass, says Vatican | CatholicHerald.co.uk"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/10/4CED22DA00000578-5807097-image-m-54_1528191423227.jpg","title":"Pooch stops owner going phone","story":"The dog attempts to keep the phone from his owner after he has seemingly become frustrated with her phone use.

Auctioneer Mr Lay added: \u0027The breadth and quality of the images is superb so really it is unparalleled in my experience. Looking through all the images in this archive, covering almost 40 years, it is possible to see the Royal family grow up before ones eyes. Everything is here, from childhood to maturity, diplomatic Royal engagements with all their pomp and ceremony to unguarded family moments between the Queen and her children. It is an astonishing collection of images\u0027          Princess Margaret with Lord Snowdon and Prince Andrew.A remarkable archive of over 4,000 photos of the Royals taken over four decades by a trusted photographer has emerged for sale for £10,000.The photos include iconic snaps of Prince Charles and Princess Diana on honeymoon as well as intimate shots of the Queen and other prominent Royals relaxing  A very young Katharine Worsely, the Duchess of Kent. The Duchess, now 85, met Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, the eldest son of Prince George, Duke of Kent, and Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, while he was based at Catterick Camp.  On June 8 1961, the couple married at York Minster and Princess Anne was one of the bridesmaids. Guests included actors Noël Coward and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as well as members of the British, Greek, Danish, Norwegian, Yugoslavian, Romanian and Spanish royal families. The Duchess later gained attention for her conversion to Catholicism in 1994, the first member of the Royal Family to convert publicly since the passing of the Act of Settlement 1701          Role reversal: The Queen is pictured snapping away on her camera while in the countryside with her family. She often used a German designed Leica to take her snaps and was regularly photographed taking pictures of horse events          A young Prince Charles on the Royal yacht Bloodhound in Scotland. The classic 1930s yacht, which was owned by Her Majesty and Prince Philip from 1962 to 1969, was where Charles and his sister Anne learned how to sail. Prince Philip had much success competing with her at the famous Cowes Week Regatta around the Isle of Wight, and she was also used to take the entire family, along with the Britannia, to Scotland\u0027s Western Isles for their annual holiday          The Royals have many interests and this photo of Prince Charles and sister Princess Anne from the early 1960s shows they grew up with a keen interest in boats. The pair are pictured on a rubber speedboat, with Charles appearing to be tinkering with the engine while Anne retrieves an oar to manually move the vessel          Princess Margaret\u0027s relationship with her husband eventually became strained and they are pictured here deep in conversation, with both looking concerned. The marriage broke down in 1976 after Margaret was pictured on the front page of a national newspaper with younger lover Sir Roddy Llewellyn, 17 years her junior, and they were orced two years later          A young Princess Anne is pictured in a casual moment chatting to a member of the public while dressed in what appears to be a 1970s style, wearing a cravat and jeans. The photo was taken around the time of a kidnapping attempt on the Princess in which Ian Ball stopped her limousine and shot her protection officer in a failed £2million ransom plot          Just like recent events with the birth of Prince Louis, a new royal baby was a major event for the media. Here Princess Margaret, right, and her husband Lord Snowden, left, are pictured taking their newborn son David home after his birth in November 1961. The Princess had two children with her husband, a photographer previously known as Antony Armstrong-Jones before he was given a title          A young Prince Edward and his cousin Sarah Armstrong Jones, daughter of Princess Margaret, are pictured here playing together at a horse show in the late 1960s. The candid series of photographs show the Royal Family at some of their most relaxed moments and reveals how their children were just like any other, particularly in this image where the prince appears to be trying to protect his hair from his cousin          This series of snaps taken of Princess Diana were commissioned for a set of stamps issued on her 21st birthday, a year after she married Prince Charles.

Reflecting how they have often been portrayed in the media, the monarch looks stern and serious while Margaret has a more relaxed expression. The pair are believed to be pictured at a horse show, which they grew up attending together          The Queen is pictured by Mr Scott here at one of her favourite events, the Badminton Horse Trials, in 1952. She even moved the trials to Windsor for one year in 1955 so they could also stage the second European Championships. The car parks, tradestands, arena and cross country courses fit into an area of approximately 500 acres of Badminton Park          Scott (pictured) lived an extraordinary life himself as he was a Yugoslavian aristocrat who fled his native Serbia during the Second World War after it was occupied by the Nazis. His actual name was Colonel Vassa Voynovich and he commanded a platoon on the Russian front aged just 17 during the First World War. An ex-cavalry officer with equestrian expertise, he was at home capturing Ascot, Badminton and the Windsor Horse Show, and shared the Royals\u0027 passion for horses. He was also extremely charming, spoke 10 languages and his diplomatic experience meant he was suave and comfortable around royalty          Prince Charles and Princess Diana do not look much like a happy couple here pictured on a trip to Wales in the early 1980s. Although the couple\u0027s marriage initially seemed strong, problems began to develop after five years and both had affairs, with Charles seeing his now wife Camilla, leading to Diana saying there were \u0027three people in the marriage\u0027 a decade later  Princess Diana looks a lot happier in these photos, including an iconic shot with Charles  as they walked around Balmoral on their honeymoon in 1981, left, when she was just 20 years old, and alongside the Duchess of York, who also endured her own difficulties with the Royals, at the Guard\u0027s Polo Club, Egham in 1982           Charles is pictured dancing with scantily clad women at a carnival in Brazil surrounded by a mass of press, more dancers in elaborate gold coloured clothing and a huddle of happy revellers.

The failure of the fire lift system delayed firefighters.7. Advice for residents to stay put in the event of a fire was futile within half an hour of the blaze breaking out – but still slavishly adhered to for another 80 minutes.8. Combustible cladding panels and insulation systems were ruled \u0027substantially to blame\u0027.9. Two types of cladding and four different insulation layers did not comply with building regulations.10. Two cavity barriers did not have the required fire performance certificates.11. The cladding produced toxic smoke that slowed the firefighters as it forced them to wear breathing apparatus.12. Designers and builders had no idea how the cladding system would perform in a fire as no tests were carried out.13. Neither the London Fire Brigade nor Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, which was responsible for Grenfell, carried out risk assessments of the cladding.14. Flammable aluminium panels fixed to the tower and on more than 300 other blocks across England were never subjected to a full British Standard fire test.15. Stairwell was too narrow and soon became impassable thanks to smoke, darkness, firefighters and distressed and dying victims.16. An architectural feature called a \u0027crown\u0027 at the top of the building caught fire and also helped the blaze spread horizontally.17. Design of tower blocks is supposed to \u0027compartmentalise\u0027 fires into inidual flats – but this was not effective at Grenfell.18. Ventilation system for removing smoke from lobbies failed.19. Fire stops between each floor were not installed correctly, meaning nothing stopped the blaze leaping up the tower.20. A \u0027culture of non-compliance\u0027 appeared to exist in the maintenance of the tower.21. Most of the fire doors leading to the 120 flats were relatively new but did not comply with building regulations.22. Some doors failed within 20 minutes even though they should have blocked fire for an hour.23. Doors were fitted with a variety of different locks, hinges and letter plates that could significantly reduce fire resistance.24. Forty-eight doors had glazing that failed and allowed flames and smoke to pass directly through.25. Fourteen of the doors to Grenfell\u0027s flats were of unknown origin.26. Some doors designed to \u0027self-close\u0027 failed to do so, allowing the fire to spread more quickly.27. Doors were left open by fire hoses and in one case, a body.28. Defective windows installed in the 2012-16 refurbishment allowed the fire to spread from a single kitchen to the external cladding through gaps in frames.29. Windows had no fire-resistant cavity barriers encasing them and these openings were surrounded by combustible material.30. During refurbishment, the windows were fitted in an \u0027improvised manner\u0027 that may have made them less safe.

A Tube strike will be taking place from 12:01am on Wednesday, June 6, 2018 and will last until 11:59pm. The Jubilee line is also scheduled to be suspended on Thursday, June 14 for a second 24-hour strike.Jubilee line strikeWhile the Jubilee line is the only Tube service that will be suspended for the entire day, the Bakerloo and Metropolitan lines in north-west London are also expected to be busy, because commuters will be using these lines as an alternative mode of transport.Some Metropolitan services that call at Baker Street will also call at Willesden Green, however. Stations such as Stratford, West Ham, South Hampstead, West Hampstead Thameslink and Hendon are expected to be busier than usual.The rest of the London Tube network is expected to operate as normal, with no other planned closures announced for the day. TfL will be running extra buses in order to cope with the additional passengers using this mode of transport.          With the Jubilee line being suspended, other lines are expected to be extremely busyWhy is there a strike?Jubilee line staff from both RMT and Aslef unions will stage a walkout on June 6 in a row over a new timetable, that has been imposed by TfL.This new timetable has been introduced so that peak service is extended on the busiest sections of the line by an hour, which will benefit thousands of passengers.However, the unions fear for how the new timetable will impact the work-life balance of the drivers, as it will ‘ride roughshod over current rostering agreements’, the RMT said. With the number of drivers working on Saturdays, a previous arrangement agreed upon in 2015, would be broken.Is the Tube strike really going to happen?Despite efforts to try and reach an agreement with the conciliation service Acas, the strikes on both days in June 2018 will go ahead.RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ‘RMT is bitterly disappointed that Tube managers have knocked back an opportunity to negotiate a settlement to this dispute in extensive talks that broke up on Friday. They failed to put a single proposal forward.          Despite efforts to reach an agreement, the strikes on both days in June 2018 will go ahead‘It is outrageous that Tube managers are trying to bulldoze through timetable changes without agreement that ride roughshod over existing rostering agreements.‘Drivers are angry at the impact on work-life balance and rightly see this move as the thin end of a very long wedge that could see processes and agreements unilaterally shredded by Tube bosses.TfL’s Director of Network Operations for London Underground, Nigel Holness added: ‘We have adhered to the strict agreements and policies we have with our trade unions. This action is completely unnecessary and I apologise to customers for the disruption that it will cause.‘I call on the unions to continue working with us for the benefit of our customers and our staff and to call off these strikes.’TfL Tube strikes: All you need to know about the Jubilee line walkoutsWho is Chief Keef?

Those who know my heart know that this is not indicative of my character, nor is it indicative of my business acumen.\u0027Haskell resigned the following day and, just 10 days later, Carlson was named the new CEO.Carlson said it was a \u0027form or justice\u0027 that she was able to take over the role and saw the volunteer position as a \u0027call of duty\u0027.          When it first began in 1921, Miss America was actually a swimsuit competition called a \u0027bathing beauty revue\u0027 (pictured here are competitors during the swimsuit round in 1945)          Carlson said she hopes young women will realize that Miss America is \u0027now open, inclusive, and transparent\u0027. Pictured are competitors in 1947The selection of Carlson marked the first time a former pageant winner has served as the leader of the  organization. Now the entire leadership team for Miss America is made up of women.\u0027This is a new beginning, and change can sometimes be difficult, but I know a lot about change,\u0027 Carlson said.\u0027My life has worked in mysterious ways. I never thought I\u0027d be the chairwoman of the Miss America Organization, but here I am and we\u0027re moving it forward and we\u0027re evolving in this cultural revolution.\u0027 On Tuesday Carlson also touched on her recent work as an outspoken advocate for victims of sexual harassment.Her lawsuit against former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, who stepped down from his role after mounting pressure from additional employees with similar accusations, is seen as one of the first sparks of the #MeToo movement.\u0027I could have never expected what would happen when I sued my former employer at Fox News for sexual harassment 22 months ago, but look what happened,\u0027 she said. \u0027Thousands of women have been inspired to know that they can stand up and speak up and their voices will be heard.\u0027 \u0027If I\u0027ve been a beacon of hope to any woman in that process, it has been worth it.\u0027Miss America is scrapping its swimsuit competition | GMA"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/15/4CED189400000578-5808185-image-m-31_1528209217124.jpg","title":"Travel firm boss completes 1986 World Cup sticker album 32 years","story":"    Dylan Harris is overjoyed after completing his sticker collection following a 32-year searchA specialist travel firm director has finally completed his Panini World Cup sticker album -  32 years after it was released following a world-wide search.    Dylan Harris kicked off his search for stickers for his 1986 Mexico World Cup album, aged 7, when the England team featuring players like Chris Waddle and Gary Lineker were knocked out in the quarter final with the help of Argentinean Diego Maradona\u0027s infamous hand ball goal.

Ninewells Hospital in Dundee where the woman, 30, went to have her baby delivered when she went into premature labour\u0027Further, the Tribunal found that she embarked upon a vaginal delivery without a proper basis for concluding that a delivery was imminent or that there were any characteristics present that might be regarded as favourable to a vaginal delivery.\u0027The Tribunal did not accept that in these circumstances a caesarean section was the appropriate mode of delivery for foetal wellbeing. The Tribunal did not accept that the circumstances were such that Dr Laxman should have assumed that a caesarean section would have no prospect of success.\u0027The Tribunal determined that at this time Dr Laxman\u0027s priority was a live delivery and there was also a reasonable prospect that Baby B could have survived following an immediate caesarean section under general anaesthetic.\u0027The decision to proceed with vaginal delivery represented a failure in her clinical decision-making on the evidence available to her at the time.\u0027In today\u0027s tribunal decision, the panel added: \u0027The tribunal is satisfied that Dr Vilvanathan Laxman has expressed genuine and appropriate remorse for what happened, and she candidly accepted responsibility as the consultant in charge in theatre that day. \u0027The events in question are likely to have had a profound impact on Dr Laxman, as they surely will have for all others who were present in theatre that day. She has learnt from this unfortunate episode and that the likelihood of it being repeated is extremely remote. \u0027Further, at no point has Dr Vilvanathan Laxman sought to blame others for what happened or to minimise her actions.\u0027It was ruled that Dr Laxman should not receive a formal warning over the case and an interim order on her medical registration has now been revoked.The report said: \u0027In all the circumstances, the tribunal has concluded that Dr Vilvanathan Laxman\u0027s conduct did not fall so far short of the standards of conduct reasonably to be expected of a doctor as to amount to serious misconduct.\u0027In respect of patient safety, the tribunal was satisfied that Dr Vilvanathan Laxman does not currently present a risk to patients.\u0027Dr Vilvanathan Laxman\u0027s wrong decision related to an isolated, single incident in an otherwise unblemished career.\u0027The panel concluded: \u0027Nothing in this determination should detract from the fact that on March 16 2014 Dr Vilvanathan Laxman made a significant error of judgement which had serious consequences and a profound impact upon patient A and for which Dr Vilvanathan Laxman bears a heavy responsibility.\u0027 The tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee with a team of other doctors.The woman\u0027s waters had broken early at 25 weeks and upon examination her unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was between 2-4cm dilated. It can be 10cm fully dilated and the patient was told by doctors she might have to undergo a C-section.Laxman had started work at 8.30am the previous day and went home at 6pm for five hours before returning to the hospital at 11pm. She was told about the patient at 2am and was subsequently paged at 8.30am to take a look at her when her condition became more critical.Later, whilst discussing the method of delivery, Laxman told a colleague: \u0027We are not doing a C-section - you would never do a C-section of a 25-weeker.\u0027 She then carried out a vaginal examination of the woman and told her \u0027to push.\u0027Mr Bradbury added: \u0027Initially the body of Baby B descended without difficulty however, the arms were raised and the hands were behind the head which required manipulation by Dr Laxman for their delivery.\u0027Thereafter, Baby B\u0027s head became trapped in the uterus with his neck within Patient A\u0027s cervix.\u0027There then followed what was to become, in the Tribunal\u0027s view, an increasingly desperate attempt to deliver Baby B\u0027s head. \u0027Because of the pain and distress that Patient A was by this time experiencing the decision was made to administer a general anaesthetic following which further attempts were made to incise Patient A\u0027s cervix and extract Baby B by means of traction.\u0027While Patient A was under general anaesthetic, Dr Laxman continued to make attempts to deliver Baby B by traction and ultimately Baby B\u0027s head became detached from his body. \u0027The evidence suggests, and the Tribunal accepts, that by the time that Baby B\u0027s head became detached from his body he had already died.\u0027Even on her own initial assessment that Patient A\u0027s cervix was 4cm dilated this should have indicated to Dr Laxman that this was insufficient to deliver Baby B\u0027s head.\u0027She should have appreciated that there would be a real and significant risk of complications arising during delivery, namely head entrapment, having had regard to the likely diameter of the baby\u0027s head at this gestation.\u0027Dr Laxman made a decision which was not clinically indicated, in that she failed to perform an immediate delivery by caesarean section under general anaesthetic and instead proceeded with a vaginal delivery.\u0027Her conduct set in train a course of events which ultimately resulted in the decapitation of Baby B and to this extent contributed to that decapitation. \u0027But for Dr Laxman\u0027s error of judgement in this regard, the decapitation would not have occurred.\u0027Laxman will now face further disciplinary hearings which will decide whether she could be struck off.She told the hearing: \u0027I was trying to deliver a live baby, I was trying really hard, possibly too hard. \u0027I did not intend to harm mum or the baby. I am distraught at the outcome and I am very sorry it did not come out the way I meant it.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/19/4CF1F7BD00000578-5809377-image-m-4_1528223340106.jpg","title":"Kenneth Cole deletes tone deaf tweet calling Kate Spade inspiring accessory","story":"    Kenneth Cole wrote then deleted this tweet on Tuesday morning after news of Kate Spade\u0027s death emerged           Spade and Cole are pictured in 2002 at an event in New York City.

Akbar Al Baker is pictured with his wife Samira Al Baker (left) and Donald and Melania Trump in 2007          Akbar Al Baker said his airline had taken steps to address gender equality, but when asked why it was led by a man, he replied: \u0027Of course it had to be led by a man because it is a very challenging position\u0027\u0027IATA also has a similar position on promoting gender equality,\u0027 he added.The comments came minutes after Al Baker - who has a reputation for hitting out at rivals and suppliers over poor performance - had joked that one of his roles as the new chairman of IATA was to be less controversial. The organisation currently has just two female CEOs on its 31-member board - Christine Ourmieres-Widener of British budget airline Flybe and Air Europa\u0027s Maria Jose Hidalgo Gutierrez, who was added Tuesday.It\u0027s not the first time 56-year-old Al Baker, who also sits on the board of Heathrow, has courted controversy with his remarks about women.Qantas caves in to pressure from Beijing and will refer to...American Airlines CEO says that airline ticket prices could...Share this articleLast year, while in Ireland to launch the country\u0027s link to Doha, he delivered a speech saying that his average age of Qatar\u0027s flight attendants is 26, so there\u0027s no need to fly with \u0027cr**\u0027 US carriers where passengers are \u0027served by grandmothers.\u0027 He later apologised for his comments. Al Baker, who has two sons with his wife Samira, became chief executive of Qatar Airways in 1997. Meanwhile, IATA\u0027s chief executive Alexandre de Juniac acknowledged that having more women in senior positions was a \u0027long-standing issue\u0027 that required further efforts from airlines and the industry body.It released figures in March showing just three percent of CEOs in the industry were female, compared with 12 percent in other sectors.Leading carriers in North America and Europe had the highest representation of women in senior roles at 16 percent and 14 percent respectively, IATA said.          Akbar Al Baker (centre) later defended the carrier, saying it was the first Middle Eastern airline to have a female pilot and that other women were in senior roles. Pictured left, IATA chief executive Alexandre de Juniac and right, Qantas chief executive Alan JoyceAfrican, Asia-Pacific and South American airlines were at about eight percent, with the Middle East having the worst at four percent, the data showed.Qantas chief Alan Joyce said at the same press conference that the Australian carrier had achieved a strong turnaround in profits partly due to its pursuit of ersity, with women making up 40 percent of senior management.But he said it was \u0027going to take a long time to fix some of the issues that are inherent in our society\u0027, such as girls not studying science and technology in schools, which impacted their numbers in engineering and flying roles.Gloria Guevara Manzo, the first female president of the World Travel and Tourism Council, said investors needed to start pushing companies to do more.\u0027When you have ersity, your company\u0027s results are better,\u0027 she told Reuters earlier on the sidelines of the Sydney airline talks. \u0027It\u0027s not just for the sake of it.\u0027          It\u0027s not the first time Al Baker has courted controversy with his remarks about women.

Surrounded by her friends and family, she calmly watched the event - despite the crowd gathered behind herThe picture that made him: A young Princess Elizabeth saw some of Colonel Vassa Voynovich\u0027s pictures of her friends as he was a friend of Sir \u0027Jock\u0027 Colville, her private secretary. Through Colville, Elizabeth requested he photograph her in uniform during one of her first Trooping the Colour ceremonies in 1951. The success of this image launched his photographic career and he changed his name to John Scott to help him get work          Another photo shows a bearded Prince Charles, aged in his 20s, on horseback looking strikingly similar to his son Prince Harry. Wearing a flat cap and a tweed jacket, the keen horseman has often taken part in races and polo matches. Last year he opened up about the emotional moment he cradled his  racehorse Allibar when it collapsed and died during training in 1981          Prince Philip cooling off after a polo match. Scott, an ex-cavalry officer with equestrian expertise, was at home capturing Ascot, Badminton and the Windsor Horse Show, and shared the Royals\u0027 passion for horses. He was also extremely charming, spoke 10 languages and his diplomatic experience meant he was suave and comfortable around royalty          Queen Elizabeth, right, is pictured enjoying a conversation with her mother while out with her camera. The pair shared a close relationship, particularly after the death of King George VI, but aside from a love of horses did not share many common interests.

He attended a lunch held at the 20th Century Fox studio in Hollywood, California, where he met film royalty such as Cary Grant, Charlton Heston and Lauren Bacall, along with the M*A*S*H stars - most of whom were still in costume. According to a fansite, he watched an episode of the series being filmed along with an episode of Charlie\u0027s Angels          The Prince of Wales is also pictured in the archive meeting other actresses and actors in Hollywood in 1977 - three years before he first started courting Diana. His visit made headlines across the country and saw hundreds of fans turn out to catch a glimpse of the Royal on US soil          Prince Charles (centre with his back turned) meeting Bionic Man actor Lee Majors with his then-wife, Charlie\u0027s Angels actress Farrah Fawcett-Majors, and movie royalty Sophia Loren  and Cary Grant at a star-studded Hollywood party in 1977          One of the photos shows the Queen during a royal visit to then-Communist Yugoslavia in 1972. It was the monarch\u0027s first visit to an eastern bloc country and she was greeted by President Josip Tito in full military uniform. She went on the state visit with husband Prince Philip and daughter Princess Anne and returned the favour when she invited Tito to Buckingham Palace in 1978          President Tito, pictured during The Queen\u0027s state visit to Yugoslavia in 1972, pulled out all the stops to make the trip a memorable one including raising the Union Jack flag. A former communist revolutionary, Tito led a successful resistance group against the Nazis during World War Two and became prime minister of his country in 1944, before becoming its first president in 1953. It is said on his return visit to London he impressed the royals by playing Chopin on the piano          A candid snap of Andrew and Edward from the 1970\u0027s. Auctioneer David Lay, who is selling the archive, said: \u0027During my many years as an auctioneer we have handled quite a few photographic collections but this is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable archives I have ever seen. In the UK and indeed many other parts of the world, the fascination with the British Royals is unwavering and here we have an archive that documents four decades of their lives\u0027          A smiling Queen at Balmoral in the early 1950\u0027s. Auctioneer Mr Lay added: \u0027The breadth and quality of the images is superb so really it is unparalleled in my experience. Looking through all the images in this archive, covering almost 40 years, it is possible to see the Royal family grow up before ones eyes. Everything is here, from childhood to maturity, diplomatic Royal engagements with all their pomp and ceremony to unguarded family moments between the Queen and her children. It is an astonishing collection of images\u0027          Princess Margaret with Lord Snowdon and Prince Andrew.A remarkable archive of over 4,000 photos of the Royals taken over four decades by a trusted photographer has emerged for sale for £10,000.The photos include iconic snaps of Prince Charles and Princess Diana on honeymoon as well as intimate shots of the Queen and other prominent Royals relaxing  A very young Katharine Worsely, the Duchess of Kent. The Duchess, now 85, met Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, the eldest son of Prince George, Duke of Kent, and Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, while he was based at Catterick Camp.  On June 8 1961, the couple married at York Minster and Princess Anne was one of the bridesmaids. Guests included actors Noël Coward and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as well as members of the British, Greek, Danish, Norwegian, Yugoslavian, Romanian and Spanish royal families. The Duchess later gained attention for her conversion to Catholicism in 1994, the first member of the Royal Family to convert publicly since the passing of the Act of Settlement 1701          Role reversal: The Queen is pictured snapping away on her camera while in the countryside with her family. She often used a German designed Leica to take her snaps and was regularly photographed taking pictures of horse events          A young Prince Charles on the Royal yacht Bloodhound in Scotland. The classic 1930s yacht, which was owned by Her Majesty and Prince Philip from 1962 to 1969, was where Charles and his sister Anne learned how to sail. Prince Philip had much success competing with her at the famous Cowes Week Regatta around the Isle of Wight, and she was also used to take the entire family, along with the Britannia, to Scotland\u0027s Western Isles for their annual holiday          The Royals have many interests and this photo of Prince Charles and sister Princess Anne from the early 1960s shows they grew up with a keen interest in boats. The pair are pictured on a rubber speedboat, with Charles appearing to be tinkering with the engine while Anne retrieves an oar to manually move the vessel          Princess Margaret\u0027s relationship with her husband eventually became strained and they are pictured here deep in conversation, with both looking concerned. The marriage broke down in 1976 after Margaret was pictured on the front page of a national newspaper with younger lover Sir Roddy Llewellyn, 17 years her junior, and they were orced two years later          A young Princess Anne is pictured in a casual moment chatting to a member of the public while dressed in what appears to be a 1970s style, wearing a cravat and jeans. The photo was taken around the time of a kidnapping attempt on the Princess in which Ian Ball stopped her limousine and shot her protection officer in a failed £2million ransom plot          Just like recent events with the birth of Prince Louis, a new royal baby was a major event for the media. Here Princess Margaret, right, and her husband Lord Snowden, left, are pictured taking their newborn son David home after his birth in November 1961. The Princess had two children with her husband, a photographer previously known as Antony Armstrong-Jones before he was given a title          A young Prince Edward and his cousin Sarah Armstrong Jones, daughter of Princess Margaret, are pictured here playing together at a horse show in the late 1960s. The candid series of photographs show the Royal Family at some of their most relaxed moments and reveals how their children were just like any other, particularly in this image where the prince appears to be trying to protect his hair from his cousin          This series of snaps taken of Princess Diana were commissioned for a set of stamps issued on her 21st birthday, a year after she married Prince Charles. Her expression looks somewhat uncomfortable and possibly reflects her feelings within the Royal Family, with problems quickly surfacing in her marriage to Charles, which would end in orce after 15 years          The Queen, right, and her sister Princess Margaret, left, pictured together in the 1970s. Reflecting how they have often been portrayed in the media, the monarch looks stern and serious while Margaret has a more relaxed expression. The pair are believed to be pictured at a horse show, which they grew up attending together          The Queen is pictured by Mr Scott here at one of her favourite events, the Badminton Horse Trials, in 1952. She even moved the trials to Windsor for one year in 1955 so they could also stage the second European Championships. The car parks, tradestands, arena and cross country courses fit into an area of approximately 500 acres of Badminton Park          Scott (pictured) lived an extraordinary life himself as he was a Yugoslavian aristocrat who fled his native Serbia during the Second World War after it was occupied by the Nazis. His actual name was Colonel Vassa Voynovich and he commanded a platoon on the Russian front aged just 17 during the First World War. An ex-cavalry officer with equestrian expertise, he was at home capturing Ascot, Badminton and the Windsor Horse Show, and shared the Royals\u0027 passion for horses. He was also extremely charming, spoke 10 languages and his diplomatic experience meant he was suave and comfortable around royalty          Prince Charles and Princess Diana do not look much like a happy couple here pictured on a trip to Wales in the early 1980s. Although the couple\u0027s marriage initially seemed strong, problems began to develop after five years and both had affairs, with Charles seeing his now wife Camilla, leading to Diana saying there were \u0027three people in the marriage\u0027 a decade later  Princess Diana looks a lot happier in these photos, including an iconic shot with Charles  as they walked around Balmoral on their honeymoon in 1981, left, when she was just 20 years old, and alongside the Duchess of York, who also endured her own difficulties with the Royals, at the Guard\u0027s Polo Club, Egham in 1982           Charles is pictured dancing with scantily clad women at a carnival in Brazil surrounded by a mass of press, more dancers in elaborate gold coloured clothing and a huddle of happy revellers. Draped in a smart double breasted tuxedo with large bow-tie, Charles cut a dashing figure with his hair swept over in a side parting style, which has, ironically, become fashionable again and was worn similarly by many male attendees at his son Prince Harry\u0027s recent wedding to Meghan Markle          Saintly smile: Sharing a laugh with Mother Theresa in Calcutta in 1978, Charles donned a red rose in his lapel and a smart grey day suit with matching neck tie. Years later Princess Diana would have a spiritual awakening at the hands of Mother Theresa and write, in a letter to her confidant Paul Burrell: \u0027Today, something very profound touched my life.

Ninewells Hospital in Dundee where the woman, 30, went to have her baby delivered when she went into premature labour\u0027Further, the Tribunal found that she embarked upon a vaginal delivery without a proper basis for concluding that a delivery was imminent or that there were any characteristics present that might be regarded as favourable to a vaginal delivery.\u0027The Tribunal did not accept that in these circumstances a caesarean section was the appropriate mode of delivery for foetal wellbeing. The Tribunal did not accept that the circumstances were such that Dr Laxman should have assumed that a caesarean section would have no prospect of success.\u0027The Tribunal determined that at this time Dr Laxman\u0027s priority was a live delivery and there was also a reasonable prospect that Baby B could have survived following an immediate caesarean section under general anaesthetic.\u0027The decision to proceed with vaginal delivery represented a failure in her clinical decision-making on the evidence available to her at the time.\u0027In today\u0027s tribunal decision, the panel added: \u0027The tribunal is satisfied that Dr Vilvanathan Laxman has expressed genuine and appropriate remorse for what happened, and she candidly accepted responsibility as the consultant in charge in theatre that day. \u0027The events in question are likely to have had a profound impact on Dr Laxman, as they surely will have for all others who were present in theatre that day. She has learnt from this unfortunate episode and that the likelihood of it being repeated is extremely remote. \u0027Further, at no point has Dr Vilvanathan Laxman sought to blame others for what happened or to minimise her actions.\u0027It was ruled that Dr Laxman should not receive a formal warning over the case and an interim order on her medical registration has now been revoked.The report said: \u0027In all the circumstances, the tribunal has concluded that Dr Vilvanathan Laxman\u0027s conduct did not fall so far short of the standards of conduct reasonably to be expected of a doctor as to amount to serious misconduct.\u0027In respect of patient safety, the tribunal was satisfied that Dr Vilvanathan Laxman does not currently present a risk to patients.\u0027Dr Vilvanathan Laxman\u0027s wrong decision related to an isolated, single incident in an otherwise unblemished career.\u0027The panel concluded: \u0027Nothing in this determination should detract from the fact that on March 16 2014 Dr Vilvanathan Laxman made a significant error of judgement which had serious consequences and a profound impact upon patient A and for which Dr Vilvanathan Laxman bears a heavy responsibility.\u0027 The tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee with a team of other doctors.The woman\u0027s waters had broken early at 25 weeks and upon examination her unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was between 2-4cm dilated. It can be 10cm fully dilated and the patient was told by doctors she might have to undergo a C-section.Laxman had started work at 8.30am the previous day and went home at 6pm for five hours before returning to the hospital at 11pm. She was told about the patient at 2am and was subsequently paged at 8.30am to take a look at her when her condition became more critical.Later, whilst discussing the method of delivery, Laxman told a colleague: \u0027We are not doing a C-section - you would never do a C-section of a 25-weeker.\u0027 She then carried out a vaginal examination of the woman and told her \u0027to push.\u0027Mr Bradbury added: \u0027Initially the body of Baby B descended without difficulty however, the arms were raised and the hands were behind the head which required manipulation by Dr Laxman for their delivery.\u0027Thereafter, Baby B\u0027s head became trapped in the uterus with his neck within Patient A\u0027s cervix.\u0027There then followed what was to become, in the Tribunal\u0027s view, an increasingly desperate attempt to deliver Baby B\u0027s head. \u0027Because of the pain and distress that Patient A was by this time experiencing the decision was made to administer a general anaesthetic following which further attempts were made to incise Patient A\u0027s cervix and extract Baby B by means of traction.\u0027While Patient A was under general anaesthetic, Dr Laxman continued to make attempts to deliver Baby B by traction and ultimately Baby B\u0027s head became detached from his body. \u0027The evidence suggests, and the Tribunal accepts, that by the time that Baby B\u0027s head became detached from his body he had already died.\u0027Even on her own initial assessment that Patient A\u0027s cervix was 4cm dilated this should have indicated to Dr Laxman that this was insufficient to deliver Baby B\u0027s head.\u0027She should have appreciated that there would be a real and significant risk of complications arising during delivery, namely head entrapment, having had regard to the likely diameter of the baby\u0027s head at this gestation.\u0027Dr Laxman made a decision which was not clinically indicated, in that she failed to perform an immediate delivery by caesarean section under general anaesthetic and instead proceeded with a vaginal delivery.\u0027Her conduct set in train a course of events which ultimately resulted in the decapitation of Baby B and to this extent contributed to that decapitation. \u0027But for Dr Laxman\u0027s error of judgement in this regard, the decapitation would not have occurred.\u0027Laxman will now face further disciplinary hearings which will decide whether she could be struck off.She told the hearing: \u0027I was trying to deliver a live baby, I was trying really hard, possibly too hard. \u0027I did not intend to harm mum or the baby. I am distraught at the outcome and I am very sorry it did not come out the way I meant it.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd72de49c25689edaf925eefc10536009f342747/0_230_3456_2074/master/3456.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=801a69e63a10689f2a8154ace455d858","title":"its been my whole life alan and his photobooths a picture essay","story":"The famous photobooth at Flinders Street station in Melbourne has been the centre of one family’s life.

Alan Adler tells how he got into the industry by chance in 1972, shares photos from down the years and explains why digital just doesn’t have the ‘warmth and character’ • Do you have your own pictures from the Flinders Street photobooth? Share them with our picture editor carly.earl@theIn 1972, Alan Adler owned a grocery shop that wasn’t doing very well. An advertisement in the Age promised him $80 a week if, instead, he ran a photobooth – a contraption that he did not understand. He bought two.“It was a disaster from day one,” he said. “One of the thermostats malfunctioned in the booth which caused the photo to come out white. I had no idea what a photobooth was about, and hadn’t seen one before I bought one.”Since those first two, the 86-year-old now owns “too many” black and white photobooths throughout Melbourne to remember – though many are now in his garage, victims of the digital photo revolution. His most famous booth, at Melbourne’s Flinders Street station, has just been given a reprieve from a planned removal. It will remain at the station, though in a different spot.“We didn’t really make any real money out of the photobooth until the $1 coin came in,” he says. “Before that you had to use four 20c coins and we would charge you 80c. Not many people carried four 20c cents with them so I wasn’t really very popular. Then the $2 coin come out and we were really making money!”Adler’s booths use the old school method, with silver-halide film, thick paper and a cocktail of six or seven different chemicals.“You can’t have a better photograph than a proper photographic process with the chemicals,” he says. “With a very expensive digital camera you can get close, but it doesn’t have the warmth or the character. Our photos are really long lasting. I’ve photos I took 46 years ago, good as the day they were taken.”Fans and customers send him nice messages from time to time, which he especially enjoys.“I got some very lovely letters” he says. One was from a group who met up on the last day that one of his booths was in operation. “We want to thank you for so many years of happiness,” they wrote.Now, the business has changed, and Alder says it’s no longer viable. It costs $2,000 for him to buy just one chemical used in the processing. “We really never charged enough,” he says. “Then digital photobooths came on to the market and we lost our locations.“It’s been my whole life. We’ve met fellow photobooth operators all around the world. We’ve been to America a few times to get spare parts for machines. We met a guy in Switzerland. It’s been our life for 50 years.” Do you have your own pictures from the Flinders Street photobooth?

He also confirms that Comcast\u0027s rival bid will not be referred to media regulator Ofcom.May 2018Culture secretary Matt Hancock\u0026nbspsays he is unlikely to ask media regulator Ofcom to investigate Comcast’s bid for Sky.May 2018Fox chairman Lachlan Murdoch\u0026nbspsays it plans to press ahead with Disney deal and take full control of Sky, amid reports that Comcast is preparing a $60bn (£45bn) bid for other Fox assets in addition to the Sky stake.April 2018US cable company Comcast, owner of NBC Universal,\u0026nbsplaunches a rival £22bn takeover bid for Sky.January 2018The UK competition regulator rules that Murdoch’s Sky bid is not in the public interest\u0026nbspdue to media plurality concerns. It offers Rupert Murdoch two options to prevent the deal being blocked: that Sky News is spun off or sold or that Sky News is insulated from the influence of the Murdoch family trust.December 2017Murdoch stuns the media industry by announcing\u0026nbspa $66bn (£50bn) deal with Disney\u0026nbspto sell Fox assets including his Hollywood film studio and his Sky stake, beginning the break up of his global business empire.September 2017Murdoch’s Sky takeover bid\u0026nbspis referred to the Competition and Markets Authority\u0026nbspby culture secretary Karen Bradley.December 2016Murdoch launches a new £11.2bn bid\u0026nbspto take full control of Sky.November 2014BSkyB is renamed Sky plc, following expansion into Europe with the £7bn buyout of sister companies in Germany and Italy.June 2013Ownership of Murdoch’s Sky stake switches from News Corp to 21st Century Fox, as he reorganises his media assets to split his newspaper publishing business and film and TV operations into two separately listed companies.1995BSkyB becomes a plc, with shares trading on the FTSE 100.November 1990Sky TV merges with rival BSB to create BSkyB, in which Murdoch’s News Corp is the largest shareholder.Comcast, which owns US TV network NBC and Universal Studios, made a rival bid earlier this year that valued Sky at £22bn.The culture secretary, Matt Hancock, approved the Comcast deal in a statement in the House of Commons on Tuesday afternoon. He also indicated he will also approve the Murdoch deal if Sky News is offloaded to an appropriate buyer, who will guarantee its independence and fund it for 10 years, in order to avoid excessive influence by the the mogul’s family over the UK news business.Disney has already offered to buy Sky News in order to clear competition concerns as part of its broader bid for many of Murdoch’s media assets. Hancock suggested this offer is likely to meet his standards and would allow Murdoch’s bid to be approved later this month, meaning a bidding war for Sky is “on the horizon”.Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox said Hancock’s statement meant it was “confident that we will reach a final decision clearing our transaction”.The deal has left Sky News employees nervous about their futures but in an email to staff channel boss John Ryley noted that both bids contained “commitments to guarantee the funding and editorial independence of Sky News”.“I will update as and when there are further developments but in the meantime, all we can do is to continue the great job we’ve been doing and concentrate on what we do best which is making the best news content for mobile, television and radio,” he said.The Labour deputy leader, Tom Watson, said Sky News has “always been a beacon for independent and rigorous journalism” and said his priority is “ensuring Sky News thrives going forward”.He warned that if Sky News is sold to Disney – and Disney’s bid for overall control of Fox is unsuccessful – it would leave the 24-hour news channel “isolated from Sky and owned by a foreign company with few news interests in the UK”.The takeover bids are part of a complex web of global media deals, with giant companies competing to buy smaller businesses in the hope of securing their long-term future in the face of challenges from streaming services such as Amazon and Netflix.The Competition and Markets Authority provisionally blocked Fox’s takeover bid in January due to fears it would raise competition concerns and was therefore not in the public interest. Fox has since been attempting to address the concerns by tabling a series of remedies.Murdoch’s last attempt to take full control of Sky was abandoned in 2011, amid the phone-hacking scandal at his News of the World newspaper. Even if Murdoch’s takeover is successful this time around it is unlikely the 87-year-old will retain control of Sky in the long term, as he is looking to sell most of his broadcast and film assets. Disney has already tabled a £39bn offer to buy assets including Fox’s TV production unit, the 20th Century Fox film studio, and its stake in Sky.To raise the odds further, Comcast recently announced it is planning to outbid Disney for the same Fox assets, as part of its battle with Disney to control the future of the media industry. Under both deals Murdoch would be left owning a much smaller Fox business which would control a TV network and news channels including the rightwing Fox News, in addition to Dow Jones which runs the Wall Street Journal and publisher HarperCollins. In the UK he would be left with his News UK business, which owns the Sun and the Times newspapers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d8876081c36826b93991537a65e3aa3395010d3/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23b215867c61957c8d67f8901529ef55","title":"tesco bank customers shut out from online and mobile services","story":"Bank apologises after 5.6m customers were unable to access online services this morningTesco Bank became the latest banking operation to suffer a technical failure after its 5.6 million customers were temporarily blocked on Tuesday from accessing their accounts online or via mobile phone.In a statement, Tesco Bank said: “We apologise to customers who were unable to access online and mobile banking earlier today. These services are now working as normal and we would like to thank customers for their patience”.It said serviceshad been unavailable for a four hour period from 10.30am to 2.30pm. It declined to say if the problem was caused by internal hardware issues or a malicious attack. In 2016, the bank admitted that 40,000 customers had been affected by an online heist when money was stolen from half the number of accounts targeted. At the time, the bank suspended some banking activities to protect customers from “online criminal activity”.Customers of Tesco Bank were able to use debit and credit cards as usual, but could not view their accounts online. The bank said: “Customers can access their accounts as normal by contacting our customer service centres.”Tesco Bank, opened in 1997 to sell insurance products, launched into current account banking in 2014. It has £9.2bn in customer deposits and has lent £11.5bn. The service outage at Tesco came just days after Visa payments failed across the UK and Europe, sparking chaos in shops and transport systems. A cross-party group of MPs on Tuesday demanded an explanation from Visa about what caused the problem. Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Treasury select committee, has written to Charlotte Hogg, the chief executive for Europe at Visa, about her handling of the failure and to find out what went wrong on 1 June.On Twitter, exasperated customers feared they faced an account lockout similar to the IT meltdown that hit TSB.

A primary school in Inverness has announced that girls and boys will compete together on sports days. Incredibly, the news has prompted national debate.As Dr Hilary Jones said, introducing the debate on Good Morning Britain on Tuesday, girls and boys are physically on an even level at primary age so there is no scientific reason to separate them.For the local councillor who noted that the Olympics didn’t do mixed-gender competitions – actually they do. Tokyo 2020 will include mixed-gender relays in swimming, athletics and triathlon, as well as mixed team events in archery, fencing and judo. There will also be a mixed doubles table tennis competition.In sports such as equestrianism and horse racing, men and women have long been competing directly against each other. And at long last women are increasingly growing in profile and success in these disciplines, whether that’s Katie Walsh, Bryony Frost and Rachael Blackmore competing in the Grand National this year, or motor racing star Alice Powell, who has spent her career challenging for podium places alongside the men.In football, girls and boys are allowed to play together up until the age of 18 after the Football Association changed the rules in 2015, and girls’ teams can play against boys’ teams in organised leagues up to the age of 12.Back in Inverness one parent reportedly said that their son had been bullied as a result of being beaten by a girl. I’m sorry to hear of anyone being bullied, but isn’t the crux of the problem here archaic ideas about girls being less physically able than boys? In 2018 we should be teaching girls and boys to respect each other, not supporting regressive gender stereotypes. Why not bring in some brilliant female sporting role models to show the children just how amazing women are at sport? They could watch Team GB’s women’s football team beating Brazil in a thrilling match at the 2012 Olympic Games in front of a record crowd of 70,584. Or the England women’s cricket team winning the World Cup, watched by 120 million viewers on television.Crucially we are a nation of inactive adults and increasingly inactive children, the consequences of which will play havoc with our physical and mental health. School sports day should be about fun. We want children to learn that moving their bodies, gaining physical literacy and competing is enjoyable. For too many kids that message is still not getting through, creating negative associations about sport and exercise that last a lifetime.I do agree that there are spaces where gender segregation can be a positive thing. My pledge for Women in Football’s #WhatIf campaign is to help set up a girls’ football club because so few girls at my daughter’s school have had the opportunity to play our national game, while their male peers have been developing their skills on the ball for years. In this instance, it’s about evening up a historical inequality – a culture in which girls are less likely to play football than boys.Certainly as physical changes start to impact on boys and girls it makes sense to segregate sport by gender. But for four-year-olds doing the egg-and-spoon race? Come off it. That’s when we truly know the world’s gone mad.• Anna Kessel is a  sports writer, chair of Women in Football and author of Eat Sweat Play"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a78f81e58c60ff76c9ae330aa125255525a324cb/0_0_2268_1360/master/2268.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a51ad8e9f58760d0bf409c27373c24f","title":"simon cowell giving up his phone is the ultimate show of affluence","story":"Smartphones used to be a status symbol. Now they are a necessity for all but the most privileged peopleDigital detoxes are all the rage these days, but did you know that unplugging from your smartphone suddenly can have severe, occasionally nauseating, side-effects? Within minutes of deciding to disconnect from the modern world to live a purer, more analogue life, some people have reported overwhelming feelings of smug superiority. Many of them appear to transform into modern messiahs, eager to preach the virtues of a smartphone-free life to anyone who will listen.All of that is great for Cowell. But far from being an astonishing confession, I would call his statements astonishingly condescending. Most people don’t have the luxury of abstaining from their smartphones. Many people rely on them to be able to take part in the gig economy. Ever heard an Uber driver talk about giving up their phone? Or a Deliveroo rider? No, because without their phones they would not be able to do their jobs.Just a few years ago, smartphones were a status symbol today they are the status quo. In our always-on world, it is choosing not to use your phone that is the ultimate show of affluence you could call this sans phone lifestyle luxury luddism. After all, the easiest way to make a living in the modern economy without a smartphone is to pay an army of assistants with phones to do things for you. I am sure Cowell did not arrange his interview with the Mail on Sunday by carrier pigeon.As smartphones have become ingrained in our lives, tech executives have claimed more concern about the ways in which they have hooked people to their wares. On Monday, Apple unveiled tools to help combat tech addiction at its Worldwide Developers Conference. These include Screen Time, which will let iOS users set daily time limits for apps. But while apps like these may be well meaning, they do little to solve the bigger issue – that, to opt out of the on-demand economy the tech titans helped create, you need to be immensely privileged."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b5393587c8f0201f4e22d57a970688ea0983851/0_174_4890_2933/master/4890.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6573577e813101a69d2f882d803c6b03","title":"the guardian view on amazon not a normal monopoly","story":"This week’s decision by the GMB union to bring a legal case against firms delivering for Amazon, the e-commerce giant, throws into sharp relief how much the modern economy has been stretched to benefit a monopolistic form of tech-capitalism. Ostensibly the action is about employment law: it argues that couriers working for three delivery companies are not entrepreneurs working for themselves who contract their labour to anyone willing to pay, but are in fact employees of Amazon’s latent delivery and logistics network. If the trade union is right, then these couriers should be treated as staff and paid the minimum wage, as well as sick and holiday pay.The price of Amazonian convenience to the British economy appears to be a few centuries of workplace progress. The union says the couriers are paid per parcel delivered, see wages deducted if unrealistic targets are unmet, and manage on illegal rates of pay. The government is picking up the tab: if these were Amazon delivery staff then the company would have to pay their national insurance. As they are deemed to be self-employed, there’s no employer’s tax to pay and the welfare system tops up their income with tax credits.Amazon has established itself as an essential part of the internet economy and its dominance – its sheer scale and breadth – has been enabled in part by privatising profit and socialising losses. The firm seems to be entrenching a model of cheap-labour doorstep delivery by recognising an easily ided workforce is more easily conquered. This model may also one day compete with the Royal Mail Amazon is reportedly planning to launch its own delivery service for US businesses to rival the state-owned US Postal Service.Amazon might think differently. The tech giant wants privileged treatment because, like the economist Joseph Schumpeter, it thinks only corporate monopolies, with their economies of scale and ability to innovate, can marshall growth. This view should be resisted. Amazon’s service ensures consumers are better off, but undue focus on this neglects the interests of workers, rival entrepreneurs and voters. This is why the spirit of employment law must be honoured so Amazon shoulders the responsibility (and the cost) for contracted workers, or works out how to compel its suppliers to do so.Amazon clearly would like to control the pipes of capitalism, siphoning off consumer demand for itself when it is lucrative to do so and charging others for use of its network. Amazon’s website is, in the west, the dominant platform for online retail sales. In the US Amazon leveraged this dominance to create a huge delivery business. In the UK it has delivered its first package by drone. Whether it is cloud computing or what ebooks are published, Amazon wants business to be done in arenas where it sets the rules. This is bad for democracy. Commerce ought to reside in markets governed by regulations set by democratic political process not those chosen by the world’s richest man, Amazon’s founder Jeff Bezos."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c829830416e75ba155a003e98e533b1251a18009/491_186_3279_1968/master/3279.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6174efee3a929c122ce57c174626d89","title":"rachel de souza vomit school controversy ofsted","story":"‘Change is necessary. Maybe I put people’s noses out of joint,’ says controversial academy chain chiefThe newspapers couldn’t believe their luck. Last autumn, Barry Smith, headteacher of the new Great Yarmouth Charter Academy, issued policies on behaviour to parents and children. The predecessor school, he wrote, was riddled with indiscipline, bullying and truancy. He would not allow such things. Mobile phones, if seen or heard, would be confiscated for weeks. Pupils must “only ever look at your teacher or where your teacher has directed you to look”. Smith specified “unacceptable” boys’ haircuts including “variations on the style often known as ‘Meet me at McDonald’s’”, a tousled mop with short sides.Most remarkably, he told children not to feign illness to avoid work. “If you feel sick we will give you a bucket. If you vomit – no problem! … that’s probably all your body wanted.” After press headlines and angry parents’ protests, Smith modified his “behaviour guide”, parts of which were “tongue in cheek”, with the sick buckets being just “a colourful turn of phrase”.For Dame Rachel de Souza, founder and chief executive of the Inspiration Trust, the chain that runs the academy, the storm was just a routine day’s work. For a small (14 schools) chain, founded in 2013, the trust attracts disproportionate publicity. Some of it is positive. Though several schools required improvement or were in special measures before they joined, the Department for Education puts Inspiration second only to a chain that includes two grammar schools in a league table of multi-academy trusts’ Progress 8 scores. A study by the Education Policy Institute rates its key stage 4 results ahead of every other secondary provider in England, including local authorities. Michael Gove, the former education secretary, was so impressed with De Souza, a steelworker’s daughter from Scunthorpe, that he said he would like to clone her “23,000 times”.De Souza points out that it’s normal for schools to be shown draft Ofsted reports and for inspectors to make second visits after representations. Ministers, in any case, have no power to influence school inspections. So why does she attract so much controversy? “Probably because I think change is necessary and do things wholeheartedly,” she ventures. But several hostile stories, I observe, are based on leaked emails, which suggests she makes enemies among her colleagues. “There were a number of difficult relationships. Perhaps some people’s noses were put out of joint.”De Souza talks at 100mph sentences begin but never finish, as she interrupts herself with new thoughts and anecdotes. “I’m jumping all over the place,” she says.She taught at comprehensives in Oxford, east London and Luton before, at 36, landing her first academy headship, also in Luton. The school, replacing two local authority schools deemed to be “underperforming”, was so difficult that she told her senior team it would probably continue to fail and, at the end of the year, “we could all walk away and get on with our lives”. But for that one year, they should give it everything.“We went totally over the top on every little thing. We would tell them to do their revision and then have a banana. Revise, eat a banana, revise, eat a banana. Year 11 had never had a qualified maths teacher. So I found one and put them all in the hall with him and a stereo mic for two hours each night.” She ordered new uniforms, sent teachers to get children out of bed in the mornings, and introduced assemblies with classical music. Exam results soared.She describes the trust as “a family” with “a feeling of community”, exemplified by an annual “great day” in early September “where we get all the staff together”. Inspiration Trust, like several other academy chains, has a central team of “brilliant subject specialists” hammering out rigorous curriculum content. If a local authority were doing it, it would be described as dictatorial, particularly since there is a heavy emphasis on “core knowledge”, the latest curriculum fashion, which De Souza embraced after visiting ED Hirsch, its guru, in the US. But de Souza insists that the team works closely with teachers and that “we see ourselves as a scholarly community generating new knowledge”.Born in 1968, she had a “wonderful, colourful, interesting childhood”. Her father was Irish, her mother, half-Austrian, half-Hungarian. A Ukrainian step-grandfather encouraged her to learn the language at a Saturday school. At her Catholic school, she was a “very good” student up to 14 but became “quite sociable and not that interested in studying” until the second year at sixth form college. Her religious studies teacher had a degree from London University’s tiny Heythrop College, and De Souza decided to follow him. She met her future husband, now in the probation service, on her first day. “I thought: yes, that’s it.”With a degree in theology and philosophy, “I was advised to shake off my northern help-the-world thing and go and make some money.” She became a trainee accountant. “I thought it was the end of life.” After two weeks, she left to take a teaching certificate at King ’s College, London.Her career – five jobs in the past 15 years – suggests a certain restlessness. There were rumours in 2016 that she would succeed Michael Wilshaw as chief inspector. She laughs and denies that she applied.So what about the “vomit school”? More laughter. “What Barry’s done there is unbelievable,” she tells me. “It’s one of the best examples of sorting out behaviour I’ve ever seen. The guy is super-talented.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94a370c998455a60fd1d5948b00eacc9c08c0464/0_273_4025_2415/master/4025.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f964ca60fc6ce6c8fc299c0729de3e76","title":"h and m change uk womenswear sizes customer frustration","story":"Swedish retailer’s products had long been criticised for being smaller than expectedH\u0026ampM is to change its UK womenswear sizes after years of complaints from customers that the clothes are smaller than expected.“We are taking the steps to change our womenswear measurements to be in line with UK sizing, for example, the previous measurements and fit of a size 12 will now be the measurements of a size 10,” said a spokesperson for the retailer.Parker said she was not “able to pull the jeans past my one thigh”.She went on to question how the retailer could sell pencil cases emblazoned with the word “#GRLPOWER” and T-shirts that say “SISTERHOOD” and expect women to feel empowered, while selling clothes that “do the exact opposite”.The Swedish company has until now translated its European sizes to a lower UK size than the majority of other high street shops, meaning a European 38 would be labelled a UK 12, where in other places it would be a 10.Although H\u0026ampM has begun using the new sizing on labels, the spokesperson said: “This will be a gradual process whereby customers will experience a transition period, and are encouraged to use our sizing guides online or ask our store staff for advice when shopping.”Customers appeared to broadly welcome the change.

He was living on £37.50 a week benefit, and “perfectly happy. I made all my own clothes, I got into all the clubs free.” When the Haçienda nightclub opened in the city, Griffiths went every night without fail for the first six months – “and I didn’t eat anyway, so there was no requirement for food. But there we were, wasted on the sofa, and the news came on that Margaret Thatcher was considering conscription for the Falklands war for the unemployed. So I thought I’d better do something. That’s how I ended up studying fashion.”The brand Max Mara conjures an image of camel coats and conservative northern Italian style, so Ian Griffiths, its designer for three decades, is not what you might expect. The man sitting opposite me in the  canteen – the unstarry interview location was his choice, being close to where he lives when he is in London – is the most influential British designer you have never heard of. With annual sales reported to be more than £1bn, Max Mara is that rare thing, a fashion-week label whose heart is in the real world. For six decades, Max Mara did not have a public-facing designer – a unique move in the gladiatoral arena that is Milan fashion week, where Donatella Versace, Giorgio Armani and Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana are all represented by personalities as well as brands. And then in February last year Griffiths cast Halima Aden in his catwalk show, making Max Mara’s the first Milan show to feature a headscarf-wearing model. Before the show, Griffiths told Luigi Maramotti, the chairman and owner, about the casting. “He said it was fine, but that he hoped it wouldn’t attract too much attention. Of course it did attract attention. But Mr Maramotti was delighted because that reaction was entirely positive.”But at heart, says Griffiths, “Max Mara has always been radical.” He is turned out like an Italian tailor’s fantasy of an Englishman, in a navy double-breasted suit by the tailor Timothy Everest, who has made all his suits to measure for more than two decades. (“Once you get a taste for bespoke, anything else is like wearing a cardboard box.”) The folds of the silk pocket square in his breast pocket and the side parting in his light brown hair both appear to have been drawn with a ruler and compass. He is the most dapper punk you will ever meet, but punk he still is, in his own way. “Max Mara was a very radical new idea when it began in the 1950s. It was about dressing women in order that they could go and be successful in the world – so not a conservative philosophy at all, quite the opposite. There is a great deal said about feminism in fashion at the moment, but Max Mara has been doing this in an under-the-radar way for 40 years.” Griffiths is proud that Max Mara was the first label to take a working woman, rather than a lady of leisure, as its aspirational icon.Griffiths pulls out his phone to show me a portrait taken of him by the renowned music photographer Kevin Cummins around the time he began studying fashion. In it, he is wearing a wedding veil. “That was a time of incredible self-made culture in that city. Ian Brown lived three doors away from our flat we’d see the name Stone Roses scrawled in the stairwell and I’d say to my flatmate, do you think they’re any good? Shall we go and see them? It was a moment when we were making everything up ourselves: our clothes, our music, our image.” As luck would have it, the legendary designer Ossie Clark had just begun teaching fashion when Griffiths arrived at Manchester Poly. “I learned an incredible amount. He got me to think about clothes in relation to the people who would wear them. Once he brought along a corset he was making for Jerry Hall.” He moved on to the Royal College of Art in London, and a part-time job at Browns on South Molton Street, where the celebrated Joan Burstein put him in the new Alaïa section, “because she thought women would trust a man’s opinion over a woman’s, on body conscious clothes”. It was Griffiths’ first encounter with designer fashion. “I was making all my own clothes out of lining material. I couldn’t believe people actually bought such expensive clothes.” All 60 students on his course submitted a project for Max Mara, “except I nearly didn’t, because I was living in a squat in Bloomsbury and, the night before hand-in, I was still working on it when my felt pen ran out at 2.30am. I thought, oh well, might as well give up and go to bed. And just then my flatmate Trish, who had been clubbing, came in from Taboo and lent me a pen.” Luigi Maramotti, the son of Achille, asked Griffiths to go to Italy for a meeting he joined directly after his graduation. But then, many of Max Mara’s Reggio Emilia workers “have been there all their lives. I have worked with my right-hand person for 28 years and that is quite normal for our company.”The secret to the eternal appeal of Italian fashion, says Griffiths, is that “it is primarily about making you look and feel beautiful. It’s not about being an experimental canvas for outrageous ideas. The best of Italian culture – in art, in food, as well as fashion – always attempts to present as something accessible.” Home is a first-floor apartment in a 15th-century building. “Our palazzo – listen to me! Our palazzo, in the middle of our street, ha, ha – is like something out of The Talented Mr Ripley. We are adjacent to the bishop’s palace, so I get an Easter card from the bishop.” When not working, Griffiths and his partner, Mark, ide their time between Islington and a cottage in Suffolk. “You wouldn’t recognise me if you saw me in the country. I’ll be up to my elbows in soil in the garden and Mark will say, ‘Can you please at least put your jumper on the right way round?’ But I am never not thinking about work. If I am walking the dogs, I will be listening to the show music, thinking about the collection.”Now, Griffiths’ personal profile is growing fast. “I didn’t go into fashion to be famous, so I don’t need for it to be ‘Max Mara by Ian Griffiths’ – I’m not that egotistical.” Nonetheless, he smiles when he says that “when I’d been with the brand 25 years, there was a feeling that I could be trusted. I felt that if the brand had a voice it could connect better with women. The collections we have shown since I was given a voice have been more emphatic. I can talk about things more clearly, now.” About making the catwalk a platform for ersity, he says, “I prefer the world ‘normalcy’. Because that’s what it is. If you walk down Bond Street it is completely normal to see a woman in a headscarf wearing a Max Mara coat, so it should be normal on the catwalk as well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ac4f958b3625eb590aa783d093da48105c41be4/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25b04c3bbc127fe6a37f39bdd3d5b1fb","title":"safe standing football government review all seat policy","story":"The government is poised to make its most significant shift towards allowing safe standing at football matches by commissioning a review of the policy which demands all-seat stadiums.The sports minister, Tracey Crouch, had previously been unmoved by calls to overturn the ban on standing which was introduced following the Hillsborough disaster and has been in place for more than 20 years. Crouch was criticised in some quarters for the government’s decision to reject an application by West Brom to introduce a safe standing section.But it is understood she feels advances in stadium design plus a swell of public enthusiasm for introducing safe standing mean it is time to review the policy.

The shadow sport minister, Rosena Allin-Khan, is set to announce Labour is backing a change to the law following a two month consultation with club representatives and fans’ groups.More than 100,000 people signed a petition calling for Premier League and Championship clubs to allow safe standing, meaning the issue will be discussed in parliament. It will be a welcome boost for campaigners who have presented expert opinion that safe standing will reduce, rather than increase, the danger to fans inside football stadiums.West Brom’s rejected pilot scheme proposed a proposed altering the design of their ground to accommodate 3,600 rail seats, which can be locked in an upright position and which some experts claim reduce the risk to fans falling over while celebrating a goal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/303d1ebf477979110bbd2f4bd14952285c7622a5/43_30_1893_1136/master/1893.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c126bfe091d01e28bd2b013056c068db","title":"sergio ramos salah karius champions league real madrid","story":"• Spain defender insists he was not to blame for injuries• ‘I didn’t want to speak because everything is magnified’Sergio Ramos has dismissed suggestions that he was to blame for the challenge that hurt Egypt star Mohamed Salah in the Champions League final.Salah left the field in tears after injuring his left shoulder in a tussle with Ramos with the score 0-0 in the first half of the final between Real Madrid and Liverpool in Kiev. Madrid went on to win the match 3-1 and their third straight European title, with Ramos also accused of deliberately elbowing Loris Karius – an incident that is believed to have caused the goalkeeper to suffer concussion.But the 32-year-old, who is preparing to play in his fourth World Cup finals with Spain, insisted that he has been unfairly castigated.“I am only missing Roberto Firmino saying he got a cold because a drop of my sweat landed on him,” he told Spanish newspaper AS.“Bloody hell, they have given this Salah thing a lot of attention. I didn’t want to speak because everything is magnified. I remember the play well: he grabs my arm first and I fell to the other side, the injury happened to the other arm and they said that I gave him a judo hold. After that the goalkeeper said I dazed him with a clash.”Ramos added: “I spoke with Salah through messages, he was quite good. He could have played on if he got an injection for the second-half, I have done it sometimes but when Ramos does something like this, it sticks a little bit more.“I don’t know if it is because you are at Madrid for so long and win for so long that people look at it a different way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/078673a524a8eca50c6e86402da77379e347bdc2/0_115_4471_2682/master/4471.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62890a4ac02ae2f0758eab15207dbc37","title":"shaktar donetsk midfielder fred joins manchester united","story":"Manchester United have confirmed they have agreed a deal with Shakhtar Donetsk to sign the Brazil midfielder Fred.

How was I supposed to decide what costume to wear on one of the most important days of my life?’I never wanted to be a princess in white. I wasn’t one of those little girls who dreams of her wedding day – I wasn’t a girl at all. I saw myself as grubby, an animal. I was happiest in overalls and didn’t mind when other people asked me if I was a boy or a girl. I liked being difficult to nail down.When I was young, there was no word for what I was – or what I was not. Even now, the words we have are incomplete. I struggle to describe myself. “Not a girl” is usually as far as I get. The closest our language has so far for a person like me is “non-binary,” meaning I exist outside the “masculine” and “feminine” gender norms. It means that, walking down the block, I will get called both “sir” and “ma’am” before I even cross the street – and neither will be right.When I met my first husband, I was in boys’ clothes. He said I looked like Ramona Quimby, the scruffy, mischievous girl from Beverly Cleary’s iconic children’s books. We rode our bikes everywhere through Portland, as though every day was summer vacation. But as the relationship progressed, I could tell that he needed me to be feminine. He craved it. If I ever looked or acted like a girl, it owned him, totally.Once, I put on a thrift store denim tube dress and went to visit him at the coffee shop where he worked. I was the only one there. He came around the counter and stood over me, too close. The look on his face – shock, total possession – frightened me. He crowded me into a corner and put his hands on the wall on either side of my head. I could smell his cigarette breath. The rough bricks were sandpaper against my naked back. He was a tall man, almost six and a half feet, with 40 pounds on me. In that skimpy shred of fabric, I felt very small. Like I couldn’t possibly get away.“You’re supposed to be working,” I said.“When you come in here, looking like that?” he growled. “What did you think was going to happen?”Our wedding was tiny – just us, our witnesses and the priest. His eyes followed me, taking in every detail. My milk-colored silk gown was heavy, but I still shivered, as though I was wearing nothing at all.I held his fingers while we promised to love and cherish one another forever, but I sensed it was not me he loved. It was the dress. And because I was not a woman, I could not fulfill the promises I made him. They weren’t my promises this wasn’t my part to play. I could only be the thing that I was. I was deeply closeted at the time, and it hurt to be seen as a bride. A woman. A wife. I held my husband’s hand and I ached. When I tried to repeat the vows, my eyes leaked. I wasn’t crying because I was moved. I cried because I was a fool, and I knew it, and because it hurt to pretend to be something I was not.The marriage lasted three crummy years, and then I left.I kept my wedding dress. It was gorgeous, a gift from my uncle Brian, not something to be parted with lightly. He made the bespoke Grace Kelly number with a full tea length, godet skirt with hand embroidered panels. For the first fitting, I stood in Brian’s sewing room in my underwear, fidgeting, while he measured me for the design.“You’ve got a bubble butt,” he teased, taking two extra hip measurements to accommodate it.He pinned the muslin pattern pieces around me, adjusting for fit. I tried to relax. I’d need space in this dress to bend, eat, breathe. Brian pinned the panels closer, adding pins where the muslin needed to follow the curves of my body. He knelt to check the pins around my hips. He marked a place over each knee, pinched the fabric, and tested its draping. The skirt would flare from here.He looked up at me and smiled. I remember his warning: “Don’t gain or lose too much weight, or I’ll have to redo everything,” he said. “The corset already has fourteen bones in it.”If I changed too much, he’d have to add or take away. One alteration would change the proportions of the entire dress, a month of minor, careful adjustments to preserve the integrity of the pattern and the durability of the garment. The entire process was thousands of hours of hand work. I nodded, promising.Do I need to say that I failed to stay the same? The small ways I changed, from my pronouns to my self-expression, transformed my life in colossal, unpredictable ways. Every tiny adjustment altered the pattern.As I got older, I learned more. The words we used to talk about queerness changed the people I dated were more accepting and open-minded. I liked dating men because I could borrow their clothes. As I settled into what I am, I changed my terms: I identified as a dyke, a tomboy. Underneath those secondhand plaids and Carhartt overalls, though, was somebody who was still wearing the wrong body.I started seeing Charlie five years after my first marriage ended. Our first coffee date, I was charmed by his intelligence, humor, and athletic good looks. He was traditional, yet deviant a lawyer with a wild streak, a community-minded, policy-loving geek. He wore thick glasses and, when he took them off, his eyes were a shade of hazel that made my knees wobble. I didn’t know if he’d see me again, but then there was another date, and another one, and then we were in a relationship and every day, it seemed, I fell more in love with him. We talked about everything: I knew he was progressive, liked queer women, and was attracted to my fluid self-expression. He was, he said, secure enough in his masculinity to enjoy whatever I was putting out there.When I told him I was trans, I could feel him absorbing each syllable as it left my mouth. He took my news, and my feelings about it, seriously.“I’m in a body that isn’t saying the right things. It’s not me,” I explained. “I feel like I’m wearing a rubber suit all the time and nobody can see me inside it.”“I see you,” he said. I knew he did. I felt it.He asked me if I was going to change my name, or my body, and I said I wasn’t ready to decide yet. I was going to take my time, and not try to sharpen the undefined parts of myself. I wanted to ease into myself – as though I had all the time in the world.Although I took my time with myself, I also took steps to own my queerness. I started coming out in public, writing about my identity, and making an effort to be more visible. In one viral video, I shared that I was non-binary trans. One of the commenters said that I may as well just tell people I am a seahorse.Seahorses: a species of role reversal. The males carry the fry, and the females drift through the plankton layer of the ocean, spawning when the mood takes them. The comment stung it meant that I was somehow unnatural. My gender was nonsense.Charlie proposed to me on a night in July, with a ring he’d designed himself. We were eating ice cream on a park bench, and he pulled out the small, navy box.The ring was a thick band of beaten platinum, set with dozens of diamonds in a pinprick design of a mountain range. I took it from him and slipped it on. Charlie smiled at me.“It’s perfect,” I said.“I wanted something that you didn’t have to take off to punch someone,” he joked. “Something tough and beautiful at the same time.”I leaned forward and kissed the vanilla ice cream off his lips. “It’s perfect,” I said again, because it was. Both delicate and weighty, it hugged my finger when I reached to touch Charlie’s face.I was excited to be married, but there were difficult steps to take first. Here was another wedding to plan, and another wedding dress. What does a seahorse wear to their wedding? I couldn’t even pick a pronoun. How was I supposed to decide what costume to wear on one of the most important days of my life?Was I going to be a wife again? Do you take this woman? If I came out, or changed my gender legally, could we even get a license?Eleven years after my first wedding, I’m getting ready for my second, and I still do not feel like a bride.When I searched for “queer wedding,” I found images of happy, nontraditional ceremonies: husbands hugging, wives kissing. Many of them were masculine-feminine couples. I also found femme couples in matching gowns, butch women in tuxedos. They looked happy. I saw photos of binary trans brides and grooms, beaming at the camera. After a while, these pictures blurred together. It is beautiful, sure, but it was more of the same: malefemale, masculinefeminine, and suitgown. I couldn’t envision myself in those roles. My sense of being the odd one out intensified.I asked Charlie if he was going to wear a suit to our wedding.“Maybe we should both wear suits,” I suggested. “Since, you know. Me.” I imagined us side by side, two tall, athletic blondes in matching tuxedos. Shook my head. We’d look like a pair of grooms, and I wasn’t eligible for that role, either.“Suits would be fine.”“When you close your eyes, and imagine your wedding, what do you see?” I asked.He closed his eyes. He was quiet.“I see a beautiful bubble of pure light,” he finally said.“You don’t see a white dress and a veil and stuff?”“I just see you,” he said, and kissed me. I stopped looking up “genderfluid wedding” and “transgender wedding” after that. I found an image of Grace Kelly, this time in a blue gown so tailored that she looked like an aerofoil. The gown in the picture was silk, with a chiffon skirt, one Kelly wore in “To Catch a Thief.” The sheath had two nearly invisible straps, and was swathed in transparent, sky blue gauze. A goddess, emerging from a cloud. The bodice was sculpted in folds and layers, making the gown look like a classical Grecian statue. That’s how I wanted to feel on my wedding day: powerful, calm, self-possessed, strong. I didn’t feel that way in a suit – or in a frilly, ultra femme dress. Maybe the answer was something architectural, for me. Something that wasn’t really human at all.My uncle generously offered to make this second wedding dress, too. He assured me that, the second time around, there are no rules. Wear red, he said. Wear a muumuu. Do whatever you want. He wouldn’t have time to sew a suit jacket, but we could discuss another couture design.“Your measurements haven’t changed since college,” my uncle said. “You’ve still got that butt.”He liked the photo of Grace, and immediately started explaining how many tucks he’d have to put across each shoulder seam to get the toga effect we wanted. The gauze would need to drape from the shoulder, and follow the line of the bodice. I hadn’t told him that I fantasized about top surgery and hormones that would make my upper body thicken. I didn’t share the worries I’d felt building since my engagement: my fear that I would be a bad wife again, that I was forcing myself into a role that simply didn’t fit, that I would disappoint my new husband like I had my last one.The sewing room, piled high with bolts of fabric, half-finished projects, and trim, was quiet. My uncle’s husband was singing in the kitchen, loading a pod into the coffee maker. I swallowed hard, my own voice suddenly stuck in my throat.“The design I showed you was very…feminine,” I finally said.He nodded. He’d found the perfect blue silk already, the color of a September afternoon.“We’ll need to make sure the bustier is in good shape before we put in the plastic boning or do anything else,” he said. “All those pin tucks. It’s like origami.”I could feel my hands starting to sweat. “The thing is,” I said.He looked at me.“The thing is, I’ve changed a lot since my first wedding. I think I’d be happier in an even simpler design,” I finally blurted out. I looked at his face carefully. What if I offended him? What if I came out and he didn’t understand?“Simpler,” he repeated. “In what way? I can’t make the construction simpler, or it won’t hang together.”“I mean, less girly. No frills. I want to look completely sleek. Elegant.”He nodded again, made a couple of notes beside the column of my measurements. “It will be obviously simple.”“Aerodynamic,” I said, and he looked at me and I could tell that he knew. I may as well have told him I wanted to dress up like a seahorse.“We can do that,” he said. And then he said the thing he always says to me, when he understands but loves me anyway: “The heart wants what the heart wants, right?”When I walk down the aisle this time, in front of every person who knows me, it will be as someone who lives in their body. Not a bride on a cake, but as myself, a person who is too complicated for the simple rituals that are the pattern of our lives.Claire Rudy Foster lives in Portland, Oregon.

It is potentially anachronistic when children are watching on-demand at any time of the day.”The news may disappoint Oliver, who made Jamie’s School Dinners for the channel in 2005, when he helped focus media attention on children’s diets by launching a war on Turkey twizzlers.“Jamie is obviously free to have his agenda,” said Allan. “We fund and commission loads of great shows about health and if we’ve got less money we can afford to put less shows like that out.”Channel 4 launched its annual report on Tuesday, the first under its new leadership team of Mahon and director of programmes Ian Katz, a former Newsnight boss and deputy editor of the . They have pledged to focus on attracting a younger audience with investments into E4 and online programming.The commercial broadcaster, which is ultimately publicly owned, said revenues fell from £995m to £960m in 2017, amid a weak advertising market. It is looking to move a substantial part of its operation outside London as part of a deal with the government to spend more money on programmes produced away from the capital.Channel 4 announced a deal with Vice to bring hundreds of hours of programming to its All 4 catchup service by the end of the year.

As the home of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, there was a steady stream of world-class classical music throughout, but it was also there when the BBC woke up to pop music in the 1960s. Thanks to the catholic tastes of John Peel, it has heard everything from doom metal to pure pop bouncing off its walls. Here are five of Maida Vale’s key moments.Like the kids skulking behind the bike sheds, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop was a unit apart from the sumptuous work poured out by the BBC Symphony Orchestra in Maida Vale’s main studios in the mid-20th century. The Workshop was home to experiments with electronic sound, made by manipulating tape and other improvised equipment. This led to everything from the terrifying, proto-techno throb of the sound effects for television drama Quatermass and the Pit to poppy TV themes. Somewhere in the middle of the two was their masterpiece: the Doctor Who theme, arranged by Delia Derbyshire, riding in on an electro bassline with a melody that felt wrought from the ether.From 1962 to 1965, the Beatles recorded 52 light entertainment programmes at the BBC, including shows from Maida Vale. The subsequent Live at the BBC collection of these recordings documents the band at a crucial stage: their chops polished by their night-after-night Hamburg residencies. They were still churning out raucous blues and rock’n’roll covers (Johnny B Goode, Lucille, I Got a Woman), but channelling their energy into a new kind of bright, pure guitar pop. The version of Twist \u0026amp Shout from Pop Go the Beatles! in September 1963 is brilliant: slightly slower, with an extra R\u0026ampB swagger that the Please Please Me album version lacks.Come the late 1960s and 70s and Maida Vale was playing host to the likes of David Bowie, Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix – but as punk raged in west London neighbours such as Ladbroke Grove, Maida Vale was still hosting classy light entertainment. Bing Crosby’s final ever recordings were made at the studios, three days before he died of a heart attack. Feels Good, Feels Right is therefore incredibly poignant, as Bing celebrates the sensual pleasures of food, friendship and song. The chief pleasure of the recording, perhaps, is the musicality of his speaking voice as he thanks presenter Alan Dell for all the network has done for him – a moment that will have you hand-delivering your licence fee.The mid-00s wrought one of Maida Vale’s most dubious innovations: the Live Lounge, a place where some of pop’s worst ever ideas were laid on tape. Perhaps inspired by a Maida Vale recording of the White Stripes doing a great take on Dusty Springfield’s I Just Don’t Know What To Do With Myself in 2003, which ended up on their classic album Elephant, the gimmick of the Radio 1 slot was to get bands and pop stars to do unlikely covers.

Lieutenant BF Pinkerton, a naval officer from the USS Lincoln, is posted in Nagasaki. While there, aided by Goro, an unscrupulous Japanese marriage broker, he lures the fatherless, impoverished 15-year-old Butterfly into a temporary union. Thinking she is legally married, Butterfly abandons her Buddhist faith for Christianity and is renounced by her family and friends. Despite his strong attraction to her, and the warnings of the local US consul Sharpless, Pinkerton then deserts Butterfly, but tells her he will return to take her back to America.Three years of waiting pass, during which time Butterfly secretly gives birth to his child with no one but her servant and companion Suzuki for support. When Pinkerton finally returns to Japan it is with his “real” American wife, Kate. On discovering the existence of his son they decide to take the child from Butterfly and back to America. Butterfly agrees to what she sees as a better life for her son and kills herself so he is not tormented in his adult years by his mother’s abandonment.How do we as a modern audience of the #MeToo era experience this musical masterpiece, written by a white European man about the sexual exploitation and death of an Asian woman? How do we reconcile our enjoyment of this opera while acknowledging that it is an iconic example of Orientalism by a composer who never set foot in Japan? And how do we honour a desire to be true to the realities of the story when the Japanese characters are so often performed by western singers, an issue in an industry that must now confront its notable lack of ersity? None of these issues can be solved by one production – but never has it been more important for a director to grant Madama Butterfly a clear-eyed examination of the unpalatable realities of its libretto.And what a libretto it is. Puccini went through five versions of the piece with his writers Giuseppe Giacosa and Luigi Illica until he achieved what we have today: a precise, ruthless exploration of how a near-powerless woman is bought and sold to a pleasure-seeking westerner. It is significant that Puccini, who could not speak English, first saw the play (by David Belasco) that inspired his libretto in London. The piece inflicts on Butterfly a patronising and infantilising cod-English dialogue that would be unacceptable on a modern stage and would have been alienating then. Puccini’s lack of English meant he could transcend the indignity of her speech to see the inherent humanity of Butterfly. As a result, he defended her from any accusation of collusion in her own misfortune by creating an original Act 1 to flesh out the deliberate detail of her deception. Consequently, in Pinkerton they created one of the most morally bankrupt characters in opera – so unpleasant that Puccini had to be persuaded to sympathetically expand the role or risk having tenors reject the part as too small and seedy to perform. He was determined that his audience should see the seduction and corruption of the innocent Butterfly as a conscious choice by Pinkerton. We hear that Butterfly is only 15 years old three times over, as she, Sharpless and Pinkerton drive the point home relentlessly. “The age of playthings,” Sharpless says. “And of sweetmeats,” replies Pinkerton shortly after toasting “the day on which I’ll wed in real marriage, a real wife from America”.Faced with such an unequivocal libretto, it is a directorial duty not to be squeamish about presenting the story of this opera. In order to make as vivid as possible the disparity in the power dynamic between Pinkerton and Butterfly, the production I have created for Glyndebourne is set in the early 1950s. In the aftermath of the second world war, the War Brides Act allowed American servicemen who married abroad to bring their foreign wives home, thus enabling Japanese women to go to America in large numbers. This meant lucrative business for marriage brokers such as our Goro, in whose bustling and obviously profitable office Act 1 is set. Butterfly’s wish to go to the US to start a new life with Pinkerton comes across particularly strongly when he is only one of many men who were facilitated by Japanese society to marry young local women. Some of these relationships had happy outcomes some not. Our protagonists are part of a bigger story that validates and reinforces Pinkerton’s unthinking, sometimes callous behaviour. We use original footage from 1950s newsreels showing Japanese women “learning to be an American wife” to illustrate how Butterfly might have been manipulated into imagining such a future. Watching these films and directing this story from the perspective of a privileged modern woman is sobering. It’s easy to be seduced into thinking of Madama Butterfly as a story from the past, a melodramatic opera that can be approached as a period piece. But this is a story that still manifests itself in many different reports in newspapers across the world today: the same pattern of western exploitation of vulnerable women can be seen in places such as Haiti.And yet the opera is filled with moments of glorious, uninhibitedly romantic music, and this ecstasy is as much an integral part of this production as the dark subject matter. The near-mythic status this piece has in the operatic canon is due to its amazing combination of brutality and beauty, and that is both its strength and its weakness. This musical allure must never dull the unpleasantness of the story – it must be remembered that the first audience who heard Madama Butterfly in La Scala in 1904 ridiculed the piece, and shouted obscenities at the character of Butterfly.Therefore, to wallow in his orchestral beauty and ignore the hard truth of the libretto that inspired it is to disrespect both Puccini and the many real, anonymous Butterflies past and present who haunt every bar of this savage masterpiece. Puccini’s opera joins the long list of works of art that after years of unquestioning admiration are now problematic in our more enlightened modern times. But to continue to grapple with the story of Madama Butterfly, much as Puccini did himself, is to honour the empathetic impulse that inspired its creation: the strange and wonderful connection between an Italian opera composer and his imaginary geisha."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59e7f520f069376c91e227b8f9fb3091e3ddffb4/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6df3e17e6cc2d992b636e617ce49f9c3","title":"a bright peafowl and a spacecraft blessing tuesdays best photos","story":"’s picture editors bring you a selection of photo highlights from around the world, including a Hawaiian eruption and a marathon swimmer in Japan"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/197c272678c7e93ec5886963bfa3cdfbf9b66a2e/212_414_4969_2981/master/4969.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d01b63ec3e91a04a4b201f791bf2375","title":"french open thiem zverev djokovic ecchinato tennis","story":"• Italian win in four sets and sets up semi with Dominic Thiem• Austria’s Thiem sees off No 2 seed Alex Zverev 6-4, 6-2, 6-1Marco Cecchinato, a man who has lived under the cloud of match-fixing allegations for two years, emerged into the sunshine here on Tuesday when he produced the best tennis of his career to put Novak Djokovic out of the French Open – and possibly out of Wimbledon.Djokovic, struggling with an injury to his serving shoulder, was devastated on court and clearly upset afterwards. “I don’t know if I’m going to play on grass,” he said. “I don’t know what I’m going to do. I cannot give you any answer. I’m just not thinking about tennis at the moment.”He looked shattered by the experience – but the day belonged to Cecchinato, an underdog from central casting.The Sicilian created mayhem, drama and history when he outlasted the once inexhaustible 12-slam champion 6-3, 7-6 (4), 1-6, 7-6 (11), in just-under-three-and-a-half hours to reach the semi-finals. There he will meet the world No 8 Dominic Thiem, who earlier saw off an injured Alexander Zverev in straight sets.Cecchinato in 2016 was convicted of match-fixing but had the ruling overturned on a technicality and here has embraced the experience like an ingenu – as he should, having lost all four of his grand slam matches. “Maybe I’m sleeping,” he said courtside. “He’s amazing. It’s unbelievable to beat Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals at Roland Garros. I don’t understand nothing. I was so tired but I won the match, and it’s amazing. For me it’s a first semi-final of a grand slam. Now I need some rest for recovery. I am very happy.”Djokovic, who memorably came from two sets down to beat a rampant Roger Federer in the 2011 US Open semi-finals, could not replicate those heroics against the world No 72.The Serb had his chances to force it to a fifth set, 4-1 up in the fourth, and three set-points in the tie-break – but two glaring errors cost him. He butchered a simple volley on a set point that sailed into the stands – provoking a desperate castigation of the crowd – then, on the third match point, he allowed Cecchinato’s fine but gettable shot down the line to sail to safety past his impotent racket. It was a curiously downbeat end to a passage of tennis to rank with any of recent times.In the first two hours Cecchinato was inspired and in the final half or so he returned to those levels against probably the greatest survivor in modern tennis. He had won only one five-setter in his life – coming from two sets down to beat the unseeded Romanian Marius Copil here in the first round – while Djokovic had won 29 of 37, and four times had recovered from 2-0 down.Zverev, meanwhile, leaves Paris weary but unbowed after his resistance finally cracked and with his friend Thiem is in the semi-finals for the third year in a row. The German, though, must first inspect a strained hamstring that neutered his movement and power from the third game onwards.“I definitely thought about it,” Zverev said when asked if he considered quitting. “But I didn’t want to pull out for the first time of my career in a grand slam quarter-final. I could barely move. I couldn’t serve. I couldn’t really do anything.”It was Zverev’s twin misfortune to find the Austrian strong and in near-perfect touch on a day when his own body finally gave up on him after dragging himself into the quarter-finals through three five-setters, two of which he had to win from two-sets-to-one down. Time finally ran out for him on a cool and cloudy afternoon, Thiem wrapping it up in an hour and 50 minutes, 6-4 6-2, 6-1.Nobody in the modern era has won four five-set matches in a row – and Zverev did well to get this far, but when he got injured in the first set, his mission against the world No 8, the only player to have beaten Rafael Nadal on clay in the past couple of seasons, moved from monumental to near impossible.As the scoreline suggests, Zverev weakened from that point, although his resolve remained intact. Serving at 40-15 in the third game of the first set, he pulled up clutching the thigh. Thereafter, it was not a proper contest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82623400a3d5669413ecc1ca88b307cd1571f61b/11_139_4868_2920/master/4868.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7555b4fffbe9c6e1f7c7d453c0ca74ee","title":"joe launchbury england fitness south africa test","story":"• Wasps captain sustains calf injury in training• Nick Isiekwe would likely replace lock in starting XVJoe Launchbury is a doubt to start England’s opening Test against South Africa in Johannesburg due to a calf problem.The Wasps captain sustained the injury in training last week and was unable to join the squad for their first significant practice session of the week at Kings Park Stadium in Durban yesterdayon Tuesday.He was poised to start the Ellis Park showdown on Saturday alongside Maro Itoje at lock but now faces a battle to prove his fitness in time.England can ill-afford to lose a veteran of 52 caps who has been in strong form for Wasps when they seek to dispatch the Springboks at a venue Eddie Jones has described as the “spiritual home of rugby”.They departed for South Africa without injured locks Courtney Lawes and Charlie Ewels, leaving them stretched in a position that has been a traditional source of strength.Launchbury’s absence would see 20-year-old Nick Isiekwe partner his Saracens colleague Itoje to make only his third Test appearance and uncapped Exeter lock Jonny Hill drafted on to the bench.A left-field selection would be Brad Shields making his England debut in the second row having joined up with the squad for the first time on Sunday.Sam Simmonds missed the start of Tuesday’s training session due to tightness arising from the flight over before eventually joining his team-mates.Among the outstanding issues in team selection is the battle between tighthead props Harry Williams and Kyle Sinckler in the absence of Dan Cole, who has been rested for the tour.“This is exactly what we want – two young tightheads fighting for that spot,” Hatley said. “Both of them are fairly explosive blokes. They’re good scrummagers. You saw the job Kyle did against France, maybe his point of difference is his ball carrying.“He’s done well carrying the ball against France and Ireland.

Now he hopes the grey can go one place better in the St James’s Palace Stakes in a fortnight’s time.“I think Matt thinks it was a bit of a fluke,” Teal continued, “but I never went into the Guineas thinking we should be a big outsider. Hopefully we can prove a point at Ascot.”Chapman suggested on ATR on Sunday that Tip Two Win’s Newmarket effort could have been “a flash in the pan” and added: “Until that horse runs again there’s gonna be a lot of people thinking, is it real or not?” The colt is third in the betting for the Ascot race at 13-2, suggesting plenty of punters have similar concerns.“I have full belief in Roger Teal but I just want a bit more proof about Tip Two Win,” was the response from Chapman on Tuesday. He added that he would be delighted to see a smaller yard succeeding on such a big stage. “To be smirk-wiped by Teal is something I would love. Obviously, if he really did come after me, he could squash me very easily.”Teal was delighted to see the Guineas form work out so well in Saturday’s Derby, won by Masar, who had been a head behind Tip Two Win at Newmarket. Two other horses from the Guineas’ first five went on to finish in the first four in the Derby, underlining the quality of the Newmarket race.Rather than go to Epsom to watch the Derby, Teal took Tip Two Win for a rare spin up a grass gallop on Saturday and was encouraged by what he saw from the three-year-old, who was freshened up in the weeks after his last race. “We don’t get much chance to go on the grass while it’s too firm but we’d had that bit of rain. He did a nice stretch along there. We were really pleased with him.“He’s come out of it well. We gave him a bit of an easy time after, because he would have had a hard race. We wanted to prep him right for Royal Ascot, so hopefully we’ve done the right thing.“He seems to be grand. He had a lovely stretch this morning we were delighted with him. He seems to be just starting to blossom. I’m thrilled with him.”It could be argued that the Ascot race, featuring a 90 degree turn before the home straight, will suit Tip Two Win rather better than Newmarket’s straight mile. In his previous outing, landing a valuable prize in Qatar, Tip Two Win moved from midfield to the lead in a matter of strides from the final turn, showing impressive acceleration.“My horse has got a tremendous kick,” Teal said. “As long as we have a safe trip I’m sure he should kick off that bend. So we’re looking forward to it.”Then, acknowledging his nerves about another attempt on a Group One prize, he added: “Well, we are and we aren’t. If the sun shines, we’ll be delighted because he’s best on a sounder surface, that’s for sure.“"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/008638118fad8147c0960b7c1303d3ec7658c026/0_300_3662_2198/master/3662.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bb5f22ec2db63608645775cba63e5bd","title":"test cricket mark lathwell dom bess","story":"Some shots linger, so that years later you can still see their shape, hear their sound, when about everything else has faded. Mark Lathwell hit a lot of those in his early years. There’s one in particular his old team-mate Neil Burns can still see, from the summer of 1992. A pull off Courtney Walsh that “disappeared like a tracer bullet at head height through midwicket and blasted into the boundary boards”. Walsh laid waste to the counties in ’92 seven for 27, six for 42, six for 21, six for 33, seven for 38. But one morning in Taunton he was mastered by Lathwell, a 20-year-old kid in his first full season.Anyone who was around English cricket in the 1990s knows the bones of Lathwell’s story. What’s forgotten now, is just how good he was in those early seasons. “The wider cricket world was denied the chance to see what I, and several others, witnessed first-hand,” Burns wrote 20 years later. “He was touched by genius, and in the first half of 1993, he displayed it virtually every time he batted.” Back then, Marcus Trescothick was only the second best young batsman at the club. Lathwell had a talent, Trescothick wrote, “that sometimes left you speechless”.It wasn’t just the runs, but the way he made them. Burns remembers another game against Glamorgan, when Steve Watkin was tearing in. Lathwell made 70 out of 75 for three. At lunch Viv Richards said he’d pick him for Test cricket tomorrow. A month later, England did. But Test cricket wasn’t Lathwell’s game. Mike Atherton recalled how, in that first match, he told Lathwell: “Good luck, the crowd are rooting for you”, and Lathwell said back: “They won’t be in a minute when I’m on my way back.” Alec Stewart reckoned Lathwell “was the one England player of my era who I believe just didn’t want to be there”.Lathwell played two Tests against Australia, 25 years ago this summer, and was never picked again. Earlier that same year, in April, the  sent David Foot along to Taunton to interview him. “Publicity bothers me, I simply can’t see why anyone should be interested,” Lathwell told Foot. “I’m not by nature outgoing. If I don’t know someone, I’m apt to go into the corner.” Stewart remembered that Lathwell “barely said a word” when he was with England, “despite all our efforts to involve him in conversations, we couldn’t drag anything out of him”.Burns always felt Lathwell would rather be “in his local, playing darts and chewing the fat”. And that was where Lathwell fetched up when he unexpectedly quit Somerset in 2001, after a year in which he’d scored eight fifties and two hundreds for the club. Back home, batting for Braunton in the Devon League. Which brings us round about to Devon’s latest Test cricketer, Dom Bess. Braunton is on the far coast from Sidmouth, where Bess played a lot of his club cricket, but the Besses and the Lathwells are two of the county’s cricket families, and their stories are intertwined.Dom’s three cousins still play for Sidmouth, Lathwell’s two sons have done for Bideford and Braunton. One of them came through the county’s under-13 team the season after Dom had moved on up a year. There’s a lot of “Lathwell b Bess” and “Bess c Lathwell” entries in the league’s scorebooks, and both names are engraved on the cup given each year to the county’s best young cricketer, though the dates are a generation apart. The real reason they are a pair, though, is that despite their living so close together, they seem so very far apart. Bess took to Test cricket like a fish to water, Lathwell like a fish to the bank.It seems unlikely that in 20 years’ time any of Dom Bess’s team-mates will be waxing about how breathtaking his talent was, will be talking about his deliveries the way Lathwell’s do his strokes. Even those who know him are unsure he’s got all the skills he will need to hold down his place in the Test team. But what he does have, everyone agrees, is the appetite for it. “The one thing we knew we were going to get from Dom was that character,” said Joe Root on Sunday. “He was padded up for 45 minutes on Saturday night, desperate to get out there as nightwatchman. That’s the sort of player he is.”Bess took up spin-bowling because, he says, he was a “porky” kid who didn’t want to run in for more than five or six strides. His approach to the game changed when he met Darren Veness, who was strength and conditioning coach at Somerset, and now works for Surrey. Veness says he taught him that “whilst talent is respected, it comes behind hard work and discipline”. He remembers Bess as a “very adept and understanding learner”, “not shy of graft, someone who is always looking for the angles, looking for the opportunities, looking for the ways to get ahead”.Bess seemed to relish every second of his two Tests against Pakistan. Which speaks to the differences between this England dressing room and the one Lathwell walked into back in 1993, yes, but also the contrasting characters of the two men, one so introverted, the other so extroverted. Cricket is a sport for all sorts, but the bright lights, the big stage, of the Test game aren’t for everyone. And like Veness says, talent only takes a player so far. Everyone who saw Lathwell play was left with a lot of regrets. Bess, you guess, is not going to have so many of those, whatever happens next."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/027127e6fe1d7d15f008d4a78508b7f19b8ca86d/231_181_3932_2359/master/3932.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb054f544fcf60458205f81a3a502e18","title":"french open 2018 day 10 live thiem zverev djokovic stephens keys","story":"Marco Cecchinato produced a performance for the ages to knock out Novak Djokovic, while Dominic Thiem, Madison Keys and Sloane Stephens made the semi-finalsAnd with that, I’m off.

Bye!Djokovic, meanwhile, is - and this isn’t really news, but still - not just a great champion but an impeccable sportsman. He lost with great grace and dignity.Cecchinato will play Dominic Thiem in the semi-final. Thiem had a straightforward match earlier today against an injured Alex Zverev and is surely not as tired as the Italian admits he currently is. Logic suggests that this is the year for Thiem to progress past the semi-finals here, and Cecchinato will have to fully recover both physically andalso mentally from the shock of beating Djokovic here.I’m quite emotional about that myself. The first two sets, and the second half of the fourth ... that was just beautiful sport.One of Cecchinato’s guys - I’ve no idea who they are - is in asolute pieces up in the players’ box. He’s sobbing like an infant. The player, meanwhile, has a quick on-court chat:Maybe I’m sleeping. It’s amazing. It’s unbelievable for me. For me, to beat Djokovic in a quarter-final at Roland Garros it’s unbelievable. It’s amazing.I play unbelievable match. I start very well on my serve. I don’t understand anything.I am so tired. For me, it’s the first time semi-final Grand Slam, so I play one day yes and one day no. Now I need to think for the semi-final and I need some rest for recovery. I am very happy.He’s done it! His backhand return down the line is high, it flies out of Djokovic’s reach, and it drops just inside the line!Another unforced error from Djokovic, who hits a forehand just wide. Cecchinato has a fourth match point.The first serve hits the net, and the second serve is too safe. Djokovic thunders it back at his ankles, and there’s no way back from there. 11-11.He’s always in control of the next point, too - but his forehand clips the top of the net and bounces backwards! It’s another match point, and this one on Cecchinato’s serve!Djokovic serves, and is always in control of the point. It’s 10-10.Cecchinato’s forehand wrongfoots Djokovic and bounces away. A second match point!This time he hits a brilliant return, Cecchinato can barely get the ball back into play, Djokovic runs forward to kill the point and take the set and ... skews it miles wide! He screams, apparently because someone in the crowd made a noise too soon. 9-9!A brilliant forehand lands deep in the corner of the court. Djokovic has a third set point.One thing Cecchinato does particularly brilliantly is, when he forces a limp shot, waiting until the last possible moment before deciding which way to hit it. Djokovic doesn’t know which way to run, so stays precisely where he is, and Cecchinato runs forward and volleys into the empty court. 8-8.Djokovic hits a backhand so low and flat that Cecchinato can’t dig it out. 8-7, set point!A rare humrum point. Djokovic, under little pressure, sends a backhand way long. 7-7.Cecchinato hits a drop shot, and it looks for all the world like a winner. Djokovic, though, reaches it, and the backhand across court that follows it. He pumps his arms and screams. Set point!Djokovic saves it! It was another fabulous rally, which ends with the Serb coming to the net to finish it off and Cecchinato, at full stretch, hitting a forehand down the line that would have beaten most players. Not Djokovic, though: his lunging backhand volley sends the ball gently crosscourt for a winner!Cecchinato hits a backhand so brilliant that it’s a wonder Djokovic can do anything other than stand and applaud. He does much, much more than that, though. Somehow he reaches it, and implausibly he gets it back in play! The rally continues, and Cecchinato has to hit winner after winner before Djokovic finally fails to return one. And with that, he’s 6-5 up. Match point!This is rock’n’roll. This time Cecchinato’s forehand clips the back of the line, and Djokovic can’t do anything with it. 5-4.I’m not sure why the crowd is so heavily rooting for the guy who’s won everything against the hyper-entertaining go-for-broke mystery upstart, but they very much are.Djokovic comes to the net but leaves the ball, which drops a hair’s width wide! That makes in 3-2, and then Cecchinato tries a backhand down the line which lands 2cm wide on the other side! An inch or two the other way on both occasions and he was 5-1 up. Instead, it’s 3-3.Cecchinato wins the first three points! The way this match has swung in the last 15 minutes has been remarkable. There’s still at least one swing left in it, I reckon.Cecchinato holds to 15, and we have ourselves a fourth set tie break. The rain, meanwhile, has taken itself elsewhere.Here’s the Press Association on Madison Keys, who is trying to be nice, and also good:Madison Keys vowed to carry on smiling after moving closer to a maiden grand slam title. The happy-go-lucky American is through to the French Open semi-finals for the first time after a straight-sets win over Yulia Putintseva.She said: “I have actually been told quite often that I’ll never win or do well because I’m too nice a person and I just don’t have it. I think that’s a load of crap, but, you know, it’s just me. “I don’t think you have to be mean in order to win matches. I think there’s a difference between being intense and wanting it and fighting and just not being nice, so that’s something that I have always stayed true to. “I’m not ever going to try to be a person that isn’t nice, so that feels more authentic to me and, you know, I think I’m still doing OK. Well, trying to be as nice as possible.” Djokovic settles himself and serves it out, winning the game with a backhand that lands an inch inside the baseline. A fine rally ends with Cecchinato sending a backhand into the net. Deuce.At 30-30 Djokovic misses his first serve. Big moment. He gets his second serve in safely and the players trade groundstrokes for a while, but then he sends a backhand down the line and just wide! Break point.Cecchinato streaks to a 40-0 lead, survives a mini-wobble and holds to 30, finishing the game with a power volley into an empty court. It’s 5-5 in the fourth set, and it’s alive once more!Cecchinato breaks back! Two unforced errors from Djokovic, two clean winners from the Italian, and this fourth set is up for grabs again!Cecchinato holds to 15. Tactically it’s probably a decent idea for Djokovic to lose that game quickly. With rain threatening to end the day with the match incomplete, he could do with finishing the set as swiftly as possible and trying to get a break up in the next before Cecchinato has a chance to rest.Djokovic, meanwhile, strolls to another hold, and Cecchinato will serve to stay in the set.Cecchinato finally holds, clinching the game with an ace. He trails 2-4 in the fourth set, and is clearly knackeredintimidatedscaredconfused.Cecchinato is desperately searching for his mojo. He tries another drop shot, which barely reaches his side of the net, and Djokovic has another break point.They haven’t stopped playing, and Cecchinato is battling to keep his serve. At game point he played a fine drop shot, only for Djokovic to reach it, and for his reply to clip the net cord, roll along it briefly and plop over the other side.At 30-30 on Djokovic’s serve, rain starts to fall. He wins the next two points to go 4-1 up in the fourth set, but really Cecchinato could do with a downpour, as he seeks to rediscover the verve he was playing with a while back.Finally Cecchinato wins a game, and pretty easily too. He’s 1-3 down in the fourth set, but the intensity of the first couple of sets remains distant. Cecchinato tries a forehand drop shot, which worked so well for him in the opening two sets. This time Djokovic anticipates it, chases it down and sends the ball back across court for a winner. It’s one small nick from an increasingly savagely slashing blade Djokovic breaks again and leads 2-0 in the fourth.Now Cecchinato is arguing with the umpire about a close call. The umpire agrees with the line judge that it was out. Apparently the code violation was for leaving the court without permission.Djokovic comes out and holds to love. These now a crucial moments for Cecchinato, who surely can’t allow this set to slip away as he did the last.At the changeovers Cecchinato engages in an animated discussion with Wayne McEwen, one of the officials, at the end of which he is given a code violation warning and docked a point. It is unclear what caused this, but the Italian needs to focus and fast, and this surely can’t be helping.And then Cecchinato is broken to love. Djokovic wins the third set, which was a complete non-event, 6-1. Djokovic holds to 15, with Cecchinato apparently having given up the set.And he follows it with another break. He’s up two breaks and 4-1 in the third set, and Cecchinato needs to climb his way out of what is only a minor dip."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/874adb551387c334b919f9f3be806758a99db02b/118_233_1693_1016/master/1693.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b7ecd51940a724452428a9f87452c91","title":"please please remain bernard henri levy performs one man brexit play","story":"French showman-philosopher begs London audience to save the European project It was, said audience member Anne von Bennigsen afterwards, “really very French. Fascinating, but just not very ... practical. Nothing particularly concrete. Still, he’s a French intellectual, I suppose. And that’s how he came across.”Poking fun at Bernard-Henri Lévy may be a national sport in France, but a bemused audience of nearly 1,000 packed Cadogan Hall in London on Monday to hear the 69-year-old philosopher plead with Britain to remain in Europe, in English.BHL, as he is almost always known, has been a fixture on France’s TV screens for decades, the flamboyance of his intellect matched only by the unshakability of his self-confidence and the whiteness of his carefully unbuttoned shirts.His one-man play Last Exit Before Brexit has been updated, adapted and translated from an earlier work, Hôtel Europe (which premiered in Sarajevo in 2014), to take account of Britain’s decision to leave the EU. It left many unfamiliar with the showman-philosopher somewhat nonplussed.“He’s a caricature of the French intellectual,” said another audience member. “Fantastic to see somebody take themselves so seriously,” said his colleague. “Nobody in this country would ever do that.” But for all its complex, lofty and undeniably Gallic bent, the play – a two-hour stream-of-consciousness monologue by a writer struggling in his hotel room to pen a Brexit conference speech about the tattered but still indispensable European dream – contained plenty of red meat.“It’s a fact,” Lévy declared from the stage, calling John Locke, Adam Smith, John Maynard Keynes and Karl Popper as his witnesses. “Without Europe, Great Britain will become Little England, and without Great Britain, Europe will crumble.”For if Europe’s economy is German and its politics French, he said, its ideology is fundamentally British: “European liberalism is an English idea you cannot truly be a liberal without admitting that the software of Europe is English.” Under attack from within by “mediocrity, bitterness and cowardice”, the European ideal risks “knockout” from Brexit, he said: the “inventors of modern democracy” have somehow confused “the people with the mob, the hatchet of the referendum with the wisdom of the agora, a national rebirth with a plunge into the void.”If Brexit is ever completed, it will be “a win for the hard right over the soft right, and for the radical left over the liberal left,” he lamented. “The revenge of fusty Britain over open Britain. The triumph of ignorance over knowledge, of the mindless over the mindful, of pettiness over greatness.” Among Great Britons now being “shrunk” by Brexit, which he called “not a return to the high seas but a pathetic retreat to a sandcastle”, he named Nelson, Stevenson, Byron, Hillary, Shackleton, Florence Nightingale, Lawrence of Arabia, Orwell, Bowie, James Bond, Stephen Hawking and Monty Python – as well as “Alexander Fleming, who saved half humanity, and Paul McCartney, who charmed the other half.” As for Europe, its salvation must lie in “the return of courage, and the powerful chemistry of dreams” – and in a new European commission, headed by Robert Schuman and with John Locke at human rights, Diderot in education, Goethe at culture, Rosa Luxemburg in defence, Pussy Riot at women’s rights, Isaac Newton at research and Bob Geldof running charitable causes.“Please, please remain,” he concluded. “The long march begins tonight. Last exit before Brexit!” It was all a bit much for some, but Bogdan Wolf, a Polish-born psychoanalyst in Britain for 40 years who described Brexit as “an absolute disaster ... part of a fascist resurrection”, was delighted. “What came out of it for me was precisely the idea of the idea,” he said. “Europe is not about pragmatism, negotiations, deals. It’s an idea of how to speak to one another, while disagreeing with one another. That’s why it matters.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f4266f9aebe3d4b3148f66567d036bce95c0376/0_270_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bf03180feb160cafe0640621b6ad5be","title":"the biograph girl review finborough london","story":"Finborough, LondonDavid Heneker and Warner Brown’s musical captures the heady excitement of the burgeoning movie businessPre-talkies Hollywood constantly seduces musical-makers. This forgotten 1980 British show, with a score by David Heneker and a book by Warner Brown, is infinitely superior to Jerry Herman’s more celebrated Mack and Mabel (1974). Where that focuses on the doomed love story of Mack Sennett and Mabel Normand, this piece captures the heady excitement of the burgeoning movie business from 1912 to 1927. Heneker and Brown focus on the shifting fortunes of key players. The title itself refers to Mary Pickford, who grows from a ringleted moppet, ashamed to be working in “flickers”, into the world’s sweetheart and co-founder of United Artists. As her star rises, that of DW Griffith, the pioneer visionary of the silent screen who made The Birth of a Nation and Intolerance, gradually wanes with the public losing its taste for portentous epics. Meanwhile “the perennial poem that is Lillian Gish” – as I once heard the critic Paul Dehn describe Griffith’s favourite actor and most loyal supporter – somehow survives the radical changes overtaking the world of film. The show is not always factually reliable: Griffith did not totally disappear with the coming of talkies, and his 1930 film Abraham Lincoln has its admirers. But the musical conveys the buoyancy of the movie business through songs that confirm Heneker (Half a Sixpence) was an experienced tunesmith: Workin’ in Flickers shows Pickford at her breeziest, The Industry makes good use of Latin-American rhythms, and Rivers of Blood, cut from the 1980 production, reminds us of the protests about the racist content of Griffith’s portrait of the American nation. Jenny Eastop’s production, with Harry Haden-Brown on piano, makes excellent use of the Finborough’s intimacy: it’s a rare pleasure to go to a musical and be able to hear every word. The piece is also vivaciously performed. Emily Langham personifies Lillian Gish’s mix of purity and intensity, Sophie Linder-Lee conveys the cool calculation behind Pickford’s childlike persona, Jonathan Leinmuller is all magisterial solitude as Griffith, and Matthew Cavendish carries off a Mack Sennett routine with physical precision. The show itself may not be the whole truth about Hollywood, but this revival deserves a longer life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90e888f312244cd737dc5ed63ec26a8d3f3b5edf/256_0_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7fd19dc0c5a7f10e472fa3bbddf8b3e","title":"love island oxbridge university applications misleading statistic twitter","story":"Comparing elite university applications with those for the ITV show is just misleadingHow does the number of people applying to be on Love Island compare with that of people applying for Britain’s elite universities, and what does the comparison tell us about the state of the nation? Well, quite a lot, if you listen to some Twitter pundits aghast at the widely shared statistic that far more of the country’s young people wanted to be on a reality TV show than get into Oxford or Cambridge.But are the numbers all they seem?Aside from attempting to compare very different things, the figures don’t actually show what some of the tweets seem to be aiming to prove: that young people lack ambition, or that it is some kind of national shame for people to take a TV show more seriously than academia. Let’s take a closer look at the figures. Tweets have claimed that as many as 150,000 people applied to be on the Bafta-winning ITV show, but that’s not an official figure provided by the broadcaster.The show’s production team has confirmed only that “over 85,000” applications have been made to be on this year’s series so far.By contrast, rather than needing the required grades in three A-levels or equivalents, the application process for Love Island – and you can still put yourself up for it here – involves uploading a brief video of yourself outlining “why you think you would make a great islander”. You also need to supply the casting company with a headshot, a full-length photo, and up to three optional photos (no filters allowed).And who is eligible to apply for Love Island? Far more than those for Oxbridge.The rules state only that you have to be over 18 to apply. However, the show has only twice featured a contestant over 30.The Office for National Statistics estimates that in 2016, there were 11.2 million UK residents aged 18-30. There are slightly more men (5.7 million) than women (5.5 million).So the numbers actually suggest that a higher percentage of those with a chance of getting into Oxbridge attempt it than those with a chance to get on Love Island.And there’s another thing to take into account. The comparison only works if you limit the university application figures to Oxford and Cambridge. According to Ucas, 527,670 people based in the UK applied to go to university in 2017 – that’s six times more than the number who applied to be on ITV every night for two months.Plenty of people on social media have treated the misleading comparison with the disdain it deserves.And there were lots of social media posts from students in England asking how they were expected to revise for GCSE exams when Love Island was on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a06470cb6e97ebea2b767c0208e919b1bbbe230e/0_59_4571_2744/master/4571.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4ac617d75d7b82ab6095ffa3dcab308","title":"miss america swimsuit contest no longer judge appearances feminism","story":"The pageant is attempting a feminist makeover in the wake of #MeToo and will be scrapping the swimsuit contestMiss America, the annual televised pageant, has announced that it will be scrapping the swimsuit portion from this year’s event. Instead of rating contestants on how they look in a bikini, judges will now rank the women on “who you are as a person from the inside of your soul”.The 97-year-old competition is also discarding its evening gown section and asking contestants to wear clothes that make them feel confident. The chair of Miss America, Gretchen Carlson, a former pageant winner and Fox News anchor, ulged these changes on Tuesday. Speaking to Good Morning America, Carlson said: “We’ve heard from a lot of young women who say, ‘We’d love to be a part of your program but we don’t want to be out there in high heels and a swimsuit.’ So guess what, you don’t have to do that anymore.” On Tuesday morning, the official twitter account of Cara Mund, Miss America 2018, further underlined these changes by posting a video of a disappearing bikini. “We’re changing out of our swimsuits and into a whole new era #byebyebikini.”Carlson was appointed chair of Miss America earlier this year after former members of the top management resigned. Leaked emails had shown pageant officials disparaging past winners for their appearance, intellect and sex lives. Miss America now has an all-female leadership team.Discussing the new changes Miss America is instituting, Carlson acknowledged the organisation was responding to the #MeToo movement. “We’re experiencing a cultural revolution in our country with women finding the courage to stand up and have their voices heard on many issues,” she said. “Miss America is proud to evolve as an organization and join this empowerment movement.” No word yet on how a competition where women compete against each other for a sparkly crown plans to encourage empowerment.Carlson herself has been a prominent voice in the #MeToo movement. In July 2016, she sued former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes for sexual harassment Ailes resigned shortly after.Miss America isn’t the only institution to have recently updated itself in the wake of #MeToo. In January, Formula One said it was ending the use of “grid girls”, the scantily-clad female models who are sprayed with champagne by winning drivers. “While the practice of employing grid girls has been a staple of Formula One grands prix for decades, we feel this custom does not resonate with our brand values and clearly is at odds with modern-day societal norms,” said Sean Bratches, Formula One’s managing director of commercial operations. The 2019 Miss America Competition airs live and without bikinis on ABC on 9 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b76f474b42055c7e92c3a97d4a5a3174c716d64c/0_116_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b87607e5657b5427d05ea56273634245","title":"iran to launch plan to boost uranium enrichment","story":"Move piles pressure on European states scrambling to salvage nuclear dealIran has launched a plan to increase its uranium enrichment capacity with new centrifuges, raising the pressure on European diplomats scrambling to rescue the crumbling nuclear deal after the US pulled out.The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed it had received a letter from Iran, which Salehi said was submitted on Monday and outlined Tehran’s plans. Under the 2015 nuclear agreement that Iran signed with world powers, it has the right to build and test certain centrifuges, although detailed restrictions exist for the first 10 years on the types and quantities of the machines.European governments have been trying to salvage the nuclear deal since the US announced its withdrawal and said it would reimpose sanctions on foreign companies working in the Islamic republic by November.The remaining parties – Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia – have vowed to stay in the accord, but many of their companies have started to wind down Iranian operations.The EU said a first assessment indicated the new steps announced by Iran did not constitute a violation of the agreement.“However, at this particularly critical juncture, they will not contribute to build confidence in the nature of the Iranian nuclear programme,” Maja Kocijančič, the spokeswoman for the EU’s diplomatic chief, Federica Mogherini, said. On Monday, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned the Europeans that “Iran will never tolerate both suffering from sanctions and nuclear restrictions” and called for preparations to speed up uranium enrichment.Iran insists its nuclear programme is for civilian uses only, but opponents in the US, Israel and Saudi Arabia accuse it of seeking to build an atomic bomb. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, reacted swiftly to Salehi’s announcement, declaring that the Islamic republic’s aim was “unlimited enrichment of uranium to create an arsenal of nuclear bombs” to destroy his country.On Sunday, Khamenei repeated the longstanding view from Iran that Israel “is a malignant cancerous tumour in the west Asian region that has to be removed and eradicated”. Iran was seeing limited economic benefits from the deal even before the US withdrawal, thanks to the reluctance of international banks to facilitate trade and a raft of non-nuclear US sanctions that were not touched by the agreement.European governments have been scrambling to protect their businesses from renewed US sanctions in order to keep Iran in the deal. But several large firms have said it will be impossible to continue operating in Iran except in the unlikely scenario that they win bulletproof exemptions from Washington.The French car maker PSA, which produces the Peugeot and Citroën brands, on Monday became the latest to announce plans to pull out of Iran, where it sold nearly 445,000 cars last year.Total, the French energy company, is also preparing its departure from a $4.8bn (£3.6bn) gas project in Iran, with its chief executive saying last week that the chances of a US exemption were “very slim”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d01a96048ff34d58383f6963e8f79124680664b9/0_0_3128_1877/master/3128.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3025e1812d14b89522a50efef1f03d45","title":"putin pushes for end to harmful sanctions during austria visit","story":"Russian leader evaded MH17 questions during first visit to an EU country since re-electionVladimir Putin lobbied for the phasing out of economic sanctions and dodged questions about the shooting down of flight MH17 during his first state visit to an EU member state since being re-elected as Russian president in March.“Both those who initiate these actions and those such measures that we call sanctions are aimed against find them harmful,” Putin said in Vienna on Tuesday, claiming that European countries were merely “finding it hard to say so”.The Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said diplomatic progress in eastern Ukraine, followed by a “gradual easing of sanctions”, imposed after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, was “the scenario we are wishing for”.Notionally scheduled to commemorate 50 years since Austria became the first western European country to sign a natural gas deal with the Soviet Union, the visit also offered the Russian and Austrian leaders opportunities to advance their respective geopolitical agendas, with a youthful Kurz, 32, pushing his credentials as a bridge builder between east and west.The trip has come a month before Austria takes over the rotating EU presidency in July, and a week before Russian, Ukrainian, German and French foreign ministers are due to meet in Berlin on 11 June to discuss the conflict in eastern Ukraine.On the eve of the visit – during which the Russian president was protected by 800 soldiers, 800 police officers and 17 military vehicles – Putin had to face much tougher questions in an interview with the Austrian television journalist Armin Wolf, an encounter that turned out to be the toughest grilling the Russian president has faced for some years. Sit-down interviews with Putin are rare and usually conducted by loyal journalists. Wolf, however, repeatedly interrupted Putin when he gave evasive or misleading answers.In a particularly heated exchange on the annexation of Crimea and the shooting down of MH17 over eastern Ukraine, an irate Putin snapped: “If you do not like my answers, then do not ask me questions” and accused Wolf of engaging in “a monologue rather than an interview”.“The tragedy we are talking about is terrible, and I feel immensely sorry for the victims and their families, but this investigation must be objective and comprehensive,” he said.After pressing Putin on Ukraine, Syria, Russian meddling in Europe and why he had never uttered the name of Russia’s most prominent opposition figure, Alexei Navalny, who is currently in jail, Wolf used his final question to ask why there were so many Kremlin-approved photos of a half-naked Putin.“You said ‘half-naked’ not ‘naked,’ thank God. When I am on vacation I see no need to hide behind the bushes, and there is nothing wrong with that,” said Putin.During the visit, the Russian president was given an easy ride by figures from the more liberal end of the spectrum, such as the Austrian president, Alexander Van der Bellen, a former leader of the Green party.Asked during a joint press conference whether Austria’s dependence on Russian gas made the country prone to economic blackmail, Van der Bellen said American liquefied gas was two or three times more expensive than Russian gas.“Under these circumstances it makes little sense, purely economically, to replace Russian gas with American liquefied gas,” he said. The Austrian president also rejected one interviewer’s suggestion that Russia had a “credibility problem” in its current conflict with the EU.Over the weekend, the Austrian vice-chancellor, Heinz-Christian Strache, called for an immediate end to “exasperating sanctions” against Russia. His Freedom party signed a five-year “cooperation pact” with Putin’s United Russia party in 2016."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0040cbca7fa6965aac9a1b4e5f34dfd58594e2e3/235_187_1653_992/master/1653.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=307807d35fd47a34086696e38315eb83","title":"saudi arabia issues first drivers licences to women","story":"Kingdom prepares to lift ban on female drivers but crackdown on activists continuesSaudi Arabia has issued its first driving licences for women three weeks before it ends the world’s only ban on female drivers, though many of the activists who pushed for change are still in jail.Ten women who held foreign driving licenses were given a health check and brief test behind the wheel before receiving their Saudi permits from the Riydah traffic office. They had been selected from the thousands who have applied, with many more licenses due to be issued by 24 June, when the ban is due to be lifted.In a country with very limited public transport, the right to drive is an important liberation for women who want to work, meet friends or take their children to school.“Driving, to me, represents having a choice: the choice of independent movement,” Rema Jawdat, a risk analyst at the Ministry of Economy and Planning and one of the first ten women given licenses, told the government’s media centre. For years women have been forced to spend a large slice of their salary on a driver or depend on a combination of taxis, friends and relatives. So many now want to learn to drive that schools have been recruiting teachers abroad, and there are waiting lists for driving classes.Although Saudi law has never explicitly banned women from driving, they were not eligible for licences. If they did try to drive, police would often detain them until a male relative came to sign a pledge that she would not drive again.Esraa Albuti, an executive director at Ernst \u0026amp Young, held up one of the first ten licences for a government photo. “I’m proud of the news about driving,” she said.Ultra-conservatives oppose ending the ban, claiming it is immoral for women to drive and will subject them to sexual harassment.The change has been credited to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has positioned himself as a reformer determined to return the country to “moderate Islam” and transform its moribund, oil-dependent economy.He also pledged to get more women into the workforce, and committed to a range of other changes, most recently allowing new cinemas for the first time in 35 years, and other entertainment.But the historic shift on women drivers has been overshadowed by the detention last month of many of the most prominent figures who campaigned against the ban for years, and in some cases decades.Eight have now been released, but nine are still being held. They are believed to include well-known activists such as Loujain al-Hathloul who had previously been detained for driving. Their arrests came after a high-profile campaign in Saudi media outlets and on social media denounced the women as “traitors”.Human Rights Watch had already warned of a “chill created by this new wave of repression” that could raise questions internationally about the depth of Saudi commitment to women’s rights.Most of those detained had already been warned in September against commenting on the lifting of the ban on female drivers, according to activists outside Saudi Arabia, and cautioned about running further campaigns against the country’s strict ship scheme.This system requires women to obtain permission from a close male relative for a host of life decisions, including marriage and travel. The king ordered some provisions to be relaxed in 2017."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ec60c0d285c71eeead38e43f1d8f79e8d6bc330/0_243_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cabe330bb9b891a105cd989e56cbf2a","title":"investing in our future why were opening lifetime isas","story":"Retirement reserves for a self-employed director, and an aspiring writer’s first house fund: how two very different young professionals are saving for their financial futuresOliver Sin, 29, is a freelance director, animator and illustrator who lives in Cheltenham. He has no retirement fund in place and would use the Lifetime Isa to save for the long-term futureUnfortunately, the nature of being self-employed means there’s no regularity in how often I’m paid. Projects can be sporadic and uncertain. Invoices can be delayed, projects can drag on or I can just not win work for a while. If I don’t work, I don’t make money. It’s a scary and risky career but it’s very rewarding at times.I pay myself a set salary that helps me limit how much I spend each month, and keeps the money I shouldn’t spend in my business. I also put some of this salary into my savings. Anything extra I earn at the end of the year usually goes into my savings too. It’s definitely stressful though. I sometimes worry if I’ll carry on making enough money as each year passes, but if I can stay organised with my business and earnings, I can relax a lot more.As well as having an unreliable income, it’s also challenging having to calculate how much I’ll spend in expenses for my business and how much tax I’ll owe each year. There are days I wish I was employed again, so I could rely on a steady stream of income and know how much I can actually put into my savings each month. However, the upside of being freelance is that I can earn a higher amount each month than I normally would when working for a company, which makes the opportunity to save far greater.The main attraction of a Lifetime Isa for me is the prospect of having a retirement fund for when I’m older. Being self-employed, I don’t currently have a pension and it’s scary knowing I have nothing to fall back on. I’m hitting 30 this year and having a Lifetime Isa or a pension is a must for me now. I’m always one to want to find the best option possible and other Isas currently on the market don’t feel worthwhile any more.There’s nothing worse than constantly saving and never enjoying your money. My wife and I are hooked on travel and like to see as much of the world as possible. Aside from wanting to build a financial safety net for the future, our main saving goal is to have enough to enjoy ourselves along the way.Laura Lucas, 29, is a marketing assistant in Manchester and a lifestyle blogger in her spare time. She is considering a Lifetime Isa to save for her first houseI blog most evenings, which doesn’t provide much income, but I hope it’ll be my main job one day. Blogging is good in that I can save money that I might have otherwise spent on dinner out or a new outfit, because I’m lucky enough to get gifted these sorts of things. I feel like I’m currently working two jobs, one that I love but which doesn’t pay, and my main job that I rely on for income. My partner and I got engaged over Christmas, so we’re saving for a wedding in about two years’ time, as well as starting to think about buying our first home together. We’ll probably do the wedding on a budget with some special bits and bobs thrown in, but we’ll have to plan ahead to make sure we can afford the extravagant extras. I’d also love to have an engagement party in the next few months and it’s my partner’s 30th birthday this year, so even though we want to celebrate these occasions in style we might have to dial them down a little to save money. We both work really hard, so we don’t want to cut out anything like holidays or evening drinks with friends. I like to think I’m a good saver, and a Lifetime Isa would help us to save for our first house. It’s great to have something backed by the government to help young people save. It’s challenging these days but a Lifetime Isa encourages you to think long term about home ownership and retirement. I already have a couple of savings accounts that I sometimes dip into for Christmas and birthdays, holidays and more expensive purchases, but setting these accounts up can be stressful.

But with buoyant house prices and stagnant wages, what are the steps to getting on the property ladder?If you’re dreaming of buying your first home, it’s not surprising. It will mean the freedom to put your stamp on a place that’s truly yours, but some say you’ll also save money. According to research published by the Bank of Scotland in February 2018, buying a home is cheaper in terms of monthly costs than renting, and saves first-time buyers between £590 and £2,190 a year around the UK, on average, depending on area. So how can you join them?How much you can potentially borrow will also have a bearing on how much you need to save. “As a very general rule of thumb, you’ll usually be able to borrow around four times your salary, which, if you earn £30,000, means a potential mortgage of £120,000,” says Wallis. “The difference between your borrowing power and what you have to pay for a property is the minimum you should save.”In addition, Audhlam-Gardiner suggests that a Lifetime Isa is more flexible in terms of the type of house you can buy: if outside London, the most you can pay for a property with a Lifetime Isa is £450,000, rather than £250,000 with a help-to-buy Isa (for Londoners the limit is the same as for a Lifetime Isa). Plus, with the help-to-buy Isa, the government bonus can only be used on completion, whereas it can be used towards a deposit or split up across the process with a Lifetime Isa. Finding the right first home for your savings is just half the battle. “First-time buyers can take years to save for a deposit for their dream home,” says Lisa Hardstaff of credit reference agency, Equifax. “But a lack of understanding about the mortgage application process – including how credit information is used – could push their dream back even further.” About half of first-time buyers take between one and five years to save a deposit, says Hardstaff. “It is worth using this time to get your credit report in good shape.” David Hollingworth, from mortgage broker London \u0026amp Country Mortgages, agrees: “Ensuring that you are on the electoral roll where you live is a simple thing to do but could make a big difference. Having one or two well-managed credit cards can help, while having none could go against you. Regular use of payday loans could result in a straight decline from a lender.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3961ff6bd45223a626b86d067c99a9fadb159cb3/0_137_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5faf953013180a1480cefeec5f7824d9","title":"eight financial apps to transform how you deal with money","story":"It’s time to upgrade your piggy bank.

But is there a third way?Sitting firmly in the middle of the millennial generation (those born 1981-2000) and I’m told I could easily afford to buy my first home in London if I just give up: coffee, my gym membership, an annual weekend away, takeaway food, and a mobile upgrade, or one night out a week, for five years – or avocados.Sure, London living is afforded by renting the equivalent of a dodgy hostel dorm, nights out revolving around two-for-one deals, and “side-hustles”, which is a glorified term for my three jobs. So, should I accept that I can’t have my brunch and eat it too? Living paycheck to paycheck isn’t the dream and maybe neither is owning a home, but there must be a way I could at least consider the option.I’m certainly not alone, but maybe we’re placing too much value on “Yolo” – apparently a typical habit of young people today – so I’ve asked Paul Bridgwater, head of commercial and proposition at financial services provider OneFamily, and millennial lifestyle and personal finance expert Lisa Rowan from The Penny Hoarder what they think – and luckily neither suggested a five-year period where I give up all that I hold dear.Is it really that hard to save in a big city or am I being led astray?Rowan suggests that, unfortunately, it’s not all in my head. “Affordable, low-amenity units are being replaced with luxury buildings that are simply out of reach for many people, especially young people in the early stages of their careers,” she says. “This competitive housing environment means more workers in their 20s and 30s are enduring long commutes from the suburbs or are living with several roommates in order to make the most of their budgets.” But, Bridgwater says, while it can feel unattainable without the help from “the bank of mum and dad” we do have the benefit of living in a connected, digital age that can help us achieve our financial goals.I really value my social life – do I have to give up a chunk of it for five years?No, says Rowan, but there are some hacks to help make sure you don’t spend most of your monthly wages during the excitement of payday. In short, be at least a bit prepared. “Knowing the type of activity upfront can help you determine whether an event is a social and financial priority for you – then, it’s easier to make compromises. You may skip on the 12-person birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant, but you can still meet the group for drinks or dessert afterward. You can still go on a bar crawl with your friends, but perhaps eat a hearty meal before you leave the house,” she says.Bridgwater agrees, and says it’s safe to assume that most of your friends are in the same boat, so be straight up with them. “Money is a bit of a taboo subject for any age group, especially in the UK. On a practical level, earnings, savings and debts are not really discussed and perhaps they should be,” he says. “Like anything else in life, by talking and sharing issues, interesting solutions will come to light.”OK, so maybe I should be budgeting. What are some handy guidelines?Bridgwater says that budgeting isn’t the same for everyone, but taking away the temptation to spend is often the easiest way to save. “Create different accounts for your big expenses (housing, bills and savings) and then set up a standing order into these accounts one to two days after your wages go in from your main account. You’ll then know the money you have left in your main account is money you can spend,” he says.So, can I think about saving for a big purchase and still keep seeing my friends?Yes, says Rowan: “You can have your instant and delayed gratification at the same time.” A product like OneFamily’s stocks and shares Lifetime Isa is a good start when considering your options. With a Lifetime Isa, for every £4 put in, the government adds £1 – so save up to £4,000 a year and get £1,000 as a bonus (available after 12 months). Lifetime Isas are available either based on cash investments, which can be preferable for first-time house purchases in the short-term or stocks and shares investments, which might be preferable if you are aiming to buy your first home in five or more years, as they offer potentially better returns over the longer term, but be aware that capital is at risk.For information on the OneFamily stocks and shares Lifetime Isa, visit OneFamily.

Photograph: EPABALAZS MOHAIToday begins a critical fortnight in the Brexit negotiations, with Irish officials expecting to receive long-awaited British proposals on the Border in the coming days. Talks are scheduled between the British and EU sides every day this week.The Government wants to see significant progress at the technical talks this week in an effort to break the stalemate between the EU and UK over the future of the Border, and high-ranking sources confirmed that they expected to see proposals from the British this week.Dublin is pressing the British to provide more detailed alternative solutions and proposals on a legally-operable text on the default “backstop” option that would effectively keep Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market and customs union should no other plan be agreed to maintain an invisible border. The timetable for the EU-UK talks in Brussels lists a session on Wednesday on Ireland and Northern Ireland. Sources in Brussels say that it is expected to be a short meeting, dealing with a number of technical issues, although if the UK brings new proposals they will be discussed.Three more days of talks follow this week on the draft Withdrawal Agreement. The Government has cast the coming two weeks as crucial in the negotiations if a solution to the Border issue is to be approved by EU leaders at a European Council summit at the end of this month.The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has been increasing pressure on London to propose more concrete solutions in time for the summit. Tánaiste Simon Coveney, the Government’s lead Brexit negotiator, has warned of a difficult summer of negotiations if no progress is made by this summit, pushing negotiations to the October deadline set to allow the UK and EU parliaments time to approve any final withdrawal deal by the UK’s departure next March. “Our position remains that significantly more progress is needed ahead of the June European Council, ” said a spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs.“Michel Barnier has made this very clear, including during his recent visit to Ireland and Northern Ireland. At this stage in the process the UK must engage in a more detailed way on the draft text of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the backstop.”Concerns about the lack of progress in negotiations were voiced by Germany’s top Brexit diplomat Peter Ptassek, who played down expectations about agreement being reached by the council on June 28th-29th. Irish officials viewed Mr Ptassek’s remarks as another attempt to increase the pressure on the British to propose solutions in what is viewed as a make-or-break fortnight to prepare for the June summit as UK media reports suggest the British is preparing “Doomsday” contingency plans for no deal. An influential London think tank has said in a new report that British prime minister Theresa May should propose her own version of the backstop for the Border before the summit.“The UK has made it clear that the EU version of the backstop is unacceptable. But the government has not, so far, put forward draft language of its own,” says the Institute for Government report.“It needs to – and it needs to make clear that it is not trying to shirk the commitments it entered into in December. With no other workable proposition yet identified, let alone agreed, it needs to table something that could work, meets those commitments and is politically acceptable.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day.

Photograph: Christophe Petit TessonAs bureau chief for British magazine the Economist, Sophie Pedder got to know Emmanuel Macron earlier than most Macron-watchers. She first interviewed him in 2012, when he was economic adviser to then president François Hollande, and continued to talk to him after he became minister for the economy in 2014. She has interviewed him twice since he became president, and is probably the foreign journalist who knows him best.In the autumn of 2015, when Macron was still a cabinet minister, Pedder accompanied him from London to Paris on a small government jet, so she could interview him on the flight. They flew into a violent storm. “The plane was lurching around. I was clenching the seat handles and watching the lightning through the windows,” Pedder recalls. “Macron was absolutely unfazed by it. He continued talking the whole way through. I honestly wondered if he even noticed the storm was taking place. It told me a lot about his character. Subsequently, a lot of people talked about his unflappable nature.”Pedder’s book, Revolution Francaise – Emmanuel Macron and the Quest to Reinvent a Nation, will be published by Bloomsbury on June 14th. Its portrayal of France is far more upbeat than her previous book, French Denial – the Last Spoiled Children in Europe, published in Paris in 2012. “Then, I was accused of French-bashing,” Pedder laughs. Now she fears being accused of over-optimism.Macron, Pedder says, “believes very strongly” in optimism. “He believes it philosophically and I think it’s part of his character. He believes it is possible to create a better society.”Macron’s critics reproach him for wanting to be a “Jupiterian” president. “The French don’t like personal arrogance. That’s the greatest risk of his presidency, if he doesn’t find a way to temper or deal with that perception. The French are a rebellious people.”When Pedder last interviewed Macron at the Élysée Palace, she asked if he had made any mistakes. To her surprise, he regretted having called strikers “lazy” and alluding to “those who are nothing” in railway stations. The remarks were taken for condescension, which was not how he meant them.Contrary to his public image, Pedder says, Macron is capable of self-criticism. She sees the influence of Paul Ricoeur, the Christian philosopher who Macron worked with. “Testing your hypotheses against reality, that’s what Ricoeur taught him. He is constantly putting his presidency through the microscope and scanning it and checking it and taking a look at it . . . He is constantly testing his own ability to exercise power in the way he thinks is efficient and in the interest of the nation.”Domestically, Macron’s adversaries are all but vanquished. The far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon mobilised only 38,900 people in Paris for his “popular tide” on May 26th. The far left had hoped to “converge struggles” as students and workers did in the May 1968 revolution. “It doesn’t seem to have taken hold,” Pedder observes. Public opinion regarding the ongoing rail strike has taken the opposite trajectory to the 1995 transport strikes, with 64 per cent now supporting the government .In his first year as president, Macron “has grown into the office”, Pedder says. “One wasn’t sure he would be able to hold his own among world leaders.” Macron dared to criticise Donald Trump’s policies before Republicans in his April 25th address to the joint houses of Congress. “This guy is gutsier than a lot of people realised before he became president. He’s tougher than a lot of people thought. He can be very ruthless when he wants to be.”In Europe and the world, Pedder continues, “One of Macron’s problems is who does he work with? Who are his partners? Angela Merkel is constrained by her party. Theresa May is distracted by Brexit. Italy is facing its own crisis. Where are strong partners to stand up for the world trading system, for international rules, for multilateralism, for all the things he believes in? He can’t do it by himself. It’s a bigger problem than just Europe. He is very isolated.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3520452.1528224879!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit british labour looks for new european single market","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJeremy Corbyn said on Tuesday that Britain should still be allowed to negotiate new trade deals after Brexit. Photograph: Dominic LipinskiPA Wire Labour has called for Britain to join “a new European single market” after Brexit with full access to the European Union’s internal market. The party has tabled an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill, which returns to the House of Commons next week, that would make such an arrangement one of the government’s negotiating objectives.“Labour will only accept a Brexit deal that delivers the benefits of the single market and protects jobs and living standards. Unlike the Tories, Labour will not sacrifice jobs and the economy in the pursuit of a reckless and extreme interpretation of the referendum result,” the party’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said.The move represents a further shift in Labour policy towards a soft Brexit, following its call for Britain to remain in a customs union with the EU. Jeremy Corbyn said on Tuesday that Britain should still be allowed to negotiate new trade deals after Brexit and he rejected as unsuitable Norway’s model of membership of the European Economic Area (EEA).The amendment appears to be aimed at limiting the number of Labour MPs who will back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which would keep Britain in the EEA after Brexit. The party leadership supports some of the amendments approved by the House of Lords but the new amendment falls short of calling for EEA membership.“It shall be a negotiating objective of Her Majesty’s Government to ensure the United Kingdom has full access to the internal market of the European Union, underpinned by shared institutions and regulations, with no new impediments to trade and common rights, standards and protections at a minimum,” the amendment says.Theresa May’s government risks defeat on a number of amendments to the Bill, which will be debated and voted on in a single, 12-hour session next Tuesday. Among the amendments passed by the Lords which are attracting support among Remainers on the Conservative backbenches are one on the customs union and another which would allow MPs to reject a “no deal” Brexit.Former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown called on Tuesday for tougher action on immigration within the rules of the EU and the single market in an effort to address some of the concerns that produced the Brexit vote.“The Brexit vote was the biggest revolt against the political establishment of our country – and the commercial, industrial, financial and cultural establishment. Something as seismic cannot be dismissed as false consciousness on the part of a poorly-informed electorate: we have to accept that was a genuine expression of people’s anxieties about the future,” he said. “The vote sent a powerful message that globalisation is not working for British citizens and this is reflected in economic discontent about wage stagnation and the prospects for young people, and in cultural pessimism – a sense that ‘the country is not what it was’ and has ‘changed out of all recognition’ – as well as an anti-politics sentiment.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3519215.1528128871!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may must devise version of brexit backstop option says think tank","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Prime minister Theresa May: she needs to table something on Brexit border that could work, meets commitments, and is politically acceptable. Photograph: Chris J RatcliffeGetty ImagesTheresa May should propose her own version of the Brexit backstop option for the Border ahead of this month’s EU summit in Brussels, according to an influential London think-tank.The Institute for Government’s report The Irish Border after Brexit says that while the UK has begun to propose future arrangements on issues like customs that could help avoid a hard border, they are not fully fleshed out and are unacceptable to the EU.“The UK has made it clear that the EU version of the backstop is unacceptable. But the government has not, so far, put forward draft language of its own. It needs to – and it needs to make clear that it is not trying to shirk the commitments it entered into in December. With no other workable proposition yet identified, let alone agreed, it needs to table something that could work, meets those commitments, and is politically acceptable,” the report says.British officials have floated the possibility of a backstop that would apply to the whole of the UK, keeping it aligned with the EU on customs and regulations for goods. EU negotiators insist, however, that the proposed backstop can only apply to Northern Ireland.“If it sticks to that line, the UK and the EU will need to explore the promised ‘innovative solutions’ either for the North – or the whole island of Ireland – that are both compatible with the joint report and do not upset the delicate unionist-nationalist balance of the Good FridayBelfast Agreement.“The UK could, for example, try reducing coverage to key sectors for cross-Border trade and try negotiating equivalence in specific areas – whereby the EU would accept that the UK was meeting the same outcomes but by different means. It could also propose that the backstop was overseen by whatever governance process is agreed for the Withdrawal Agreement rather than the EU institutions as now. The aim would be to remove the implication that Northern Ireland was separated from the rest of the UK and had become part of the EU’s customs territory and regulatory jurisdiction,” the report says.With EU officials warning that little progress has been made ahead of this month’s summit, government whips told Conservative MPs on Monday that the House of Commons would vote next week on amendments passed in the House of Lords to the EU Withdrawal Bill.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano pictures","story":"Kilauea volcano has created nearly two dozen lava-shooting fissures on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island since the eruption began, spewing lava and emitting toxic gases.Thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes and experts remain unsure of where more of the hazardous cracks might open up, or when the volcanic activity might stop.The eruption of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii sparked new safety warnings about toxic gas on the Big Island\u0027s southern coastline after lava began flowing into the ocean and setting off a chemical reaction.Italy\u0026#39s new Eurosceptic government vows to work with Hungary to \u0026#39change the EU\u0026#39Hundreds of miscarriages of justice feared as CPS apologises for disclosure failingsBrexit bulletin: Norway lukewarm on UK joining EEA clubComment: If Chris Grayling delivers a third runway as well as he delivers trains, expect it some time in 2060US ambassador to Germany ruffles feathers with Austria meeting invite after being accused of \u0026#39interfering\u0026#39 in domestic politicsFashion designer Kate Spade found dead at 55\u0026#39Her only crime is that she was caught\u0026#39 -

We believe that countries should play by the rules,” said Mr Williamson. “This is even more important at a time when storm clouds are gathering and regional fears are rising, when more nations have nuclear and chemical weapons, not to mention the infringement of regional access, freedoms and security.”But he declined to answer whether British ships would sail within 12 nautical miles of a disputed territory or artificial island built by the Chinese, as US ships have done. At the end of May China’s military said it had dispatched warships to challenge two US Navy vessels that had passed within 12 nautical miles of the Paracel Islands, an archipelago in disputed waters off the coast of Vietnam. Gavin Williamson, UK defence secretary, tours HMS Sutherland in SingaporeChina, whose claim to the Paracel Islands is not recognised, argued that passage within 12 nautical miles constitutes a violation of the country’s territory under the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea. Mr Williamson stressed that the UK, France and Australia had also been asserting their rights of passage in the region. “We’ve been sending a clear message to all that the freedom of navigation is absolutely critical,” he said. Since it left UK shores in January, the Sutherland and its 220-strong crew have also engaged in surveillance operations to counter efforts by North Korea to bypass UN sanctions on banned commodities through illicit ship-to-ship transfers. Mr Williamson said the UK was “very realistic about the challenges” that lay ahead with North Korea, but welcomed the prospect of the upcoming Singapore summit between Donald Trump, the US President and Kim Jong-un. “The most important thing that we have is the fact that people are talking, people are trying to work to find a solution and the diplomatic lead that has been shown is one that I think we all welcome and we know is the right approach.”    Please review our commenting policyItaly\u0026#39s new Eurosceptic government vows to work with Hungary to \u0026#39change the EU\u0026#39Hundreds of miscarriages of justice feared as CPS apologises for disclosure failingsBrexit bulletin: Norway lukewarm on UK joining EEA clubComment: If Chris Grayling delivers a third runway as well as he delivers trains, expect it some time in 2060US ambassador to Germany ruffles feathers with Austria meeting invite after being accused of \u0026#39interfering\u0026#39 in domestic politicsFashion designer Kate Spade found dead at 55\u0026#39Her only crime is that she was caught\u0026#39 - farmer attacks EU over plan to put down Penka the stray cow Police fear career and lives could be ruined if they pursue moped gangs Grenfell firefighters questioned \u0026#39stay put\u0026#39 order which doomed residentsHigh Court backs NHS decision to stop funding homeopathyComment: The classic British B\u0026ampB is dying out - but give me chintz over creature comforts any dayCrocodile kills vicar during mass baptism in EthiopiaMystery illness kills eight in UgandaChief of Defence Staff \u0026#39deeply uncomfortable\u0026#39 with legal pursuit of veteransWoman in critical condition after being punched by robber riding pillion on mopedThe economics of Love Island: how game theory explains \u0026#39coupling up\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/04/TELEMMGLPICT000072420395_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqBe6O56qrl4zbRlMQqI7UBFVse9JsN00kzbUr3IXHaGo.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"moons movements could leave us 25 hour day","story":"The moon is currently moving away from Earth at a rate of 3.82cm a year, which could mean in around 200 million years’ time, each day will be 25 hours longMany of us feel as if there are not quite enough hours in a day – but according to scientists, this could change in the future.Researchers have found that the effect of the Moon moving away from Earth causes our planet to spin more slowly, lengthening the day.A new study, published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shows that 1.4 billion years ago, a day on Earth lasted just over 18 hours.

The Austrian leader is in coalition with the far-Right Freedom Party (FPÖ).“I think there is a groundswell of conservative policies that are taking hold because of the failed policies of the Left,” Mr Grenell told Breitbart, adding that he felt it was an “exciting time” to be in Europe.He said he considered Mr Kurz, who is the world’s youngest leader at 31, a “rock star”.Mr Grenell has been a controversial choice as ambassador. In his first move after taking up the appointment last month, he tweeted a warning to German companies to stop doing business with Iran following Mr Trump’s decision to withdraw from the nuclear deal or face sanctions.The German foreign ministry said it would seek an explanation of his comments to Breitbart at his next regular meeting with officials next week.

That is why it’s worth indulging in one of those exercises to\u0026nbspconsider\u0026nbspwhat else you could do with the money.\u0026nbspWithout further ado, £2.1bn is the amount Harrods’ well-heeled shoppers spent throughout the course of 2016. It would buy you just over 23\u0026nbspGareth Bales, based on Real Madrid’s reported asking price for the Welsh wunderkind. It would pay for the reconstruction of London’s\u0026nbspBarts\u0026nbspHospital twice over. It would cover the £200m\u0026nbspestimated budget of Solo: A Star Wars Story\u0026nbsp10\u0026nbsptimes over. It would pay the annual salaries of nearly 92,000 newly qualified teachers or nurses, or\u0026nbspmore than 27,000 newly appointed NHS consultants.\u0026nbspIn corporate terms, it was the purchase price for WS Atkins –\u0026nbspa British multinational engineering, project management and design outfit –\u0026nbspwhen it was gobbled up by Canadian company\u0026nbspSNC-Lavalin\u0026nbsplast summer. At the time the company employed 18,000 people in 300 offices in 29 countries.\u0026nbspIn other words, £2.1bn is an absurd amount of money to pour down the toilet. And yet there has been\u0026nbspremarkably little debate about doing so via the RBS\u0026nbspsell off.\u0026nbspSensing that people might be\u0026nbspa little upset, the government dispatched only a junior minister, John Glen, economic secretary to the Treasury, to defend the action on the BBC’s Today programme. He told listeners that we “need to be realistic” and “look at market conditions”.\u0026nbspThe problem with that line? A realistic look at market conditions would tell you that now is a rotten time to be selling bank shares, what with the turmoil that Italy is causing in the eurozone, not to mention the damage Mr Glen’s government is doing to every man jack of us with its Brexit policy. \u0026nbspBut, but, but, say the defenders, it will take years for\u0026nbspRBS\u0026nbspshares to break through the\u0026nbsp500p\u0026nbspbarrier. We need to get going now. Private investors don’t like state-backed institutions.\u0026nbspThis will show them that there is no intention for RBS\u0026nbspto remain that way and\u0026nbspwill whet their appetites for more sales down the line.\u0026nbspI’m not sure what that says about Saudi\u0026nbspAramco, the oil company backed by the state of Saudi Arabia. You may have noticed that the\u0026nbspworld’s financial centres, including London, have been falling\u0026nbspover each other in an attempt to land the flotation of that entity\u0026nbspbecause every man and his dog\u0026nbspwants a piece of the investment action.\u0026nbspThe fact is, it\u0026nbspdoesn’t matter if there is a government of some description on a shareholder register, and it\u0026nbspdoesn’t matter if there is a stock overhang. It\u0026nbspdoesn’t matter if the governance of company X is awful and there is a remuneration plan in place to give a dodgy CEO 10 per cent of the equity for hitting some easily achievable target, or even no target at all, because if the City scents value, investors will steam in. If\u0026nbspRBS\u0026nbspshares look\u0026nbspcheap, institutional investors will\u0026nbspbuy regardless.\u0026nbspThis is not an argument for the bank\u0026nbspto remain in state hands. It is simply a suggestion that the government is proceeding with undue haste now the bank\u0026nbsphas paid its whopping US fine for its involvement in the mortgage-backed securities market in the run up to the financial crisis.It is true, as banking analyst Ian Gordon has pointed out, that\u0026nbspRBS\u0026nbspshares are trading at close to a two year high, and have outperformed other UK bank shares in the year to date.\u0026nbspBut that’s what you would expect to see happening with a recovery play.If, as Mr Glen has stated,\u0026nbspRBS\u0026nbspis “a completely different institution to where it was 10 years ago” then\u0026nbspthe government should\u0026nbspsit\u0026nbspback and wait\u0026nbspfor the market to wake up to that fact because, as shadow chancellor John McDonnell has stated, there is simply no economic justification for its\u0026nbspcurrent policy.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

If Sky News is not spun off\u0026nbspthe takeover will be blocked, the culture secretary said.He told\u0026nbspthe House of Commons that the competition watchdog had found that the takeover could lead to an erosion of Sky News’ editorial independence and an increase in the control of the Murdoch family trust\u0026nbspover UK media.

Meanwhile, a recent report found over\u0026nbsp100 academy trustees were paid more than £150,000 in 2015-16.Ms Rayner said: “The Labour Party will bring back genuine national pay in education. Not just for the teachers, but for other educators too.“We will reinstate the School Support Staff Negotiating Body. And we will go further.“National pay settlements will apply to every school that is funded through our National Education Service. There will be no more race to the bottom in our schools, and we will end the scandal of teaching assistants on the minimum wage.”Karen Leonard, GMB national officer for schools, said: “GMB members in academy schools are often paid poverty wages while bosses pocket £150,000 salaries.”We welcome this much needed pledge from Labour to stop the kind of academy penny-pinching which sees our dedicated and professional school support staff struggling to get by.“Ultimately, it\u0027s our children who will suffer if school staff aren\u0027t paid properly.”Earlier this year, MPs said academy trusts that pay their bosses “unjustifiably” high salaries could spend taxpayers’ money better on improving children’s education.\u0026nbspDan Moynihan, chief executive of Harris Federation, became the first academy leader in the country this year to earn more than £500,000.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “It is important that schools are able to recruit the staff they need. That is why we have given schools freedom over staff pay so they can reward the most experienced teachers and support staff – attracting the brightest and best.“With average salaries of £37,400 outside of London, rising to £41,900 in the capital, teaching continues to be an attractive career.“We have asked the independent School Teachers’ Review Body to take account of the Government’s new flexible approach to public sector pay, which it will have taken into account in reaching its recommendations which we are now considering for the coming year.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

As Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, argues, Britain could have a second EU referendum before Christmas this year, giving time for a lengthy 12-week campaign starting next September.Nick Clegg puts a rather different argument. He says that Brexit should be put to a second referendum because people who voted Leave are dying off.\u0026nbspThe “high point” of support for Brexit had passed because “the oldest voters voted for Brexit in the largest numbers” while the young voted to remain in the EU.\u0026nbspMy case is that the first referendum said we should leave without specifying how. In a second referendum, the government would in effect say – here’s the deal we have negotiated... do you approve? What could be more logical? What could be more natural?\u0026nbspNothing except that Ms May has ruled out a second Brexit referendum. In February, in a typically muddled formulation, she told a conference:\u0026nbsp“We are leaving the EU and there is no question of a second referendum or going back and I think that’s important. People in the UK feel very strongly that if we take a decision, then governments should turn not round and say, no, you got that wrong.” But if anybody is going to say, “you got that wrong”, it wouldn’t be the government but rather the people saying to the prime minister that she got wrong the exit terms she negotiated.\u0026nbspThat is what Ms May doesn’t like about the notion of a second referendum.In fact, there is a strong case for holding a second referendum. Since 23 June 2016, the date of the first referendum, we have learnt quite a few things we didn’t know before. Business chiefs, for instance, are worried about the time-wasting bureaucracy of filling in customs declarations after Brexit takes place. That is what a hard border would mean.As to the Brexiteers’ notion that technology could be used to avoid this, Jon Thompson, chief executive of HM Revenue and\u0026nbspCustoms, delivered a stark verdict\u0026nbspwhen he appeared before the Treasury Committee.\u0026nbspThe cost to business of introducing a high-tech customs plan would be up to £20bn a year, he said. That is a frighteningly high price to pay.\u0026nbspWhen we cast our referendum vote, we also hadn’t thought about complex procedures such as car assembly. As a car chassis moves along the production line, components from all over Europe are put into their appointed places. If this is taking place in a British car plant, then many of the components will have come from the continent. If the plant is on the other side of the Channel, then many British-made parts will have had to have been shipped across. In fact, more than two-thirds of the UK’s exports to the EU take the form of intermediate inputs to the production of finished goods and services. Likewise, about 55 per cent of imports from the EU represent products to be incorporated in final production in the UK. If all this were to be subject to customs clearance, then the whole series of complex procedures would come to a halt.No wonder the prospect of Brexit is already having a negative effect on economic activity. As the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, an intergovernmental economic organisation, commented this week: “Economic growth is projected to remain modest at 1.4 per cent in 2018 and 1.3 per cent in 2019, owing to high uncertainties about the outcome of Brexit negotiations.”\u0026nbspThis is about half the rate of growth being experienced by the rest of Europe. Did we know that Brexit would condemn Britain to reduced economic activity?In short, we need a second referendum because we know much more about the disadvantages of leaving the European Union that we did when we were first asked. Moreover, in Ms May we have a prime minister who cannot make up her mind about anything. The Financial Times put this point strongly on 17 May: “It has been 693 days since Britain voted to leave the EU. In another 316, that decision is set to become reality. Yet the government of Theresa May has still not come to an agreement – either with itself or with Brussels – on what the new economic relationship with the continent should be. This was the most basic question raised by Brexit, and it should have been answered before Article 50 was triggered, setting in motion withdrawal.\u0026nbspFailure to do so is testament to political isions and weak leadership.”\u0026nbspSo we shall have to make up Ms\u0026nbspMay’s mind for her.So, in light of this muddle and confusion, what question would be put in a second referendum?\u0026nbspIn the 2016 referendum the question was\u0026nbspshould the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\u0026nbspIn effect, this formulation called for an answer from the gut. Like it or leave it? But in a second referendum, this luxury would not be available.\u0026nbspThere would have to be reference to the terms of disengagement covering such crucial questions as whether the UK would remain a member of some kind of customs union.\u0026nbspAs it is hard to get such detail into a simple question, I suggest the following:Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave on such terms as approved by parliament?\u0026nbspIn addition, a simple version of the terms approved by parliament could be sent to every voter and could be made available in voting stations.This would have the merit of emphasising that parliament is the supreme decision-making body in this country. However, as a Remainer, I must remember a key rule about asking questions – never ask one when you might not like the answer. How likely is it that the answer to a second referendum might differ from the first? Remember that voters are likely to be hostile to the holding of a second referendum. They may think – you have asked us once, we gave you an answer, don’t bother us again. With the result that the turnout for a second referendum would likely be low and thus unconvincing.However, Peter Kellner, the experienced political commentator and former president of YouGov, has just published a much more upbeat appraisal.\u0026nbspHe believes that below the surface, public opinion is stirring. In particular, one million Labour voters who backed Brexit two years ago are having second thoughts. His study of recent polling results convinces him that significant numbers of younger Leave voters, as well as those supporting Labour in last year’s election, no longer think Brexit is right for Britain. He also supports the Nick Clegg thesis and argues that the effects of demographic changes since the referendum are growing. “Bluntly,”\u0026nbspas he writes, “older, mainly Leave, voters are dying and younger, mainly Remain, voters are joining the electorate.”Mr Kellner bases his findings in the more than 23,000 voters that YouGov has questioned since the start of the year.\u0026nbspAnd his conclusion is that there is a real prospect that if the people were given the final say on Brexit, they would vote for the UK to stay in the European Union. So let’s have a second referendum.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Turkish police dispersing a march in Istanbul with tear gas and rubber bullets in 2015 and banning the event in 2016 and 2017 outright on security grounds underlines\u0026nbspthe ongoing relevance of the demonstration.More recent reports of homophobic violence being carried out in Chechnya\u0026nbsp and Indonesia\u0026nbspfurther emphasise the need for education to encourage greater tolerance.This year\u0027s London Pride parade is scheduled for Saturday 7 July while the UK\u0027s largest event\u0026nbsptakes place in Brighton on Saturday 4 August, coinciding with the Pride Festival held at Preston Park between 3 and 5 August, which is this year being headlined by the one and only\u0026nbspBritney Spears.Other key events taking place across Britain this summer include:In Europe, this summer\u0027s biggest Pride events are:Even further afield, you can celebrate Pride in these cities:or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Hippos are susceptible to the infection, and can pass it to humans who eat infected meat.\u0026nbspZambia\u0026nbspinitially suspended a planned cull in 2016 following pressure from activists, but Born Free\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspaccused\u0026nbspthe government of “secretly” overturning the decision and “promoting the cull to trophy hunters”.\u0026nbspWill Travers, chief executive of\u0026nbspthe charity, told The Independent\u0026nbspthe authorities have failed to provide enough\u0026nbspevidence showing\u0026nbspan overpopulation of hippos in the Luangwa River, or to make public any data that\u0026nbspjustifies\u0026nbspthe cull.They are, apparently, using the same flawed rationale for the slaughter as last time – a preventative measure to avoid a future outbreak of anthrax, combined with an assertion that low rainfall will exacerbate the situation, he said.They also appear not to have informed key stakeholders in the Luangwa Valley...\u0026nbspThe negative consequences for thousands of hippo and Zambia’s reputation as a wildlife tourism destination cannot be underestimated.”Umlilo Safaris, a South African trophy hunting company, last month began\u0026nbspoffering customers\u0026nbspa five-day “hippo management hunt” in the Laungwa Valley for £10,500 each.\u0026nbspThe organisation’s Facebook page says hunters can shoot five hippos per trip and keep the animals\u0027 tusks.Richard Kock, professor of wildlife health\u0026nbspat the Royal Veterinary College, told The Independent the government needed to provide\u0026nbspdata to justify the cull.\u0026nbsp“There’s no doubt that hippos can build up numbers until there really are probably too many for the ecosystem,” he said. “And so I think the anthrax may well be a factor in controlling their populations, and it may benefit the environment because they will consume large quantities of herbage, and obviously that will affect other species.\u0026nbsp“I’m also very sensitive to the fact people use these things as excuses for nefarious behaviour. So I would say you need good data and you need good evidence and it should be the scientific authorities who should back up any sort of criteria on culling. And it should be justified.”In a statement, Zambia\u0027s ministry of tourism said the culling was to maintain a suitable habitat for aquatic species and wildlife in general, noting that similar culls had taken place before.The hippos are causing considerable damage to the riverbanks and continue to threaten the sustainability of the river system, a spokesperson said.The move comes months after more than 100 hippos died from a suspected anthrax outbreak in Namibia.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I find it particularly interesting that the Israeli tweet uses a meme with women to react to the Ayatollah\u0026nbspKhamenei’s tweet.”Israel’s Mean Girls gif had been retweeted more than 9,000 times and liked more than 27,000 times within a day of being posted.The Twitter exchange came amid growing tensions in the Middle East since Donald Trump announced the US was withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposing sanctions on Iran.\u0026nbspOn Tuesday, Benjamin\u0026nbspNetanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, sought to convince European states to abandon the deal, claiming Tehran’s threats to increase uranium enrichment capacity showed it still planned to destroy Israel.Britain, France and Germany are scrambling to\u0026nbspsave the accord, under which Iran\u0026nbsppromised to curb its nuclear programme in return for lifted sanctions.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Some are said to be planning to become Uber drivers.Saudi women had long complained about\u0026nbsphaving to hire costly male drivers, use taxis or rely on male relatives to get to work and run errands.The surprise decision to issue licences to some women early came as activists who had campaigned for the right to drive remained under arrest, facing possible trial.Saudi Arabia’s prosecutor said over the weekend that 17 people had been detained in recent weeks on suspicion of trying to undermine security and stability -\u0026nbspa case activists said targeted prominent women’s rights campaigners.Eight have been temporarily released, while five men and four women remain under arrest, the prosecutor said.Among the women held since 15 May are Loujain al-Hathloul, Aziza al-Yousef and Eman al-Nafjan, according to people with knowledge of the arrests.The three are among the most outspoken and well-known women’s rights activists in Saudi Arabia. They risked arrest by pushing for the right to drive for years, while also calling for an end to ship laws that give male relatives final say over a woman marrying or travelling abroad.They now face a string\u0026nbspof charges\u0026nbspincluding communicating with people and organisations hostile to the kingdom and providing financial and moral support to hostile elements abroad.State-linked media have referred to the group as “foreign embassy agents” and branded them traitors.Three other veteran women’s rights activists were briefly detained at the onset of the sweep. They had taken part in the first protest in 1990 against the kingdom’s ban on women driving.Nearly 50 women took part in the first driving protest around\u0026nbsp28 years ago. The women were arrested, lost their jobs, had their passports confiscated for a year and faced severe stigmatisation.\u0026nbspOthers were detained over the years during various efforts by women’s rights activists to drive.While Saudi law has never explicitly banned women from driving, women were not issued driving licences.\u0026nbspOften, police would detain a female driver until a male relative could pick her up and sign a pledge on her behalf that she would not drive again.Hard line conservatives viewed women driving as immoral and warned they\u0026nbspwould be subject to sexual harassment if they drove.Four years ago\u0026nbspthe country’s top cleric, Grand Mufti Abdulaziz Al Sheikh, said barring women from driving “was in the best interest of society” because it protected them from having to deal with an accident.The kingdom\u0026nbspis currently facing\u0026nbspsteep economic challenges and has a burgeoning young population that has access to the world through the internet where\u0026nbspwomen in neighbouring Muslim countries drive\u0026nbspfreely.To boost the economy and ease international criticism, Saudi Arabia’s 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been promoting changes, such as the decision to allow women to drive,\u0026nbspdespite risking backlash from clerics and others who adhere to the ultraconservative Wahhabi\u0026nbspinterpretation of Islam.The prince has also attempted to appeal to young Saudis by opening the country to more entertainment, allowing music concerts and bringing the first commercial movie theatre to Saudi Arabia this year.\u0026nbspBlack Panther\u0026nbspwas the first film to be shown.\u0026nbspHowever, rights groups say the arrest of activists by the crown prince’s security forces are an attempt to silence dissent as women prepare to drive for the first time, and may be a way to freeze any calls for greater reforms.The spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Liz Throssell, has described the crackdown as “perplexing”.She said: “If, as it appears, their detention is related solely to their work as human rights defenders and activists on women’s issues, they should be released immediately.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Once, after a 12-hour shift I was exhausted and had to wait for the last woman to leave.I popped my head around the communal showers to find her shaving her legs. Five minutes later she was clipping her toenails and casually flicking them into the drain.Couples do get frisky in the pool and I regularly had to put an end to it. If the black-death stare didn’t work then Id loudly point out that there are children present. They usually stopped.It was in the family changing room were the real action went on though. Men and women can use them together - so they did.It was a familiar scene when I peered under the door. A pair of feet, a pair of knees and lots of toes twitching. I’d have to hammer on the door brazenly shouting, Are you nearly done!We’d all stand in reception knowing exactly which couple had been doing the deed. Their walk of shame was always priceless. It was usually teenagers who obviously didn’t have any privacy at home.Kids can be a bit of a nightmare when they over-swim. If theyre going to be sick they rarely wait to get to the changing rooms.I’ve had enough barf upchucked on my toes to last me a lifetime.They also go to the loo as and when the fancy takes them. One mum was with her two kids - one on the loo and the other was plonked on a nappy bin.The kid pooed on it and mum looked to me to deal with it.It’s our jobs to clean and wed do it reluctantly. I definitely wouldn’t use a Jacuzzi at a pool. We did the bare minimum.I’ve seen some outfits in my time. But the most eye-popping swimsuit was one put on incorrectly. This poor old dear hadn’t realised her costume was on back to front. She looked like Borat in his fluro mankini.I couldnt let her go in the pool like that, so had to discreetly break it to her that it was on the wrong way round.Its a great job to do though.  I would recommend it to anyone even if it means having to sit in wet undies all day after having rescued a nipper from the shallow end.Zoe Apostolides, 27, lives in London. She worked as a lifeguard aged 16-20.Zoe says: I became a lifeguard at 16 and on Saturdays Id get to my local pool in South West London for 5am.My least favourite job was clearing out the sauna area, which involved scraping out the human fat that collected in the grates underneath.It was really thick, pale orange and smelled awful: like sweat and fry-ups.  Itd get under your fingernails and leave greasy marks on the red-and-yellow uniforms we wore.Afterwards wed collect the clumps and put them in human-waste bags before tossing them into a special bin.Another grim job was picking up dead cockroaches. Sometimes the pest controllers would put down poison but thered always be a few ready to dart out from under the changing rooms.We had a special net to fish out floating poo, but if someone bled in the water wed have to clear the pool and close it for the day.Louise Humphries, 53, lives in Leicester. She was a lifeguard aged 18-23Louise says: Hygiene goes out the window for most bathers when theyre in their swimsuits. I’ve been handed a child’s poo by a mum who announced, I don’t think this belongs to my child.Momentarily speechless, I spluttered, well, just leave it on the side then! When this happens the pool has to be cleaned.Hair clogging up the shower plugs was a classic daily thing us life guards had to yank out of drains.One place I worked at had a sauna and spa, and the men-only nights proved to be an education. One night I spotted a man head down in the hot tub.I panicked and raised the alarm, shouting, “he’s drowning!” I yanked him up and got the surprise of my life when another guy popped up from beneath him. Needless to say neither of them were drowning.So many kids get left on their own in the pool while their parents go and get changed. I’ve had to jump in and haul little ones out of the pool when the wave machines starts and they slip under.I’ve also had to discipline kids. Parents don’t like it, but for me it is safety first.You get used to people treating lifeguards badly - one dad tried to square up to me after I reprimanded his son.Then there was the diabetic who hadn’t eaten enough and passed out. Having to drag him up from the bottom of the pool was a memorable experience.Even today I would never use a public Jacuzzi. The type of swimming I prefer nowadays is strictly in the sea.I’ve got a teenage son and decades on still find myself shouting, “walk don’t run!”  The lifeguard attitude never leaves you. It’s a side of life so few people get to see and yet I would encourage my son to do it. Louise is the owner of Studio44Pilates.Hayley, 50, is a health care assistant from Hunmanby, Yorkshire. She worked as a lifeguard for one season as a teenager.Hayley says: Baywatch it very definitely wasn’t. While no day was ever the same - every morning started in the same fashion: fishing out the debris from the night before.The pool was open air, there were no fences or security cameras. So it was down to us to skim off the floating used condoms, bottles and other rubbish that had been chucked into the pool during the nocturnal hours.We’d draw short straws for who would dredge the bottom of the baths.When I lost out I’d find used tampons, verruca socks, plasters and other things that people somehow inexplicably lost while they were swimming.I lost count of the number of times I had to gently reprimand mums and dads for letting their toddlers wee in the plastic grating that went around the pool.They thought it was a drain, when it was really the filtration system for cleaning the water they swam in.And when parents let their kids wee in the pool you know exactly what they are doing during those thirty seconds they’re standing still.The person in charge of maintaining the chemical composition of the pool didn’t check it everyday either.The pool was undoubtedly half water, half urine at times.I also got used to seeing more willies and boobs in one summer than I’ve ever seen since.Girls in skimpy bikinis will never ever learn that if you dive in that string won’t hold the ‘girls’ in.Guys are just as bad and were forever pulling down each other’s swimming trunks.The pool had a glass panel at one side. I lost count of how many times a day swimmers would moon at stunned families innocently walking by.Working that summer season in a holiday camp pool put me off swimming in public baths for life. I only go now to private ones in posh health centres.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because 17.4million of us voted to leave, to take back control of our money, our laws and our borders.Before the referendum vote, Parliament decided — quite rightly — that the British people had the right to decide whether we should leave the EU.That is why Parliament passed the Referendum Act and voted to trigger Article 50.And it is why both major political parties agreed in last year’s general election to abide by the referendum decision.Liam Fox says Britain has proved the doubters wrongThere is also great strength in the UK economy that should give us reassurance as we move towards a more independent future.Remember the dire consequences predicted if the British people decided to vote to leave? We were told investors would desert us.What happened?Last year we landed more inward investment projects than ever before, a vote of confidence from the international financial community.We were told we would face an employment crisis.What happened?Employment is up by 600,000 since before the referendum to 32.34million, with record numbers in work.Our manufacturing order books are at their highest for years and our exports have risen by about ten per cent in the past year.Remember how jobs would flood out of the City of London to Paris and Frankfurt?What happened?Last year saw more venture capital on tech, including financial technology, coming to London than all of Germany, France, Spain and Ireland combined.Thankfully, the British people had the sense and courage to ignore the prophets of doom.We can rightly be confident and optimistic about our future outside the EU — and the PM has set out a vision of what that will look like. The UK already has enormous advantages in a competitive global economy.Our system of law is admired across the globe. Our skilled workforce and universities are world class.We have fantastic research and development facilities, some of the best innovators and we are leaders in the digital revolution.And we speak English and are in the right time zone to trade with Asia in the morning and the Americas in the afternoon.The UK is in a strong position. We are not the dependent and supplicant country some would have us believe.We are a leading member of the Commonwealth, a grouping of 53 countries that is home to one third of the world’s population and half of the globe’s top 20 emerging cities.We are one of the highest contributors to Nato, have a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and are members of the G7 and G20.The UK’s future is, and needs, to be global. Based on International Monetary Fund data, it has been calculated that in the next ten to 15 years, 90 per cent of global economic growth will originate from outside the EU.That is where we must concentrate our efforts for exports and investment, alongside maintaining our ties of prosperity and security with our European neighbours. The well-being of future generations depends upon it.Sometimes it is difficult for people in Britain, or the rest of Europe, to grasp the scale of this growth.But when we understand that by 2025, China, alone, will have 221 cities with more than a million people, while the whole of the European continent will have 35, we can begin to see a fuller picture.Of course, the EU will continue to be an important economic and trade partner and we want to have a full, open and comprehensive trade agreement with it that puts the prosperity of European people before the ideology of the EU bureaucracy.But the truth is that our trade relationship with the EU has been changing over the years, since well before the referendum.In 2006, 54 per cent of our exports went to the EU. That has now fallen to 44 per cent, as markets elsewhere have expanded faster.One of the main benefits of Brexit, and being outside the Customs Union, will be having an independent trade policy for the first time in more than 40 years — made in Britain, for Britain.We need to have policies that ensure we are able to take advantage of the opportunities that will lie ahead as Asia and Africa develop growing middle classes with an appetite for the high-quality goods and services Britain provides.We cannot allow our future options to be constrained by the patterns of the past.As we leave the EU, we will take up our independent seat at the World Trade Organisation, the governing body of global trade.We will be champions of the free trading system that has helped take a billion people out over abject poverty over the past generation — one of the greatest achievements in human history.We believe protectionism will always fail and that spreading prosperity through trade is the best route to the global stability and security that is in all our interests.The UK can, and should, be a leader in that quest.It is time for our country to raise its level of ambition, take pride in our achievements and help shape our global future, joining the PM and the Government in delivering a Brexit that works for everyone — in Britain and beyond.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We don’t want to compromise,” he confessed to Vice online news. Now we all know. Our grovelling attempt to buy a friendly, friction-free and costly trade deal was doomed from the start.Brussels was never going to let Britain be better off outside.The Commission was determined to punish us for daring to leave. For believers in ever-closer union this an immutable article of faith.Abandoning the True Path is a heresy punishable by economic death.If we make it a success, we put the sacred Project in peril.In fact we should welcome Barnier’s harsh honesty.It provides an urgent wake-up call to dithering Theresa May who seems to favour a deal at any price.The PM’s weakness has made Britain a soft touch for Brussels and renegade Tories.Mrs May, a Remainer, has surrounded herself with a Downing Street coven of pro-EU fanatics and Whitehall mandarins who want her to cave in.She has a defeatist chief whip who keeps telling her she can’t win Commons votes against Brexit wreckers.And she is terrified of Chancellor Phil Hammond, a defiant Remainer who sabotaged spending on No Deal plans.Meanwhile, officials stoke fake news about a food, fuel and medicines crisis while the tax man invents a ludicrous annual £20BILLION customs bill for British exporters.Theresa May’s government is scaring itself to death.But a Sun on Sunday poll reveals voters don’t buy this rubbish.Most think, rightly, Theresa May has made a total hash of negotiations and must be replaced as PM when we leave next March.Mrs May is a rabbit in the headlights — aware of the trap she is walking into but paralysed by indecision over ways to escape.She seems to believe the EU Commission really can cripple one of the world’s major economies, wreck security ties and revive terrorism in Northern Ireland.And she is ready to cough up a gigantic £39BILLION of taxpayers’ cash for the privilege of surrendering — a prospect which enrages Remainers as much as Brexiteers.Paying that monstrous ransom in return for national humiliation would condemn the Tories to the scrapheap at the next election and hand the country over to a Corbyn-led Marxist nightmare.Ambitious Barnier — a preposterous puffed-up plutocrat — thinks he’s got it in the bag.EU needs all the friends – and money – it can get.In fact, his arrogance is causing alarm among EU leaders who want a deal — and offers Britain a chance to escape not just intact but in triumph.Barnier may have the support of France which has throughout history seen Britain as the great enemy.But many other countries — including Sweden, Holland, Italy and even Germany — regard the UK as their best customer.Trade is two-way traffic. Trade wars are bad news, as Donald Trump is starting to prove.Theresa May may be super-cautious but she has surely learned that boldness pays.She earned her leadership spurs by taking on Police Federation thugs. And she won global credit by standing up to Vladimir Putin over the Salisbury nerve agent poisonings.She must apply those lessons to this month’s crucial EU Council where member states gather to consider Britain’s future, just as Italy bursts into flames.The PM has a choice.She can accept an unpopular compromise which will unravel disastrously if British voters think they’ve been conned. Or she can march into talks with a clear, fair, take-it-or-leave-it offer to Europe from a valued economic and security ally.Her £39bn cheque is the trump card. With Greece destitute, Italy imploding and Austria, Poland and Hungary near revolt over immigration, the EU needs all the friends — and money — it can get.European leaders would have to decide whether to accept the deal or see Mrs May take everything off the table, including that mouth- watering £39bn pile of crisp Bank of England notes.Forget about “cliff edges”. The EU desperately needs that cash. There would be a stampede to stop Mrs May reaching the exit.Now it seems most if not all those casualties could have escaped if they had not been penned in their flats by fire-brigade diktat.We raise our hats to the fire service teams who risked death in this hideous blaze.

who was delivering a premature infant in a breech position - a C-section but instead attempted to carry out the delivery naturally with devastating results.However today the tribunal found that the error does not mean she is unfit to practice medicine.The ruling comes despite the tots mother angrily confronting the medic during the tribunal, telling her: I dont forgive you.But in a judgement released today, tribunal papers said it did not find that Dr Vaishnavy Laxmans fitness to practise is impaired by reason of misconduct.It added: The tribunal wished to record that nothing in this determination should distract from the fact that on March 16, 2014, Dr Vaishnavy Laxman made a significant error of judgement which had serious consequences and a profound impact upon patient A and for which Dr Vaishnavy Laxman bears a heavy responsibility.The botched birth had caused the infant’s legs, arms and torso to become detached, leaving the head still in his mother’s womb.Two other doctors subsequently carried out a C-section on the woman to remove the infant’s head.It was re-attached” to his body so his mother could hold him before she said goodbye.It is believed the child was already dead before he was decapitated during the 15-minute delivery, at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee.Mr Tim Bradbury, chairing the tribunal, said: “Laxman’s conduct set in train a course of events which ultimately resulted in the decapitation of Baby B and to this extent contributed to that decapitation.“But for Laxman’s error of judgement in this regard, the decapitation would not have occurred.”He added that Laxman had not sufficiently addressed in her mind the risk to Baby B by proceeding with a vaginal delivery - namely the risk of head entrapment and the delay this complication would inevitably cause.The tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee with a team of other doctors.The womans waters had broken early at 25 weeks and upon examination her unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, was in a breech position whilst the mothers cervix was between 2-4cm dilated.Laxman had started work at 8.30am the previous day and went home at 6pm for five hours before returning to the hospital at 11pm.She was told about the patient at 2am and was subsequently paged at 8.30am to take a look at her when her condition became more critical.Later while discussing the method of delivery, Laxman told a colleague: We are not doing a c-section - you would never do a c-section of a 25 weeker.She then carried out a vaginal examination of the woman and told her too push.Last month consultant Laxman, who denied misconduct, said the youngster would have died had a C-section been carried out during the procedure on March 16 2014.She told the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester: “I was trying to deliver a live baby, I was trying really hard, possibly too hard.“I did not intend to harm mum or the baby.I am distraught at the outcome and I am very sorry it did not come out the way I meant it.”Laxman qualified as a doctor in Chennai, India, in 1999.The mother – known only as Patient A – came to face with Laxman and in a harrowing exchange across the room looked at her and said: “I don’t forgive you – I don’t forgive you” as the doctor stared down at the floor.The patient then looked away as Laxman’s QC apologised on her behalf.The mother added: “I would never use the word stillborn, he was not stillborn he was decapitated.“I was pregnant, my first pregnancy I wasn’t sure what was going on and I was told it was the safest place possible.“Nobody explained the plan or risks associated. It was like disorganised chaos and I was scared.”The tribunal panel will now decide whether or not Laxman should be served with a formal warning."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000411166735.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"these incredible photographs looked like theyre photoshopped but theyre totally genuine","story":"However despite the optical illusions and bizarre elements, they are all totally genuine.In a strange snap a boat looks like it is floating in mid air metres above inviting blue water.And in another mind-blowing image a huge pink wave threatens to take out a vessel off the coast of Australia.A teenager manages to walk on water in one shot, while a boat appears to emerge out of a cloud in the San Fransisco sky in another.All of the pictures look like they have been photoshopped, but they havent been doctored at all..."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408822955.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"labour refuses to refund supporters who bought 35 tickets to jezfest music event before the party started giving them away free","story":"Tickets to next weekend’s Labour Live event are being handed out to party members after organisers failed to sell out the 20,000-capacity venue.And Labour is also putting on a fleet of free coaches to bus in supporters from all around the country, in a bid to avoid embarrassment.The festival in North London will feature a mixture of political speeches and musical acts, as well as a union-sponsored silent disco and a feminist DJ set.Last month it was revealed that trade union Unite had bought up 1,000 tickets and was giving them away to members because sales were going so badly.And now it’s emerged that local Labour parties have been handed free tickets to pass on to local activists.News that supporters were going to the event for free led to some attendees asking for a refund for their £35 tickets.One activist tweeted: “Is there a process to try and reclaim costs?

The party published amendments to the flagship EU (Withdrawal Bill), which returns to the Commons on Tuesday. In a softening of its position, Labour calls for common minimum standards, rights and protections with Brussels, and “full access to the internal market of the European Union, underpinned by shared institutions and regulations”. The party still rules out membership of the European Economic Area - an option many of its backbenchers, such as one-time leadership hopeful Chuka Umunna, want left on the table.  But the fresh move will be seen as an attempt to quell a potential backbench rebellion over the EEA, which threatens to embarrass Jeremy Corbyn .   It is understood Labour MPs will be ordered to abstain in a crunch vote on EEA membership. The UK would still quit the European Court of Justice, with a new arbitration panel set-up between the UK and EU to settle disputes. Labour would not sign up to freedom of movement - a key pillar of single market membership - and wants to negotiate a new deal on migration. Instead, it wants a new “comprehensive” customs union - a clear dividing line with the Conservatives. Theresa May has insisted the UK will leave the existing customs union and not join a new one.   Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: “Labour will only accept a Brexit deal that delivers the benefits of the single market and protects jobs and living standards.  “Unlike the Tories, Labour will not sacrifice jobs and the economy in the pursuit of a reckless and extreme interpretation of the referendum result. “Existing single market agreements that the EU has negotiated with third countries, including Norway, are bespoke deals negotiated with the EU to serve the best interests of those countries. “We need to learn from them and negotiate our own more ambitious agreement, which serves our economic interests and which prevents a hard border in Northern Ireland. “Two years on from the referendum it is clear that the Government has no plan for how it will protect jobs and the economy, and guarantee no hard border in Northern Ireland. “Labour’s amendment, along with a commitment to negotiate a new comprehensive customs union with the EU, is a strong and balanced package that would retain the benefits of the single market. “Parliament should have the opportunity to debate and vote on it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"labour tory mps share experiences","story":"NewsLabour and Tory MPs share experiences of abortion in emotionally charged speeches\"We are not criminals\"\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporterNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent18:51, 5 JUN 2018Updated19:09, 5 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLabour and Tory MPs have shared their experiences of abortion, in an emotionally charged debate in the House of Commons. Tory Heidi Allen spoke of how she was ill when she made the decision to have an abortion, during a debate on reforming the law in Northern Ireland. And Labour’s Jess Philips recalled her own experience, as well as sharing stories of Northern Irish women who travelled for terminations, insisting: “We are not criminals.” Heidi Allen’s voice wobbled as she told MPs: “I was ill when I made the incredibly hard decision to have a termination. I was having seizures every day, I wasn’t even able to control my own body let alone care for a new life.  “So Mr Speaker are you seriously telling me that in a civilised world rape, incest or a foetus that is so badly deformed that it could never live are not sufficient grounds for a woman to have the power to decide for herself that she shouldn’t make that decision. “No, enough. “Very suddenly and unexpectedly we have a window of opportunity before us. Whether you feel that window has opened as a consequence of no functioning administration in Northern Ireland or because a neighbouring referendum was so close and so relevant as to be impossible to ignore, or simply because you feel the glaring light of equality and human rights illuminating the women of northern Ireland. “This has become their moment and they will have my unequivocal support.” Jess Phillips recalled how the last satnav journey of a hire car she recently collected at Birmingham Airport was to the Calthorpe Clinic in the city. She explained: The place I myself had been for an abortion a decade previously. I shuddered at the thought of the woman who had hired the car before me, not to go about her working life but to go and do something I took completely for granted - myself and (Heidi Allen, Conservative MP for South Cambridgeshire) are not criminals.  Ms Phillips said last week she asked Northern Irish women to get in touch with their stories of travelling to England, Scotland and Wales. She said: Today I am them, here are some of the extracts. As Ms Phillips outlined their stories, MPs were told they said: It was Christmas Eve, I was with friends at a party. I stepped outside for a breath of air and I was raped. My mum had to book the flights, book me into a clinic. This all took money. I was from a working-class family, we had to borrow it.

The ComRes survey reveals a staggering 82% would be willing to pay 1p more in National Insurance contributions if the money went directly to the health service. The findings will pile pressure on Theresa May to pump more money into the cash-strapped NHS. In a warning to the Prime Minister, the poll also shows voters are more likely to back the party at the next election which pledges extra funds for health and social care. Four in five adults (82%) said they supported the 1p increase if the money raised - as much as \u0026pound11billion - was ring fenced to fund the NHS.  Almost as many Tory voters (81%) as Labour voters (86%) supported the tax rise. The poll also shows a third of voters (33%) would probably change their vote at the next general election in favour of a party which promised additional funding for health and social care. And 18% would definitely switch to a party which pledged extra funds.  Voters also give a damning verdict on the Conservatives’ handling of the NHS since they came to power. More than half of all adults think the quality of service in the NHS has declined since 2010 (55%), 28% say it has stayed the same and just one in ten (9%) think it has improved. Among Tory voters 45% say the NHS has declined, 37% say it has stayed the same and 14% believe it has got worse. People in England are more likely to have a negative view on their health service than those in SNP-run Scotland and Wales, where it is run by Labour.  Three quarters of people (75%) in the North East of England say the NHS has got worse, 56% in London and 65% in Yorkshire and Humber. In Scotland 48% say the quality of healthcare has declined since 2010 and in Wales, 45%. The Mirror’s poll was conducted after Gordon Brown called for a repeat of the 1p hike in National Insurance contributions to raise \u0026pound11billion for the NHS. The former Prime Minister warned the health service is in “mortal danger” and could struggle to survive in its present form without an emergency injection of funds similar to the 1p rise he introduced as Chancellor in 2002.  The NHS will soon need an extra \u0026pound40billion of funding a year, rising to \u0026pound95billion by the 2030s. At the same time it is having to cater for an ageing population which see more than 4.4million people aged 65 or over by 2033-34 Britain’s most senior doctors last night (TUE) welcomed the poll findings and called for “urgent” action to implement the 1p tax rise. Dr Kailash Chand, honorary vice president of the British Medical Association, said the results showed Brits were “prepared to pay more” to save the NHS.  Speaking to the Daily Mirror in a personal capacity, Dr Chand said: “The results from this poll could not be clearer. “I’m very pleased because they show the vast majority of people in this country still believe the NHS is one of our most precious assets - and they are prepared to pay more to save it. “More people are being seen by the our NHS than ever before, with a rising population and soaring demand with people living longer. “Yet funding of the health service since 2010 has simply not kept pace. “The results of this poll will also send a powerful message to politicians that the public believe the NHS is in such urgent need of funds, they are prepared to pay more for the NHS. “But this cannot be the only solution. The Government must urgently raise real spending rises on the heath service to at least 4% a year.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rafs new f35 lightning ii","story":" But aviation enthusiasts were left disappointed when military chiefs were forced to cancel the sorties.

In a blow to pro-choice campaigners, the UK government made clear it would not railroad through a change from Westminster. Cabinet minister Karen Bradley said: Personally I want to see reform in Northern Ireland - but it is a matter for the people of Northern Ireland. Yet the choice could soon be taken out of Mrs May\u0027s hands anyway. The government has revealed it will not tell Westminster MPs how to vote if the issue is forced onto the table. And today, Tory MP Sarah Wollaston declared such a vote will be inevitable. That means MPs look set to have a chance to change the law, giving thousands of women in Northern Ireland the choice every year.  The row comes as Northern Ireland prepares to become the only place in the UK or Ireland where abortion is illegal. Abortions on the British mainland have been legal since 1967. And terminations will soon become legal in the Republic of Ireland too after a historic referendum vote last month. Calling a three-hour debate today, Labour MP Stella Creasy said: It\u0027s about dignity. The dignity of women to be able to choose for themselves what to do with their own bodies. Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Tony Lloyd added: It\u0027s about people - it\u0027s about women in distress.  London ministers faced pressure to act directly because Northern Ireland currently has no parliament after power-sharing broke down. Ms Bradley said it was a matter of conscience, adding: A free vote on this issue in this House would be afforded if the matter of abortion comes before the House again, and the same applies in Northern Ireland. But she said Westminster must not disenfranchise the 1.8million people who live in Northern Ireland. She added: The Government\u0027s priority remains to urgently re-establish strong, inclusive, devolved government at the earliest opportunity.

New arrangements can be put in place in time but the “clock is ticking”, MPs were told. Chiefs from ports in France and Belgium told the Commons Treasury Committee they needed more clarity about what will happen after Britain quits the EU in March 2019.  Port of Calais deputy chief executive Benoit Rochet said: “The most important problem is we know that there is Brexit but we don’t exactly know what Brexit means.”  Asked if his port would be ready by 2021, Mr Rochet said he had no choice, but he added: “The clock is running, time is running.”  Port of Zeebrugge boss Joachim Coens believed it was vital an agreement on future customs arrangements was in place by the time the proposed transition period kicks in next March. He said: “The transition period of two years if fine, provided we know from the beginning of that transition period what we have to do.  “If this transition period means uncertainty during the transition period, then we will never be ready, never. It is not possible.” John Keefe, director of public affairs at Getlink, which runs the Channel Tunnel, said the firm was still waiting for clarity from the Government. “In order to make our contingency planning we need to have a direction to go in,” he said.

Joanne Wall, 48, had mentioned the almost-invisible bump on her nose in passing to her doctor while visiting them over an unrelated issue. She was shocked to find out that the spot was, in fact, skin cancer . Following her diagnosis in March, the gran-of-two underwent facial surgery to cut out the disease and stretch skin from her cheek across her nose. She has now been left with a vivid bumpy, red scar in the shape of a heart across her nose, and her confidence when out in public has been knocked.  Despite her upcoming wedding to partner Craig Middlebrook, 49, in September, brave Joanne is positive surgery was the right treatment option to take. She says she couldn\u0027t have done it without her husband-to-be by her side. The bride, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, said: I would have lived with this for years if it hadn\u0027t flared up during my doctor\u0027s appointment. I don\u0027t know what would have happened. I had had this little blotch visible on my nose for some years - it was so tiny that it wasn\u0027t visible to anybody else. Because it was so small and unnoticeable I didn\u0027t think it could be anything bad. I used to assume maybe it was a spot that hadn\u0027t come through yet. I used to squeeze it. I thought it was a blocked pore and that it would go away. I went to the doctor for something unrelated and I asked him to have a look at it. I was a bit panicky with the diagnosis but at the time he did reassure me.  He said, \u0027I know cancer is a scary word but this one is the best type to get\u0027. A consultant diagnosed Joanne\u0027s \u0027blocked pore\u0027 as a 3mm basal cell carcinoma (BCC) cutaneous nodule with telangiectasia. He suggested several different treatment options including radiotherapy, but the gran opted to have surgery. She was booked in to have a bilateral cheek-to-nose advancement flap, where surgeons would cut out the nodule and stretch the skin across her nose to cover up the gap. She said: I always thought I had a pretty high pain threshold. But the pain afterwards was horrendous. I would sleep sitting up constantly. There was a constant throbbing of my nose and behind my eyes. I\u0027ve never known anything like it. The people that go through rhinoplasty - I take my hat off to them. My problem at the moment is that foundations just settle into the scars and make it more prominent. When it\u0027s on your face it\u0027s the first thing that people see.  She recalled how a stranger on one occasion asked her if she had been bitten by a dog. It has knocked my confidence. It\u0027s quite a lot to get your head around, she said. I do have days where I think to myself should I have left it until after the wedding? But although at times I hate looking in the mirror, the unconditional support and love from my partner, who tells me I\u0027m beautiful no matter what, gets me through. Although Joanne briefly used sunbeds, she believes her cancer dates back to sun exposure in her childhood. Later in life, she says she was always careful to use sun cream and even used to be laughed at by her friends for using SPF 50. But she claims sun protection just wasn\u0027t thought of when she was a little girl. Joanne said: The consultant said it could have been sun damage from when I was a child. I was born in 1970 and people weren\u0027t really sun aware back then. I can never remember my mum buying sun cream or putting sunscreen on me.

Philip Muspratt started decorating his house with the empty cans and bottles in 2005, creating ornate patterns around the doors and windows of the semi-detached home. The artistically-minded lager fan, who passed away in 2015 aged 63, even built a water feature and BBQ in the back garden of the Hartlepool home on Raby Road. While many neighbours reportedly admired his decorating achievements, some saw the beer cans as an eyesore on the street.  The home even featured in a 52-minute documentary in 2012 called \u0027The Can House\u0027, the Hartlepool Mail reported. In recent years, Hartlepool Council began demolishing much of the estate to make way for new builds. But despite numerous attempts to move them on, the Muspratt family refused to give up their unique looking home, turning down a number of offers from the council, reports claim. But now they have seemingly left the house and all of its beer bottles behind with pictures showing its windows boarded up. Metal mesh is also over the doors and a fence has been erected outside.

Groom Nathan Rees has slammed the airline for destroying his stag do, saying he will be taking legal action against them and that their cabin crew should be sacked. He has accused employees of “making a mountain of a molehill”. But a fellow passenger on the flight, from Bristol to Prague, Czech Republic, claims some members of the \u0027alcohol-fuelled\u0027 stag party treated employees in a disgraceful way. The passenger, who did not wish to be named, told Wales Online: “The way in which the staff were treated by this drink fuelled party was nothing short of disgraceful.  Were you on the flight? Email webnews@trinitymirror     They had managed to urinate before the flight took off, but did so over the bathroom floor at the front of the plane, causing it to come under the door near the food storage area. “When the flight attendant clarified that general manners would be required to get the flight off the ground, saying the flight would be dry, the reaction of the affected party was to verbally abuse the flight attendants.” Members of the group have also been accused of treating the plane like a nightclub. More than 140 people, including children, were left disappointed after the flight from Bristol Airport to the Czech capital was cancelled on Friday following a delay. EasyJet has since explained that while the official reason for the flight’s cancellation was adverse weather conditions, it was the behaviour of some passengers which meant the flight could not leave on time, when the weather was fine.  But despite the cancellation, it appears Nathan\u0027s stag party eventually made it to the Czech capital, with pictures showing them posing together in the city. Yesterday, husband-to-be Nathan, from Treharris, South Wales, hit out at cabin crew, calling for them to be sacked and accusing them of overreacting. But a witness described another version of events. “The attendant said upon the ejection of one very drunk individual that there had been reports from other passengers that they had been swearing loudly with no regard for families of children on board, and had been play fighting with each other, they said. “Once the party was ejected from the plane, almost every single one verbally abused the flight attendant on disembarking. In short - drunk stag do has ruined the flight for many, then has audacity to blame the staff for their actions.” An easyJet spokeswoman said: “EasyJet was required to cancel flight EZY6267 from Bristol to Prague on June 1 due to a group of passengers behaving disruptively on board which caused a delay - the flight was further delayed and then cancelled due to adverse weather conditions.

Dylan Harris was a seven-year-old schoolboy when he started filling his ‘Mexico 86’ album. He spent hours swapping stickers with classmates in the playground but failed to get the full set. But dedicated Dylan kept his bundle of ‘swaps’ and vowed to one day finish the iconic album. He spent the next three decades tirelessly searching for the players he needed to complete the book.  His big break came with the launch of niche websites, allowing collectors to swap their stickers online. Dylan, now 39, quickly began filling his album - replacing his ‘gots’ with sought after ‘needs’. He sourced one sticker from a collector 4,800 miles away in Venezuela, South America.  For the last three years one sticker eluded Dylan - the relatively unheard of French goalkeeper Albert Rust. But last month he tracked it down 1,500 miles away in Italy - finally completing the iconic sticker book. Incredibly he finished the book without spending any money, instead relying on ‘swaps’.  Dylan, from Wigan, said: “After the World Cup I was stuck with a half empty album and a big pile of swaps I was unable to exchange. “I figured I\u0027d keep them just in case there was ever anyone to swap them with in the future. “Then, in the early 2000s, websites started to appear where people would swap their old stickers online.  “I slowly started to find the occasional person to make a handful of swaps with, but it was a long drawn out process.” Bobby Robson’s England were infamously knocked out in the quarter-finals after the ‘Hand of God’ game against Argentina. Argentina, captained by Diego Maradona, went on to lift the trophy by beating West Germany 3-2 in the final. Dylan is now trying to complete a Panini album from the 1970 World Cup, which was held in Brazil.

For one of the nation’s best loved dressings has fallen out of favour with modern Brits as just 14% drizzle it over their lettuce, cucumber and tomatoes. According to research by the snack giant, the under 30s prefer to slather it over tuna, ham or cheese in sandwiches or use it as an alternative to mayonnaise for chips. Launched in 1914 specifically for the UK market, the condiment with a signature tang, took eight years to perfect for British tastebuds.  But the bottles are set for a dramatic makeover as American owner Kraft Heinz revealed it no longer reflects the UK’s changing palette. Heinz is now working with trendy London design agency Jones Knowles Ritchie on a revamp after revealing the traditional salad dressing’s name did not “fairly represent the product’s ingredients or usage occasions”. A spokesperson told trade journal The Grocer: “As a market leading business, Kraft Heinz continues to audit its portfolio in order to meet the needs of consumers. “There are consumers now who haven’t grown up with the brand in the household and just don’t know about the iconic zingy flavour or what to eat it with.” New look bottles are expected to hit supermarket shelves in September with the name change aimed at younger shoppers.

In her passionate response to the cosmetics giant\u0027s campaign, the cop admits that she is indeed \u0027paid to lie\u0027 - before listing several lies that she has told on the job. Recalling one heartbreaking instance where she spent eight hours of a 10-hour shift cradling a baby girl in her arms, she describes how she whispered an untruth to her. Her mother was in police custody for stabbing her father. Social Services were too stretched to attend, she writes in her powerful message, shared on Facebook . I used my own money to buy her milk and nappies. A member of the public remonstrated with me when they saw me buying these supplies, said I was \u0027wasting taxpayers\u0027 money doing my shopping when I should have been serving the public\u0027. I rocked that baby to sleep, her tear stained cheek on mine. To read the officer\u0027s response, scroll down  I whispered to her, I promised her she would be fine. She wasn’t. She is now a teenager my colleagues deal with her daily. She is not fine. I lied. Referring to another incident, the officer tells Lush - which has defended its campaign and denied being \u0027anti-police\u0027 - how she talked a suicidal man down from a balcony. She says she convinced him that he had everything to live for. He came down. I saved his life that night, she writes. I referred him to the appropriate agencies to support him through his crisis. He engaged with Mental Health Services for a while. He killed himself the following year. He left a suicide note saying he didn’t have anything to live for. I lied. She then goes on to describe her first \u0027sudden death\u0027 as a then-police constable. I was 23 and the male that passed away was 21, she says. I performed CPR whilst waiting for paramedics to attend. Any opportunities to save his life failed and he was pronounced dead. I checked his whole body for any suspicious activity and then I confirmed his death to his parents and his younger siblings. This is not an anti-state/anti-police campaign. We are aware that the police forces of the UK are doing an increasingly difficult and dangerous job whilst having their funding slashed. We fully support them in having proper police numbers, correctly funded to fight crime, violence and to be there to serve the public at our times of need.  This campaign is not about the real police work done by those front line officers who support the public every day - it is about a controversial branch of political undercover policing that ran for many years before being exposed.  Our campaign is to highlight this small and secretive subset of undercover policing that undermines and threatens the very idea of democracy. There is an age old understanding that our government and public institutions are there to protect and preserve the rights and safety of the public.  In the case of these secretive undercover units, their work went well beyond the boundaries of acceptable police tactics and is now the subject of an ongoing public inquiry, which was instigated by Theresa May during her time as Home Secretary when the scale and scope of the breaches of protocols started to become clear.  This public inquiry needs help from the public to keep it on track and ensure that this one opportunity for full honesty and disclosure is not lost or squandered. All citizens should be concerned when human rights are abandoned by those in power. The police themselves have admitted in their public apology to seven of the females deceived into long-term relationships with police spies, that these actions were a violation of the women’s human rights, an abuse of police power and caused significant trauma”. In a recent court case the police admitted the actions amounted to inhumane and degrading treatment breaching Article 3 of the European Declaration of Human Rights. Those victims are now asking that the public inquiry demands that the undercover units release a full list of the undercover names used by their operatives, release a list of which campaign groups were targeted, and also that they release the information and data entries they hold on individuals whose lives and homes were infiltrated during these operations. Without this full disclosure there is no way of knowing the full extent of what happened during the dark years of this renegade secret policing operation - and that full disclosure might not happen unless the public demand it.  It was the first dead body I had seen since my own Grandad had died. This happened 19 years ago. I can still smell the air freshener in that house. My sergeant asked me if I was okay. I was not okay. I lied. The woman, who has made her way up the ranks from constable to inspector over her 16-year career, also recalls a number of other instances where she lied while at work. Her message, addressed to Lush, was shared on the UK Cop Humour Facebook page . She tells the cosmetics firm: I have seen your front window display and the accusation that as a police officer I am \u0027Paid to Lie\u0027. I have given this considerable thought over the last 24 hours. I have looked over my 16-year career, from Constable to Inspector, and I must say that I agree with you wholly and passionately, because I am indeed \u0027Paid to Lie\u0027. She later adds: I lie to those I try to help, to my own colleagues and to my friends and family. I am not alone and I am sure that my colleagues reading this would agree they have done the same. Lush has said it is simply shining a light on intrusive, abusive, political policing amid an ongoing public inquiry into undercover officers\u0027 secretive activities.  However, the officer says: Whilst I can see there may have been good sentiment behind your latest campaign, it has been appallingly executed. Believe me nobody wants to see a corrupt practise or a corrupt officer held to account more than a decent hard-working officer. Unfortunately, your abhorrent window display depicts something far more sinister. The policewoman\u0027s response comes amid a huge backlash over posters that recently popped up in windows of Lush stores and appeared on the firm\u0027s website . Some have accused the company, based in Poole, Dorset, of being anti-police- while supporters of police have called for a boycott of the chain. However, Lush has defended the campaign and denied the allegations that it is anti-police. The campaign includes window displays featuring the slogan Paid to lie, along with police tape and a split image of a man wearing a police hat and a nose piercing. It uses the hashtag spycops on social media and is due to run through most of June.  The campaign, which has been reported to the Advertising Standards Authority, takes aim at undercover policing and in particular the activities of secretive Special Demonstration Squad of the Met Police, which infiltrated protest groups from the 1960s to the 1990s. The chain is supporting women who it says were tricked into sexual relationships with undercover officers, drawing attention to human rights abuses against them, and pressuring the government to make the inquiry more transparent. A police investigation - Operation Herne - was set up in October 2011 to look into allegations made against the SDS, including using dead children’s identities. Police were forced to apologise and pay out \u0026pound425,000 to a woman who had a child with Special Branch detective Bob Lambert, who was working undercover and spying on a protest group of which she was a member. The Undercover Policing Inquiry into undercover policing in Britain is now taking place, but is still in its early stages despite opening three years ago. In a press release, Mark Constantine OBE, Lush\u0027s co-founder and managing director, said: Confidence in the police will never be restored until this public inquiry does its job”.  West Midlands Police Crime Commissioner David Jamieson earlier slammed the campaign, calling it crass and saying it was written by an inexperienced PR consultant. He said: This is a crass and insensitive campaign. Police officers put their lives on the line day in day out. Lush have needlessly waded into a highly complex area. He added: This firm relies on the police to do their job tackling shoplifting and other crimes against businesses. This is a puerile and immature campaign, clearly written by an inexperienced PR consultant. I will certainly be considering where I buy Mrs Jamieson’s bath bombs from in future. Others may do the same. Che Donald, vice-chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, was also among those to have blasted the campaign. He tweeted: This is very poorly thought out campaign @LushLtd \u0026amp damaging to the overwhelmingly large majority of police who have nothing to do with this undercover enquiry. I will now clear my house of any of your products and my family and friends will never use them again. #FlushLush.  Lynne Owens, director general of the National Crime Agency, added: Undercover policing is a highly specialised \u0026amp regulated tactic undertaken by brave officers to protect the public from the most serious offenders. I’d encourage @LushLtd to visit @NCA_UK to receive a contemporary briefing. The Advertising Standards Authority said on Twitter: We\u0027ve received complaints about the @LushLtd police campaign and are currently assessing the complaints. Lush are not under investigation at this stage. Lush explained on its website how it has partnered with the PSOOL and COPS groups to get their message spread further through the campaign. The groups have started an online petition asking new Home Secretary Sajid Javid to make major changes to the inquiry, set up in 2015 by then Home Secretary Theresa May, to improve transparency. They wrote: The public inquiry is in danger of collapsing due to secrecy and derailment. We urge you to listen to the victims and instruct a panel of experts to assist the Chair, extend the inquiry to Scotland, disclose the cover names of the officers, the names of the groups they spied on and release the personal files of victims. Lush stores are stocked with postcards that customers can sign and send to the Home Secretary to back the campaigners.  Releasing the information will allow more people to come forward with evidence at the inquiry, which only covers England and Wales, the campaigners argue. In a statement about its campaign, Lush said: This is not an anti-state/anti-police campaign. We are aware that the police forces of the UK are doing an increasingly difficult and dangerous job whilst having their funding slashed. It added: This campaign is not about the real police work done by those front line officers who support the public every day - it is about a controversial branch of political undercover policing that ran for many years before being exposed.

I agree with you wholly: Policewoman\u0027s response The emotional message, purportedly written by a long-serving policewoman, was shared on the UK Cop Humour Facebook page yesterday morning. It reads: Dear Lush UK, I have seen your front window display and the accusation that as a police officer I am \u0027Paid to Lie\u0027. I have given this considerable thought over the last 24 hours.

From the 1950s to the 80s, the Royal photographer has enjoyed unprecedented access to the Queen and her family - and the results are amazing.  In his impressive portfolio are images of Prince Charles meeting the cast of MASH, the Queen and her mum having a natter and a very young Princess Diana and Fergie at a horse event in 1983. Perhaps the most striking image, however, is one which was taken around the time Prince Andrew was about 12. In it, we see him and a very young Sarah Ferguson meet - possibly for the first time.  Fast-forward 14 years, and the pair were saying their wedding vows in Westminster Cathedral. In the foreground is a young Prince Edward playing with the Queen\u0027s niece Sarah Armstrong-Jones, now Lady Sarah Chatto, while the Queen appears to be telling him to calm down.  There are also numerous informal snaps of Princess Anne, Princess Margaret and Prince Philip, as well as a young, bearded Prince Charles bearing a strong resemblance to Prince Harry.   Even prior to his career, Scott lead a fascinating life. A Yugoslavian aristocrat by birth who fled his native Serbia during the Second World War after it was occupied by the Nazis, his actual name was Colonel Vassa Voynovich. He commanded a platoon on the Russian front aged just 17 during the First World War and arrived in London via Paris, smuggling important intelligence reports in 1941.  Once settled in a suite at the luxury hotel Claridge\u0027s, he became the private secretary of King Peter of Yugoslavia, who was also living in exile there. After several years working for King Peter, he established himself as a photographer, taking his small Leica camera everywhere, including weekend country house parties. It wasn\u0027t long before a young Queen Elizabeth spotted his work as he was a friend of Sir \u0027Jock\u0027 Colville, her private secretary.  Through Colville, Elizabeth requested Voynovich photograph her in uniform during one of her first Trooping the Colour ceremonies.

A poll of 2,000 adults revealed the process of finding something you like and then buying it involves an hour and 20 minutes of mulling things over and getting the opinions of two other people. Shoppers will also watch videos of celebrities or models wearing the items to see how it looks in real life before deciding whether or not to buy something. And while men are just as thorough with their shopping research, women are twice as likely to screenshot a picture of themselves in an outfit to friends, while one in 10 will send a video of themselves to a girlfriend for approval. The stats emerged in a study by Brightcove and also found one in six shoppers are more likely to buy something if they can watch a video of it being worn or used.  Mark Blair of Brightcove said: “When we are shopping and parting with our hard-earned money, it can be a long time between seeing something we like and actually deciding to buy it. “It’s often not as simple as just walking into a shop or going on to a website and buying the first thing you see. “Technology has changed the way we shop and thanks to video and social media, it’s now easier than ever before to get the opinions of others or see clothes and accessories captured in ways other than the still images we were once used to. “Video allows us to find out even more about a product before we buy it, meaning we can be completely sure that it is right for us.”  Researchers found the first key stage of buying a new outfit is checking the website in question offers free delivery. Brits will then go on to surf several other sites before reading relevant reviews. A savvy 34 per cent of shoppers will then hunt for money-off vouchers, in a bid to save the pennies and bag a bargain. The fifth most popular stage of shopping involves filling the basket with clothes, with a view to returning later once a decision has been made. Three in 10 shoppers will continue to compare their in-basket items with other purchases, while 22 per cent will add items to wish-lists and the same percentage will make the effort to go in-store to try clothes on.

Whether we\u0027ve driven or schlepped from the nearest bus stop/train station, when the rest of us enter our homes, we simply walk through the front door.  Not the royals though.   For the residents of Kensington Palace , they do things a little differently.   These glamorous inhabitants include the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (and family), Prince Harry and Meghan Markle as well as Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank .  Instead of just driving up to their front doors and rummaging in their bags for their keys like the rest of us, they have a much more sneaky and elaborate way of getting in.   When coming back to Kensington Palace, the Royal family shun the street entrance and are literally flown  into Hyde Park in the grounds of the palace.  A chauffeured car then waits for the royals and whisks them off to their home, while armed police officers stand guard on the lawn.  When the Queen went to visit her newest great-grandson, Prince Louis, last month she arrived on the grounds in a helicopter. However, this isn\u0027t just a case of the royals being super-decadent because of who they are.

Convicted drug dealer Sam Walker, from Liverpool, mocked police on camera saying: Better luck trying to catch me when I go out of the country next time, Merseyside Police.” The criminal, who has clocked up more than 100 crimes, fled to Sierra Leone using private jets and a cargo ship. Despite his criminal past, Walker is considered a hero in the country\u0027s capital Freetown after paying for fresh water pipes and tanks to be fitted in the area. Walker claimed he faced being jailed in the UK for skipping court over breaking an alleged driving ban.  His video, shown to pals on Snapchat and Instagram, was titled: “How to get out of UK when you\u0027re wanted by police. Can’t use an airport coz they will nick you.” The footage shows Walker flying in a private plane to Belgium. He then takes another personal flight to Barcelona, Spain, before hitching a “little 14-hour boat trip” to Morocco. He is then driven across Africa for three days - across the Sahara, Mauritania and Senegal - to Guinea before taking another boat to Freetown.  Walker, whose grandfather was from Sierra Leone, claims he was forced to evade police because his court date clashed with the departure of a shipping container from the UK filled with charity donations. He now faces a longer prison stretch when he returns home - but in the meantime has enjoyed time with Sierra Leone’s vice-president, Mohammed Juldeh Jalloh. Speaking from the country, Walker insisted: “I was in a Catch-22. I had to fulfil my promise to the people in the slums, knowing full well that when am caught I will get the maximum sentence of four months in jail plus two months for missing my court date.  “But to me the people were more important. The court date could wait. Sometimes in life you have to do the wrong thing in the eyes of the law in order to do the right thing.” Walker has been in and out of prison since his teenage years and made front page headlines when he publicly threatened former Everton and England star Barkley. The sinister Twitter message, sparked in a row over an ex-girlfriend of the footballer, said: “Inbox me a number for you, ya little rat! “You know wot this is about so don’t play stupid or your footie career will come to an end!” He now claims to have spent thousands on installing fresh water pipes for the slums of Sierra Leone after seeing “men, women and children dying”.  Walker said: “I managed to convince them to start fitting a fresh water line for them and I paid for it there and then to make sure it was 100% being done. They have installed a 5,000 litre water tank in the slums so no woman or child has to ever drink dirty water again.” Yet Walker, who has been in and out of prison since a teenager, denies he is a changed person despite the charitable mission. He admitted: “I have not just woke up and changed overnight. I am still the same person and still do what I do. “But that does not mean I can’t help the people who need it and give them a voice. “I know when I come back to the UK I will be arrested at the airport and put straight in jail. “I can deal with that knowing that I have fulfilled my promise to the people in the slums by giving them a container full of toys, clothes and food and given them fresh clean water so no man, woman or child ever has to risk their lives by drinking dirty sewage water again.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather met office tells","story":"NewsUK weather: Met Office tells Brits to expect MORE thunderstorms days after 60,000 lightning strikesHayfever sufferers will also be badly affected this week as the perfect storm of conditions hits the south of the UK\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByKelly-Ann Mills19:08, 5 JUN 2018Updated19:10, 5 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMore thunderstorms are set to batter Britain bringing with them rain and lightning.

But tourists have been warned to avoid certain areas unless it\u0027s essential, with the threat of terror attacks in several places in Europe and beyond. Where is safe to go and where should you avoid travelling to? What precautions should you take while travelling? Here we take a look at the UK Government’s travel advice for destinations across the globe. Turkey  The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advises against all travel to within 10 km of the border with Syria and to the city of Diyarbakir. The FCO said: Fighting in Syria continues in areas close to the Turkish border and there remains a heightened risk of terrorism in the region. They warned that presidential and parliamentary elections will take place on 24 June 2018 which may result in rallies and demonstrations around the country. You should avoid large gatherings and follow the advice of the local authorities, the advice added. Added security measures may apply to flights from Turkey to the UK.  Egypt Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Egypt, the FCO says. People have been told they should always be vigilant and follow advice of Egyptian authorities and travel companies. Threats to western nationals, institutions and businesses have been posted on websites and social media. The FCO has advised against travel - unless it\u0027s essential- to the Governorate of South Sinai with the exception of the area within the Sharm el Sheikh perimeter barrier, which includes the airport and the areas of Sharm el Maya, Hadaba, Naama Bay, Sharks Bay and Nabq. But people have been advised against all but essential travel by air to or from Sharm el Sheikh. Places to avoid also include the area west of the Nile Valley and Nile Delta regions, excluding the coastal areas between the Nile Delta and Marsa Matruh.  Spain Barcelona and other areas in the region of Catalonia have seen large gatherings because of the political developments in the region. And the Government has warned more demonstrations could take place. They may occur with little or no warning and even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can escalate and turn confrontational, the FCO says. You should exercise caution if you’re in the vicinity. Demonstrations may also cause some disruption and delays to transport services. The FCO have also urged people to not take unnecessary risks, especially when under the influence of alcohol after several deaths as a result from people falling from balconies. They also warned people to be aware of the existence of street crime as thieves tend to target money and passports.  GreeceTerrorist attacks in Greece can’t be ruled out, the FCO says. Brits have been told to apply for a free European Health Insurance Card and to carry their passport or photo ID showing British nationality at all times. Some medical costs are not covered by the European Health Insurance Card so people have been told to get comprehensive medical and travel insurance before going to Greece. The FCO says: Greek police won’t accept rowdy or indecent behaviour, especially where excessive drinking is involved. Greek courts impose heavy fines or prison sentences on people who behave indecently. Your travel insurance may not cover you after drinking.  France It is very likely that terrorists carry out attacks in France, according to the Goverment. The country has had ongoing threats by Islamist terrorist groups. The French government has advised the public to be vigilant and has reinforced its security measures. People should also be aware that a number of strikes are being planned on SNCF trains until June 28 and should check travel advice.  USA Terror attacks in the USA are very likely and could be indiscriminate, the Government has warned. People should be vigilant and check reports in the press. The US Department of Homeland Security is to start implementing separate enhanced security screening procedures for all commercial flights to the US.

From learners on the motorway to stricter MOTs, there\u0027s a lot to take in. We\u0027ve teamed up with the experts at Halfords to give Mirror readers the lowdown on everything you need to know. Our team have been through the official information and below are some of the most important things to remember. Get your car in shape before the MOT   The new rules for MOTs introduced this month mean that there are new categorisation for problems. The new MOT system uses the following classifications: * Dangerous : this is a fail and you are not allowed to drive the car. * Major : this is a fail but you can drive to a garage to have the issue fixed. * Minor : the car has passed but there are issues that need fixing. The car isn\u0027t dangerous or polluting the environment. * Advisory : the car has passed but the issue could become more serious in future - monitor and repair if necessary * Meet the standard: the car meets the minimum legal standard - make sure it continues to meet the standard. If you get ‘major’ or ‘dangerous’ then you\u0027ll fail. Dangerous faults must be repaired before you can drive the car again. Major faults mean that you could drive the car to a garage for repairs as long as the car has time left on the existing MOT. Advisory still exists as a category too, so you need to keep a close eye on these. You\u0027ll still pass, but it\u0027s likely that these will become more serious with time.  You can check your car in advance for common MOT fails before you take it to be tested. Doing this means you should be able to fix problems before your test. You can also book a Free Car Check at Halfords which includes:  Bulb Check Wiper Blades Check Battery Check Engine oil level check Windscreen Chip Check Plus Free Screenwash Top Up   It can be somewhat complicated working out what oil you need to buy for your car. (The Mobil Super 3000 , for example, is best suited to engines that have been designed to use a low viscosity (HTHS) motor oil.) The Halfords Oil Finder will tell you all you need to know - just pop in your car details and it will give you suitable oil for topping up. Once you\u0027re ready for your MOT, book with Halfords Autocentre for a 45 per cent discount on the DVSA maximum fee. Common MOT failures  Because the MOT now tests for some new things you\u0027ll want to check these before taking your car in. You must make sure that your tyres are properly inflated. Warning lights on your dashboard that indicate a problem with your brakes are also a reason for the car to fail too, so check for these. Contaminated brake fluid will also be a fail from now on too as will any leaks that pose an environmental risk – like oil from the engine or gearbox. If your car has headlight washers then they must work on cars registered from September 1, 2009. Many MOT fails are quite simple problems to fix. So make sure that you have no chips or cracks in your windscreen. If you do, consider Halfords weRepair service, which will fix a chip for just \u0026pound25 at a time that suits you. It\u0027s also common to fail for a blown car bulb, so check these before you book in a test. Halfords can supply bulbs for all makes and models of car. If you\u0027re not sure if you can fit them yourself – and they can sometimes be very awkward – Halfords will do it for you and it only costs \u0026pound8 for a headlight or \u0026pound5 for other lights. The WeFit service also covers wiper blade fitting from \u0026pound2 or a battery from \u0026pound15. Cars registered for the first time after 1 March 2018 will also need to have working daytime running lights. These cars won’t go through the MOT process until 2021 though, so this is something to be aware of in the future and to add to your pre-MOT checklist. Beware using a phone for navigation  The law on using a mobile is clear: don\u0027t do it. Fines are stiff so don\u0027t take risks here and get a car holder for your phone. The Halfords One Touch Car Mount , above, is priced from \u0026pound8. The fine on the other hand could be as much as \u0026pound1,000 if you go to court, or \u0026pound200 with six points if you\u0027re given a fixed penalty notice. Bear in mind too that you can also get three points if you have an obstructed view of the road. That means you need to take care when mounting your sat nav or mobile phone holder – check this Halfords blog post for more detail. Don’t be tempted to play with your phone when driving. Even when in a mount it’s not legal to do so.  If you want to avoid the risks of having a phone to distract you then a sat nav is an ideal way to stay focused but still get directions. Modern sat navs also feature alerts about heavy traffic and the Garmin Drive , above, even has lifetime map updates, so you\u0027ll never go down a street the wrong way because of out-of-date maps. The Garmin Drive is just \u0026pound79 too (save \u0026pound20).

It was a big move for me.“Bobby Geddes (keeper coach) has been great and the gaffer has been brilliant because he’s put faith in me to put me on the bench and play me in the last game.“That’s the biggest thing for a goalkeeper, having the manager’s faith in you.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/34199517_10160329796320562_5304264978264489984_n.jpg ","title":"dundee people age no barrier as dundonians pick up new instruments with music academy launch","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFrom a four-year-old to a 77-year-old, the visitors to Dundee Music Academy\u0026#8217s opening weekend found age doesn\u0026#8217t matter when it comes to learning an instrument.More than 150 people took up the offer of free music lessons to launch the Academy at Dundee Music Studios last weekend.\u0026#8220The aim was to inspire the people of Dundee and highlight the amazing benefits of music,\u0026#8221 organiser David Gourlay said.\u0026#8220We were very happy with the turn out and the mix of ages was fantastic, from the youngest being four to the oldest 77, we had a great time with a lovely group of people.Music a big part of life for Dundee music tutor\u0026#8220Each person was given the opportunity for free to try as many music lessons as they wanted in guitar, piano, drums, bass and singing.\u0026#8221He said the feedback had been great, with lots of the people who attended booking in the following week for lessons.\u0026#8220But the most important thing for us was seeing the enjoyment and happiness people felt whilst taking their lessons,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220Our team of tutors had a great weekend passing on some of their knowledge and after 22 hours of teaching for free they all agreed that they found it so rewarding that they would do it again!\u0026#8220So we have decided that we should host this type of event numerous times throughout the year.\u0026#8220In fact we noticed that lots of people missed out on the chance to get a free music lesson due to prior commitments and variety of different reasons so we want to offer everyone at any time the chance to book in a try a first lesson for free with any of our tutors.\u0026#8221He said the benefits of playing music were \u0026#8220incredible\u0026#8221.\u0026#8220Everyone loves music, it’s one of life’s greatest gifts but few know just how mentally, physically and emotionally rewarding it is to play an instrument.\u0026#8220Playing an instrument increases memory, enhances coordination, teaches discipline, perseverance and patience, builds confidence, sharpens your concentration, relieves stress and allows self-expression, it creates a sense of achievement as you develop your ability, and there are so many more benefits but most of all, it’s make you happy and everyone deserves to feel happy,\u0026#8221 he said.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/GraduationCropped1170.jpg ","title":"dundee people childhood friends from dundee primary school launch clothing brand","story":"Aimée Keatch and Naomi D’Cruz met at St Joseph’s Primary School and have been best friends since they were five years old.Although they attended different secondary schools, they were re-united at DJCAD when they were both were accepted on the Textile Design course.They explained, “It was the reputation and quality of teaching at DJCAD that first attracted us to apply, and while we were there we both really enjoyed the extensive facilities made available to the students.\u0026#8220Ultimately, it was the support from DJCAD in allowing students to develop their craft that gave us the confidence to pursue With Indigo.”After graduating in June 2017, they decided to travel around Asia together, visiting Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam, and it was during this time they were inspired to begin designing together using their individual talents.“We wanted With Indigo to be a fusion of gifts and fashion that would showcase both of our particular individual skills and give us a unique selling point in a competitive market.\u0026#8220After graduating, we wanted to create a platform for ourselves and future graduates to showcase the unique and individual talents that comes out of DJCAD.”Their current range of products continues on from their degree show work, where they’ve designed and printed their own fabrics to produce various garments – from T-shirts to pinafores.They’ve also created a range of jewellery, pun-filled greetings card and notepads all featuring hand-drawn designs.Going forward, they hope With Indigo will become a platform for future graduates to join and showcase their own abilities, allowing them to sell their own hand-crafted products using the then established With Indigo badge of quality.The website www.withindigo includes With Indigo’s product range as well as an interactive game which gives an insight into a day in the life of a designer working at With Indigo.

I’m a great believer that if you’re good enough, you’re old enough.“I broke into the side at 17, 18. Back then it was almost sink or swim.“You have to have the right mentality and drive about you to survive in the first-team environment because I demand a lot from the boys.“The ones we accelerated into the first team first of all need to be thrown in to understand what it’s like to train at that level and what is expected to hit that first-team pitch.“I’ll find out very quickly if they can cope. Clearly there is a physical aspect and I need to know that should I need it or think he is ready ability-wise, is he physically ready?“There are boys there coming through our Development team and all have been told that in the upcoming season, you have to come in here in pre-season and tell me I am pushing.“There is no barrier. It’s not like ‘you’re only 16 or 17 and you’ve not really cracked it yet’, there’s nothing like that.“Come in for the four weeks of pre-season and blow the webs off it.”There might be no barrier but the level required from these young players and what the manager expects from every player, no matter the age, is extremely high.And it won’t take long for the youngsters to find that out.A prime example is 19-year-old Scott, a prolific goalscorer in the Development League, who featured for the Dark Blues in the final three matches of the last campaign.He came on against Partick Thistle in the last game of the season, replacing Craig Wighton after an hour, but failed to impress his manager.Neil said: “I’ll not tell you what I told Cedwyn after the Partick game but it was pretty stark.“If he is coming into my first team I expect him to score goals, create chances, to run after centre-backs, close down full-backs – he doesn’t get let off because he’s 18 years old.“He’s coming in during the summer and he’s got a short space of time to get in my face and say ‘I’m better than what you’re going to bring in. If you’ve not got anybody in yet, gaffer, I’m your man’.“All the boys that have made an impact in the first team have a real chance but they need to come back and be better than what I’ve got.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b10f80c669bf-e1527838783208.jpg ","title":"ralph signs but striker desired","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee have added left-back Nathan Ralph as their fourth signing of the summer – but a striker is still top of boss Neil McCann’s wishlist.The 25-year-old moves to the Scottish Premiership from the English National League after suffering relegation with Woking last season.And the Tele revealed way back in January that a move for the former Yeovil Town man was likely in the summer.Gaffer Neil, however, is still working on bringing a goalscorer to the club.He’s made no secret of the fact his team were short in the scoring department last season and adding somebody to put the ball in the net would help him achieve the top-six finish he craves for his side.The club have already made a move for Macauley Bonne.The Leyton Orient striker knocked in an impressive 22 goals in the National League last season and has drawn plenty of interest from English league clubs.The Dark Blues tried to get in there early. However, they look to have been priced out of that deal.On Thursday the club did announce a capture in the shape of Ralph on a two-year deal.Moving up from the English non-league, he said: “I know the level is better than what I have been playing at recently so I’m looking to test myself as much as possible.“I feel like I’m good enough to play at this level. I’m excited, looking forward to it.”He also revealed he’d been persuaded to make the move north by new team-mate Roarie Deacon, with both players clients of OYS Sports Management along with Glen Kamara.Ralph added: “I’ve heard a lot of good things about the club.“I spoke to a few people as well, the likes of Roarie Deacon who said it’s a good place to come, play good football and the manager will improve me.“That’s pretty much everything I was looking for.“I am energetic, I like to attack.“I’m a left-back but I like to get forward as well.“I would say I’m decent in the air.“I like to try create when I can, I like getting assists.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":" Ya wee w      Booze-fuelled rammy at Catholic school football match leads to calls for drink ban for parents","story":"                          CALLS have been made to ban alcohol at children\u0027s football matches after a booze-fuelled rammy that has led to the end-of-term football tournament being cancelled."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7875247.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Celtic unveil beginning of   4m stadium upgrade","story":"                          CELTIC yesterday revealed phase one of Parkhead\u0027 \u0026pound4million facelift which aims to make the stadium known throughout the football world as one of the best for spectator experience."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7873438.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Neil Cameron  I like the Ally McCoist of right now -

The intention is to change it to clear glass and make it more attractive entrance.\"The next phase would be to\u0026nbsp refurbish the shop fronts in Market Arcade and make them more in keeping with the building.It is hoped both phases will be able to secure funding from the Academy Street Townscape Heritage Project to regenerate that area of the city centre.With that funding due to finish in 2020, the proposed improvements are at the top of the list of priorities on the market action plan.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe third phase focuses on the market hall itself.\"This is the area potentially most subject to change,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are going to look at having a feasibility study done to see what is physically possible and how much can be developed to create a better and more usable space, better units and a better environment.\"One idea, for example, is to look at whether a mezzanine floor would be possible.\"We also want to try and create a more open area which we could use as a venue, Mrs Murray said.She is particularly keen to see more cafes and restaurants and food units while zoned areas such as a restaurant quarter or a jewellery hub are another possibility.Rents could also be set according to whether units are assessed to be in a strong or weak location.Of the 36 units, 32 are currently occupied and there has\u0026nbsp also been interest from other prospective tenants.\"The Victorian Market is quite unique in Inverness and we need to exploit that,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are trading healthily but we want to maximise our potential.

We\u0026rsquove got the most roads and schools and most of them in the poorest condition. That\u0027 nobody\u0027 fault, that\u0027 our geography.\"She expected both governments to insist that grant support has risen year on year \u0026ndash something the council has consistently disputed.A spokeswoman for the Scottish Government said: \"Highland Council has had more money this year from the Scottish Government despite UK government cuts to our budget. It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding.This is \u0026pound17.1 million more to support services compared to last year taken together with the decision to increase their council tax by three per cent. The local government needs-based funding formula takes into account a number of factors such as rural and island communities, as well as road length and number of school pupils.\"A spokesman for the UK Treasury said: \"We\u0026rsquove helped make the Scottish Parliament one of the most powerful devolved bodies in the world and they have a full range of tax powers to raise funds.\"Tuesday 5 Jun 2018 8:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04105000/04105690.jpg","title":"East of Inverness plans include bid for 3000 new homes","story":"\u0026nbspA VISION for 3000 new homes, three schools and a 30-acre district park for Inverness will be formally unveiled later this week \u0026ndash amid fierce opposition.While public feedback has included optimism about improved transport potential, fears have been raised that a fresh focus on the swathe of farmland between Barn Church Road and the Inverness College UHI could \"undermine investment confidence\" in the nearby Stratton new town project which is already under way.The Inverness East development brief prepared by Highland Council planners will be considered for adoption by city councillors on Thursday.The blueprint \u0026ndash which does not estimate the overall cost \u0026ndash aims to ensure expansion is \"co-ordinated, offering a clear vision and the right facilities to support new communities\".A draft version was approved for consultation last November. Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users. Transport agency HiTrans will consider the provision of a new rail station at Seafield, the campus or Stratton.Discussions are underway with the college and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the \"early delivery\" of sports facilities at the campus. A least one pitch plus associated buildings could cost \u0026pound4.7 million.The expansion also promises to include an upgrade to the busy Inshes roundabout layout.Planning officials are discussing road widening proposals with landowners. Council representatives will attend community council meetings in the coming months to assess local requirements.A 500-space park-and-ride facility was consented as part of the Stratton scheme.The report references a landowner who argued that the brief contradicts an existing development plan and \"fails to recognise Stratton and only refers to potential future development at Ashton Farm\".They also complained that the \"vision map does not reflect the original permission\u0027 town centre at Stratton or the development plan support for it\".Another considers \"Ashton centre\" to be \"an unreasonable competitor location to Stratton\" that \"undermines\" Stratton.It is unclear from the report what long-term employment would be created in the area \u0026ndash an issue raised historically by numerous city councillors who questioned council officials\u0026rsquo aspirations for growth.The report stated: \"Analysis identified that the optimum location for a new centre is at east Ashton.\"This location is, therefore, identified as the core area for new and existing communities to visit as a destination that has footfall generating uses including a new district park, high school and mixed-use centre that includes high-density residential uses.\"It emphasised that the Stratton site does not include provision for a district park or high school with community facilities like those at Inverness Royal Academy.The brief \"does not seek to create competition between Stratton and Ashton\", according to the development planning team.Public feedback has already established an aversion to more development in the area with calls for the focus to instead be on the city centre and brownfield sites, and concern that the recent demand for new homes could stall, leaving a surplus of residential properties.Other responses included a plea that \"pubs should not be allowed\".Smithton and Culloden Community Council chairman David McGrath welcomed the document, with a caveat that it improves access to the nearby Inverness Shopping Park with a short cut for existing residents.A spokesman for the Stratton developer Hazledene said: \"We don\u0026rsquot think it\u0027 appropriate that a competitor town centre should be introduced, as this would add uncertainty and confusion.\"These [Ashton] proposals are early stage proposals and we believe should not be given the same weight as the Stratton permissions already granted.

It’s has been a very, very fast process here.\u0026#8220It’s one of the advantages of the technology we’ve used.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000.

We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity.

By taking part in Walk Your Way you’ll be helping to reduce your own risk of stroke, and the vital funds you’ll raise will help the charity to support more stroke survivors to regain their independence.Sign up to Walk Your Way now: stroke.org.uk/WalkYourWayMichael Lynagh, former Australian rugby union internationalSir,What is it with people who drive cars while doing other things?As a driver I often see people behind the wheel talking on mobile phones, sending texts, touching up make-up in the mirror and, on a few occasions recently, the same man has been shaving while bowling merrily along the A83 trunk road \u0026#8211 while in a van belonging to an Argyll and Bute public agency.It just takes a split second for an accident to happen through losing concentration behind the wheel.Put down your smartphone, make-up bag and electric razor before either the police catch you or an accident happens.Name and address supplied\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"news from the districts week 22","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 31/05/18, 2:16 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Time short to apply for grantsThere is just a week left to apply for community benefit grants from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust.The trust has a stake in the Srondoire Wind Farm and has another arrangement with Renewable Energy Systems Ltd, owners of the Freasdale Wind Farm, both of which will provide community income.Application forms can be found at www.tsct.org.uk to be returned to info@tsct.org.uk or to Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, William Duncan and Co, Barmore Road, Tarbert, PA29 6TW.The closing date for applications is Friday June 8, 2018.Hall on track for summer openingA £12million project to transform the historic Queen\u0026#8217s Hall in Dunoon is on track to host its first public event.A concert by ABBA Mania on July 28 will be the first public event at the venue since it closed for refurbishment in 2015, followed by a sold-out performance by The Proclaimers on Friday August 3.The work is part of the £30million ‘CHORD’ programme to assist regeneration and economic development of five waterfront towns \u0026#8211 Campbeltown, Helensburgh, Oban, Rothesay and Dunoon.Staff are hotel starsThe Loch Melfort Hotel has been awarded four stars by VisitScotlandThe hotel was recognised by the tourism agency as \u0026#8216a well-managed and well-presented property where all guests are assured of a warm west coast welcome and comfortable stay\u0026#8217.Owners Calum and Rachel Ross, said: \u0026#8216This would not have been possible without the hard-work, passion and dedication of our team, who we would like to say a big thank you to.

The Simmentals are hot on their heels with 103 entries, a 10-year record  and an increase from 85 in 2017.

Holsteins total 29 entries, and the Dairy Shorthorn class has seen numbers more than double from 12 to 25.

Children from Ballantrae Primary are set to relocate to Girvan Primary following a major fire at the village school yesterday evening. It is believed that around 30 firefighters were called to the blaze at 8.38pm on Monday.  The fire – contained within the main school building – caused extensive damage to the existing classroom and early years provision at the school. A new extension, which is currently under construction, was unaffected. Fifty-eight P1-P7 children are expected to make the move to Girvan Primary from Thursday, June 7, once suitable arrangements are in place to transport pupils and staff.  Plans are also underway to relocate the 13 early years children to Ballantrae Community Centre, keeping them within the local community. The intention is to introduce the changes for the early years centre from Monday, June 11 however, this will be subject to finalising arrangements with both Ballantrae Community Association and the Care Inspectorate, who will need to register the centre before it can be used. A drop-in session will be held at Ballantrae Community Centre between 4pm-6pm tomorrow (Wednesday) to update parents/carers and to give them the opportunity to ask any questions they may have. Councillor William Grant, South Ayrshire Council’s Portfolio Holder for Lifelong Learning, said: “This is a really sad end to the school year at Ballantrae Primary and I know it will have affected everyone in this tight-knit community. “I’m pleased we have been able to move so quickly to put alternative arrangements in place for children and staff, keeping the loss of education time to an absolute minimum, which is a positive outcome.  “And my thanks to everyone involved in achieving this, especially colleagues at Girvan Primary and Ballantrae Community Centre. “At this time it’s too early for us to have a clear picture of the extent of the damage to the school building and the work that will be involved to bring it back into use. “However, there’s no doubt interim education arrangements will need to run well into the new school year and it could be many months before pupils can return. “Our priority will be to maintain quality learning and teaching for our children during this time and that’s what we will focus on.” Ballantrae Primary’s Head Teacher, Yvonne Templeton, added: “We’re all devastated by what’s happened and really can’t believe it. “Our school is very much at the heart of the community in Ballantrae and I know this will have an impact on everyone not just within the school, but right across our village. “However, we can all be grateful that no one was hurt in the fire. “My focus will be on supporting our children, staff, parents and carers while we’re decanted from the school we know and love, but I know we’ll take the spirit and ethos of Ballantrae Primary wherever we are.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12651122.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_310518bella_03JPG.jpg","title":"bella mani boss claims beauty","story":"NewsBella Mani boss claims beauty empire is safe despite tax collectors swooping inBella Mani - Italian for beautiful hands - has operations in Ayr and Prestwick.

Bella Mani - Italian for beautiful hands - has operations in Ayr and Prestwick. But the large salon in Irvine’s Rivergate mall has been shut. However boss Nigel Howard,47, of Alloway, insists the workforce is safe despite a formal winding up notice. He’s a former Ayr United centre half star who played more than 50 games for the club between 1991 and 94. A petition lodged at Ayr Sheriff Court on behalf of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs wants Bella Mani Salons (Ayr \u0026amp Irvine) Ltd wound up by the court. They also want a liquidator put in place and any parties claiming an interest in the action must get it touch by this Thursday. There are eight branches , some run by differently named companies. Bella Mani Salons (Ayr and Irvine) was launched five years ago with a registered address at the Prestwick Main Street Salon. Bella Mani Salons (Prestwick) has Gabriella Howard as the sole director. The firm has been a salon of the year at the Scottish Hair and Beauty Awards and INAA make-up artisit of the year.  Bella Mani Salons (Kilmarnock) was dissolved last June and Bella Mani Salons (Motherwell) went the same way ten weeks ago. Both these firms had a registered address at the Howard home in Alloway. Nigel is listed as the sole active director of the Ayr\u0026ampIrvine firm, his wife Victoria resigned as a director in 2013, just nine months after the company was incorporated. But on Monday Nigel would not say how much tax HMRC is looking for and that it was “complicated and being contested.” He said: “Staff have been worried but I have assured them everything is fine. This is a dormant company that does not affect day to day running. The Irvine salon is shut and we are moving to a smaller one in the High Street. “I think this is a positive story and we work very hard to keep a total of 64 staff in jobs.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"gym group set open 24","story":"NewsThe Gym Group set to open 24 hour facilities in AyrThe group which runs more than 120 outlets across the UK, is scheduled to open a 15,000sq ft unit in the early part of 2019.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson16:26, 5 JUN 2018NewsHeathfield Retail Park (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA 24-hour gym is to become the newest tenant at Ayr’s Heathfield Retail Park, as the firm’s expansion across Scotland continues. The Gym Group, which runs more than 120 outlets across the UK, is scheduled to open a 15,000sq ft unit in the early part of 2019. It comes just a week after fellow new investors, Wren Kitchens, announced their intention to take up residence in the park later this year. Heathfield, a 190,000sq ft park, is to lose more than a third of its live trading space in the coming months as names such as Homebase, Carpetright and Maplin bow out. But Alistair Dickie, of the park’s development firm Ediston Properties, insists the quick capture of new tenants has proved there remains plenty of potential for the future. He said: “We are losing something like 72,000sq ft of trading space owing to retailer failures and consolidation in the marketplace. “It goes without saying that is a lot to deal with, but our park – and Ayr as a destination in general – is very resilient. “Interest in the site from new names has not slowed and the acquisition of both Wren and the Gym Group is testament to that. “Since we acquired the park, we have carried out 11 new lettings and the arrival of Wren and the Gym Group takes that to 13. “That proves we are continuing to move in the right direction and our faith in the park remains as strong as ever.”  Ediston, who bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million, have attracted big names like M\u0026ampS, Costa and DFS to the site in the intervening years. And Mr Dickie says further investment is to follow as the park looks to rally from this year’s trading setbacks. He added: “We have plans in place to spend a further \u0026pound2 million in September of this year “And moving forward, we have a strong business plan to ensure the prosperity of the park and its future. “I fully believe we are now through the worst of what has been a turbulent spell.” The Gym Group, founded in 2008 by former English squash player John Treharne, operates one other Ayrshire branch in Kilmarnock. It follows a \u0026pound500,000 investment when it took over a Lifestyle Fitness outlet at the Queen’s Drive retail park.

Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

Community leaders in Stranraer, desperate to lick their own sand back in shape, want to use the South Ayrshire model of success. It follows Prestwick’s hard fought battle to convince council bosses to clean up their rubble-strewn shore. Norrie Smith, vice chair of Prestwick South Community Council, performed the role of special envoy on a trip down the coast. He said: “The guys down there were very keen to talk to us about how we went about things. “Their problem is slightly different in terms of what they need to clean up, but the premise is the same. “They’ve got a fantastic community asset, much like ours, and it’s just about returning it to its rightful state and making the most of it.”  While weeds and silt are dogging Stranraer’s shoreline, Prestwick is facing the ongoing battle of mounting rubble. Already, more than 500 tonnes has been removed from the beach since council diggers were sent in to level the sand. Norrie added: “We’re delighted that our example has been recognised elsewhere. “People in this town campaigned long and hard to get where we are now, and if we can help others by sharing best practice then great. “I’m all for collaboration, whether it’s in your own town or further afield, so linking up like this can only be a positive thing.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party. Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon church mulling over decision","story":"NewsTroon church mulling over decision to allow gay couples to marryThe congregation at St Ninian’s are having time out to pray and think before revisiting the decision.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley15:25, 5 JUN 2018NewsRev Tom Montgomery (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA church is deciding whether to allow gay couples to get married in Troon. The congregation at St Ninian’s are having time out to pray and think before revisiting the decision. The vestry have split views on whether the Bentinck Drive Episcopal Church should give same-gender couples the blessing to walk up the aisle. The Rev Canon Tom Montgomery said: “Jesus was radically inclusive.” Speaking to the Post, he said: “I believe the Lord Jesus would welcome same-gender attracted people and would want them to be happy. Jesus has unconditional love for us all. “I have worked with same-gender attracted people who have had their hearts broken because they can’t express their love openly.” He said it is about “promoting and encouraging respect of all people”. The rector asked for the views of the vestry at a dedicated meeting, where he said there was a “diversity of views” among the congregation.  He added: “At the moment we are praying through the decision of the General Synod and are continuing to seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit.  “There is a wide spectrum of opinion.”   Rev Canon Montgomery would have to get authorisation from the bishop and the Registrar General of Scotland before conducting the marriages. The Scottish Episcopal Church voted to allow same-sex marriage in the church if clergy opt in. Reverend Montgomery said some are all for it while others are reticent because of their upbringing and the Bible’s teachings.  He said: “In the Bible there is no mention in the Gospel about same-gender attraction.”  But he said same-sex relationships are mentioned in a letter of St Paul and the Old Testament’s Book of Leviticus.   But he pointed out the Bible said women who commit adultery should be stoned, which people would be horrified by.  He added: “Jesus has a bias towards the downtrodden and excluded.”  And he appealed for same-sex couples and gay people in the congregation to “stick with us”. He added: “I am aware of your hurt and disappointment, as I acknowledge mine, but it is amazing what can happen when people pray and try to see what it really feels like from another person’s perspective.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Selkirk Fleshers turn over a new Leaf","story":"THE Selkirk Incorporation of Fleshers held its annual pre-Common Riding outing to Lilliesleaf on Saturday, when over 50 members and guests travelled to the village to support 2018 Fleshers Standard Bearer Jackie Johnston.\nAccompanied by Selkirk Silver Band cornet player Stuart Kemp, Standard Bearer Johnston cast the Incorporation\u0026rsquos flag in fine style and was followed by the Fleshers\u0026rsquo silver jubilee Standard Bearer, Alan Linton.\nDeacon Robert Black proposed the toast to the 2018 Standard Bearer, while no fewer than four of Jackie\u0026rsquos fellow Standard Bearers made the trip to Lilliesleaf to support him \u0026ndash Mark Easson (Hammermen), Michael Pepper (Weavers), Stuart Davidson (Merchants) and Martin Young (Ex-Soldiers).\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Svetlana is set to unveil her mosaic masterpiece in Selkirk","story":"A MOSAIC masterpiece is set to be unveiled this weekend in Selkirk.\nArtist Svetlana Kondakova has been adding the finishing touches to the 200 metres of lifelike creations on the town\u0027s Flood Defence walls.\nStunning depictions of many recognisable faces connected with the town\u0027s Common Riding command the focal point of the impressive commission.\nAnd there is also an eye-catching kelpie creature, metaphorically representing the nearby River Ettrick and its flood threat, being tamed by popular Scout master Graham Coulson.\nBut for the Edinburgh-based artist, her greatest pride is in the community creations - 94 leaping salmon swimming along the entire length of the wall section - which were made at a series of workshops over the past six months.\nSvetlana told us: \"The artwork has been inspired by and created together with the people of Selkirk and I hope that their active participation will leave a lasting legacy.\n\"Some of the youngest children in the town and some of the oldest residents have all taken part in making the salmon mosaics.\n\"I wasn\u0027t sure what to expect from the workshops but the standard of the salmon is very impressive and they look fantastic on the wall.\"\nTamer of the metaphoric kelpie was decided by a public vote with Scout master and opera stalwart Graham Coulson proving the popular choice.\nAnd ever since the voting closed Svetlana has been working with Graham to create her final mosaic character.\nShe added: \"Many of the mosaics of people who feature on the wall have been done from photographs but I had a few sittings with Graham where we took photos and decided how best to progress - it was a lot of fun.\"\nThe kelpie creation also incorporates two commemorations - one for the 1958 Standard Bearer Alex Munro, who sadly drowned during the Braw Lads\u0027 Gathering river crossing a few weeks after Casting the Colours, and the other for late community activist Tom Henderson, who was the town\u0027s Honorary Provost as well as a councillor for many years.\nA total of 19 people involved with the Common Riding have been immortalised in the mosaic artwork.\nAnd many of them will be in attendance on Saturday when an official opening will take place from 12.30pm.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Home curfew for Borders tobacco importer","story":"A MAN who evaded tax duty on 5,300 cigarettes and 43 kilogrames of hand rolled tobacco has been placed on a home night time curfew for the next six months at Jedburgh Sheriff Court.\nJames Anderson was found guilty after a trial of the offence which happened in Galashiels between April 2016 and March last year.\nSheriff Euan Edment told him it was a \u0027significant amount of tobacco and cigarettes for which no tax had been paid\u0027.\nBut he told Anderson that he suspected others were involved in the operation and his role was limited.\nThe 58-year-old was told he must stay in his Bongate, Jedburgh, home between the hours of 7pm and 7am for the next six months.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Celtic fan Tom hopes to make a meal of it in Malawi","story":"TO many, it may seem a trip of a lifetime, but for Selkirk\u0026rsquos Tom Stevenson, it will be no holiday in Malawi.\nThe ardent Celtic supporter has followed his team around the world, but never to Malawi where he is travelling to in June as part of the Celtic Foundation.\nIt is a way of giving practical support through the Foundation to Mary\u0026rsquos Meals.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938. The smiddy, itself, \u0026ldquodid its bit during hostilities, by billeting troops.\nIt did not reopen after the war and operate at its former level of business as blacksmiths and engineers. It did, however, remain in general use and is currently a joiner\u0026rsquos workshop.\nJohn Ker was also the last \u0026ldquoBoxmaster (minute secretary) of the Peebles Incorporation of Hammermen\u0026mdashthe blacksmiths\u0026rsquo once exclusive and powerful guild.\nIt fell to him to record in the minutes, rather regretfully, \u0026ldquoThere was no meeting and no dinner held in 1927\u0026mdashfitting, his forebear had been one of the founding signatories we believe. Times had changed, the calling had lost its prosperous and confident ambience, and that was a fact.\nThese events resonate with the story of Black Beauty\u0026rsquos life over a hundred years ago in Victorian England.\nSome of his memories were happy and some were very sad, none less so than those when he meets his old friend Ginger . . .\n"},{"url":null,"title":"40 week one-way system introduced in Jedburgh","story":"A TEMPORARY one-way system has been in introduced in Jedburgh to allow work to be carried out to a privately-owned dangerous building.\nThe new arrangement, which began on Monday (June 4), has seen a section of the High Street become one-way southbound from Jewellers Wynd to Canongate southbound, and a section of Exchange Street one-way northbound from High Street to Friarsgate.\nThis one-way system is required to extend scaffolding onto the road to allow for repairs to be carried out to the building, which has significant structural issues and needs extensive work to make it safe.\nThe disruption is expected to last 40 weeks, and a temporary walkway has also been introduced around the scaffolding to allow pedestrians to still use High Street and Exchange Street.\nSignage is in place to make people aware of the temporary arrangement.\nA joint statement by Jedburgh and District councillors Jim Brown, Scott Hamilton, Sandy Scott said: \u0026ldquoThe High Street dangerous building is a complex and long running issue, but the council is making progress and needs to introduce this temporary one-way system to carry out further repairs.\n\u0026ldquoThe council is looking at various options for the future of the building, and a report is expected to be discussed later this year.\n\u0026ldquoWe thank townsfolk for their patience so far, and would ask they comply with the temporary one-way system.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Borders parking issues working group calls for evidence from public","story":"A CALL for evidence on parking issues in Borders town centres has been issued by Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos Parking Issues Working Group.\nThe working group is currently gathering evidence and researching what happens in other local authority areas and will report back to the Executive Committee later this year with recommendations.\nAn online survey has now been launched to give local people and businesses the opportunity to provide evidence of any issues faced in their communities.\nCouncillor Gordon Edgar, Executive Member for Roads and Infrastructure and chair of the working group, said: \u0026ldquoAs part of our evidence gathering we want to hear from people on specific places, days and times when parking is a problem.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.    I genuinely don\u0026rsquot know what to do now. #Oscar2018 pic.twitter/lfXWlFBCj9  The Silent Child beat four contenders to the award: DeKalb Elementary, The Eleven O\u0026rsquoClock,\u0026nbspMy Nephew Emmett and Watu Wote/All of Us.  The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

In total, 24 fourth-year students from Musselburgh Grammar School received hands-on experience in team building, staging an event, kitchen and cooking essentials, and barista skills as part of an ongoing partnership with the school.  The students also heard presentations from Craig Bonnar of award-winning catering company and official racecourse supplier Heritage Portfolio Susan Manchester, general manager of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art cafes and Sarah Montgomery, the racecourse\u0026rsquos senior operations and commercial manager.  Three pupils were invited to return to the racecourse the following day to support an industry roadshow attended by senior executives in the British horseracing industry, racehorse owners and trainers and racecourse managers.  In previous years, racecourse staff have undertaken a number of volunteer activities to support local causes as part of the annual Give and Gain Day, including restoration work at Olivebank Children\u0026rsquos Centre and a beach clean at Fisherrow.  This year, Musselburgh was one of 20 UK racecourses to take part in the Racing Together Community Day, which supports a range of activities in local communities.  Sarah Montgomery said: \u0026ldquoIn past years we have been very active in supporting Business in the Community\u0026rsquos Give and Gain days but this year we opted to strengthen the relationship we have been building with Musselburgh Grammar School.  \u0026ldquoWith excellent support from Heritage Portfolio, we were able to put on a diverse programme which gave real-life experience to 20 students who have expressed an interest in hospitality and tourism careers, and this will contribute to their employability pathways initiative.  \u0026ldquoThree of those students returned to the racecourse to support us in hosting a British Horseracing Authority roadshow which provided a valuable opportunity for the pupils to put their training into practice and which will be a useful addition to their CVs.

Rockers Altered Sky are fulfilling their ambition of playing at Download Festival, Britain\u0026rsquos premier hard rock and heavy metal festival, on Thursday, June 7, with plans for a UK summer tour also set to be announced in the coming weeks.  The band, which includes Haddington\u0026rsquos Ana Nowosielska and Amy Blair, will be the main support in the Doghouse Tent, with the gig taking place the day before the main festival gets under way.  Ana, the band\u0026rsquos lead singer, was excited \u0026ldquobeyond words ahead of the festival, which is celebrating its 16th year.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt is up there with a childhood dream.  \u0026ldquoYou would go to Download and see Slipknot and Metallica and we are going to be playing there as well.  \u0026ldquoIt is absolutely amazing.  The band is looking at hiring a van and staying for the four-day festival at Donington Park, which this year is headlined by Avenged Sevenfold, Guns N\u0026rsquo Roses and Ozzy Osbourne.  Ana added: \u0026ldquoDownload is definitely one of our goals.  \u0026ldquoIt is one of the biggest music festivals in the UK, especially for our type of music.  \u0026ldquoIt is very much suited to where we want to be.  Currently the band\u0026rsquos attention is focused on creating their second album, the follow-up to Without Wonderland.  The five-piece will soon head down to Wales to record the album, with a view to it being released in the New Year.  Ana, 28, said: \u0026ldquoEverything has been a lot easier this time.  \u0026ldquoWe were joking the other day and saying we had a good five years to write the first album and now we have had six months to write the second album.  \u0026ldquoThe difference is we are definitely going to see that the album is going to stand by itself.  The band are then hoping to get back on the open road, with a UK tour being organised and the band keen to venture further afield again.  Last autumn, the band enjoyed a 19-date tour which saw them performing in the Philippines and Japan.  Ana told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are obviously talking about going back to Asia again. We met so many good people and made so many wonderful relationships.  \u0026ldquoWe would like to tour Europe \u0026ndash hit up Germany and we had an Italian tour in the works a year ago which fell through.  \u0026ldquoThen, of course, we would like to get over to the USA.  Ana grew up on Haddington\u0026rsquos Alderston Meadow and met drummer Amy, who lived on the town\u0026rsquos Long Cram and attended Knox Academy, during a night out in the town\u0026rsquos Mercat Hotel.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe reporter will ensure that the local development plan and the community\u0026rsquos views are taken into account prior to making a recommendation to ministers, who will make the final decision."},{"url":null,"title":"LOOKING BACK  Remembering the first ever Haddington Festival","story":"              HADDINGTON Festival is celebrating its golden anniversary at the moment, with the event having put a smile on thousands of faces since 1968.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7864264.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"SEPA water quality report  how clean is the water at your beach ","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH beach has been branded \u0026lsquopoor\u0026rsquo for its water quality in a report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.  Peter Dicker, foodbank manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to provide vital support when it matters most \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community with no money for food are able to access emergency support, and that has only been possible in the last year because of the incredible generosity shown by local people in donating food, time and funds.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.

As many as 1,600 homes \u0026ndash as well as business units, a supermarket, primary school and various green spaces \u0026ndash are planned for the former opencast mine site at Blindwells.  The first housebuilder is expected to be announced this summer, with work on housing getting under way potentially by the end of the year.  In the meantime, preparatory work has been carried out on the site, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie and Port Seton.  Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.  Iain Slater, development and estates director, said the new exit would be permanent, although it would initially be limited to construction traffic.  Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.  Mr Slater said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the permission the road layout will be altered to allow for the additional cars generated from the Blindwells development.  \u0026ldquoThese works include widening of the A198 approaching the roundabout to increase capacity [as well as] the installation of a filter lane to allow cars leaving the A1 heading east to go round to Tranent without stopping at the roundabout. There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.  Construction work on the 1,600 homes could take 12-15 years, with early plans already drawn up for a second phase further to the east which could see another 1,600 homes, as well as leisure space and a cemetery."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870497.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Tranent singer Caitlyn Vanbeck  39 s first single takes charts by storm","story":"              TRANENT singer Caitlyn Vanbeck\u0026rsquos first single flew up the charts when it was released on Monday.

An increase in the display of alcohol of 8.8 square metres was proposed and given the green light by the committee\u0026rsquos councillors.  A detailed statement was provided to the committee which outlined the revamp both inside and outside the shop.  It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality. This will transcend all ranges and lines including alcohol.  \u0026ldquoWhilst alcohol is very much ancillary to the overall offer, there is a desire to incorporate premium wines and craft beers.  In a bid to prevent items being stolen, members heard how various measures were being taken to cut down on the chances of theft.

Jeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos frontbench has tabled amendments to the Brexit Bill which would call on Theresa May to make maintaining \u0026ldquofull access to the EU \u0026ldquointernal market an objective of the negotiations with Brussels.  The move stops just short of calling for the full single market membership sought by a vocal group of Labour MPs after the Lords backed a Norway-style membership of the European Economic Area.  But the measure \u0026ndash which has been tabled as an alternative to the Lords amendment to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill \u0026ndash is aimed at delivering the same benefits as single market membership.  Labour leader Mr Corbyn said: \u0026ldquoWe are confident we can build a new relationship with the EU. We want the UK to have a better deal than the Norway model.  It is understood Labour MPs will abstain on the Lords EEA amendment but will be asked to back the party\u0026rsquos call for a \u0026ldquobespoke deal which would see shared UK-EU institutions and regulations.  Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: \u0026ldquoLabour will only accept a Brexit deal that delivers the benefits of the single market and protects jobs and living standards.  \u0026ldquoUnlike the Tories, Labour will not sacrifice jobs and the economy in the pursuit of a reckless and extreme interpretation of the referendum result.  \u0026ldquoExisting single market agreements that the EU has negotiated with third countries, including Norway, are bespoke deals negotiated with the EU to serve the best interests of those countries.  \u0026ldquoWe need to learn from them and negotiate our own more ambitious agreement, which serves our economic interests and which prevents a hard border in Northern Ireland.  \u0026ldquoTwo years on from the referendum it is clear that the Government has no plan for how it will protect jobs and the economy, and guarantee no hard border in Northern Ireland.  \u0026ldquoLabour\u0026rsquos amendment, along with a commitment to negotiate a new comprehensive customs union with the EU, is a strong and balanced package that would retain the benefits of the single market.  \u0026ldquoParliament should have the opportunity to debate and vote on it.  In a sign that some Labour MPs will still push for full single market membership, Chuka Umunna \u0026ndash a supporter of the pro-EU Open Britain campaign \u0026ndash said: \u0026ldquoAll the way through the passage of this Bill, the only amendments which have commanded support on both sides of the House and passed are cross-party backbench ones.  \u0026ldquoSo, if we are serious about \u0026lsquoprotecting full access to the internal market of the EU\u0026rsquo and ensuring \u0026lsquono new impediments to trade\u0026rsquo, logic dictates Labour MPs should be whipped to support the cross-party EEA amendment sent to us by the House of Lords.

Campaigner Norah Casey said: \u0026ldquoThis event is not about celebration, it\u0026rsquos about dignity and respect.  In his speech President Higgins said: \u0026ldquoA combination of stigma, shame and an unreceptive society condemned so many women to concealing their experiences, their trauma, their hurt.  \u0026ldquoIn recent years the silence has been broken and you all have helped to let the light into some very dark corners of Ireland\u0026rsquos shared past.  \u0026ldquoYou have presented us with what makes a very harrowing and deeply uncomfortable reflection of an Ireland some would prefer not to be able to recognise, but which has to be acknowledged, transacted and to which a response must be made.  \u0026ldquoAll of you and of all the other women who cannot be with us today were failed by these institutions and the religious orders who ran them.  \u0026ldquoYou were profoundly failed by the State which, in its relationship to these institutions, should have had your welfare at its core.  \u0026ldquoYou were failed by Governments that knowingly relied on the existence and practices of these institutions rather than addressing your particular needs in other, more sympathetic ways.  \u0026ldquoYou were also failed by a society that actively colluded by their silence in your incarceration and treatment or chose to look the other way, averted their gaze, as vulnerable girls and women were subjected, in so many cases, to further abuse and degradation.  \u0026ldquoIreland failed you. When you were vulnerable and in need of the support of Irish society and its institutions, its authorities did not cherish you, protect you, respect your dignity or meet your needs and so many in the wider society colluded with all that through their silence.  After the speech the women were taken to Mansion House, the residence of the Lord Mayor of Dublin. Gardai closed off the street as crowds lined the pavements and there were moving scenes as they applauded and cheered the group upon their arrival.  On Wednesday the women will discuss how they would like to be memorialised by the state in private meetings in the culmination of the two-day event organised by voluntary group Dublin Honours Magdalenes (DHM).  The Department of Justice and Equality is understood to have paid for flights and hotels for the women who travelled from the UK, Switzerland, Australia and the United States.  Many were returning to Ireland for the first time since leaving the laundries, DHM said.  The events come as the Government\u0026rsquos redress scheme was widened to reach women originally excluded because they worked in the laundries but lived elsewhere.  On Monday, academics in Northern Ireland said their year-long Government-commissioned probe into records of mother and baby homes and Magdalene laundries north of the border could help determine whether a public inquiry into the treatment of residents there will take place."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7488005.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Man left two children screaming for help in searing hot car","story":"              A PRESTONPANS man left two children screaming for help in a searing hot car.  Andrew Yorkston parked his vehicle in a lay-by near to Drummohr Holiday Park and left the two youngsters in the back seat of the locked car for about 30 minutes on a hot summer\u0027s day.  The six-year-old girl and two-year-old boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl banging on the car windows and screaming: \u0026ldquoHelp, save us.  The worried passers-by contacted the police and waited by the car to calm the kids before Yorkston eventually appeared, claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been [away] five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 27-year-old then drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  On Tuesday, Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard that Yorkston was in charge of the children when he was taking them to a nearby McDonald\u0027s and stopped off unexpectedly at the lay-by near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane told the court that the two-year-old boy and the six-year-old girl were spotted locked in the car at about 5.30pm.  Mr Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who were very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe six-year-old was shouting: \u0026lsquoHelp, save us.\u0026rsquo  The girl pointed to an opening in the trees and told the passers-by that the man looking after her was down there, the court heard.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, said that Yorkston, of North Grange Avenue, had stopped for a toilet break and his wife had been left \u0026ldquosuitably unimpressed by his actions.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  The solicitor added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0027s and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme.  \u0026ldquoFortunately there was no harm down to the children.  Sheriff Adrian Cottam deferred sentence to next month.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7806713.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"WHO admits mistaking Prestonpans for Preston on official pollution figures","story":"              THE World Health Organisation (WHO) has removed Prestonpans from its list of most polluted communities. . . after confirming that it had confused the East Lothian town with the English city of Preston!  There was widespread concern when the global monitor named Prestonpans as Scotland\u0026rsquos most polluted town in its latest breakdown of pollution figures earlier this month.  The annual list used readings taken from 2013 and named Prestonpans as the worst offender in Scotland.  WHO released a similar report two years ago which also named and shamed Prestonpans \u0026ndash yet it was thought then that the reported high pollution levels in the town related to the former Cockenzie Power Station, which had been operational until March 2013.  However, East Lothian Council told the Courier earlier this month that it believed the reading was actually down to a geographical error by WHO, claiming that the organisation had confused Prestonpans with Preston in Lancashire, nearly 200 miles away.  And this week, the WHO confirmed that this was indeed the case.  In an email to senior environmental health officials at the local authority, representatives of WHO confirmed that they had confused the two communities due to a computer mapping error.  They said: \u0026ldquoIt is true that there was a mislabel in the datum for Prestonpans, which should have been labelled as Preston.  \u0026ldquoThis error originated in the previous database release when reverse geocoding the coordinates from the EEA (European Economic Area).

A mutant strain of the infection - which can not be treated with the usual course of antibiotics - struck in Britain for the first time earlier this year.  Health officials now fear there could be more cases after recording 44,676 diagnoses of gonorrhoea in 2017 - a 22% increase on the previous year.  The report from Public Health England also told of a 20% year-on-year rise in deadly syphilis - a 148% increase on 2008 figures.  Speaking today (Tues) Debbie Laycock, from sexual health charity Terrence Higgins Trust, said: \u0026ldquoToday\u0026rsquos stats confirm the number of STIs diagnosed in England remains worryingly high against a backdrop of damaging cuts to sexual health services.  \"Our sexual health services are stretched too thinly and demand outweighs availability, with more cuts already planned.  \u0026ldquoThe significant rise in both syphilis and gonorrhoea shows why further cuts are completely unacceptable and would be extremely damaging, particularly given the emergence of a new extensively drug-resistant strain of gonorrhoea.  The report warned that the 44,676 diagnoses of gonorrhoea in 2017 was of \u0026ldquoconcern given the recent emergence of extensively drug resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae.  It was seen for the first time in the UK earlier this year, when a UK man he picked up the disease after a sexual encounter with a woman in south-east Asia.  Two further cases were idenified in Australia soon after.  Left untreated, gonorrhoea can lead to complications including infertility and pelvic inflammatory disease.  Pregnant women can also pass on the disease to their baby during labour.  The report added: \"The large increase in gonorrhoea diagnoses between 2016 and 2017 is concerning due to the ongoing circulation of high-level azithromycin resistant gonorrhoea.  \u0026ldquoAdditionally, the first detected case of extensively drug resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae with resistance to ceftriaxone and high-level resistance to azithromycin, the two antibiotics used as front-line dual therapy, was detected in the UK in March 2018.  \u0026ldquoSoon after two cases with similar antimicrobial resistance profiles were later detected in Australia.  \u0026ldquoAll three cases were associated with travel to south-east Asia.  The newly-released report said that in 2017 there were 422,147 diagnoses of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) made in England, around the same number that was reported in 2016.  More than 1.3 million chlamydia tests were carried out and over 126,000 chlamydia diagnoses were made among youngsters aged 15 to 24.  There was a 90% reduction in genital wart cases, mainly thanks to a high school immunisation programme, it said.  The impact of STIs remains greatest in young heterosexuals aged 15 to 24, black ethnic minorities, and gay and bisexual men, the report said.  Mrs Laycock added: \u0026ldquoThere is a small decline in chlamydia diagnoses, but this isn\u0026rsquot good news as there\u0026rsquos also been an 8% decline in testing for chlamydia.  \"Most worryingly, that includes a 61% drop in chlamydia testing in sexual and reproductive health services in just two years.  \u0026ldquoYoung people, those from black and minority ethnic (BME) communities, gay and bisexual men, and people living with HIV continue to be the most affected by STIs. More work must be done to ensure people from these groups have access to the information and sexual health services they need to improve and look after their sexual health.  \u0026ldquoThe fact that young people continue to be disproportionately affected when it comes to STIs clearly shows a much needed emphasis on sexual health and STIs when relationships and sex education (RSE) becomes compulsory in England from 2019. We want to see sexual health check-ups normalised among young people, and no different to visiting the dentist or doctor.  \u0026ldquoThe welcomed decline in HPV-related genital warts is as a result of vaccinating girls against HPV before they become sexually active.  \u0026ldquoIn order to make further progress and address the markedly higher rates in boys, we need to see that vaccination programme extended to boys too, in order to drive down rates of preventable cancers later in life.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos no clear plan for tackling consistently high rates of STIs. The situation needs to improve quickly and learnings from the recent drop in new HIV diagnoses would be a good place to start.  \u0026lsquoWe\u0026rsquore calling on local authorities and Government to face up to what\u0026rsquos happening, urgently work together and ensure sexual health services are properly funded to meet local demand."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7863021.jpg?type=article-full","title":"  These beautiful Scottish courses are perfect if you re game for golf","story":"              Regarded as one of the best places in the world to play golf, Scotland is home to many\u0026nbspfantastic courses.

A bold claim, but the club\u0026nbspare confident that once you play the perfectly manicured 18 holes designed by six-time British Open Champion Harry Vardon, you will agree\u0026nbsp- and be happy to tell others the same.    Founded in 1907, Balmore Golf Club has a proud history, but it has an even brighter future. Significant investments in facilities for the whole family such as a 6-hole Par 3 course with complimentary child membership and an extensive practice facility for keen golfers eager to perfect their game has uniquely positioned the club. It\u0027s a safe, family-friendly environment successfully attracting a new generation of members such as former Celtic and Scotland football star Kris Commons who joined during April\u0027s new member intake:  \"I\u0026rsquove played a lot of great golf courses in Scotland over the years,\" said Kris. \"But I decided to join Balmore Golf Club for two main reasons: the quality of the course itself, plus the stand-out practice facilities which are set up to cater to families. The real clincher was the massive practice area which has two full size greens with bunkers, a six-hole par 3 course, putting green and driving range. My two boys are really keen on golf, so having such an impressive practice facility that they can use to learn and enjoy the game is important.

But Ash Pryce received an altogether different legacy - one which sparked a love of the supernatural and things that go bump in the night.  The magician will take to a Glasgow stage later this month with a show inspired by the tales of his Spiritualist grandfather Tom Lund, who introduced Ash to the occult when he was 11.  Spiritualism, which began as a movement in the 19th century, centres around a belief\u0026nbsp in the ability to communicate with the world of the spirits and receive messages from the afterlife.  And while Mr Pryce is not an active believer these days after his work on stage gave him a glimpse \u0027behind the curtain\u0027, his grandfather\u0027s tales of spooks, ghosts and missives from the world beyond have stayed with him to this day.    The illusionist\u0027s grandfather Tom Lund  Mr Pryce said: \"The show is very much a tribute to my grandfather. His room would be full of books on spirits, on ghosts, and we\u0026rsquod chat for hours about the\u0026nbsp other side. It was something that connected us.  \"When he died in 2014 I\u0026nbsp wanted to be able to pay tribute to him, and decided to draw on our\u0026nbsp mutual interest in Spiritualism.  \"I can honestly say that I wouldn\u0027t be a magician today if it wasn\u0027t for him.\"  Mr Pryce said that going to a spiritualist meeting with his grandfather at an early age made a huge impression on him, as the medium began to channel messages from a long-departed relative.  He said: \u0026ldquoI was in awe at what happened\u0026nbsp there.\u0026nbsp A table began bouncing around the room, the medium contacted my deceased great-grandmother\u0026hellip at least, that\u0026rsquos what it seemed.  \"My grandfather believed in it all and it gave me a life-long interest in the paranormal.\"  He later learned that the table was moved by people giving it tiny, reflexive nudges as they stood alongside - similar to the way a Ouija board works - while knocking sounds said to be spirits communicating were actually the sound of the mediums clicking their joints.  However, despite learning the tricks of the trade, he still remains fascinated in the supernatural.    Appearing at Glasgow\u0026rsquos Britannia Panopticon Music Hall - itself said to be haunted\u0026nbsp - the show will see the illusionist resurrect a 160-year-old illusion known as the Spirit Cabinet during a story-led performance based on his experiences with his grandfather.  The Spirit Cabinet was invented by American mediums the Davenport Brothers in the 1850s, and used a prop by mediums during their seances.  It sees a medium\u0026nbsp - in this case the actress Misha McCullagh - secured and bound inside a wooden or curtained box along with several small items, such as bells, writing tablets and occult symbols.  The medium would then challenge the spirits to \u0027cross the veil\u0027 into the material world and they would begin to move and interact with the items, writing messages for the audience to read or floating through the air.

In a move to have\u0026nbspless sugar and more fruit and vegetables on school dinner menus, recommendations by experts to make school food and drink healthier are being consulted on by the Scottish Government.  Although strict rules already apply to the nutritional content of meals, drinks and snacks served in Scottish schools, following a review by health, nutrition and education experts, views are being sought on proposals to further reduce sugar and other measures to promote healthy choices and help tackle childhood obesity.  A list of proposals includes \"no\u0026nbsplonger permitting fruit juice and smoothies to be offered in primary and secondary schools\".    Another proposal involves\u0026nbspintroducing lower sugar limits, for foods such as breakfast cereal and yoghurts.  Ministers also want to reduce how often sweetened and baked goods are available in primary schools.  And they are also planning a new regulation for red meat which specifies, for the first time, how much of a child\u0026rsquos weekly intake should be high-quality produce and limits the amount of processed meat  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she wants to cut child obesity by half by 2030.  Put sugar tax on smoothies, say doctors  Almost 30 percent of children in Scotland are at risk of being overweight, and 14 percent are at risk of being obese, according to government figures.  Scotland\u0027s Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: \"More than 360,000 meals are dished up in Scottish schools every day, setting children and young people up for their lessons and -- through learning about healthy habits -- for life.  \"The proposals we are putting forward are based on the latest scientific and expert advice, as well as the views of local authorities, schools and catering staff.\"  In primary schools uptake of school lunches is the highest it has ever been due to the introduction of free school meals in Scotland in January 20.  Alison Johnstone, the Scottish Greens\u0026rsquo health spokesman said the recommenations\u0026nbspwon\u0026rsquot do anything to address pupils leaving at lunchtime to buy junk food.  She also said schools need better kitchen facilities so that fresh food can be prepared and cooked on site.  \u0026ldquoNew guidance on what is served in schools is welcome and providing three portions of fruit and vegetables at lunch time is a start, but when John Swinney began this review he said he wanted primary school children to have as many of their \u0027five a day\u0027 at school as they can,\" she said.  \u0026nbspIt\u0027s disappointing to see this is as far as efforts will go. It also won\u0026rsquot address the fact that in secondary schools most pupils leave at lunchtime, generally to buy junk food from nearby supermarkets, vans and takeaway shops.  \u0026ldquoLondon plans to ban new fast food outlets from opening near schools and we need equally strong action to tackle the obesogenic environment forced upon children and young people in Scotland. Nor is there anything in these proposals to improve facilities for preparing food in schools. Many schools lack kitchens and decent dining halls. We can hardly begin to change the food culture in our schools without investing in the production of healthy, fresh food, on site, and supporting catering staff properly.  \u0026ldquoExpanding the provision of free school meals simply must be a greater priority. It clearly increases uptake and is the best way to make school meals a foundation for healthy eating for all children.  \u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Javid expresses  sympathy  to student nurse battling to stay in Scotland","story":"              THE prospects of a student nurse, originally from Africa, staying in Scotland to fulfil his dream of a career in the NHS appear to have risen after Sajid Javid, the Home Secretary, said he was \u0026ldquovery sympathetic to his case.  Speaking at his first Commons question-time since taking over his new role, Mr Javid was questioned about the plight of 23-year-old Denzel Darku by the SNP\u0026rsquos Joanna Cherry.  The Edinburgh MP explained how the student nurse, who came to the UK from Ghana aged 14, was a tireless campaigner, who had carried the baton for Scotland in the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.  Mr Darku previously served in the Scottish Youth Parliament and currently lives in Paisley. After having two appeals against deportation rejected, he is now battling to stay in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoHe dreams of a career in NHS Scotland but he faces deportation on a technicality through no fault of his own, declared Ms Cherry.  She referred to how the Scottish Government had written to the Secretary of State about Mr Darku\u0026rsquos case but had not yet had a reply and urged him to meet her to discuss it. \u0026ldquoHe only wants to stay in Scotland to serve the NHS, explained the backbencher.  Last week, Mr Darku\u0026rsquos case was raised at First Minister\u0026rsquos Questions by Labour MSP Neil Bibby as another example of the UK Government\u0027s controversial \"hostile environment\" immigration policy. Nicola Sturgeon said the student nurse had been \"an absolute credit to Scotland\" and branded the threat of deportation hanging over him a \u0026ldquodisgrace.  The following day, The Herald understands, Ruth Davidson raised the case personally with the Home Secretary in a telephone call.  During Home Office Questions, Mr Javid said he was \u0026ldquopleased that Ms Cherry had raised the issue, noting how he had spoken about it to the Scottish Conservative leader, who, he said, was also \u0026ldquovery concerned.  He told MPs that there was an appeal going on in regards to Mr Darku\u0026rsquos case, so he could not say too much, but then added: \u0026ldquoI am very sympathetic about the situation.  A source close to Ms Davidson said she was \u0026ldquovery pleased by Mr Javid\u0026rsquos comments.  Later, Ms Cherry said the student nurse\u0026rsquos situation was another illustration of the impact of the Government\u0026rsquos immigration policies, which were \u0026ldquodamaging and callous and that Scotland wanted \u0026ldquonothing to do with them.  She went on: \u0026ldquoThis young man is studying hard so he can become a nurse and work in our NHS yet he faces deportation. All this at a time when Theresa May is resisting calls to see sense from even her own Cabinet colleagues and allow skilled migration of health care workers to the UK.  The SNP\u0026rsquos home affairs spokeswoman argued that the Conservative Government was failing the country\u0026rsquos economy and society and that it was \u0026ldquoappalling it had not even had the courtesy to reply to letters from the Scottish Government, which was \u0026ldquochampioning Denzel\u0026rsquos case.  Ms Cherry said a \u0026ldquoScotland-specific migration system would the nation to prioritise what its economy and society needed \u0026ldquorather than having to abide by Tory plans to cut net migration, which we now know will cost our economy \u0026pound10 billion a year  She added: \u0026ldquoAs we move closer to Brexit, we need the UK Government to do more than simply drop their net migration targets we need migration levels to be maintained, if not increased. In Scotland our demographic requirements mean immigration needs to be encouraged.  \u0026lsquo\u0026rsquoWe need powers over migration to come to Scotland we want nothing to do with the Tories\u0026rsquo hostile environment regime.

It might not be Wembley but Broadwood Stadium is a mighty fine start. The accompanying photograph showed the six-piece band on the stage, their arms around each other.  It turns out that this was not only M\u0026agravenran\u0026rsquos first stadium show, it was the stadium\u0026rsquos first show, as well. For one night only, the Cumbernauld venue, home to Clyde FC for the last 28 years, was turned into an outdoor music gig. Broadwood: Live by the Loch, it was called. There were three acts: Dougie MacLean was the opener, followed by M\u0026agravenran and then, shortly after nine o\u0026rsquoclock, after an hour or so of steady rain, the headliners, the Red Hot Chilli Pipers. L\u0026agraven Chomais, a Gaelic rock/traditional band from the local Greenfaulds High School, also played a couple of sets.  By the end of the night - 11pm, or thereabouts - MacLean, M\u0026agravenran and the Pipers had done a mass version of MacLean\u0026rsquos anthem, Caledonia, and the 2,000 fans went home happy. Those who had patiently stood in front of the stage, rather than sitting in the covered stands, had got the worst of the rain, but didn\u0026rsquot seem to mind too much. And within moments the organisers, North Lanarkshire Leisure, were tweeting that the event would return next year, \u0026ldquoeven bigger and better.  Could this be the start of something for Cumbernauld? The aim is that Broadwood will now go on to host further high-profile concerts. It has been tried nearby: Falkirk FC\u0026rsquos stadium has seen concerts by Elton John, Status Quo and Tom Jones, amongst others, while Elton played Airdrie FC\u0026rsquos Excelsior Stadium a year ago this month. As an academic, Dr Stephen Bowman, wrote approvingly on Twitter: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos easy to do down #Cumbernauld but full credit to everyone associated with #LivebytheLoch ... Exactly the sort of the kind of thing the town needs and deserves.  The stadium was effectively divided in two for the show, one half remaining cordoned off while the other half was given over to the staging, lighting and PA system, the standing fans and the food stalls. The leisure centre at one end of Broadwood had become a hospitality centre, with communal changing rooms being turned into dressing-rooms for the musicians.  \u0026ldquoThis all goes back to a Facebook message I got at the back end of January from Gerry McMahon at NL Leisure, said Gary Innes, accordionist with M\u0026agravenran, in a dressing-room strewn with clothes and musical instruments. \u0026ldquoHe said, look, we\u0026rsquove got the Gaelic school out here, and we want to put on a music event but we don\u0026rsquot know who to speak to or what to do, could you come out here for a meeting?  So Innes met them, and they told him that what they wanted to do was to stage a music festival. He drew on his contacts in the industry, assembled a bill, went back to NL Leisure and got it approved. \u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquove got a great team and they have worked their socks off to get the stadium, he said. \u0026ldquoBut when you think about it, the show was signed off only in March, and the turnaround since then has been quite remarkable. A lot of hard work has gone into this.  \u0026ldquoNL Leisure asked if we could give them acts that could sell tickets, bring in the numbers. We knew Dougie was celebrating 40 years of Caledonia and, national treasure that he is, he was an easy fit. The Pipers have a worldwide appeal. Two of them lived in Cumbernauld for many years, so they feel this is kind of a homecoming gig. It\u0026rsquos also part of their 15-year celebration of the band.  \u0026ldquoThe nice thing that NL Leisure is really keen on is building on that local connection with the community and giving them something that they can look forward to and be part of, Innes adds. \u0026ldquoThey acknowledge that there\u0026rsquos not an awful lot here [in cultural terms]. In terms of a sports facility it\u0026rsquos brilliant but outwith that there\u0026rsquos not an awful lot for the community to do, so if they can add to that each year by putting on a musical event, then it\u0026rsquos great for the community and the stadium. \u0026ldquo  \u0026ldquoThis is a really heavily populated bit of the country, adds his colleague Ewen Henderson, \u0026ldquoand a lot of it are families, and young families, who are quite often cut out of a lot of the cultural spectrum in terms of being able to go to events. Innes added that NL Leisure was already looking forward to next year and trying to get a big headliner in, backed by a solid 10 months of pre-publicity.  Kevin MacDonald is one of the three bagpipers in the Red Hot Chilli Pipers, who fuse trad Scots music with such rock and pop hits as Queen\u0026rsquos We Will Rock You and Snow Patrol\u0026rsquos Chasing Cars (\u0026ldquobagrock, they call it), and who play 200 shows every year. \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove known Gary for a number of years and he asked us if we could be on the second of June, he says. \u0026ldquoWe were meant to be in Germany today but the event was cancelled, so it has worked out great for us.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos also quite nice in that both [piper] Willie [Armstrong] and I, the two founding members, both lived in Cumbernauld. I went to Greenfaulds High School and that\u0026rsquos where I met Willie. He still stays here.  \u0026ldquoThe biggest thing on a personal side that I\u0026rsquove noticed about Cumbernauld, because I came from a small community in Aberdeen before coming down here, is that, unfortunately, it suffers from a lack of different communities, because it\u0026rsquos seen as a commuter town between Edinburgh and Glasgow. Even when I was growing up here, if you wanted a night out you went to Glasgow or you went to Edinburgh. Unfortunately it has never built up a proper community-type spirit where people can come along. Clyde have been in the football stadium here some 24, 25 years ago and it\u0026rsquos great to see that NLL is now trying to bring events [like the concert] here.  Rain had been threatening for a couple of hours before the show. The atmosphere is muggy, and the crowd is still in the process of arriving, when L\u0026agraven Chomais open proceedings. Dougie MacLean, who has travelled with his wife Jenny from Perthshire to be here, plays songs old and new, and gets the audience going as he has been doing for years now. He teasingly alludes to, but doesn\u0026rsquot actually name, what is probably his best-known song. That, it seems, is for later.  M\u0026agravenran play an engaging, boisterous set and win a lot of new fans in the process. Gary Innes, who has put the bill together, and who won the Instrumentalist of the Year title at last December\u0026rsquos Scots Trad Music Awards, suffers a mishap, however, for the first time in his professional career: he raises his arms, and his accordion strap breaks. He has to disappear for a few minutes to borrow an accordion from L\u0026agraven Chomais.  The food and drink stalls have been doing solid business throughout the night, and finally it\u0026rsquos the turn of the Red Hot Chilli Pipers, complete with their energetic dancers, Rachel and Eilidh. Amazing Grace is one of their early songs but it\u0026rsquos the rock covers that really get the fans dancing, some of them managing to dance as they clutch umbrellas and pints of beer. And at some point during the set, Clare Adamson, the SNP MSP for Motherwell \u0026amp Wishaw, who is present, spots a \u0026ldquovery young lady in the act of flossing. \u0026ldquoRespect, she tweets.  Back in the M\u0026agravenran dressing-room, bottles of wine have been opened, and the general opinion is that the night has gone rather well. Kevin Rodgers, a Gaelic teacher at Greenfaulds had earlier spoken of his delight at how L\u0026agraven Chomais\u0026rsquos sets have gone. The teenagers - Craig Yule, Ava MacKinnon, Jessica Muir and Emily Robertson (a fifth, Eilidh Millar, was unable to make it) - were, he said, \u0026ldquoall as high as kites, absolutely. It\u0026rsquos been a brilliant experience, ever since they came here for a soundcheck at four o\u0026rsquoclock.  Outside again: darkness has fallen, and the kilted Pipers are bringing their set to a close. It\u0026rsquos been a good one: you can see why they\u0026rsquove played sell-out tours across the world, and why their fans include Ewan McGregor, Sir Paul McCartney, the Scottish rugby team, the Queen and Samuel L Jackson, to quote from the band\u0026rsquos website. And then, as a final act, all the musicians crowd onto the stage to sing Caledonia, the audience lustily singing along.  Graeme Morrison, operations and business development manager at NL Leisure, and one of the event organisers, said the concert had been delivered over a relatively short timescale, compared to the time it would normally take to organise and promoting an event of this size. \u0026ldquoWhile the day itself was very long, it was incredibly rewarding and exhilarating to see so many people enjoying the show. We\u0026rsquore already talking about next year. We feel we\u0026rsquore in a privileged position to be able to put something like this on for the community. Because everybody praised it so much, despite the bad weather, we owe the audience and the community this, to put it on again next year. We\u0026rsquore open to working in partnership with big promoters, but what we\u0026rsquove absolutely demonstrated with Saturday is we\u0026rsquore capable of putting on our own events.  \u0026ldquoThis is a legacy event for us, he added. \u0026ldquoI want people to be talking about Broadwood: Live by the Loch in twenty years\u0026rsquo time."},{"url":null,"title":"World-leading upgrades at Scotland   s key heritage sites","story":"              They were once Scotland\u0026rsquos long forgotten landmarks, with their stories of heritage and tradition confined to the history books.  But thanks to the work of the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), many of the country\u0026rsquos key sites are being given a new lease of life.  NTS this week announced an ambitious five-year plan, detailing a \u0026pound60 million commitment to Scotland\u0026rsquos built and natural heritage.  The charity hopes the investment will not only attract more visitors to its sites, but also encourage more Scots to become members of the trust.  NTS chief executive Simon Skinner said: \u0026ldquoThis strategy outlines everything that the National Trust for Scotland stands for - protecting our heritage, sharing unique experiences with people and promoting Scotland, all through the collective endeavour of our supporters and staff.  He added that as part of the strategy, the key message to Scots is: \u0026ldquoWe need your help if we\u0026rsquore going to keep doing the things that you like and looking after the things that you love.  One of the biggest projects included in the plan is the conservation of Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026rsquos Hill House in Helensburgh.  The crumbling landmark was built as a \u0026ldquohome for the future in 1902 but the experimental building material has allowed water to soak into the building.  The trust is spending \u0026pound5m on the world-leading project, which will begin later this year.  \u0026ldquoThis is a pure conservation exercise, said Mr Skinner. \u0026ldquoThe cage will keep the rain out but allow the wind to blow through and hopefully dry the building out.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore essentially buying time until we can come up with a solution for the building.  He added: \u0026ldquoThis is the first time anything like this has been done anywhere in the world. Other countries are looking to Scotland to see if this works, so it\u0026rsquos very significant conservation project.  The cage will also include gangways allowing the public to view the building and the ongoing restoration work.  Elsewhere in Scotland, Glencoe is also set to benefit from \u0026pound1.1m of investment.  This will include an upgrade to access roads and the site\u0026rsquos visitor centre, which Mr Skinner describes as a \u0026ldquolost opportunity.  He said: \u0026ldquoMany people don\u0026rsquot realise that the landscape you see wouldn\u0026rsquot quite be the same if you didn\u0026rsquot have us looking after it.  \u0026ldquoWe maintain the access roads and look after the visitor centre and all that comes at a cost.  \u0026ldquoMany people simply pass by the visitor centre and that\u0026rsquos a lost opportunity to engage around one million people each year.  Just a little further along the road, another important site - the Glenfinnan Monument - is also in need of some attention.  The monument, at the head of Loch Shiel, pays tribute to Bonnie Prince Charlie and those who fought in the Jacobite Risings.  Built in 1815, the 18m-high building is now overshadowed by a more modern tourist attraction - the Glenfinnan viaduct which featured in the Harry Potter film franchise.  The site\u0026rsquos visitor centre will receive a \u0026pound250,000 upgrade in a bid, as Mr Skinner says, to \u0026ldquogive the Harry Potter fans a reason to turn around.  Inverewe Garden and Estate in Wester Ross will also receive a \u0026pound700,000 boost under the strategy.  It ha s already received \u0026pound2.5m for a new glasshouse to display rare and exotic plants, and to enable Inverewe House to be open to the public for the first time, and the next stage of investment will involve the creation of an access tower linking the gardens and viewpoint over Loch Ewe.  The House of Dun, in Montrose, will also receive a \u0026pound800,000 upgrade, while other sites to benefit also include the Burns Monument in Ayrshire and Alexander \u0026ldquoGreek Thomson\u0026rsquos unique interiors at Holmwood in Cathcart.  The number of visitors to NTS properties began a long decline in the 1990s and early 2000s.  In 2005/06 visitor numbers sat at 1.45m, but by 2014/15 had dropped by 24 per cent to 1.1m.  However, the situation has began to improve over the last three years, with the latest figures showing total visitors numbers sitting at 3.69m for 2017/18.  The trust hopes that its new strategy will allow it to further build on that and encourage more people to experience the best of Scotland\u0026rsquos built and natural heritage."},{"url":null,"title":"Celtic-themed wedding goes viral","story":"              A CELTIC-MAD bridegroom\u0026nbspmade sure that when he came to tie the knot, it would have a definite Hoops theme.

It also staged The Storr: Unfolding Landscapes on the Isle of Skye in 2005 and Speed of Light, initially commissioned as part of the UK\u0026rsquos 2012 Cultural Olympiad.  The statement says: \"In September of last year the trustees of NVA made the difficult decision to withdraw from the capital project plans to rescue St Peter\u0026rsquos Seminary in Cardross, due to increasing risks, both financial and physical.  \"NVA\u0026rsquos original plan for St Peter\u0026rsquos was universally acknowledged as bold, with creative ambition at its heart.  \"It was also recognised as a high risk venture for a small independent arts organisation.  \"NVA has spent many years working with great passion and determination, with the support of the owners of the site, the Archdiocese of Glasgow, to save this iconic building for future generations.  \"We collaborated with public and private stakeholders, the local communities and an amazing design team.  \"Important work was done to begin to preserve and restore the building and to demonstrate the immense creative, intellectual and community potential of the site.\"  However, it adds: \"Despite our best efforts we were unable to guarantee the viable future for the St Peter\u0026rsquos Seminary that we had imagined and hoped for. In the end, we had no choice but to bring the capital project to an end.\"  READ MORE: Image which scandalised Government in 1920s to be sold at Scottish auction  NVA said it has tried to develop an \"alternative proposal\" for the site, but this has not proved possible and \"has reinforced the many financial and structural challenges facing the company.\"  The board said that NVA is now \"not able to continue\".  NVA\u0026rsquos final presentation will take place this summer in a co-production with Hopscotch Films working with the acclaimed Scottish artist Rachel Maclean.  Make Me Up, a commission from BBC Arts and 14-18 NOW, the UK\u0026rsquos official arts programme for the First World War centenary celebrations, will reflect on the shortcomings of a century of female enfranchisement."},{"url":null,"title":"One of UK s most traditional sauces set to be renamed Sandwich Cream after 104 years","story":"              SALAD Cream, one of the UK\u0027s most traditional sauces could\u0026nbspbe renamed Sandwich Cream.  Food giant Heinz is set to ditch the famous name for the first time in 104 years claiming that as only 14 per cent of buyers actually used the gloopy white sauce on salads, the old name no longer reflects its modern purpose.  A spokesman for Heinz said that the name no longer \"fairly represents the product\u0027s ingredients or usage occasions.\"  Parent group Kraft Heinz said it was working with brand design specialists Jones Knowles Ritchie on overhauling one of Britain\u0027s longest running kitchen staples.  It would be the first name change for the product since its launch in 1914.    Fans of the traditional name went on social media to express their anger.  It is believed Heinz is considering adopting the name Sandwich Cream to better reflect how the country uses the condiment and to appeal to \"younger shoppers\".  UK sales of the brand dipped 5.4 per cent to \u0026pound28.8 million last year.  A Heinz spokesman added: \"As a market leading business, Kraft Heinz continues to audit its portfolio in order to meet the needs of consumers.  \"There are consumers now who haven\u0027t grown up with the brand in the household and just don\u0027t know about the iconic zingy flavour or what to eat it with.\"  The consultation process means the earliest a new name will be introduced is in September.    The condiment became a national favourite during the 1940s, Heinz says, when ketchup was unavailable and salad cream was used to add flavour to bland war-time rations.  In 1999, it was revealed that Heinz were about to ditch the brand but once the leak was published it led to a major protest by shoppers and it saved the brand.  The publicity helped sales and Heinz took advantage by relaunching Salad Cream in new-look packs and putting the price up."},{"url":null,"title":"UK Government defends RBS shares sale at   2 1bn loss  saying it  39 s   39 value for money  39 ","story":"              THE UK Government has defended the sale of a 7.7 per cent stake in Royal Bank of Scotland at a \u0026pound2.1 billion loss to the UK taxpayer, insisting it was \"value for money\".  Lord Bates, the Treasury spokesman, dismissed criticism of the move from Labour and the Liberal Democrats in the Lords.  Answering an urgent question, he said the sale would raise \u0026pound2.5bn, representing \"value for money for the taxpayer\".  The Conservative peer said RBS was a \"smaller, simpler and safer organisation\" than the one the Government was forced to recapitalise in 2008 at a cost to the taxpayer of \u0026pound46bn and the sale price reflected that \"reality\".  But Liberal Democrat Baroness Kramer demanded: \"Why sell now crystallising a loss that rises to in excess of \u0026pound3bn when financing costs are included and when there is no pressure..?\"  She warned that by acting now the Government could be selling shares on an \"inaccurate prospectus, ignoring growing allegations that liabilities to those abused by RBS\u0027s global restructuring group... are inadequately quantified, not declared and not provided for within the accounts\".  But Lord Bates said that when the Government paid 502p per share in 2008 it was an \"essential injection of capital\" at a time of financial crisis the bank was now, he insisted, in a very different organisation.  Labour spokesman Lord Davies of Oldham said the shares were being sold at a \"massive level below\" the 2008 bailout with the taxpayer bearing the cost and leaving the public to \"lose on the deal significantly\".  Lord Bates hit back, telling him: \"You may say we sold it too cheaply. I might say that you bought it too high.\"  He said the price was \"near the top end of the yearly average\" and the Government had signalled it shouldn\u0027t be in the business of \"running these banks\".  Tory former Cabinet minister Lord King of Bridgwater backed the sale as being an \"entirely sensible procedure to bring in some money while we can\".  Lord Bates said the Opposition was forgetting what the situation was in 2008 and the \"incredible damage done to our economy, which we are still having to clear up\".  He said the sale proceeds would go directly to reduce the debt accumulated in 2008.  Outwith Parliament, Gordon Brown, who was Prime Minister when the bank was bailed out, said there was \"no excuse\" for selling the shares at under their potential value.  Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, also insisted there was no need to sell the RBS shares now.  \u0026ldquoThere was no need for the Conservatives to cost the taxpayer more than \u0026pound2bn, he declared.  \"There is continuing uncertainty on a number of RBS\u0026rsquo legacy issues. Ministers should instead have been using their position as the biggest shareholder to make sure management put the bank in order so that the share price recovered before selling any of the stake,\" he added."}]
