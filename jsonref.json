gas-focused civil engineering company Bilfinger Berger Middle East, and from 2009 to 2016 as an advisor to infrastructure company Arcadis. It also reveals that somewhere along the way Gilliar had received \u0027specialist training in Civil  Military security operations and analysis, counter terrorism, close protection and firearms, armed and unarmed combat\u0027 and had expertise in \u0027Security and intelligence based analytics and systems.\u0027  While working in Dubai, he hired his son to work with him as an IT specialist, and had a second son with his new wife, Erika Krajníková Gilliar. The couple began breeding and training a stable of horses with top coaches in France, mingling with Europe and the Middle East\u0027s rich and titled.In 2010 he founded European Energy and Infrastructure Group (EEIG), boasting \u0027strategic influences at the highest level within Washington, D.C.\u0027 and even \u0027represented the foreign ministry of Korea\u0027 on a nuclear power deal, according to the firm\u0027s website.His bio for CEFC says he was an \u0027advisor on internationalization\u0027 to the South Korean Foreign ministry 2011-2016, after two years advising the chairman of South Korea\u0027s largest electric utility Kepco. He also founded EEIG subsidiary J2cR in 2015, boasting \u0027top-level former U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice officials\u0027 with services including \u0027lobbying\u0027 and \u0027political intelligence\u0027 and \u0027focused on homeland security and transnational trade\u0027.It would be through his partner in J2cR, Rob Walker, that he would meet Hunter Biden.Walker is a former Clinton administration official and his wife, Betsy Massey Walker, served as Jill Biden\u0027s assistant when she was Second Lady.Gilliar was thrust into the spotlight last fall when Hunter\u0027s laptop, abandoned at a Delaware computer store, was leaked to the press.Emails from the laptop revealed Hunter had partnered with his brother Jim and three other businessmen including Gilliar to launch a joint venture with Chinese energy giant CEFC, after dangling his family connections to the foreign investors.The discovery sparked fears that the Chinese government would attempt to use the financial relationship to exert pressure on Joe Biden.In 2018 CEFC chairman Ye Jianming was arrested on corruption charges in China and his right hand man was convicted of bribery in the US, while Hunter\u0027s deal has landed him under a federal criminal investigation.In May 2017 Gilliar sent an email to Hunter, Bobulinski and Walker, about proposed \u0027remuneration packages\u0027 for the deal.The British businessman suggested Hunter would receive an $850,000 salary plus a 20 percent stake in a company that owned half the joint venture with CEFC.But Gilliar also listed a 10 percent stake to be held by Hunter \u0027for the big guy\u0027.Bobulinski, a former US naval officer, told reporters last year that the \u0027big guy\u0027 was Joe Biden.Gilliar\u0027s family said the exposure of his involvement in the CEFC deal has not slowed his business – if anything it has helped.His sister-in-law, Kim Gilliar, told DailyMail.com that although he \u0027keeps his cards close to his chest\u0027, the email scandal seems to have actually sparked more business opportunities for him.Company disclosures show that in December 2020 Gilliar was awarded 15 million share options worth $13.75 million from a British-Australian metal mining company for securing a contract with giant Czech state-owned energy company CEZ.And despite his continued major deal-brokering, Gilliar remains elusive, with no photographs of him to be found anywhere online – until DailyMail.com spotted the shadowy businessman visiting a police station in Prague with his wife in November last year.However, Gilliar did not respond to our requests for comment. The enigmatic entrepreneur was not the only one with intelligence agency links buzzing around Hunter during his partnership with the Chinese.In an audio recording on Hunter\u0027s laptop, he refers to one of his CEFC business partners Patrick Ho as the \u0027spy chief of China.\u0027The Chinese businessman was later surveilled by US law enforcement as a foreign intelligence threat before he was convicted of bribery in 2018.And in post-coital conversation with a prostitute caught on his webcam, Hunter said he believed a group of Russian drug dealers stole a second earlier laptop of his during a drug and booze-fueled bender in Las Vegas in the summer of 2018.\u0027They have videos of me doing this,\u0027 he said, referring to the filmed sex he just finished. \u0027They have videos of me doing crazy f***ing sex f***ing, you know.\u0027Hunter\u0027s debauched exploits raise the possibility that he was targeted as a vulnerable conduit to Joe Biden as part of multiple foreign intelligence operations – a possibility investigated by the Senate finance and security committees last year."},{"url":null,"title":"Javid urges people Covid tests going Christmas parties","story":"\u0027Obviously, the booster vaccination campaign is very welcome and I\u0027m sure that will help, and really the the last thing on the cards is more social distancing and how seriously we take that.\u0027I think, at the moment, one of my concerns is that there is an intensification of social mixing just in the run-up to Christmas and the timing of that is a bit unfortunate, given these circumstances.\u0027I\u0027m not saying that those events should be stopped or banned, but I think, you know, people might think about spending more time outside, trying to keep more of a distance, wearing masks at them, potentially taking tests before they go and potentially taking tests after they\u0027ve been to one and before they go and visit their relatives at Christmas.\u0027  Boris Johnson insisted he had already put in place a package of \u0027balanced and proportionate measures\u0027 in response to the threat posed by the new variant as cases of Omicron reached 22 in the UK.The mandatory wearing of facemasks in shops and on public transport came into force in England yesterday, along with tighter testing requirements for international travel and the return of self-isolation for contacts of confirmed Omicron cases, even if they have been fully vaccinated.But it is the booster campaign which the Government believes provides the greatest line of defence against the new variant and the Prime Minister promised that everyone eligible would be offered a booster jab by the end of January with at least 400 military personnel helping the NHS, and vaccination centres \u0027popping up like Christmas trees\u0027.Mr Javid said Omicron cases are likely to go higher and \u0027we have to be realistic\u0027 that there is already likely to be transmission within the community.Dr Harries had earlier told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme that even if \u0027vaccines appear to be effective, but we find that the variant is more highly transmissible, having lowish grade infection, but in very large numbers of the population, (it) could still be a significant impact on our hospitals\u0027.\u0027And, of course, our behaviours in winter and particularly around Christmas, we tend to socialise more, so I think all of those will need to be taken into account,\u0027 she added.\u0027If we all decrease our social contacts a little bit, actually that helps to keep the variant at bay.\u0027She suggested \u0027being careful, not socialising when we don\u0027t particularly need to\u0027 and getting a booster jab.The comments caused alarm in the hospitality industry and helped fuel a Tory backbench revolt which saw Conservatives rebel over new restrictions.Asked whether parties and Nativity plays should be scrapped, Mr Johnson said: \u0027We don\u0027t want people to cancel such events and we think that, overwhelmingly, the best thing for kids is to be at school, as I have said many times throughout this pandemic.\u0027He also rejected suggestions that advice on working from home should be reinstated in England, as is happening in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, in response to the concerns about Omicron.Scientists believe Omicron could be more transmissible than the dominant Delta variant and may render vaccines less effective because of the extent of its mutations.Mr Johnson, who visited a festive food market set up in Downing Street after the press conference, will be asked about the Government\u0027s approach again during Prime Minister\u0027s Questions in the Commons today.In the Commons on Tuesday, 19 Tories – with two rebel tellers – opposed the mask-wearing measures.Some 32 Conservatives rebelled by voting against the self-isolation regulations while two more acted as tellers for the noes, but the measures both comfortably passed.Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the powerful Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, said there were \u0027serious concerns\u0027 about the \u0027efficacy of what is being proposed\u0027, and warned against \u0027mission

Plan A we have always been clear that as you get into deeper winter, the colder, darker days, the virus likes that, not just this virus, the flu virus, they like that.\u0027So as we do that then

actually that helps to keep the variant at bay\u0027.Downing Street subsequently slapped down the advice as it stressed a reduction in socialising is not part of the Government\u0027s response to Omicron.Mr Johnson later echoed a similar sentiment at a Number 10 press conference as he said Christmas parties should still go ahead.Mr Javid was asked for his opinion on the issue this morning as he said: \u0027I think people should continue to behave in the way that they were planning to behave over Christmas.\u0027I don\u0027t think there is any need to change those plans. The only changes that have been made in the last few days are the ones that everyone now knows about.\u0027It might effect your international travel plans, so if someone had plans to travel over Christmas then there could be an impact there.\u0027There is the need to self-isolate if you come into contact with someone with Omicron.\u0027The Health Secretary was also asked if people should take a coronavirus test before attending a Christmas party.He replied: \u0027I would. I would. It is not a formal recommendation in the guidance but if I was going to a party with lots of party and things I would.\u0027But I would have done that by the way even before we knew about this variant.\u0027Again, the reason I would have done that is because it is getting cold, it is getting darker, we are spending more time indoors, probably more people indoors than before just because of the colder, darker days, so a sensible precaution that everyone can take.\u0027  NHS waiting list could DOUBLE to 12 million in just four years: Millions of patients who missed out on vital care during Covid pandemic could increase huge backlog, damning report warns By ELEANOR HAYWARD FOR THE DAILY MAIL NHS waiting lists could double to 12 million by 2025 despite billions more in taxpayers’ cash being pumped into our hospital wards, a damning report has concluded.The National Audit Office (NAO) said millions of patients had missed out on vital care during the pandemic – and could now return to the health service to increase the backlog.The number currently waiting for NHS care already stands at a record 5.83 million. But the NAO warned this could double to 12 million in a little over three years.Its report also warned the health service was falling dramatically short on all key targets – including cancer care – with the ‘catastrophic’ consequences costing lives.And it suggested Boris Johnson’s controversial new ‘health and social care levy’ would be inadequate to prevent hospital waiting lists continuing to soar. The report is likely to add to fears the NHS will swallow up almost all of the money from the new levy in the coming years, leaving little for the collapsing social care sector. Yesterday\u0027s study by the NAO – an independent watchdog that scrutinises public spending for Parliament – provides the most in-depth assessment to date of the horrifying legacy of the pandemic on non-Covid care.Even under its best case scenario, the NAO said the number of people in England waiting for routine care – currently at a record 5.8 million – will increase to 7 million in 2025.But if the NHS were to perform activity at pre-pandemic levels, this would actually reach 12 million by 2025 – meaning one fifth of the population was caught in the backlog.Experts warned if the Omicron variant leads to more disruption and lockdowns this winter there will be an ‘even bigger mountain to climb’. The report said up to 9.1 million patients missed out on referrals for elective care, saying ‘millions have avoided seeking or been unable to obtain healthcare during the pandemic’.Many were put off seeking help due to the Government’s ‘stay at home message’, while others had vital operations and appointments cancelled as hospitals dealt with an influx of Covid-19 patients.The NAO said it had been ‘impossible’ for the NHS to maintain cancer care throughout the crisis and treatment including chemotherapy ‘dropped significantly’. There were between 240,000 and 740,000 ‘missing’ urgent GP referrals for suspected cancer from March 2020 to September 2021. And between 35,000 and 60,000 fewer people started treatment for cancer than would have been expected during this time frame.The authors of the report said it is uncertain how many ‘missing’ cases will return to the NHS over the coming months.But if 50 per cent seek treatment, and activity continues to grow in line with pre-pandemic plans, the waiting list would reach 12 million by March 2025.If the NHS meets the Government’s target of increasing activity by 10 per cent more than planned, the waiting list would stand at 7 million in 2025.The Government’s new 1.25 per cent hike in national insurance, coming into force in April, will raise an extra £36billion over three years for the NHS and social care.Of this, £8billion will go specifically to addressing the backlog. However, the NAO said it was uncertain whether this funding would be enough to reduce waiting times and address long-term problems in the health service.It noted ‘waiting time performance had been gradually deteriorating’ since 2013 and ‘the pandemic heaped yet more pressure on a care system that was already creaking under the strain’.NHS England data shows that in February 2020, just 83 per cent of patients were seen within the 18-week standard. By last month, this had fallen to 66 per cent.The report said it will be impossible to clear the waiting list unless workforce shortages – of around 100,000 doctors, nurses and other NHS staff – are addressed. It also warned ‘the ongoing pandemic may continue to affect bed and staff availability in unexpected ways and at short notice’.The NAO report said if the backlog is to be cleared, social care needs support so elderly patients do not end up trapped in hospital.Tim Mitchell, vice president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said the projection that waiting lists could hit 12 million was ‘very worrying’ but ‘will not come as a surprise’.He called for the creation of ‘surgical hubs’ to tackle the backlog, adding: ‘Frustrated patients who have been left waiting in pain for hip, knee, heart and other vital operations, want to know there is a plan to reduce waiting times.’A spokesman for NHS England said: ‘NHS staff are now pulling out all the stops to recover elective activity levels, so anyone who is concerned about their health should come forward so the NHS can help you.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"SAGE tells No10 bring fit fly tests vaccinated UK arrivals","story":"Share this article   But the notes say: \u0027Any significant reduction in protection against infection could still result in a very large wave of infections.\u0027This would, in turn, lead to a potentially high number of hospitalisations even with protection against severe disease being less affected.\u0027  It comes as easyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said bookings had \u0027softened\u0027 since the Omicron strain emerged and the Government brought in costly travel rules that will require passengers to isolate until they have a negative PCR test result regardless of their vaccination status.Mr Lundgren, writing in the Daily Mail, pointed out airline shares had dropped 13 per cent within hours of the announcement of the change. \u0027Ministers must ensure their decisions are backed by data and precautions are kept in proportion to the threat,\u0027 he said.And Emirates airline president Tim Clark said a hit to the peak December travel season – when millions across the world travel to see friends and family – would cause \u0027significant traumas\u0027 for businesses.Critics have claimed that Mr Johnson\u0027s announcements are an over-reaction, given that only 22 omicron cases have so far been found in England. And early signs are that the variant is a mild form of the virus.They say the moves are contributing to a renewed climate of fear, hitting consumer confidence – with the hospitality sector especially hit. Clive Black, retail analyst at Shore Capital, said: \u0027This will cost the economy billions.

Westmeath. Photograph: Damien EagersSchool principals across the country say they do not envisage having to turn children away from school for failing to wear face masks.The principal of one Co Sligo primary school said the new rule is putting colleagues in an “awful situation” with many wondering if they will be facing court challenges for refusing access to non-compliant pupils.Aisling Tighe, principal of the 71-pupil Cloghogue school in Castlebaldwin said she was “lucky” to have had 100 per cent compliance but she said she would not refuse entry to a child who did not have a mask.“I would not block a child. They have missed enough days already,” she said.Ms Tighe was critical of a “strongly worded” letter circulated to principals late yesterday saying if medical certificates were not provided from today, pupils and staff without masks “will be refused entry to the school”.Saying this was causing concern among principals, the Co Sligo teacher said colleagues were asking: “Do we stand at the gate and not let them in? There are even jokes about bouncers. It’s a bit ridiculous.”She said there was also “a lot of anger out there” because of the decision to do away with contact tracing in schools. “If we still had contact tracing in schools we might not be in this position.”With just 71 pupils in the school, 38 of them from third class up are impacted by the new rule.Another Co Sligo-based principal agreed the lack of notice had put schools and parents under pressure, given that emails from the department and the chief medical officer had been received only on Tuesday evening with the new use coming into effect on Wednesday.Robert Campbell, principal of the two-teacher Kilmactranny school, which has just 18 pupils in total, said he too had full compliance but “I would not turn pupils away”. He said while the masks were proving “uncomfortable and worrying” for some children, they were very resilient .Meanwhile, there was also 100 per cent compliance with masks at Loughquittane National School in Killarney, Co Kerry, on Wednesday morning.‘Proactive’A decision was taken at the weekend to be “proactive” and children were also prepared, principal Alison Coffey said. It was explained to them and told how a lot of people in the school community had vulnerable people at home, Ms Coffey said.“It was totally voluntary. Older people at home could be vulnerable, we explained.”There was “100 per cent compliance,” she said. “In fact they children took so diligently when dismissal was called they had to be told to remove the mask – with some wearing the gear as they got into the family car.The masks are removed for play.Matt Melvin, principal of St Etchen’s National School in Kinnegad, Co Westmeath, says the vast majority of pupils aged nine and upwards were happy to wear face masks in school on Wednesday.“I’d say we had compliance rates of about 90 to 95 per cent,” he says. “In most cases where they were not wearing one it was a case of their parents not hearing the news or forgetting because it’s not part of the routine.”Mr Melvin says he doesn’t envisage having to turn any pupils away at the school gates, despite what the official guidance states.“This shouldn’t be about making heroes out of parents who are resisting the rules. When we discuss the new rules with children, and explain the reasons for it, they are very happy to oblige.”"},{"url":null,"title":"q a can my child really be refused entry to school for not wearing a face mask","story":"New rules have come into effect that primary school pupils from third class upwards should now wear face masks indoors. We visited St. Clare’s Primary School, Harold’s Cross, Dublin to see how pupils and teachers are adapting. Video: Bryan O\u0027BrienPupils in third class upwards are required to wear face masks, apart from those with exemptions. Photograph: Damien EagersWhat are the new rules on wearing face masks at primary school? Pupils in third class upwards are required to wear face masks, apart from those with exemptions. These rules apply for children aged nine-plus using public transport and in other public, indoor settings.Can my child really be refused entry to school for not wearing a mask? Department of Education guidelines state that unmasked pupils in third class upwards will be refused entry to school if they do not have a medical certificate to show they are exempt from the rules.Schools, however, are being advised by the Government to take a “flexible” and “practical” approach to the new rules over the coming days.Are these rules underpinned by law? The guidelines are not statutory but, like existing rules on face masks for secondary students, schools are required to implement them.When asked if school principals will be legally protected when implementing the wearing of face masks, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said where they apply public health policy they will be “protected definitely”.On what grounds can a child be exempt from wearing a mask? There three main grounds under which children may be exempt from wearing a mask:(1) Any pupil with difficulty breathing or other relevant medical conditions (2) Any pupil who is unable to remove the cloth face-covering or visor without\u0026nbspassistance (3) Any pupil who has special needs and who may feel upset or very uncomfortable wearing the cloth face covering or visor, for example pupils with intellectual or developmental disabilities, mental health conditions, sensory concerns or tactile sensitivityDo children require a medical certificate to prove they are exempt? Most children will not require a medical certificate on the basis that schools are best placed to identify children whose needs are such that the wearing of face covering may not be possible for them.In other circumstances, a medical certificate – from a GP, typically – must be provided to the school.What happens with mask wearing at break time or during PE? A “common sense” approach is being advised. As it the case at second level, students may take off masks briefly for eating and drinking indoors.Schools are being advised that masks can also be taken off when in the yard and for PE lessons outdoors.If sporting activity takes place indoors, masks do not need to be worn if the space is well ventilated and subject to CO2 monitoring.Masks may also be taken off for music, but consideration should be given to social distancing and ventilation.What happens if my child forgets or loses their face mask? Schools should have a sufficient supply of masks for this purpose.My child is in a mixed class with second and third class pupils. What rules apply? Where there are mixed classes in a single classroom, only children in third class and above are required to wear face masks.When will the rules be reviewed?  The Department of Education says it has been advised that this measure is being\u0026nbspintroduced on a temporary basis and is subject to review in mid-February 2022.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"college green pedestrianisation plan delayed for another three years","story":"The council published new plans last year for the pedestrian and cycle plaza, which would see the traffic-free zone double in size from previous designs. The council in November of last year published new plans for the pedestrian and cycle plaza, which would see the traffic-free zone double in size from previous designs. The new plaza would run from College Green to the junction of Dame Street and South Great George’s Street, with buses, cars and taxis banned from just west of the Luas line in front of Trinity College, for a distance of 350m and deliveries permitted until 11am only.The council at the time said it intended to submit a fresh application to An Bord Pleanála for the scheme by last summer.However, councillors were told on Wednesday the council would instead engage a team of consultants early next year to prepare the application and would “hopefully” lodge a planning application by the end of next year.Procurement“In 2023 we would hopefully be getting planning and going through a procurement process for a contractor with a view to being in a position to start work on College Green in early 2024,” Frank Lambe senior executive officer with the council said.This time frame would tie in with the implementation of the BusConnects programme in the College Green area he said. The previous plans for the plaza, were rejected by An Bord Pleanála in 2018, due to concerns about the “significantly negative impacts” it would have on bus movements and on traffic, particularly on the city quays .The National Transport Authority in September 2020 published its final plans for a redesigned bus network for the city. Under these plans buses were routed away from the College Green and east Dame Street area, to facilitate the plaza.The council has been preparing plans for the plaza since 2015 and has said the creation of the traffic-free space was essential to the smooth running of the Luas Green line that began operations through the city centre in December 2017.It submitted an application for the plaza to the board in May 2017. A planning hearing was scheduled for January 2018, but days before it was due to begin the hearing had to be postponed because of errors in a newspaper notice published by the council, on the board’s instruction, the previous November.The hearing was rescheduled for March, and did go ahead, but took three weeks instead of the scheduled three days. A decision was due in April 2018, but after several postponements the board rejected the plans in November 2018. The council at the time said it would submit a new application the following year."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Scientists fear key attitudes may change if climate change worsensStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"lack of prompt covid decision making exhausting public s patience","story":"People queuing at Citywest vaccination centre in Dublin this week.

Photograph: iStockIreland’s first confirmed case of the Omicron variant was identified through “blind luck”, according to public health officials.The case involved a person who recently returned from a country in southern Africa, where the new variant was first identified. Seven designated countries in the region are now the subject of travel restrictions.The person had returned to Ireland before the restrictions were imposed and then developed symptoms which necessitated a PCR test in the past week.Outlining the case at a media briefing on Wednesday, Dr Cillian de Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, said he had no details on the severity of the case.Dr de Gascun said there was “an element of blind luck” involved in the identification of the case, as it was included in a regular 10 per cent sample of all cases that is referred to the NVRL’s lab at Backweston each week.He said a review of cases involving S-gene failure, which can be used to identify potential Omicron cases, was carried out, dating back to the start of October.This identified 14 recent samples with this characteristic, of which eight could be retrieved. These were sent for whole genome sequencing, but only one was confirmed as involving Omicron. Enhanced contact tracing around the case has since begun.Seven other cases with S-gene dropout, which can be indicative of Omicron, were found not to involve this variant but a sub-lineage of the dominant Delta variant.According to Dr de Gascun, the prevalence of S-gene dropout cases was well under 1 per cent. The vast majority of cases from October and November were no longer be available for sequencing.Dr de Gascun said there was no evidence of community transmission of the variant in Ireland, and for this reason travel measures had been introduced to minimise spread. Once a variant gets into a country, it has to achieve a “critical mass”, after which dominance occurs over four to eight weeks.About 1,500 cases a week can be genetically sequenced, or about 5 per cent of all cases, he told the briefing.The NVRL had anticipated the S-gene dropout test could have been used as a proxy test for the presence of Omicron, prior to sequencing, but Dr de Gascun said the fact that only one out of eight samples identified in this way turned out to be the new variant showed it could not be used in isolation as a surveillance measure.Officials are now working through what the best approach might be. Aside from travel-related cases and close contacts, they will be trying to find the best way of sampling that can “characterise what’s happening in the population at large”.“We only found out about this lack of association between S-gene targeting and Omicron this morning.”Omicron responseThe emergence last week of the new variant prompted the Government on Friday to impose travel restrictions on passengers from seven southern African countries: South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini and Mozambique. People arriving in Ireland from these countries have to quarantine at home for 10 days after entering the State. Although the number of travellers impacted will be small, the reintroduction of travel restrictions marks a further return to tighter restrictions to bring Covid under control.Travellers from those countries will also have to present a “not-detected” pre-flight PCR test result, regardless of vaccination status, quarantine at home for 10 days and undergo a further two PCR tests. The obligation is backdated for recent arrivals from these countries, who will be traced and contacted using the passenger locator form. The Garda will monitor compliance, initially.Concerns over Omicron and the ongoing high level of Covid cases in the State has led to the Government approving a raft of measures.These measures require travellers into Ireland from any country to show negative PCR or antigen test results, introduce mask-wearing for primary school children from third class upwards and ask parents to limit their children’s socialising.Pandemic powersTwo pieces of legislation – one to extend several Covid powers and one specifically to revive mandatory hotel quarantine if needed – are to be brought to the Dáil and Seanad in the coming days.The mandatory hotel legislation is necessary because those powers have already lapsed, while the other Covid powers – including those concerning masks, hospitality restrictions, Covid certificates, travel restrictions and others – are due to lapse early next year.Officials are currently preparing orders to require travellers into the country to show a negative PCR or antigen test from Friday. There will be “spot checks” at the airport to ensure travellers are compliant, but officials said it would be mostly a matter for airlines and ferry companies to ensure that passengers could show a negative test.The Government is considering fines for carriers that allow people without tests to board, while a spokesman confirmed there would be fines for passengers who could not show a negative test. There will be no checks for travellers from Northern Ireland.

Other owners proudly displaying Frenchies in their timelines include Marcus Rashford, the Manchester United football and food poverty campaigner, and Hugh Jackman, star of the X-Men film franchise.Figures show that since 2010, registration of French bulldogs with the Kennel Club has increased by 1,682 per cent.The Kennel Club says it cannot simply ban the entry of “deformed” French bulldogs to its shows, as unhealthy exaggerated features needed to be confirmed in a face-to-face examination by a trained expert.As a result of the changes, judges at shows, including the world-famous Crufts, will be required to mark down any dogs that have the problematic features.A Kennel Club spokesperson added: “Dog shows can be an important lever for change by ensuring the public can see and recognise what a healthy and unexaggerated example of a breed looks like. “We have training and education for judges, who have been informed of these updates to the breed standard and know that only the healthiest examples are rewarded at dog shows.”The changes to the breed standard come after the Kennel Club developed its Respiratory Function Grading Scheme in 2019, in partnership with the University of Cambridge, to “support and encourage” the responsible breeding of French bulldogs and other brachycephalic breeds. The scheme assesses a dog for the likelihood that it has BOAS (Brachycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndrome), which can affect some French bulldogs, causing painful problems with breathing.But experts have urged pet lovers to do their bit to undermine the market for poorly bred Frenchies and other breeds by shunning irresponsible breeders.Dr Laura Hamilton, a veterinary surgeon and French bulldog breed health coordinator, added: “Many people love owning French bulldogs, but it’s crucial that the public is aware of the breed’s complex health concerns and prioritise health over what they might think looks ‘cute’, and that breeders do all they can to produce healthy puppies.“Although these changes to the French bulldog breed standard are important, these days social media can often be influential on the way that dogs are bred to look, so we urge any would-be owners to fully research the breed before making any decisions, speak to experts, and find a responsible breeder who health screens their dogs.”More from NewsSupreme Court indicates it will uphold Mississippi abortion law which challenges Roe v WadeTearful Alec Baldwin says \u0026#39I didn\u0026#39t pull the trigger\u0026#39 in first interview since fatal shooting on Rust setNo 10\u0026#39s plans will fail to solve the social care crisis, Jeremy Hunt warnsGhislaine Maxwell trial latest: Jeffrey Epstein introduced me to Donald Trump, accuser claimsTeachers ‘go rogue’ and cancel nativities because of new Covid restrictions to tackle omicronMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes new test detect omicron variant","story":"A new test to pick up the omicron variant without needing to send it for full sequencing is being developed by health officials. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said it was working quickly to come up with a genotyping assay, which would give an early indication of a probable variant case.The assays will look for the presence of specific mutations carried by the variant in positive Covid samples. In the case of omicron, the variant carries many mutations which set it apart from other variants.It comes amid concerns that many cases of omicron are being missed, because half of laboratories cannot spot the variant and only one-fifth of samples are being fully sequenced.Rule changes introduced this week to prevent the spread of omicron mean that those who have been in contact with a confirmed case must self-isolate for 10 days. But there are fears that large numbers of cases will never be detected.Full sequencing can take up to 48 hours. So, if samples must be sent away to be checked, it is possible that people will not know they need to self-isolate in time.Currently, only 50 per cent of laboratories use a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test which can spot omicron, because the variant does not carry one of three genes that the test is looking for.Since July, rapid genotyping for the Beta, Gamma, Delta and Kappa variants, has been available at regional network laboratories.UKHSA would not confirm whether the new test would also be limited to regional centres, or whether it would be rolled out more widely. They were also unable to say how accurate it would be or when the test would be available.A further nine cases of omicron were identified in England on Wednesday, taking the total in the country to 22. The variant has now been found in the East Midlands, East of England, London, South East and North West.A further case was also reported in Scotland, bringing the total to 10.Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of UKHSA, said: “It is very likely that we will find more cases over the coming days as we are seeing in other countries globally and as we increase case detection through focused contact tracing.“That’s why it’s critical that anyone with Covid-19 symptoms isolates and gets a PCR test immediately.”On Sunday, Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, said that it would be possible to pick up the contacts of omicron cases quickly because they could be identified through PCR testing, rather than needing full sequencing, which takes longer.The omicron variant is missing one of the three target genes which PCR tests are looking for, meaning that it can be detected without looking at the virus in detail.The UKHSA said that all samples from suspected cases and those through surge testing would be sent to laboratories that could detect the s-gene dropout.Officials are also contacting private laboratories who are carrying out travel PCR tests, to see if they can pick up the s-gene deletion and help with omicron detection.More from NewsNo 10\u0026#39s plans will fail to solve the social care crisis, Jeremy Hunt warnsGhislaine Maxwell trial latest: Jeffrey Epstein introduced me to Donald Trump, accuser claimsTeachers ‘go rogue’ and cancel nativities because of new Covid restrictions to tackle omicronScots refused early Covid booster vaccines despite plea from Nicola SturgeonNothing tugs on the heart like the lost tastes of childhoodKeir Starmer gives his best rendition of a Commons greatest hit - \u0026#39Last Christmas\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"europe should consider making covid","story":"Europe should consider making Covid vaccines mandatory says EU chiefEuropean Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen said a third of the EUs population was unvaccinated amid fears over the spread of the Omicron iantMandatory vaccination for the EU needs discussion says European Commission President Image: Maureen McLean REX ShutterstockByLizzy BuchanDeputy Online Political Editor:,  Dec | commentsThe EU should consider making Covid vaccination mandatory to battle the spread of the Omicron iant, the European Commission President has said. Ursula Von der Leyen told reporters that  million people in Europe were not vaccinated - around a third of the population - and discussions were needed on how to boost take-up. Europe has been hit by a wave of Covid cases, leading to fresh restrictions in countries like Austria, Belgium and Portugal. As of Tuesday,  cases of the new Omicron iant had been reported in EU countries, including Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Austria has already said it will make jabs mandatory from February while Germanyaposs incoming Chancellor Olaf Scholz reportedly supports the idea.  Ms Von der Leyen, a former medical doctor, was asked whether she supported mandatory jabs. She told reporters in Brussels: “We have the vaccines, the le-saving vaccines, but they are not being used adequately everywhere. And this costs … This is an enormous health cost coming along.“If you look at the numbers, we have now % of the adults in the European Union vaccinated oryou take the whole population, it’s %. And this means one-third of the European population is not vaccinated. These are  million people.“This is a lot, and not each and every one can be vaccinated – children, for example, or people with special medical conditions – but the vast majority could and therefore, I think it is understandable and appropriate to lead this discussion now. “How we can encourage and potentially think about mandatory vaccination within the European Union, this needs discussion. This needs a common approach, but it is a discussion that I think has to be met. She said the world was in a race against time to battle the virus. “Scientists tell us we have to do everything possible to make the best out of the time we have till we have certainty about the characteristics of transmissibility and severity of Omicron”, she said. Prepare for the worst, hope for the best. Vaccination policy is decided by inidual states, and Ms Von der Leyen added: It is not for me to make such a recommendation. In the UK, jabs are not mandatory but being fully vaccinated is now a condition of employment for care workers.Health Secretary Sajid Javid recently announced that NHS staff in England would need to have had both jabs by April, following a consultation.However Mr Javid said he did not believe the Government would ever make Covid vaccination obligatory for ordinary citizens.

Adam Wagner, Visiting Professor of Law at Goldsmiths University of London who has analysed Covid laws, said organisers of such an event could have faced a £, fine while attendees could have been fined £.It comes after the Mirror revealed Boris Johnson and his Downing Street staff were accused of breaking Covid rules by attending parties at No. The Prime Minister gave a speech at a packed leaving do for a top aide last November  when the country was in the grip of its second lockdown, sources told the Mirror. Then on December , with London in tier  restrictions, members of his top team held their own festive bash in Downing Street. Scroll down for the full legal opinion and join the debate in the comments.  Downing Street did not deny the events were held, but a spokesman said: “Covid rules have been followed at all times.” Mr Wagner, however, said only “permitted organised gatherings” or those “reasonably necessary for work” would have been allowed at the time. In an analysis for the Mirror, he wrote: “It seems doubtful that any kind of party, held for over  people indoors where Covid was more likely to spread, would be reasonably necessary for work. “A court looking at this would probably take into account the fact that official guidance from  November said ‘[a]lthough there are exemptions for work purposes, you must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity and is not otherwise permitted by the rules in your tier’.  “This strongly suggests that primarily social work Christmas parties would not be permitted under the rules – and a court would not be sympatheticthe party was organised by the politicians who made the rules in the first place. “At the time, anyone who held, or was involved in the holding” of an illegal gathering over  people indoors would potentially have committed a criminal offence.

Askedthe gatherings happened, he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “Whatever would’ve happened in No throughout the pandemic, I’m absolutely certain all the rules around the pandemic would have been followed.“Obviously I can’t tell you what’s going on on a daily basis in any building, butit’s government and especially No all the rules would have been followed at all times.” He added: “You’re assuming that the news report you’re referring to is accurate, and I’m sure you would have come across inaccurate news reports in the past.” But askedhe was certain it’s inaccurate, he replied: “I can tell you all rules would have been followed at all times.” Top barrister’s opinion in fullBy Adam Wagner, Barrister and Visiting Professor of Law, Goldsmiths University of LondonThe lockdown laws changed regularly last Winter and it was sometimes dficult to keep up. From  November to  December we were in a national lockdown. From  December, the “three tiers” were introduced. The “leaving party” was during the national lockdown law which applied from  November to  December. The  December “Christmas party” was whilst London was in “Tier ”, the highest level of restrictions at the time. During that period there were only two legal ways to have an indoor gathering of more than  people. There were “permitted organised gatherings”, but that would mean guests weren’t allowed to mingle with anyone not in their household. That doesn’t seem to apply here. The only other legal route wasthe gathering was “reasonably necessary for work”. It seems doubtful that any kind of party, held for over  people indoors where Covid was more likely to spread, would be reasonably necessary for work. A court looking at this would probably take into account the fact that official guidance from  November said “[a]lthough there are exemptions for work purposes, you must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity and is not otherwise permitted by the rules in your tier”. This strongly suggests that primarily social work Christmas parties would not be permitted under the rules – and a court would not be sympatheticthe party was organised by the politicians who made the rules in the first place.

Mr Rees-Mogg borrowed up to £.m a year in directoraposs loans from his firm Saliston Ltd between  and . Although it does not specically identy directoraposs loans, the MPaposs code of conduct requires directors to declare taxable expenses, allowances and benefits. The Leader of the House of Commons stated that he was an unremunerated director and shareholder of the firm but did not mention he had taken out the loans. By using directoraposs loans he was able to borrow the large sum at very low interest rates.  UK company Saliston Ltd has previously been described as a holding company by Mr Rees-Mogg, with £m property assets, understood to include a Mayfair house. Saliston also has a stake in asset management firm Somerset Capital Management LLP, which Mr Rees-Mogg co-founded. He paid just £, interest to Saliston on £m of loans over three years, a rate of just .%. The deputy Labour leader and shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster pointed to a section of the ministerial code which says that ministers must ensure that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and their private interests, financial or otherwise. Downing Street refused to comment on the specics. The Prime Ministeraposs press secretary said: The Leader of the House of Commons has addressed this directly previously but beyond that itaposs a matter for the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, which is independent so you wouldnapost expect us to comment on it.

We were at the theatre, to see a show my son had been learning about at school, a super special early Christmas treat.Behind us were five women in their thirties who, from the off, talked, and not even in stage ­whispers only during the big musical numbers. They chatted at the top of their voices throughout, as though they were at home in front of the telly rather than surrounded by people, and being incredibly rude to the performers on stage a few feet away. Half-way through the second act, I snapped. Although that makes it sound much more impressive than it was, because obviously I just meekly and incredibly Britishly pleaded with them to be quiet. Please. Thank you. Sorry. It did not go well. I was stupid for trying. What did I think they were going to say, “We had no idea we were disturbing you, please accept our apologies ”  Of course not. They knew they were being loud. They didn’t care. It reminded me of whenever I’ve seen anybody ask someone to wear a mask. The last time, it ended with the personanswering the polite, reasonable request with, “You f***king bitch, mind your own business”.The irony of saying that about a global pandemic – by definition, everyone’s business – seemingly lost here.Now there’s a potentially serious new iant, so we’re being asked to do something. The something that a worldwide study found to be the single most effective public health measure at tackling Covid. Wear a mask.  The reaction to this small ask, and my uncomfortable theatre experience, has left me with a depressing realisation. We’re not living in a Me First society. We’re living in a Me Me Me Me First society. This was impossible to ignore thanks to the amount of maskless people going about their business on Monday – in shops, on public transport , everywhere. They knew the mandate was coming into effect the following day, and why, but still they refused to take part in the communal effort to save Christmas – and, you know, lives – until there was no other option. Admittedly the messaging has been insane over the last few months. There will be some who think you must not need to wear a maskthe man with the most important job in the UK doesn’t. With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email. Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here. But there are others who know this isn’t the case, but don’t want to wear masks, so they just… don’t. Similar to the kind of person who feels like chatting loudly in a theatre, so just… does. Apart from no one diespeople talk in a theatre. The truth is that there are a lot of utterly selfish iniduals out there. We see it on a larger scale with rich countries not doing enough to supply vaccines to poorer ones because they’re too worried about themselves. And what gets lost is that helping them is the best thing we can dowe’re worried about ourselves, becauseeveryone’s vaccinated, spread is reduced and iants less likely to develop. We all need to look out for each other, with masks, with sharing vaccines, with compassion. Only then is there hope for us all.

Sophie Higginbottom, , tipped the scales at st and wore a size  before she lost half her body weight dieting with Slimming World and taking up running. Now Sophie of Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, can’t wait to become a ‘beautul bride’ after getting engaged and dropping to a svelte size eight. Sophie, who lives with fiancé, Alex, and their two greyhounds, now weighs a healthy st. She said: “I feel like this is the version of me that I was always supposed to be. “I had struggled with my weight since I was a teenager and couldn’t seem to get it under control. “I would always avoid cameras and just hated having my photo taken...it was getting to the point where I barely recognised myself.  “Planning a wedding is actually something I’m excited about, I definitely think it would have been something I dreaded before I lost weight. “I’ve been trying on some wedding dresses, and it was such a lovely experience. I felt beautul and really comfortable having my photograph taken, which is a world away from the way I felt when I was almost st heavier. “I’m so much more confident and full of le. Nothing feels out of reach any more, and that’s an amazing feeling.” Sophie joined Slimming World in January  after a charity fun run with her family to raise money for Alder Hey Hospital made her realise how unfit she was.  After finding her local group, she quickly got to grips with her new diet and was amazed when she lost five pounds in her first week of the plan. Following her incredible success, she has been named Slimming World’s ‘Woman of the Year’. Trainee psychologist Sophie said: “I’d tried lots of diets in the past, but nothing ever stuck because I felt so restricted. With Slimming World, I could still enjoy lots of hearty and delicious food. “At first, I thought my fiancé was dreading the food he would have to eat with me - but I soon changed his mind!  “Slimming World has changed my relationship with food for the better. I was scared of food before, now it’s my best friend. “I forward plan exciting and filling meals for the week ahead and I take it as a bit of a challenge to make Slimming World-friendly versions of all our favourite foods. “I’ve done an American feast of burgers and mac ‘n’ cheese, a big family Greek night and we still enjoy a cooked breakfast. It really has slotted into our lives so well and neither of us feel like we’re on a ‘diet’.”  Discovering a love for running during the lockdowns last year and overhauling her diet has seen Sophie shed a total of st  and  lbs. Sophie said: “Le was lacking joy previously - there was no excitement, no happiness. I would hide away, and would never put myself forward for things. “I was much more negative about myself. I didn’t look in the mirror before - it was better to avoid mirrors, to be honest. I would cut the labels out of clothes. I was so embarrassed about being overweight and the size that I was.  “I don’t think I would have planned a wedding before. I wouldn’t have been happy getting married at that point - I wasn’t happy myself. “The thought of trying on a wedding dress filled me with fear, but when I went to the shop with my mum, it was the most amazing experience. I feel like it’s made me the person I was always meant to be and now I’m just excited to be that person and live my le.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Slimming WorldAlder Hey hospitalHospitalsLoveMarriageWedding dressTeenagers\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He managed to get away with two mobile phones, an Amazon tablet, a handbag and its contents, a wallet, and a school bag and its contents. But the quick-thinking victim used his Find my iPhone app to locate Mitchell, who was so intoxicated on Valium he could not recall what he had done.  Police found him at a city hotel with some of the valuables he had stolen from the family home, Plymouth Crown Court heard. He was also caught with a computer tower he had had stolen from the University of Plymouth, and later admitted breaking into two cars. Mitchell has  previous convictions for burgling homes. Sending him back to prison for almost two and a half years, a judge said that a neighbouraposs camera had shown Mitchell snooping around homes in Plymstock. Judge David Evans added: Less than two weeks after you were released on licence, you committed this burglary, with two children under ten in the house. You stole items belonging to one of them. It is clear from the victim statement that the family felt unable to stay in their own home and they booked into a hotel for the following night. Mitchell, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to burglary of the home in Killerton Lane between October  and October . He asked for three other offences to be taken into consideration over the same period - the burglary of the university building and theft of cash and a digital camera from two cars. Judge Evans jailed him for  days, which is the statutory three-year term for a three-strike domestic burglar minus the maximum  per cent discount.

Ms Redfern refused to comply with the order and defiantly re-opened the next day. She argued the action against her was unlawful and she needed to provide for her family. The council then took the case to Swansea Magistratesapos Court, in a bid to force the cinema to shut for a specied period. At a hearing on Tuesday, solicitor Lee Reynolds argued that Cinema  Co had clearly ignored the rules. He said: The reality is we say, the way these premises are being run, is asCovid simply does not exist.  The important point we rely upon, whilst it is accepted we will never be able to prove that the premises are infected, they may be infected. Businesses are given directions to minimise the risk of infection and contamination, and the way these premises are being run means they may be contaminated. This is not a theoretical risk, the officers have attended, seen the lack of signage, lack of anti-bacterial hand wash. It is a real risk instead of a theoretical one. It is based on the eye witness account of officers who have attended and can, on oath, put forward a position why these premises could be infected or contaminated due to the way they are run.  However, Ms Redfern hit back - insisting her business was safe and claimed that the action against her had been unlawful. She said: They are trying to close me down unlawfully and each time they have turned up I havenapost been there and itaposs just incorrect. I donapost believe the allegations are correct at all. Public Health Act - I have a right to run my business. All I have done is give my customers the freedom of choice whether they want to come to my business or not. The councilaposs unlawful closure is having a ripple effect on the local community. However, Ms Redfernaposs appeal for District Judge Neal Thomas to dismiss the case was rejected. He said: Iaposm satisfied the local authorityaposs application has been properly brought under the Public Health Act and I grant the application as requested. Itaposs clear from the evidence the local authority is trying to do no more than their job. To try and reduce the risk of transmission of a disease. The outcome of his ruling does not mean Ms Redfern has a criminal conviction against her name, but it does mean that the councilaposs enforcement action against her was legally correct. And as a result, it means that Cinema  Co must comply with Covid regulations - effectively meaning it will have to shut its doors, as per the councilaposs original order. Solicitor Mr Reynolds said thatCinema  Co remained open then an application for contempt of court would be made. He said those who were found to be in contempt of court can face a jail sentence. Ms Redfern was told to pay the councilaposs legal costs of £,. She declined to comment as she left court. A council spokesman said: We welcome the decision today by the district judge, which we hope will encourage the owner of Cinema  Co to carry out the necessary work to protect staff and customers. During this entire process, the Council did not want to close down this business - indeed we have provided millions of pounds of funding, help and support so businesses can operate safely during the pandemic. We want Cinema  Co open and trading, the same as the majority of businesses in Swansea and Wales, who are following the rules and are doing all they can to keep people safe. We will continue to offer support and advice to Cinema  Co to ensure those measures are in place and that they can operate safely. The coronavirus virus is still with us and signicant concerns remain about the potential impact of the new Omicron iant.The measures and regulations currently in place are vital to help slow the spread of the virus and to protect the NHS and social care.We hope Cinema  Co will comply with the court order and follow all of the Covid safety measures.

He added: “We are already making signicant progress in tackling physical inactivity, improving infrastructure and making environmental changes to enable people to be more active. “We are delighted to be working with the Department for Health and Social Care and HeadUp on this important pilot to see whether offering incentives can help people make positive changes to improve their health and wellbeing.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSHealth TechAir MilesAppsFitnessObesity\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He cited an issue with restaurants that are typically four or five stars getting knocked down for fairly minor, technical infringements and the process for reassessment can take up to six months. He added: What we are asking for is the government to require local authorities to have a much faster appeal and recertication process so that those marked down can be reassessed in - weeks, not - months. Otherwise, we will not be able to play our part in the recovery of our high streets, as this inflexible process will prove the straw that breaks the camelaposs back.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a message: “I’m delighted that one of the greatest events in our gastronomic calendar, the Curry Oscars, is back in action and it is fantastic to celebrate the genius of our curry restaurateurs who have, for decades, offered their fragrant medleys.

Health officials in the area, said it was highly probable that the Covid iant had been discovered there, and said it is taking precautionary action against its spread. The B. . . iant, known as Omicron, was first identied in southern Africa, but has since been reported in at least  other countries but is expected to be far more widespread. Cases in the UK have been found from Glasgow, to Liverpool, Norfolk and London as the government works to try and keep the new iant from spilling out of control. See the full list of where it is in the UK below. Since its discovery the government has announced tighter restrictions, including requiring mask wearing on public transport. So far, every confirmed case in the UK has been tested and along with their contacts are isolating.  The full list of cases where the Omicron iant is across the UK: Barnet –  Bolton -  Brentwood –  Camden –  Glasgow -  Haringey –  Lanarkshire -  Liverpool –  North Norfolk –  Nottingham –  Sutton –  Wandsworth –  Westminster –  Health officials have said that it is “highly probable” that there are two more cases of the Omicron iant in Bolton. The iniduals that tested positive are said to be linked, and members of their households are being re-tested and are self-isolating. Dr Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of UKHSA, said: “We are continuing our efforts to understand the effect of this iant on transmissibility, severe disease, mortality, antibody response and vaccine efficacy. “Vaccination is critical to help us bolster our defences against this new iant – please get your first, second, third or booster jab without delay. Following the change in JCVI advice yesterday, a booster dose for everyone over  years is now recommended at a minimum of  months from your last primary course jab. Please take up this offer as soon as you are invited to protect yourself, your families and your communities.  “Please make sure to wear a mask in line with government guidance, including on public transport and in shops, to help break the chains of transmission and slow the spread of this new iant. “It is very likely that we will find more cases over the coming days as we are seeing in other countries globally and as we increase case detection through focused contact tracing. That’s why it’s critical that anyone with Covid- symptoms isolates and gets a PCR test immediately.”  All nine of Scotland’s Omicron cases can be traced back to a single event, which took place on November . First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament that this suggested that there was community transmission already happening within the UK. She added that more cases were likely over the coming days, which could also be linked to this super-spreader event. Most of England’s cases focus in and around London.  The case in Brentwood, Essex, was linked to a local KFC branch but all staff tested negative and the fast food chain has reopened since. One of the cases in Westminster involved an inidual who left the country shortly after. Wales and Northern Ireland are yet to report a confirmed case of the new iant.

Police said the opening of The Ripped Gym in Harlow in Essex in November last year was a blatant breach of legislation and put peopleaposs lives at risk.In police bodycam footage, -year-old owner Michelle Meade-Wyatt told officers who attended the gym that she did not consent to any fines. She refused to provide her details and added: Iaposm a living woman and weaposre under common law. An officer warned her she would be arrested and that the matter would be dealt with under Covid- legislation. Essex Police said that after around  minutes of trying to engage with her, officers felt they had no choice but to arrest her for breaching the regulations. The force said that Meade-Wyatt, of Liverpool, admitted at Colchester Magistratesapos Court to breaching Covid- restrictions.She pleaded guilty to failing to cease carrying on a business that was restricted under the Health Protection CoronavirusRegulations , police said.She was ordered to pay fines and costs totalling £, at the hearing on November .  Assistant Chief Constable Rachel Nolan said: This case is a very clear example of a blatant breach of the legislation, which not only put peopleaposs health at risk, but at a time when infection rates were rising. She said that officers and council staff had made extensive attempts to engage with the gym owner to resolve this situation. Meade-Wyatt told the PA news agency: I stayed open because the members were committing suicide. She said she only admitted the charge after there was a slight changing of wording. Meade-Wyatt claimed that after her arrest she was held for just under  hours, and she plans to take civil action against the force.

The sheep can be seen laying in the long grass as the violent stallion jumps around and picks up the defenceless animal and aggressively slings its body in every which way.The sheep already looks leless as it is dropped to the floor before the horse picks it up again to throw it around once more.  A couple of startled onlookers can be seen tentatively approaching the horse in a bid to help the sheep, but decide to hang back as the furious horse is filmed bucking and throwing its head around in a display of sheer rage. As the sheep is picked up a second time its face is red with blood from its injuries. Viewers of the shocking footage remarked about the power and potential threat horses can pose when distressed. One user commented: Everyone knows to stay clear of the back end, but the front is really the most dangerous. Iaposve seen my horse lt a  lb bale of hay and causally toss it when trying to pull some lose bits of forage out.  Another added: Easy to forget how powerful horses are. Lted that sheep and threw it around like it was nothing. Others took pity on the sheep making reference to their gentle nature, used to soothe children to sleep. One comment read: I bet that sheep wishes it was jumping over a sleeping childaposs mind, being counted so that they could fall asleep.

The government is keen for anyone who shows any covid symptom to take a free PCR, which can be booked here. But many Brits have been coughing and sneezing more than usual – and there have even been reports of it being the worst cold ever so itaposs important to be able to tell the dference between the two coronavirus iants, a cold and the flu. What are the symptoms of a cold  According to the NHS, the symptoms of a cold can come on gradually, and include:A blocked or runny noseA sore throat HeadachesMuscle aches Coughs A raised temperature Pressure in your ears and face Loss of taste and smell  What are the symptoms of the flu  The NHS says flu symptoms can include:a sudden fever – a temperature of C or above an aching body feeling tired or exhausted a dry cough a sore throat a headache dficulty sleeping loss of appetite diarrhoea or tummy pain feeling sick and being sickWhat are the main Covid symptoms According to the NHS, the main coronavirus symptoms are: A high temperature A new, continuous cough A loss or change to your sense of smell or tasteMost of the above symptoms are the first that were officially recognised by the government and are still the accepted ones linked to the Delta iant.Statistics from South Africa, where the Omicron iant was first detected and sequenced, has shown that there have been no hospital admissions and no deaths from people with Omicron.Doctors also say people recover from it in just a few days after symptoms, including tiredness, headache and muscle aches, pass.  Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, who was one of the first people to suspect the Omicron Covid strain, has said she noticed patients at her private clinic showing symptoms that are dferent from the Delta iant.Dr Coetzee told the AFP that she alerted health officials of a clinical picture that doesnapost fit Delta on  November when seven patients showed dferent symptoms that seemed very much related to normal viral infection. She said her patients presented with extreme tiredness, mild muscle aches, scratchy throat and dry cough. Unlike the previous iants, this one doesnapost cause loss of taste or smell, she added.

Weaposre free to party, toke the occasional cig, sleep with whoever we want to, and nurse our hangovers with fast food and sleep. But for many young gay men, including myself, the fear surrounding HIV and Aids can be crippling - evenweaposre not exposing ourselves to potential infection. In the aposs, the Aids crisis, also known as the aposgay plagueapos, had the world in a panicked chokehold. It was seen as a stark death sentence, a self-inflicted consequence of a dirty lestyle a decade of tragedy. And while medical understanding has advanced by leaps and bounds - the stigma surrounding the virus still echoed on to younger generations.I was six years old when Section  was finally abolished in England and Wales. The notorious law, brought in during Thatcheraposs administration, prohibited schools from talking about homosexuality. But a decade later, at the ripe old age of , I still hadnapost received any form of LGBTQ+ sex education at secondary school or sixth form. I didnapost know that HIV was no longer the death sentence that it once was, or what aposundetectableapos meant, or why as a teen who hadnapost even had sex I was so afraid of it. Because I really was petried at times.  At school, youaposd regularly hear jokes about people being bummed and getting Aids - but no teacher attempted to correct the ignorance or debunk the myths. And for some reason, I couldnapost talk to anyone about my constant panic of dying - because the stigma surrounding the virus is still re, and education is still so poor.  In fact, according to sexual health charity Terrence Higgins Trust, the most recent estimate suggests there were , people living with HIV in the UK in . Of these, around , are undiagnosed and do not know they are HIV positive. Equally alarming,  percent of people living with HIV have never shared their status with anyone outside of their healthcare workers. Now, my experience with health anxiety is nothing compared to the thousands of people living with HIV who face discrimination on a daily basis. But it highlights how strong the reverberations of the aposs crisis are - and how important it is we begin to educate children about HIV. Today is World Aids Day - but headlines surrounding Covid continue to dominate. Perhaps because Aids is still seen as a gay comeuppance that doesnapost really affect the straight world - or maybe because the stigma is so ingrained into our society itaposs impossible to smash. But we must break through. If not, history could easily repeat itself.HIV is the name of a virus. Aids is the name for a collection of illnesses caused by this virus. HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. ‘Immunodeficiency’ refers to the weakening of the immune system by the virus. HIV has been passed on between humans for many decades but was only identied in the early s.AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. It is a collection of illnessescaused by a virus people pick upthat makes their immune system weak . You can’t get an AIDS diagnosis unless you’re already HIV positive. In the s and early s, most people with HIV were eventually diagnosed with AIDS. Now, thanks to modern antiretroviral treatment, very few people in the UK develop serious HIV-related illnesses. The term Aids isn’t used much by UK doctors. Instead they talk about late-stage or advanced HIV. If left untreated, infection with HIV progresses through a series of stages: from flu-like seroconversion illness, through infections associated with the symptomatic stage, leading to late-stage HIV or AIDS. If someone with HIV has a detectable viral load, they can pass on HIV through blood, semen, vaginal fluid, anal mucus and breast milk. HIV is not passed on by spitting, sneezing or coughing, nor by kissing or general social contact. HIV can’t survive for very long once itaposs outside the human body. Studies have shown that a person whoaposs on effective treatment who has an undetectable viral load canapost pass on HIV.

In the months before her diagnosis in , the -year-old had lost three stone and was so ill that she collapsed in the hospital where she was sent for clinical assessment.It followed years of unexplained symptoms, during which time her blood was taken numerous times - but she was never tested for HIV. Ahead of World AIDS Day on December , Sandra is sharing her story in the hope it can raise awareness around testing and ensure people get the vital treatment they need sooner. Despite experiencing a number of chest infections and symptoms linked with HIV - such as unexplained night sweats, weight loss, coldsores and thrush for  years - she said medics never even considered the virus. She believes that because of her age, location and not falling into a group with a high prevalence of HIV, medics overlooked the possibility that she could have the illness.  It wasnapost until July , after being sent to hospital in Harrogate that Sandra, from North Yorkshire, was finally given the answer she needed. The doctor told me that I was HIV positive, she recalled. I thought he was going to say stage four cancer. It was a relief to know what it was. By that stage her condition was so advanced that medics said she needed immediate urgent treatment at St Jamesapos University in Leeds to save her le. I was pretty far gone, I was at the stage where it was goodbye, Sandra said. They said that within  hours it would be critical. I was in hospital for the whole of August , they saved my le.  Sandra said: I donapost know whether they discarded the idea that I had it, or just didnapost think of it at all. I just hope one or two of them went home and had a couple of nightmares. If anyone had said to letaposs do an HIV test Iaposd have said yes, by all means. An earlier diagnosis would have made a huge dference. If I had stayed at home, I live on my own, trying to live with this illness I could have died. I just donapost know why I wasnapost tested. Because of the weight loss I wonderedit was cancer that was being missed. She said she hopes her experience encourages medics to ensure patients are checked for HIV. Sandra said: Iaposve lived in fear that I was going to slip through the net. Iaposm an example of what can happen, but I donapost want this to be a sob story about me. I want to show that GPs should test for everything, itaposs only a simple blood test.  Sandra, who believes she had been HIV positive for  years before it was diagnosed, is now able to manage her condition through medication - although she said the amount of tablets she takes is higher than it would beshe had been diagnosed early. I donapost feel like Iaposm fading away, which is how I felt before, she said. Recent highly acclaimed TV drama Itaposs A Sin, which tackled the emergence of the AIDS epidemic in the s, was a hard watch, Sandra said. It shows people dying from AIDS, it was like a blow to the head because to me thataposs how I was when I went into St Jamesapos. It was only then that I realised Iaposd been living with it all through  and years and years prior to it.Sandra now volunteers with HiVitality, a charity which provides retreats for people with the condition to spent time with others in the same position.There are people out there that need reaching and need help, this is something that they need, she said. Charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, which provides support for people with HIV, said that the delay in identying Sandraaposs condition shouldnapost have happened, and said she was not tested until it was nearly too late. It is campaigning for opt-out testing at AE departments - meaning blood taken from patients is tested for HIV unless they say no - a move Sandra said she agrees with. Liz Porter, clinical director at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: Sandra’s story is such a sad one and it absolutely shouldn’t have happened. Sandra was presenting with a lot of the indicators of undiagnosed HIV, including unexplained weight loss, coldsores and thrush, and yet no one thought to test her until it was almost too late. Sandra’s is an extreme and rare example of incredibly late diagnosis, but the latest data shows that % of people diagnosed with HIV are still being diagnosed late. Which means the diagnosis comes after damage to the immune system has already begun. This is worst in those aged  and over where a shocking % of people are diagnosed late. Too often both iniduals and health professionals don’t think of HIV affecting certain groups, for example a white woman in her s like Sandra. Ms Porter said that routine testing in Sandraaposs area could have made. a big dference and avoided the health problems she is now experiencing. She stated: Routine testing across healthcare is a clear way to avoid this happening to others, alongside educating professionals about HIV and what indicator conditions to look out for. If routine testing had been in place where Sandra lives, she would have been diagnosed years earlier with a simple test at her GP and avoided the health problems she is now experiencing. It would also have saved the NHS money and avoided Sandra’s weeks in hospital. You can live a long, healthy le with HIV thanks to treatment – but the earlier you’re diagnosed, the better.

The Christmas tree in London’s Trafalgar Square is one of London’s most iconic displays and has a long history attached to it. Every year since , a  metre tall tree gets shipped from Oslo to London as a sign of gratitude for Britainaposs support during World War II. Itaposs felled in Oslo in a ceremony attended by the Lord Mayor of Westminster, the British ambassador to Norway, and the Mayor of Oslo, then shipped to London by sea and decorated in Trafalgar Square in traditional Norwegian fashion. It is currently being decorated and is set to be lit on December . But this year, Londoners are underwhelmed with the tree, which appears to be a little scant on both branches and pine needles in its middle section.One passerby shared a photo of the tree to Twitter and the reactions soon started pouring in, with many left unimpressed.Does it get dressed with extra branches or is that it  asked one person, referring to the tree looking sparse. “Interflora clearly forgot to include the little sachet of plant feed,” one user quipped. The comment prompted Interflora’s official account to pipe up, commenting: “Our sachets are amazing, but not sure even theyaposd do the trick here...! Have we fallen out with Norway ! another person said, while a fourth person asked jokingly Did it get delivered by Hermes  Dear me, thataposs a bit flea bitten, complained another user.  Where’s the rest of it  It’s Gonna need a lot of tinsel to jazz that up! another person wrote. But others were quick to jump to the treeaposs defence. One Twitter user wrote: I was there  weeks ago for the tree felling ceremony, a very proud moment for me but also Norway. We must always remember why this happens, also you’d probably need to drop out a little on one sideyou weighed several tons and had a two week journey. It’s Christmas people. Another said I think that’s just how that age of tree is. Should look finethey garland the lights on it in a scalloping pattern, rather than the taut vertical lines they did last year which accentuated it’s slenderness. A very nice gt and a good tradition. The so-called “official” Trafalgar Tree account eventually chimed in, commenting: “Over  comments about ME”.“Is it fair to say I am possibly the most famous tree in the world! #HatersGonnaHate #ChristmasSpirit ,” they commented.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON World War Christmas trees\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The  movie features an all-star ensemble cast from Emma Thompson and Keira Knightley, to Colin Firth and Hugh Grant - not forgetting the late, great Alan Rickman. For those unfamiliar with the plot, it follows  dferent stories, delving into ying aspects of love as each of the relationships are somewhat interlinked. But it’s not just the actors that dazzle on set - in fact, London looks simply stunning lit up for the holidays as the film takes place in ious locations around the city. Right now, you’d feature around half-way through the film, as it’s set five weeks before Christmas, played out in a countdown to December . That means it’s the perfect time to hit the Big Smoke and visit some of the stunning set locations where the festive favourite was filmed. Soyou want to pretend you’re a fly on the wall at Juliet’s house while Mark declares his love with cards, or recreate the scene where Sam runs after Joanna in the airport, here are some of the locations you could visit. Heathrow Airport  Hugh Grant’s iconic voiceover opens the movie at Heathrow Airport - which is where the film ends, too. Playing the Prime Minister, he says: “Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world, I think about the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport. General opinion’s starting to make out that we live in a world of hatred and greed, but I don’t see that. It seems to me that love is everywhere... “When the planes hit the Twin Towers, as far as I know, none of the phone calls from the people on board were messages of hate or revenge – they were all messages of love. If you look for it, I’ve got a sneaky feeling you’ll find that love actually is all around.” It sets the fuzzy, warm tone of the holiday movie, as hidden cameras in Heathrow’s Terminal  captured real-le emotional reunions in the arrivals hall, with the people featured then asked for permission to use the clips. Selfridges  On busy Oxford Street, it was at the department store Selfridges where Alan Rickman, as Harry, purchased a necklace for a woman who wasn’t his we, Karen . He buys the gt for a colleague named Mia, with a shopping assistantwho makes the gt wrapping process a painstaking one for Harry. Somerset House  The central court of Somerset House, in The Strand, is where the skating rink in the opening montage was filmed. Formerly a parking lot, the court is now home to  fountains in summer, and the ice rink in winter, which is open to the public.If you fancy pretending you’re an extra in the scene, you canbook ticketsto the rink from £ per person.Notting Hill  Notting Hill features in Love Actually not once, but twice. First it’s home to the recording studio where Billyrecords his cheesy Christmas song at Westway Studios. But we see the popular neighbourhood again, at St Luke’s Mews where Mark professes his love to Juliet in that iconic cards scene. The unmistakable cobbled streets and coloured properties make for a beautul filming location, made all the more stunning by the festive lights. Queen’s Walk  If you’re a London regular, you’ve probably taken it walk along the south bank of the River Thames numerous times. It’s on these benches where Liam Neeson’s character, Daniel, has an emotional heart-to-heart with his son, where he discovers he’s not just distracted, he’s in love, actually. To be even more precise, the bench is on Gabriel’s Wharf, in front of the Riviera Restaurant.

For the latest must-have travel news follow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. St Paul’s Church St Paul’s Church, in Clapham, is one of the venues you might need a packet of tissues for. Filmed at this th century church, in South London, Love Actually saw Daniel bury his we in a tear-jerking scene. It’s also the church - which is Grade II* listed - where Peter marries Juliet to ‘All You Need is Love’. Where  can you visit Love Actually filming locations  Whether you’re a fan of the film or not, Trafalgar Square is well worth a visit to see the huge Christmas tree - a traditional gt from Norway. And while the scenes set at  Downing Street were filmed at Shepperton Studios, you could always take a trip to see the landmark which was ‘home’ to Hugh Grant. Other notable filming locations in the festive film include Grosvenor Chapel, Millennium Bridge, Marble Arch and the OXO Tower, as well as Elliott School in Pullman Gardens where the Christmas concert was filmed.

After realising that the deal so far had cost them £, a minute, Spoty has reportedly been left mystied as to why the couple have not produced any content, according to The Sun.  The music and podcast service is said to have contacted their pairaposs Archewell Audio brand to ensure they protect the future of the multimillion-pound contract. One source told the newspaper: “Spoty were delighted when they signed the couple, but the lack of content has mystied them. Particularly as they seem to have no problem producing content for other s.” After hiring veteran podcast producer, Rebecca Sanaes, the couple are believed to be releasing a whole set of new episodes in time for this Christmas.  Another source said: “When Harry and Meghan signed the Spoty deal in December, they didn’t really have a full audio team behind them, there were no scripts ready and they hadn’t made podcasts before. The holiday special episode was whacked together but, even though it was well received by fans, it was hard for them to pull off.” Harry and Meghan began looking for commercial deals after they were cut off by the Princeaposs family following their decision to break away from all Royal duties. The pair now live in a £million mansion in Montecito, Calornia.Angela Levin, Prince Harry ’s biographer, said: “Harry and Meghan want to do too many things at the same time.” Legal experts say Harry and Meghan will need to meet any deadlines stipulated in their contract to secure the funds. Alex Cook, Partner at Helix Law, a specialist litigation firm of solicitors, added: It might be considered embarrassing for Harry, Megan and Spoty equally to air any dispute publicly and it wouldn’t be surprisingthere are private commercial arbitration clauses to manage any disputes between them all.

The picture was uploaded to facebook after a resident in Cardf, Wales, spotted the electric BMW while on a walk, reports WalesOnline.A cable can be seen stretching from the home over the front garden of the property, connecting to the charging point of the car. It has sparked a big debate online about the practicality of electric vehicles - and the loss of pedestrianised spaces. The dad who uploaded the photo said a big re-think is needed. He captioned the post: Genuinely staggered to come across this on a walk with the baby. Since the s we’ve given so much space over to petrol cars.  We can’t allow the small pockets left for people to be given over to electric cars. But things didnapost end there, with more people chipping in with their views on the subject. One responded: This just wonapost do. Itaposs obstructing the footway with a vehicle – its mode of propulsion does not change that. That was echoed by another user, who said: You donapost get to block the pavement with your private property, go and charge it somewhere . Other agreed saying the car owner was being selfish. If you want to connect to the house give up your garden donapost ask me to give up the footpath, said a third before adding: I would be tempted to walk over that.  But not everyone saw eye-to-eye on the debate. One person posted: How about you finding an issue where there isn’t one  Plenty of room to get past, they’re just trying to create the safest situation they can. Would you prefer a long cable draped across to the road  Because that’s their other choice here. Find something real to get annoyed about.

The video is a part of a project for The People’s Vaccine Alliance as part of a World Health Organisation and UNAIDS event. Harry said: There are striking parallels between Covid- and another deadly pandemic. One that emerged  years ago - HIV. The video also features clips of Prince Harry’s mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, meeting Aids patients.  The Duke of Sussex added: This is a story about how corporate greed and political failure have prolonged both pandemics and what we can do to stop it. By ending vaccine monopolies and sharing technology, companies in the developing world can start producing Covid vaccines too...Break the monopolies...deliver a Peopleaposs Vaccine. Alongside the video, Prince Harry also wrote a letter to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Ms Byanyima. In it he wrote how “deeply grateful” his mother, who was known for helping to break stigma around HIV and Aids, would have been for their achievements. The letter was read out by the WHOaposs director of global HIV, hepatitis and STIs programmes Dr Meg Doherty at the event. Harry wrote: On this World Aids Day we recognise the  years that have shaped le for many.  We honour those whose lives have been cut short and reaffirm our commitment to a scientic community that has worked tirelessly against this disease. My mother would be deeply grateful for everything you stand for and have accomplished. We all share that gratitude, so thank you. In sharp comparison he called the rollout of the Covid vaccine globally a “spectacular failure”. The Prince called vaccinating the world a test of “our moral character” and said the world was failing.  He said: Similar to the Aids crisis, weaposve yet again revealed over the past year that the value of le depends on whether you were born and or live in a rich nation, or a developing country. Now more than ever, the voiceless majority of the world needs to be heard and the onus is on our leaders to end this pandemic.” He warned that repeating failures that surrounded and worsened the Aids epidemic would be a “betrayal of the next generation”. He called on world leaders to learn lessons from the past “where millions died unnecessarily” due to unequal access to treatment.

The Buckingham Palace workman was visiting to dismantle a desk when an unexpected person offered him a brew. Speaking on Channel  documentary Secrets of the Royal Palaces, Royal Upholsterer Kevin Andrews, who worked for the late Queen Mother, explained what happened. He said: “A builder was dismantling a desk so he could not see who was making the offer when the ladyaposs voice asked himhe would like a cup of tea.”  Without realising it was the Queen herself who answered, he is said to have replied: “Yeah. In a mug. Two sugars. Builderaposs tea. “I donapost want any of that nonsense I had the last time I was here, all that fine china and all that saucer stuff.” Without saying anything, the Queen dropped off his cup of tea on the table, and by the time he went to pick it up the builder could only look on as he saw her walking away. The Queen is likely to have found the encounter funny, as she is known for her humour and good nature when she meets oblivious people. Like the time a hapless group of tourists once bumped into the Queen walking around her Balmoral estate - but didnapost recognise her. The monarch was out for a low-key walk in tweeds and a headscarf, something she likes to do when she gets the chance.  One of her former protection officers has revealed the -year-old likes to slip under the radar when possible. Richard Grfin claims that once a group of American tourists failed to recognise her.Speaking to The Times, Richard said the Queen didnapost want to blow her cover at the time.She went along with the tourists as they questioned whether she lived in the area, replying that she had a house nearby. When they asked hersheaposd ever met the Queen, all she said was No, but this policeman has, gesturing towards Mr Grfin. Richard - who worked closely with the monarch for more than  years - said the group then moved on, having no idea who theyaposd just met.

Nusr-Et landed on Londonaposs streets in September and shocked guests with their extravagant prices, including an £ golden steak and £ gold burger.One furious guest was not too happy with his visit, saying that the staff treated them like babies, My London reports.Taking to TripAdvisor, the visitor started off by saying: The food is very average. We had a Nusret special, kafes, baklava, onion flower, giant tomahawk, four cocktails, water and kunefe. For two people we spent just shy over £,. An eye watering amount for what would be a £ meal. I would describe the level of cooking as basic.  Waiters were friendly but also a bit of a gimmick they were making annoying sounds when they were cutting our baklava. We felt we were treated like babies. He ended his review with: I guess this place is more for the elite that are on a completely dferent social hierarchy. Another angry visitor on TripAdvisor said after his meal: Food is absolutely average, at exceptional prices. Very disappointing canapost say I could be tempted backit was free. However, lots of guests have left generally positive reviews online. One person said: Food was fantastic, the nusret Stilton Burger was cooked to perfection. The staff was welcoming and friendly and looked after us. The overall experience at this restaurant was fantastic.  Another * review said: At the present time it’s the best meat restaurant in London. Excellent presentation, flavourful, succulent, delicious meat, attentive and quick to take care service. The steaks at Salt Baeaposs steakhouse cost £ - and their signature giant tomahawk steak, thataposs coated in gold leaf, racks up an incredible £, bill. Despite the heavy price tag, the London outpost has been quite the celeb magnet over the past few months.Famous faces such as David Beckham, Wayne Rooney and Gemma Collins have all splashed cash on the ludicrously expensive steaks.However, some critics have condemned the restaurantaposs tacky interiors and many guests are outraged at how expensive the menu is.

Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust bosses have since personally apologised to the patient after the conditions were revealed. “The linen hadn’t even been changed from the previous patient, it was all still there,” the patient said. “They had to hurriedly sort it all. I asked the nurse ‘are you going to wipe it down ’ And she said ‘yeah, I’ll do that’. She did but she said ‘oh, we didn’t realise the sink was blocked in here, I’ll flag it as urgent’.  “I had to sweep my bedroom myself because the floor was so filthy with bits on it. I asked for a dustpan and brush, got a load of disinfectant wipes. I got on my hands and knees and wiped the floor down. I don’t want to touch anything because it’s revolting. “ But after  hours the sink still had not been cleaned, meaning she went to used the communal bathroom to wash instead, only to find yet more squalor. When I went to have a wash in the bathroom, because I couldn’t in my room with the sink being blocked, I couldn’t even put my soap and towel down because I didn’t want them to touch anything,” she continued. “The bathroom was so filthy. There’s only three toilets - one of them is blocked and the other two have no toilet paper in them. “You’re limited to what you can do, really. “The basic human rights of going to the toilet, for example - I’m having to go round looking for hand towels to use as tissue because I need to use the toilet. It shouldn’t be like that.”  The kitchen was not much better, she added, as the bins were overflowing. “I thought, ‘I’ll go and get a cup of tea’, I went to put my teabag in the bin and the bins were overflowing onto the floor,” she said. “A staff member told me to ‘just throw it in’, I told them ‘this is disgusting, just shocking that people are being left like this’.” The patient, from Urmston, Greater Manchester, began fearing that her mental health would regress because of the conditions. “It’s ironic but it’s actually not good for my mental health to be here - you can’t go to the toilet, you can’t have a shower, you can’t have a wash to feel clean,” she explained. “It’s absolutely harming my recovery.  “I think they get away with it because they think no one is going to listen to the mentally ill. They can give us conditions that are not worthy of criminals and we just have to accept them, there’s little we can do about it.” After the M.E.N. approached the trust with the pictures, the patient says cleaning staff attended the ward to mop her room and unblock the sink on Wednesday, November . A spokesperson for Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust indicated that staff are unsure how the conditions deteriorated - and an investigation has been launched to find out. Andrew Maloney, Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust deputy chief executive, told the paper the pictures shown of the ward fall way below the standards of the environment that we would expect anyone to experience. He added: “The immediate action that has been taken to recty that issue provides us with assurances that it has been taken seriously and appropriately. “This is largely an isolated incident but one that we do need to learn from in the context of our CQC standards.  “We had already committed to just under £m of investment in the Moorside service, and those works have started now on site, with a complete refurbishment of all the bedroom areas. “Nonetheless, no matter what the environment is, it’s really important that we maintain high standards of cleanliness. “It’s everybody’s responsibility to make sure those environments are maintained to that high level.” One trust boss attended the ward to personally apologise on behalf of the mental health service. Now, trust chiefs say they will be carrying out quality spot checks and a quality of care programme where we scrutinise certain metrics across in patient and community services teams. In the week after arriving to scenes of squalor, the patient said “every day teams of people are turning up with clipboards doing audits, inspections, asking the patientsthere were any problems, the bathrooms smell of bleach”. She added: “I’ll give them credit they are really making the effort! If [we] hadn’t told the story, who knows  I had the head of the trust come to see me and personally apologise, she was respectful and really lovely.” The pictures of the ward follow an unannounced inspection in September by the Care Quality Commissiondue to on-going concerns about the safety of services and “the safety of people using the services”. Though the trust holds onto its ‘good’ rating, red flags were raised over staffing levels after the inspection of eight wards on five of the trust’s seven sites Brian Cranna, the CQCaposs head of hospital inspection said: “There wasn’t always enough nursing and support staff on duty, although where the trust identied signicant staff shortages, they’d put contingency plans in place. It was worrying that permanent staff didn’t always feel safe when bank and agency staff were used as they didn’t always have the relevant training to give supportan incident occurred.” On the CQC report, Ms Green has said: The inspection team found several positive aspects of care including how well staff managed risks and followed best practice, how they protected patients from abuse and knew how to report it, and ease of access to clinical information.We accept there are areas for improvement such as levels of qualied staff on wards, which many NHS trusts are struggling with, however we have strong contingency plans in place to ensure we remain safely staffed.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Care Quality CommissionHospitalsHuman rightsMental healthPublic servicesTea\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Calornia man Jay Beiler was walking along Glider Port beach in San Diego on November  when he came across the creature, which he initially thought was a jellyfish. But on closer inspection, he realised it was a rare type of fish.Speaking to NBC San Diego, Mr Beiler said the creature was the “stuff of nightmares”.“Mouth almost looked bloody!” he added. The creature has since been identied as a footballfish, a type of anglerfish, a bony fish known for their characteristic mode of predation.  The anglerfish lures in its prey, other fish, with a modied dorsal ray attached to its head, which uses bioluminescent light to attract potential food. According to the Calornia Academy of Sciences, the species lives in the Pacic Ocean at depths of , to , feet. At this depth they are not exposed to sunlight, hence the need for other means to draw in prey. It is not known exactly how this specimen of fish made its way from the depths of the ocean, to the beach.  Mr Beiler documented his unusual find by snapping a few images of the creature, which he called “fearsome”.Social media users were both intrigued and put off by the fish, which one Facebook user called “mean-looking”.“And this is exactly why I stay away from the ocean,” another man wrote. One person suggested the fish’s appearance was a “bad omen”, possibly suggesting a climate event or other kind of natural disaster was incoming. Another person commenting on Mr Beiler’s find on Facebook simply called it “scary looking”. Ben Frable, from Scripps Research, told NBC  the fish could have come to the surface due to underwater topography. The find was a rare one, he said, and offered scientists “valuable” information on the species, given how scarce sightings were.

The urban explorer posted a video about his findings on his YouTube channel, BeardedReality, where he showcased the ious rooms that were still packed with clutter, the Daily Mail reports.

Daniel said: “I started seeing lots of items left around so a wave of excitement took hold as I went inside. “I could tell it was going to be interesting to look at this place. “The atmosphere was calm at first, however at times it became quite eerie – we would hear random noises throughout the house that put us a little on edge.”  The explorer guessed the property had been abandoned for only a couple of years, although they found old-fashioned televisions and dated furnishings throughout the home. And among the creepiest items left behind at the property was an array of bizarre children’s toys that looked as though they had come straight from a horror film. One wooden doll could be seen laying in a cot and had bright blue eyes that were much cleaner than the rest of her face.  While another doll made of porcelain was found in one of the upstairs bedrooms and had been persevered in its box. Daniel also found antique items including stacks of china crockery and ornaments and an entire shelf filled with bottles of wine. In his video, he exclaimed: “Thereaposs got to be thousands of pounds worth of stuff here.” What’s more, the explorer found a vintage Melotte hand-cranked cream separator, which was used in the dairy industry in the th century.  Daniel explored the property with his friend Steve, and the pair were “blown away” by everything they saw. He said: “The main area that caught my surprise was in the basement where the majority of the collectables were squirrelled away and other random antiques. “To the right people and collectors some of these inidual items could be worth hundreds. “We were left wondering why such a place had become like this – we were blown away by everything we saw.” Have you got a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

To say I hate it is perhaps a bit harsh, but I do have a very strong dislike to it and here’s why. Firstly, I really cannot be bothered. The time and effort that goes into having an Elf come to stay is time and effort that I really don’t have at this time of year. Parent admin is never-ending as it is, and there is so much more during December – I barely keep up with what my kids need throughout the month.I definitely don’t need to add a Twinkletoeson top.  I once thought about jumping on the elf bandwagon, until my daughter was at a friendaposs house and one freaked her out. You see, many young children have vivid imaginations and I have spent many hours reassuring both my children that their teddy hasn’t moved all by itself. or that ghosts and monsters are not real. I am not then going to welcome an Elf into the house – who quite frankly is creepy as… - and undo all my hard work. Then there is the worry that the Elf is going to wake me in the dead of night and remind me that I haven’t moved it, as so many parents report. Sleep is precious, the kids now sleep through - Iaposm not allowing an Elf to ruin it!  It isn’t just a case of moving little Elfie about the house though - the pressure is on parents now to get creative. Kids want to be surprised by Twinkletoes’ shenanigans. Undecorating the tree, ‘pooping’ in the Cheerios, or using toilet paper as a parachute to swing from the chandelier, after leaving flour footprints and chaos in its wake. It’s a naughty elf and, isn’t that just a little hypocritical  I mean, sending an elf to watch the kids and report back to Santa, while being less than well behaved itself  For me, the whole concept is unnecessary. As a kid, the threat was just that Santa was watching. How he was watching never occurred to me, but I always knew that he would be there.You see, telling your kids that Santa won’t come is an empty threat, which I think most parents - including myself - have said several times throughout December. But which parent is actually going to follow that one through and leave their kid with no presents on Christmas Day I am very up for people doing Christmas their own way, and soyou love Elf on the Shelf, that’s fine - but you sure as hell wonapost find one in my house.Do you do Elf on the Shelf for your kids  Have your say in the comments belowRead MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Father ChristmasMichael BubleElf on the ShelfChristmas decorations\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Something about the idea made us fall in love with it.Whataposs more, there have been loads of people using the opportunity to raise money for charities that meant something to them. Liz works at Grace House, a charity providing short breaks for disabled children, and I was talking to the Registered Manager one day about their need for a wheelchair-accessible swing.What do you think of Adam and Lizaposs gesture  Let us know in the comments below Emily loves the swings in the park so much, it made me feel sad that not everyone has the opportunity to have a go on them. After a bit of googling we saw these swings cost around £,. I put two and two together, and Liz and I decided that we should go for it and try to raffle off our home, enabling us to move, letting someone win an amazing prize in time for Christmas, and also raising funds for Grace House. The charity aims to enrich the lives of disabled children, young people, and their families in the local area by offering short breaks for disabled children, counselling, family activities, youth groups, and much more. Itaposs very close to our hearts.  Our beautul house in South Tyneside has three bedrooms, two storeys and a garden. Itaposs close to a big park and only eight minutes drive from the nearest beach. And you wonapost have to pay any property transport fees as thataposll all be done for you. If we sell all , raffle tickets, one lucky winner will be waking up on Christmas Day with the deeds to our house. And Grace House will be getting a £, donation for that special swing. I asked Liz for her input into this piece and she laughed: Itaposs a crazy idea to put your home up for raffle instead of just selling it the conventional way but Adam convinced me it would be a good idea. It was very important to us that we did something special with the extra money we could raise. Working in Grace House I see where the money goes and having that extra cash means we can do more for the kids and young people we have.  A wheelchair-accessible swing has been on our wish list for a while but because itaposs so expensive itaposs never been achievable but this time we could really try and get it for the kids. So what would you doyou won our house for £  Live mortgage- and rent-free  Rent it out for extra income  Sell it - or maybe be inspired by us and give it to charity  Thereaposs only one way to find out, isnapost there... To take part in Adam and Lizaposs raffle, go to Raffall for the TCs.

While many dogs may rush through their walks in sheer excitement, Buster the sausage dog prefers to take his time, making sure he really squeezes the maximum amount of enjoyment out of his daily exercise. Perfectly happy to go at his own pace, Buster lets his more energetic siblings lead the way, trotting along at the back by himself. The amusing video is a testament to the patience of the pup’s entire family, with the rest of the dogs as well as Buster’s owner having to wait for the cautious canine. In the clip, viewers are first shown two of Buster’s siblings on their walk, both going at the same pace. But then the camera pans back around  yards to show us Buster, who is trotting along at a much slower pace and showing no signs of getting any faster. The stylish dachshund, complete with silver harness, refuses to quicken his pace for anyone, enjoying himself far too much as he takes in everything around him. His sister Bella clearly doesn’t have much time to wait for Buster though, as another clip on the account shows her running back to nudge her brother, telling him to hurry up.The video, which was uploaded by TikTok user @motherofsausages, showed off just how unbothered Buster is by his speed, more than happy to go at his own pace.The clip was a huge hit on the video sharing , with over . million views and over , likes. Viewers were clearly enamoured with Buster, with one user commenting: “Let him be! He’s respecting the speed limit.” Another commenter wrote: “My favourite slow walker ever. I love watching him chill and take his time.” A third added: “Please, I have to know, have you EVER seen him run in his letime.” The TeamDogs Christmas Gt Guide, sponsored by Keep Wales Tidy, is packed with more than  treats, toys, gadgets and garments to make every dog’s tail wag with holly jolly joy on December .

But whatthe hoodie you pick up doesn’t actually belong to your partner and you instead accidentally start wearing a stranger’s clothes  That’s what happened to comedian Fern Brady, who says she spent a whole week wearing a hoodie that she thought belonged to her boyfriend - but was actually her builder’s. Posting on Twitter under the username @FernBrady, Fern detailed how she “realised with horror” that she’d been walking around her house in her builder’s hoodie while the builder had been working on her home.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. She wrote: “Iaposve been wearing my boyfriendaposs hoodie around the house for the last week. I tried to give it back last night. He said ‘Thataposs not my hoodie.’ Realised with horror Iaposve been wearing our builderaposs hoodie. In front of the builder.” Fern, , said she’d even fallen asleep in the cosy jumper and had greeted the builder when she woke up – still wearing his clothes. She added: “I had a little sleep in it at one point. Came out my room. Said good morning to the builder. Wearing his clothes.”  The woman was so embarrassed by her blunder she couldn’t bring herself to face the builder, so just threw the hoodie into the room he was working in – but he moved it back into the living room. She wrote: “After realising my mistake after a week, I threw his hoodie into the room heaposs been working in. He put it in our living room. What does it mean  Am I going out with the builder now  Heaposs pretty old.” Fern’s tweets received hundreds of replies, and many people were inspired to share their own embarrassing stories. One person wrote: “My husband was away with work. Came home late one night and left very early next morning having rearranged kids bath foam letters to say, ‘fancy a shag’. “Not sure who was most mortied - me or the bathroom fitters that had been working there all week.” While another said: “I remember being  and leaving my jumper at my friends. I then saw her dad wearing it and could never ask for it back.” And a third revealed: “After years of filching my elder sonaposs assorted sports tops, we realised recently that one that I thought was his, isnapost. Nor is it mine. Whose is it and how do I come to have it  Nobody knows.” Have you got a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

And she’s already pledged her service to her country. In a statement released by the Imperial Household Agency to mark her birthday, she said: “I would like to refine myself and move forward step by step so that I can grow into an adult who can be of service to others.”  But who exactly is Princess Aiko and what will her future hold  We take a look… Only child Princess Aiko, also known as Princess Toshi, is the only child of Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako.She was born at Tokyoaposs Imperial Palace in  and her parents broke with tradition by choosing her name rather than leaving it to her grandfather, former Emperor Akihito.Aiko is her personal name, while her imperial title Toshi means a person who respects others. School struggles Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.When she was just eight years old, Aiko refused to go to school because she said she was the victim of bullying.She was eventually persuaded toto the classroom but onlyher mother could go too. It was some time before she felt confident to go to school on her own. Aiko’s parents tried to make her school days more bearable by regularly inviting her classmates to the palace. An investigation revealed that she had suffered “violent things” from boys in another class. The school, however, explained away the incident, claiming that two boys accidentally collided with her, “which scared her”. Health problems  In October , there were more worries about the princess when she missed nearly two months from school due to an unspecied illness. Palace officials confirmed the teenager had been complaining of stomach problems and dizziness, which they attributed to studying for exams as well as practising for an athletics event. She later attended Gakushuin Girls’ Senior High School, where the princess was able to spend three months studying at Eton in Britain, staying in a boarding house. Aiko then started accompanying her parents on royal duties after her father ascended to the Chrysanthemum Throne in . She is currently enrolled at Gakushuin University, where she has been attending online classes due to the Covid pandemic.According to the Japan Times, she studies Japanese literature, English and Spanish as well as Japanese history and traditional art.In September, she moved from the Akasaka Imperial Residence to the Imperial Palace with her parents taking her dog Yuri and cats Mii and Seven with her. Entering royal le  Now she has turned , Aiko will be formally welcomed into public le in a ceremony set to take place on Sunday. While dressed in formal attire, she will visit sanctuaries where the Imperial Familyaposs ancestors are buried and offer prayers to the gods, as well as be greeted by her parents and grandparents. Part of her formal attire will be a tiara, however itaposs been reported that the one she will wear for the ceremony will be a second-hand one - and not made especially for her. The tiara she will wear was first made for her aunt Princess Sayako but it is thought that the piece is being adjusted so it fits her perfectly on her big day. Itaposs said that there was some surprise in Japan, when it was announced that no new tiara was being made for the occasion. Future le  Once her official coming-of-age ceremony is out of the way, it is believed Aikoaposs first public appearance will be on New Yearaposs Day, when members of Japanaposs Imperial Family meet with well-wishers at Tokyoaposs Imperial Palace. She will also continue her university studies and in March will appear at a traditional coming-of-age news conference. However, depending on how Aikoaposs adult le pans out, her time in Japanaposs Imperial Family could be short.Thataposs becausea female member of the Imperial Family marries a commoner, she will lose her royal status and even her title.Earlier this year, her cousin Princess Mako was forced to relinquish her title when she married her commoner long-term love Kei Komuro.Before Makoaposs wedding, there were emotional scenes when she was forced to say goodbye to her parents and younger sister Kako at the entrance to their home.Though all wore masks in line with Japanaposs coronavirus protocol, her mother could be seen blinking rapidly, asto fight off tears.Mako bowed formally to her parents but her sister grabbed her shoulders and the two shared a long embrace. Chrysanthemum Throne  Of course, Aiko may choose not to marry - but despite being the only child of the Emperor, she will not ascend to the throne because women are not allowed to rule over Japan. In Japan there are just three heirs to the throne, Emperor Naruhito’s younger brother Crown Prince Akishino, , his son Prince Hisahito, , and the emperor’s uncle Prince Hitachi, . Experts have warned the royal line could completely vanishthe Imperial House Law is not revised. In , an expert  called for a revision to the law to allow the imperial couple’s first born, regardless of gender, to ascend the throne. But this was halted with the birth of Prince Hisahito in  - the was the first male member of the Imperial Family born in nearly  years. There are also fears that banning women from marrying outside the nobility, effectively forcing them to leave the Royal Familythey chose to wed, means the busy schedule of official duties is falling onto fewer and fewer people. Relaxing the rules is popular in Japan, with  per cent of people said to be supportive of allowing women to become emperors, not least because it would keep the monarchy relevant in an ever-changing world. But Japan’s former prime minister Shinzo Abe was reportedly against allowing women to rule, believing that because the throne has consistently been passed down through the male line, it should continue the same way.

Here’s everything you need to knowAn area above the North Pole is causing spacecrafts to slow down as they pass through it Image: GettyByMalvika Padin:,  Dec | commentsOne area in the Earth’s atmosphere is proving that space is not as unorm as many believe.This area which is around  miles above the North Pole has a funnel-shaped gap which opens up in the Earth’s magnetic field every day at noon local time, when the Sun is at its highest point Mostly, the magnetic field prevents any particles of the Sun reaching the planet, but the gap creates a space where solar winds interact with the planet’s atmosphere causing issues for satellites and spacecrafts. Besides interfering with radio and GPS signals in the region, NASA scientists have also noticed that spacecrafts passing through the region- known as a polar cusp- seem to slow down.NASA are trying to find the reason behind these strange occurrences.  What is NASA’s CREX- mission to study the speed bump above the North Pole  NASA will be launching the Cusp Region Experiment-mission on Wednesday, December . The aim is to find out more about this area above the North Pole, by firing a sounding rocket into the sky from Norway. Scientists already known that spacecrafts passing through the polar cusp slow down because the air there is denser than at any other point in the Earth’s orbit, but there has yet to be explanation of why or how this happens. Talking about the mission, Mark Conder, CREX- principal investigator and physicist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, said: At around  miles above Earth, spacecraft feel more drag, sort of like theyaposve hit a speed bump. The CREX- mission was meant to happen in , but was postponed because of unsuitable weather conditions then, after which the Covid pandemic caused more delays.Now that the Sun is more active and Covid restrictions have loosened, NASA is hoping to get their study of the polar cusp underway. What is a polar cusp  Usually the density of the atmosphere drops with altitude, but remains consistent horizontally. But things are dferent in the polar cusp, where the air is about one-and-a-half times denser than the surrounding air at the same altitude.  The CREX- mission is set to investigate this additional mass and find out what is supporting it. The rocket will launch into the sky, ejecting  soda can-sized canisters which will release vapour tracers that produce colourful, glowing clouds. Scientists are planning to monitor how air moves through these clouds in the hopes of understanding what’s happening around the polar cusp. Professor Conde said: You can’t just increase the mass in a region by a factor of . and do nothing , or the sky will fall.

Surfer Rolando Montes can be seen making a panicked bid to paddle back to the safety of the beach while his pal also tries to get away on top of his board. Stunned onlooker Jorge Benitez filmed the encounter and watched as his friends fled.  This is the first shark I see, Benitez said.

Shark attacks in waters off Puerto Rico are rare, with the most recent incident a decade ago. Over the past nine years nearly  people have been mauled across the globe. The current hotspot is the US, where  shark bites were reported this year, compared to  in Australia. This year  shark attacks - six being fatal - have been reported across the globe. As scary as sharks may seem, the odds of dying in their jaws is very low compared to dozens of other causes. According to the World Health Organisation, ischaemic heart disease is the biggest killer and claimed . million lives in  - compared to  shark deaths that year. That means youaposre , times more likely to die due to narrowed heart arteries than in a set of ferocious aquatic gnashers. Regardless, shark attacks remain more interesting than chronic diseases in most peopleaposs eyes. Recently a huge great white shark attacked a film crewaposs boat after they tried attaching a camera to one of the predatoraposs fins. The Discovery Channel camera crew were on location off Stewart Island in New Zealand when the shark burst out of the water and tried to sink its razor teeth into their dinghy. Before the attack the film crew tried to latch a camera to a fin in the hopes of seeing the apex predatoraposs feeding ground. Within moments the shark darted at the vessel and rushed up out of the water and bit down on a rope attaching them to a larger vessel. The narrator can be heard warning of the dangersthe crew are separated from the main ship.

The model, from Egypt, says she is full of confidence after she was bullied for her condition as a childReham Soliman, , was diagnosed with vitiligo when she was  Image: mediadrum@rehamsolimaByAlahna KindredNews Reporter:,  Dec | commentsA woman with a skin condition has been called Meghan Markle with vitiligo after becoming a model.Reham Soliman, , was diagnosed with vitiligo when she was  and it has since spread to more than  per cent of her body.Growing up, she was bullied for her skin condition and grew to resent it, until six years ago when she decided to stop caring what people thought. Reham, from Cairo, Egypt, was then approached by a modelling agency in  that wanted to feature her in a skincare brand.Now she gets told she looks likeMeghan Markle with vitiligo. She said: Growing up as my vitiligo started spreading, children called me cow and clown. I noticed twice that people did not want to shake my hand as they believed vitiligo is contagious. There were situations in university where people did not want to sit beside me. They would purposefully change the direction they were going in, I have been stared at in the streets all my le.  People come up to me to ask me whataposs wrong with my face, whether I am a burn victim orI do not know how to apply makeup. My friends, however, have often commented that I look like Meghan Markle with vitiligo. That is why I was so surprised when a skincare brand approached me for a modelling opportunity.  It was an unbelievable experience and I have seen how it has encouraged so many other people to accept their dferences. Reham did say that modelling isnapost always enjoyable and not always a great experience. She said: A while ago I was approached by a modelling agency that wanted to feature me as a erse model. However, when I went to their studio they had me in for a completely dferent photoshoot in a dferent category called TODAA.  They were classying people with unique characteristics and just using the veil of ersity for publicity. I asked them not to use my pictures and I was very disappointed by the agency as a whole after that incident. I have vitiligo but I am still a human being, I do not like being pigeonholed and categorised and locked in a corner. Overall, Reham believes her being so confident in her skin has encouraged others to accept their flaws. She said: I get a lot of positive feedback from people all over the world for my pictures that I did not accept. And not just from the vitiligo community but from anyone that does not fit into societyaposs standards of beauty. People with weight or health problems approach me to say that seeing me makes them feel alright with being dferent. People can be dferent and still live their lives and be happy.

which swung in either direction in horrendous conditions.The sides exchanged goals in the first half, with Stuart MacLean reacting quickest in the box after the Baljaffray keeper couldn’t hold a Fraser Talbot shot and the striker scored to net his eleventh goal in eight games.Baljaffray forced a succession of corners near the end of the half and were on level terms when Red Star were only able to partially clear a corner which fell to the away side’s full back and his shot via the aid of a deflection went past young Leon Murphy in the Star goal. -Into the second half and Star could have retaken the lead when Aaron Moore latched onto a drilled cross from strike partner Stuart MacLean, however, his effort was blocked by an excellent save from the Baljaffray number one.The visitors took the lead after  minutes when a cross caused confusion in the Star defence and the Baljaffray forward had the simple task of finishing into an empty net from close range.Star huffed and puffed for an equaliser, however, they were frustrated by excellent goalkeeping until the goal came in fortuitous circumstances after a long ball was nodded past his own keeper by the Baljaffray centre back meaning the sides were level with  minutes to go.Star took the lead with five minutes remaining when Aaron Moore was able to burst clear of the Baljaffray backline and finish well into the far corner to make it -.This should have been enough to see Star over the line but Baljaffray scrambled a late equaliser when Star again failed to clear a free kick and the ball was bundled over the line to see the match end -.Lochgilphead Red Star are on their travels on Saturday November  when they face their toughest test of the season so far as they take on league leaders and title favourites

November .Star stung the hosts at Cowan Park, Barrhead, with an excellent start to the match, forcing a succession of corners before the ever-dangerous Coll McCallum finished after an excellent delivery by Craig Aitken.The visitors doubled their lead after  minutes when Craig Aitken broke clear down the left and finished with an excellent effort into the goalkeeper’s far corner to put Star - ahead.Star were under pressure for much of the remainder of the half but always carried a threat on the break, with Stuart MacLean’s pace causing the home side no end of problems.Into the second half, Arthurlie forced their way back into the match and pulled a goal back after a rare defensive lapse by Star on  minutes. Star failed to clear the danger from a cross and the unfortunate Coll McCallum erted into his own net past Leon Murphy.The Arthurlie equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when winger Sean Ross cut inside before unleashing a spectacular effort into the top corner.The hosts would have been expected to go on and win the game from here but the Star defence remained well-organised and resolute and a fine goalkeeping performance from Leon Murphy ensured the Lochgilphead side ed home with a well-earned point.Star put their unbeaten league record on the line on Saturday November  when they welcome fellow Argyll side Cardross to the Joint Campus G.

However, their decision not to so far highlights the failure of the Scottish Government to secure proper guarantees from bus firms that infor the tens of millions of pounds that was given to the sector during the pandemic, they should not be cutting services and we need to look again at how that support works."},{"url":null,"title":"jedburgh-pupils-waving-sanitary-products-like-flags-meeting-hears","story":"BORDERS pupils using gender-neutral toilets have been ldquowaving sanitary products about like flags and urinating in sanitary bins, according to an elected official.As well as the reports of the incidents at Jedburgh Grammar School, Galashiels councillor Harry Scott says he has heard stories of girls at Kelso High School going an entire day without a toilet visit after refusing to use the unisex loos.But a Scottish Borders Councilspokesperson says that both schools have ldquono knowledge of these incidents taking place.A motion was put forward by Mr Scott at a full council meeting last week demanding the council to consult with pupils and teachers over plans to install gender-neutral toilets at the new Galashiels Academy and Peebles High buildings.:Storm Arwen: lsquoFurther strong winds expectedrsquo over next  hours, says councilAt Thursdayrsquos meeting, the independent representative said: ldquoYoung girls going through certain changes in their le are entitled to extra privacy as far as toilet facilities are concerned.ldquoThey should not have to share with teenage boys or men.On the alleged issues at the schools in Jedburgh and Kelso, Mr Scott added: ldquoThese young people need to feel safe and comfortable in their surroundings, and to be able to use the facilities on offer without embarrassment or anxiety, whether caused intentionally or otherwise.ldquoWhile Irsquom fully in agreement about providing support for minority groups, that support should be provided without the detriment to others.ldquoWhy is it not possible to have male, female and gender-neutral toilets which would cater for the needs of everyone Mr Scott called for a full consultation on the matter and for the council to publish the results.:Gamekeeper recklessly killed  protected birds on Borders estate, court hearsHe also advised discussions with the parents of primary school children due to attend the new campuses in the coming years..removeSeconding Mr Scottrsquos motion, independent Selkirkshire councillor Caroline Cochrane backed his calls for a consultation.ldquoIf wersquore saying that they [the pupils] are mature enough to share toilet facilities then they are mature enough to decide what they find acceptable and are comfortable with, she said.There has been much debate on the pros and cons of gender-neutral toilets.Those in favour of the unisex facilities say that they can help reduce bullying, as well as being more inclusive to the trans community and to disabled people with carers of the opposite sex.However, those against the loos say that they threaten the safety of women."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-borders-recorded-50-cases-last-day","story":"THE Borders has recorded  new cases of coronavirus in a -hour period, latest figures show.An update was published by the Scottish Government at pm today .And the new data shows that the Borders has now seen , coronavirus cases since the start of the pandemic.:Michael Bubleacute adds Borders date to highly awaited summer  tourThere are  people in hospital in the Borders with recently confirmed cases of COVID-, according to the updated figures.Scotland has now recorded , cases since March last year."},{"url":null,"title":"bench-memory-selkirk-singer-unveiled-home-town","story":"DOZENS of people turned out to the unveiling of a commemorative bench in memory ofFrightened Rabbit frontman, Scott Hutchison in the grounds of Haining House on Saturday, November .The former stately home which was given over to the public to be used as an arts centre was chosen as the perfect location for the beautully crafted oak bench which has the words ldquoWhile Im alive, Irsquoll make tiny changes to the earth emblazoned across the front.These words were taken from the lyrics of Scotts song lsquoHead Rolls OffrsquoScott took his own le in May  after suffering from depression and a charity in his name was launched to raise awareness about children and young peoplersquos mental health issues.The bench was made by three trainee female carpenters, and was crowdfunded by fans with money left over from another bench that was situated in Kelvingrove Park in .Ade Cartwright, the organizer of the bench fundraiser, said in a statement: ldquoThis bench is for all those out there who have been touched by Scottrsquos lyrics and music, his humour and humanity.

And we need vaccines to get into the arms of all of those who are at risk in every single country, not just in some countries, and not adding more vaccines to people who are already protected, but getting that first and second dose to those iniduals who are at risk in all countries.ldquoAnd this is really important that this is crystal clear today because there is still a lot of uncertainty around Omicron, and this data will come in and there are scientists around the world that are studying this.ldquoBut therersquos no indication to suggest that the vaccines wonrsquot work. Eventhere is a reduction in efficacy, itrsquos still better to have the vaccine because it will save your le, she said at a press briefing.Meanwhile, the global health experts said there is a lack of evidence to support offering Covid- booster jabs to an entire population.The remarks from the WHO come after the UK Government set the challenge for the NHS to offer boosters to all adults in just  days.The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationadvised on Monday that the booster programme should be extended to include all adults amid concerns about the Omicron iant ndash making  million more people eligible for a booster shot.But doubt has been cast on the benefits of offering these booster jabs to healthy iniduals.Dr Mike Ryan, executive director of WHOrsquos health emergencies programme, said he is not aware of any evidence that would suggest offering booster jabs to the entire population gives any greater protection to healthy people.Asked about the acceleration of the UKrsquos booster programme, he told the press briefing: ldquoThe primary objective, I think of all governments, now must be, in the face of Delta and Omicron and others, is to ensure that all vulnerable iniduals, people of older age, people with underlying conditions, are immediately offered the vaccine to ensure that everyone has had at least a primary course of vaccine.vw,vw,px,

boosting the entire population is going to necessarily provide any greater protection for otherwise healthy iniduals against hospitalisation or death.ldquoThe real risk of severe disease, hospitalisation, and death lies in particularly at risk and vulnerable iniduals who do require protection against all iants of Covid-.He said having excess amounts of vaccine and deciding what to do with it is not a problem being faced by many countries around the world who are struggling to get even one jab to their most vulnerable.Dr Soumya Swaminathan, WHOrsquos chief scientist, said the focus should be on people who have not yet received a first jab, rather than on giving booster jabs.Speaking at the press conference, she said: ldquoI just want to reiterate what was just said, that our goal should be really to protect those who have not yet received their primary cause of vaccination.ldquoAnd this is true in all countries.She added: ldquoSome countries are doing, as a precautionary principle, providing additional doses to people because they have adequate supplies, and theyrsquore just doing it.ldquoThere isnrsquot a whole lot of evidence that everybody over the age of , or for that matter above any age, is going to benefit from this.ldquoSo what we really need is the data to come in from many countries using dferent vaccines, dferent demographics, dferent populations, and coverage, and also dferent iants at dferent times during the year to have a comprehensive view on when boosters are going to be needed, which subgroups of people theyrsquore going to be most useful

detail what they currently know about the situation in Scotland.The new Omicron iant, which was first discovered in South Africa, has led to countries around the world tightening restrictions amid concerns it could be more transmissible than the Delta iant.UK prime minister Boris Johnson announced tighter measures on mask wearing and travel over the weekend for England, reintroducing mandatory face coveringsin shops and on public transport.Meanwhile, in Scotland, face coverings have been compulsory in these settings throughout the majority of the pandemic as highlighted yesterday by the first minister on the Andrew Marr Show.As the Omicron iant continues to dominate headlines, heres what we learned from Nicola Sturgeons Covid update today...Some of the  cases currently detected have no link to travel to or from South Africa, which suggests there could be some level to community transmission.The Scottish government is asking people to signicantly increase compliance with the current rules in place: wearing face coverings, taking regular lateral flow tests, getting vaccinated and maintaining high levels of hygiene.According to the WHO, there is currently no evidence to suggest that illness caused by the Omicron iant is more severe.However, the first minister said this remained under reviewAlthough the first minister couldnt provide a detailed updated on the figures in Scotland, which will be published later today, she confirmed that the current situation in Scotland was stable.Nicola Sturgeon has written a joint letter with Welsh leader Mark Drakeford to the UK government urging a four nations policy to introduce an -day self-isolation period for people arriving from overseas.The first minister said:\"We are proposing a tougher four-nations approach to travel restrictions at this stage that would see people arriving in the UK from overseas asked to self-isolate for eight days. In our proposal, they would take a PCR test on day eight of their arrival, as well as on day .\"Currently  countries are on the red list andanyone arriving in Scotland from anywhere outside the common travel area, will be asked to take a PCR Covid test on the second day of their arrival, and self-isolate until they get the result of that test back.Further actions regarding rules and regulations to curb the spread of Covid will be considered in the coming days as we learn more about the Omicron iantThe first minister said that she remained hopeful that as we learn more about this Covid iant, concern surrounding it will reduce rather than increase."},{"url":null,"title":"storm-arwen-county-clear-up-effort-underway","story":"Households across the county were left without power following the storm this weekend have had their supplies restored, though severalproperties in rural areas such as Athelstaneford and Bolton are still without.Scottish Power are continuing to work to reconnect customers as soon as possible.A Salvation Army mobile unit will be in Bolton after am, where residents can pop along to collect water and hot drinks.Flasks can also be filled up with water to be delivered to neighbours or vulnerable people.The van also has power points to re-charge mobile and handheld devices.All pupils at Athelstaneford Primary School will be undertaking remote learning today as a result of the power issues.Meanwhile, signicant damage has been caused to trees in and around communities, rural and coastal areas.East Lothian Council amenity teams have began a clear-up, but \"given the large number of fallen trees on public land and highways, it will take quite some time to clear\".A spokesperson added: \"We are grateful to people, including local people who may have fallen trees on their land, for their patience and understanding.\"The teams have also been checking for any debris or building damage.\"There have been some reports of fallen chimney pots and slates, particularly on Dunbar High Street.\"Temporary barriers remain in place on Dunbar High Street to allow for inspections of properties that may have sustained damage in the strong winds.The East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership has been supporting the most vulnerable people in our communities to check they are safe and well and providing assistance where needed.Residents are encouraged to check in on neighbours, friends and family who may be vulnerable or require some help.For more information, contact East Lothian Council contact centre on   or for out of office hours  ."},{"url":null,"title":"zans-wildlife-diary-redwing-winter-visitor","story":"If you step outside on a calm autumn evening after the local birds have gone quiet, you may hear thin, plaintive whistles from overhead, which mark the arrival of redwings.Redwings are highly sociable ndash it is not uncommon to see them in flocks of hundreds as they roam throughout the country.Their main diet is berries and they seem to display a preference for some types over others it is believed that this is based on the softness and sweetness of the berries.In mild winters you are likely to see large flocks of redwings feasting on their favourites of hawthorns and rowans however, in harsh months they may forage for fruit in gardens or urban areas.Once disturbed, the birds will take off and seek refuge in neighbouring trees or hedges. Alongside eating berries, they also feed on small insects and mealworms.Unlike other members of the thrush family which build nests in the trees, redwings prefer to build their cup-shaped nests on the ground.The nest is usually well hidden in the dense vegetation and made out of grass, mosses and twigs.Most redwings breed in Scandinavia and Iceland, with a small number breeding in the UK, most of which are concentrated in the Scottish Highlands. The population arriving here from Iceland appears slightly darker and bigger and it is treated as the distinct subspecies coburni.Unlike many migratory birds, which remain loyal to their wintering grounds, redwings present a nomadic lestyle ndash driven by food availability, they rarelyto the same place.I have already seen my first redwings in Edinburgh but I am yet to find them in East Lothian this autumn.Last winter in Musselburgh was fabulous! I particularly remember the snowfall in January during a couple of days I took off work. I liked every minute and, despite cold hands and feet, I enjoyed walking along the Esk.At one point, I spotted a buzzard perching on a snowy branchand headed towards it.As soon as I captured the bird of prey, I heard a familiar lsquotseeprsquo call coming from the hedges.I knew the redwings must have been having a lavish meal as the call was getting louder with every step I took, but I could not see them.It amazes me how dficult it is to spot these birds, even though they are medium-sized and always in large groups.I managed to sneak inside the bush and, when I looked up, I saw at least  redwings. The birds were incredibly noisy and constantly on the move. The whole bush was bustling and I felt like I was sitting at the heart of a busy factory!Until now, I found that experience one of the most challenging. It was not easy to operate the camera in such a tight space, with twigs scratching my face the entire time. I did not have a clear view of the birds either, but I could not move as it would spook them!The low winter sun was already disappearing but, eventually, I did manage to find a gap and push the camera through. After taking a few photographs, I decided to head back home.When I ed to the same spot the following day, the redwings were gone.If you have enjoyed my pictures this year and would like to see more, I now have several designs of my WildleCalendars for sale.

But the three aforementioned experts want us to rip all that out in preference for their as-yet only alternative, the totally impractical AHS pumps. No thank you: back to the drawing board for that idea, as the last few days has proved where.And by the way, the diesel four by four SUV kept us mobile during that week and able to render assistance to others less fortunate than ourselves.Neil Arthur, Kilpatrick, Isle of Arran.FOSSIL FUELS ARE LIFE-SAVERSPEOPLE should be prepared for power cuts. Torches, preferably the LED type, should be kept ready along with a stock of long-le batteries. Camping gas lanterns provide illumination for hours. Spare butane propane cylinders should be available, and spare mantles. Cooking can be done on small camping gas stoves. A propane cylinder connected to a gas heater gives a lot of warmth, with a CO detector as a precaution. In case the water supply fails, a few sealed five-litre plastic bottles of spring water will fill the gap.It is interesting to note that all these useful items depend on fossil fuels ndash plastics from oil, gas, steel which requires coking coal, and diesel machines to mine zinc and manganese . We depend on the products of oil, gas and coal in so many ways. Keeping fossil fuels in the ground is definitely not a good idea.William Loneskie, Lauder.* DAYS and days of no power. Tall trees left growing too close to power lines is the laziness of idiots.Clear them now, no excuses its not rocket science but good old-fashioned common sense.And future-proof the Grid.Tom Begg, Lochwinnoch.WE NEED ANSWERS TO GRID CONCERNSIT is worth noting that Hunterston Reactor  has in the last few days moved to its final defuelling phase and \"will notto power generation\" according to the French owners EDF Status website today, so another MW of stabilising synchronous generation has now been lost to Scotland. The remaining Reactor  is due to stop generating in January, which will leave west Scotland with worryingly low network strengthdue to our increasing reliance on renewables even though the HVDC interconnector from Wales terminates in the locality. This will affect the electrical protection response when there is network fault.In addition, National Grid in  published its concerns that HVDC links will in many circumstances not be able to transfer power when feeding low-strength areas of the network. This identied that when nearby network faults occur there will be many scenarios where the HVDC AC converters will become unstable and our AC voltage will start to surge and oscillate at a dferent frequency to the Hzthat we receive in our homes, which will necessitate shutdown, meaning Scotland could not import.I, along with many, would like to hear from Scottish Power, EDF, which owns Hunterston, and SSEN that they have fully responded to National Grids  request for input to \"further explore the risk to converter instability\" and that we can be confident such problems have been solved.DB Watson, Cumbernauld.KEEPING IN TOUCH IN POWER CUTSOUR thoughts are with communities who have experienced the effects of Storm Arwen and our focus has been on getting everyone reconnected as quickly as possible.Wersquove been upgrading the nationrsquos home phones to Digital Voice and more than one million customers are benefiting already from the high-definition calling it brings.

I have not received so much as an acknowledgement that this is an issue that will need to be addressed.For the avoidance of doubt I, like Mr Mackay, certainly donrsquot \"believe in independence for the fundamentalist sake of independence but neither do I have any faith in the future of the UK under either the Conservative Party or an increasingly ldquocentrist Labour Party.I have no choice but to cross my fingers and hope ldquosomething will turn up, although I find it impossible to be anything like as optimistic as Wilkins Micawber.John Milne, Uddingston.SCOTLAND ON THE WORLD STAGEMAY I point out to R Russell Smiththat what Keith Brown actually said was: \"We need independence to invest in our bountul renewable resources which are the envy of Europe. The future of the planet depends on it ndash and its too important to be left to the Tories\".Im surprised that Mr Smith believes that there are many people on the planet who have never heard of Scotland, given all the inventors, scientists, engineers, doctors and explorers Scotland has produced not to mention the Burns Suppers held annually around the world.

However, whilst the statement may be correct, the conclusions are not, since the cuts are based on relative numbers of train users between pre-Covid figures and those in the current survey.In fact,working from home becomes the new normal for a majority of Scots, then further cuts may be required next spring to match the services to that of customer demand.

It will take time to change that situation and involve action at a local and national government level.\"The short term lettings market both brings people to the islands, and removes properties from the local market.\"This results in a lack of affordable housing and long term rentals. Isle showed me that there is both an appetite to support the Scottish islands - because people feel a real affinity with them - and that there is a huge power in working together as island communities. \"As a social enterprise, all profits after running the business must by law be reinvested into the communities they serve. For the purposes of Isle Develop CIC, that community is the Scottish islands.Isle Develop CIC have supported fisherman Callum Williams, Kirsty Bennet and their sons after they opened aseafood shop on Tiree this summer\"IsleHoliday is an attempt to harness that to make sure that more of the money generated by our housing stock stays in the islands. Airbnb dont need that commission, but our island communities could make excellent use of it,\" said Ms Meek.\"Our goal is to use it to generate revenue which can be used to the benefit of our communities - particularly in relation to affordable housing and long term rental options for residents.\"Ministers have been seeking to tackle the growth of rentals on s like Airbnb and popular tourist areas by giving local councils powers to set up licensing schemes and charge fees to cover their costs.New laws tabled by the Scottish Government mean that properties used for short-term lets will need licences by .Ministers want to increase regulation of short-term rental properties in response to concerns raised by some communities about spiralling rents and claims of disruption.IsleHoliday will list holiday lets from across the Scottish islands, allowing visitors to book and make payments, but thatrsquos where the similarity with other s ends.Ms Meek added: ldquoWhen you book your holiday house through isleHoliday, % of the profit will go back into our island communities.\"We know our Bernerays from our Burras! By working together with accommodation providers and local organisations we can offer rich information about island le before visitors arrive from driving on single track roads to public facilities, events and great local businesses to visit during their stay.ldquoVisitors will have a better experiencewe correctly set their expectations. Our islands are not empty wildernesses waiting to be discovered. They are full of heritage and history, present and we hope, future. Those are gems well worth discovering.ldquoWe want to put faces to places and start to change the narrative from destination first, to community first.The group are accepting property listings from any Scottish island, and there are already receiving Tiree - where the company is working in partnership with the local development trust - to Bernera in Lewis, and even Unst.\"She said that the dream would be to have the capital to enter into co-ownership of properties - either existing or new.But the plan at the momen is that all Isle Develop CIC surplus will go towards providing small grants to micro businesses to purchase pieces of equipment which will help them become more sustainable year round.It will also help directly fund housing surveys, projects and campaigns relating to long term affordable island accommodation.Ms Meek said they have already funded two small businesses to purchase crucial pieces of equipment."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13252233.jpg?type=article-full","title":"backlash-edinburgh-based-tsb-shuts-quarter-network-branches","story":"TSB is shutting a further  branches ndash a quarter of its network ndash in a move described by campaigners as ldquoyet another hammer blow to the UK high street.Some  jobs are set to go with the Edinburgh-based bank saying the latest closures are in response to declining branch use and more customers using digital services.The Scottish branches closing are: Coldside, Dundee , Ellon , Forfar , Forres , Fort William , Kirkintilloch , Lanark , Stranraer , ThursoIt comes a year after it announced it was shutting  bank branches and a cut of around  jobs despite appeals to save branches in remote and most deprived areas of Scotland.Fourteen months ago TSB had  branches, but these latest cuts ndash following a wave of previous closures in  and this year ndash mean that by the end of June  this number will have more than halved to .Kirkintilloch TSBDr Jackie Mulligan, the founder of ShopLocalOnline.org and one of the government-commissioned High Streets Task Force experts, said: ldquoThis news is yet another hammer blow to the UK high street, which is already reeling after nearly two years of pain.Dr Mulligan added: ldquoThe sht online is irreversible, but so, too, is the damage that a bank leaving a high street can cause for the shops that surround it.

The forecasting ides the road network into inidual routes rather than geographic areas making it easier for decision makers to direct resources where they are needed most.#Each island is designated as a route, while the Mainland is ided into eight routes. Up until this year, the decision on how, and when, to treat the road network in the winter months has relied upon the information received from two weather stations at the Mill of Rango in Sandwick and at Kirkwall Airport, basically covering the East and West, while this has been helpful, it was a very broad brush.“The system is being closely monitored by officers throughout the winter season with view to summarise its performance at the conclusion of the trial next year. This will determinewe want to adopt this technology on a permanent basis.”Stressing that road safety remains the top priority, she said:“I want to reassure our communities thatwe are treating areas of the West Mainland, but not parts of the East for example, we are doing this because we are confident – based on the data – that the roads in the East do not require it.”There are km of priority one roads in Orkney, km of priority two routes and km of priority three roads.In line with nationally recommended guidance, the council’s Winter Service Policy - points out that the network will be treated in the morning when road surface temperatures are predicted to be below C, and in the afternoon when they are predicted to be below C.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are still hoping for the best and hoping that our developing understanding of this iant will reduce rather than increase our concern.“I very much hope that additional protections can be avoided and while we will act on a precautionary basis, we will always seek to act out at all times in a proportionate manner.”Research is still being undertaken on the Omicron iant — which was first discovered in southern Africa — but early indications are that it might be more transmissible than the dominant Deltra strain.However, she did say that there was no evidence that the symptoms of Omicron was dferent from Delta and the disease caused is any dferent.Scientists are also working to establish what impact this new iant will have on the effectiveness of vaccines.New recommendations are set to come from the joint committee on vaccination and immunisationis set to be announced this afternoon, and this will guide the Scottish Government on the shape of the booster programme.Ms Sturgeon said that evencurrent vaccines were less effective against the new iant, that was not the same as no effectiveness, and urged more people to come forward and become double vaccinated.She also urged travel restrictions to be tightened and called on a four nations approach in order to prevent the importation of the virus from abroad.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As the trust’s chairman Dan Wise explained, it is essentially an underwater drone.He said: “This small unit will allow us to continue our collaborative research into the Orkney skate population. More specically, we will be able to get eyes underwater to look for essential fish habitat such as egg case laying grounds, nursery areas etc.“We can cover more ground with this drone when compared to ing, and the quality of the camera is greater when compared to a drop down camera – both survey styles we still do but this is another tool in the tool box.”RSPB Scotland is also going to invest in new machinery, with its £, award going to the purchase of a specialist tractor for removing vegetation.A tractor equipped with Soucy tracks will be used to cut and collect material for removal from the sites, without leaving rutted tracks or creating erosion points. This machine has signicantly less ground pressure than a normal tractor, reducing the chances of damaging sensitive habitats, and is specically designed to operate in softer ground conditions.The benefits to birdle include opening up foraging habitat, allowing flightless chicks to move around more easily, and reducing the chance of chicks becoming saturated in dense, wet vegetation.RSPB Scotland site manager in Orkney, Alan Leitch, said:“The funding means we can purchase machinery that offers us a real opportunity to upscale our annual land management efforts on the Orkney nature reserves to increase conservation benefits. These operations will help a suite of species including curlews, lapwings, and hen harriers.”The £m fund was launched in July this year and has now been extended to a total of at least £m over the next five years. On the fund in general, the Bioersity Minister, Lorna Slater, said:“Too much of Scotland’s natural environment is degraded after years of over-exploitation, but this government is committed to restoring nature and our wildle. The Nature Restoration Fund will play a big role in delivering these aspirations, and the projects we are funding today are just the beginning.#The fund kick starts a new approach, supporting longer-term, larger, landscape-scale projects across Scotland # on land and at sea # that address the twin crises of bioersity loss and climate change. Over this parliament we will invest at least £ million through the fund, delivering real change that people and nature will benefit from across the whole country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Although folk must still enter via the south nave side door, once inside the cathedral, everyone will be able to enjoy the new glazed timber vestibule.Meredith Macbeth, St Magnus Cathedral#s historical buildings conservator, said: “We are absolutely delighted with the work so far and the new vestibule truly enhances the entryway of this wonderful building. The works are not entirely complete as the curved glass has been delayed by the supplier in Europe due to COVID, Brexit and other supply issues, but we are expecting it early . So for now the area will remain roped off from the public, but it is a delight to see the new vestibule settling in and the excited response by those who know the building so well.”Councillor Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC#s education, leisure and housing committee, said: “The cathedral really is the gt that keeps on giving to the people of Orkney and further afield.#What a beautul addition to what is a very special building. I look forward to seeing the complete, finished product which is sure to be absolutely stunning.”Elaine Grieve from the Society of the Friends of St Magnus Cathedral, who are making a substantial contribution to the costs of the work, said: “The Cathedral is so precious that it is hard to contemplate making any changes for fear they won’t do the building justice.#However, in this case, what an absolutely wonderful transformation the vestibule has made to the entrance of the building. The craftmanship is outstanding and we now have an addition which befits this treasured building loved by so many near and far.”The cathedral#s stonework also enjoyed a facelt recently.Conservation works included repointing stonework with lime mortar on the interior and exterior of the west door. Samples of original lime mortars were found deep in the constructions joints of the building and were analysed by the Scottish Lime Centre in Fe. An appropriate mix was specied, to match in manner of strength, colour and aggregate size.For anyone wishing to visit there are signs directly through the side gate, please be mindful of the restrictions in place in regards to the pandemic such as the wearing of masks and social distancing while inside.St Magnus Cathedral is managed by OIC on behalf of the people of Orkney.

And we need vaccines to get into the arms of all of those who are at risk in every single country, not just in some countries, and not adding more vaccines to people who are already protected, but getting that first and second dose to those iniduals who are at risk in all countries.ldquoAnd this is really important that this is crystal clear today because there is still a lot of uncertainty around Omicron, and this data will come in and there are scientists around the world that are studying this.ldquoBut therersquos no indication to suggest that the vaccines wonrsquot work. Eventhere is a reduction in efficacy, itrsquos still better to have the vaccine because it will save your le, she said at a press briefing.Meanwhile, the global health experts said there is a lack of evidence to support offering Covid- booster jabs to an entire population.The remarks from the WHO come after the UK Government set the challenge for the NHS to offer boosters to all adults in just  days.The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationadvised on Monday that the booster programme should be extended to include all adults amid concerns about the Omicron iant ndash making  million more people eligible for a booster shot.But doubt has been cast on the benefits of offering these booster jabs to healthy iniduals.Dr Mike Ryan, executive director of WHOrsquos health emergencies programme, said he is not aware of any evidence that would suggest offering booster jabs to the entire population gives any greater protection to healthy people.Asked about the acceleration of the UKrsquos booster programme, he told the press briefing: ldquoThe primary objective, I think of all governments, now must be, in the face of Delta and Omicron and others, is to ensure that all vulnerable iniduals, people of older age, people with underlying conditions, are immediately offered the vaccine to ensure that everyone has had at least a primary course of vaccine. vw,vw,px, px\"ldquoThere are others here who can better answer than me regarding the benefits of a booster regarding other iants, but right now there is no evidence that Irsquom aware of that would suggest that boosting the entire population is going to necessarily provide any greater protection for otherwise healthy iniduals against hospitalisation or death.ldquoThe real risk of severe disease, hospitalisation, and death lies in particularly at risk and vulnerable iniduals who do require protection against all iants of Covid-.He said having excess amounts of vaccine and deciding what to do with it is not a problem being faced by many countries around the world who are struggling to get even one jab to their most vulnerable.Dr Soumya Swaminathan, WHOrsquos chief scientist, said the focus should be on people who have not yet received a first jab, rather than on giving booster jabs.Speaking at the press conference, she said: ldquoI just want to reiterate what was just said, that our goal should be really to protect those who have not yet received their primary cause of vaccination.ldquoAnd this is true in all countries.She added: ldquoSome countries are doing, as a precautionary principle, providing additional doses to people because they have adequate supplies, and theyrsquore just doing it.ldquoThere isnrsquot a whole lot of evidence that everybody over the age of , or for that matter above any age, is going to benefit from this.ldquoSo what we really need is the data to come in from many countries using dferent vaccines, dferent demographics, dferent populations, and coverage, and also dferent iants at dferent times during the year to have a comprehensive view on when boosters are going to be needed, which subgroups of people theyrsquore going to be most useful and which vaccines should indeed be used.Boris Johnson said all adults will be offered a booster by the end of January.Experts have said the expansion of the vaccine booster programme poses a ldquohuge logistical challenge for the NHS.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CoGCGraduation_AlainaMaclennan_PrizeWinner-2-scaled.jpg","title":"skye graduate wins college","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe HND Sports Coaching graduate celebrated at the college’s ceremony held on Mondayin the city’s Royal Concert Hall. Alaina, who attended Plockton High School, and lives in Kyleakin, was surprised and delighted to win the prize, saying: #I am happy that my hard work during my time at college, and through the challenges of adapting to remote learning due to Covid-, have paid off.  “City of Glasgow College gave me the good foundation I needed to build and develop my future career in sports coaching.

However, the service and sacrice of all those who fought in the First World War continues to be remembered,” Sir Jeffrey said.“There is also a growing recognition that those who fought came from dferent backgrounds, but were in the trenches with a united goal. The war truly is part of our shared history and it is fitting that so many have travelled from Northern Ireland to mark the centenary of the tower.”Sir Jeffrey also paid tribute to the Somme Association for ensuring the Ulster Tower and Thiepval Wood are maintained to commemorate the past and keep those stories alive for future generations.

We thought there would be more, they said in a technical briefing today. Enhanced contract tracing is underway.The case involves recent travel to one of the southern African countries and was linked to a positive case last week.The suspected cases were identied by an S-gene dropout characteristic which it exhibits, but the dominant iant in Ireland, Delta, does not. This trait can be spotted by standard PCR tests.Cases of Omicron identied in Nigeria have also dated as far back as October, suggesting the iant may have been far more widespread than previously thought earlier in the year.The concern around the iant from within the scientic community stems from the number of mutations it exhibits on its spike protein, the part of the virus that binds to human cells and infects people.The spike protein of Omicron is sufficiently dferent to previous strains that scientists have cause for concern it may be more transmissible than previous strains of Covid- but may also evade the antibody response produced by the immune system and vaccines.There is still much work to be done on this iant to confirmit is more transmissible or whether it has vaccine-escaping properties, though, the scientic community has cautioned.Most of the reported cases of Omicron have been either mild or asymptomatic but a caveat to this is they are mostly among young people or people who are fully vaccinated, where cases would tend to be mild.There have been hospitalisations due to the iant in South Africa, Dr Angelique Coetzee confirmed in recent days.Any arrivals into the Republic of Ireland will now have to produce a PCR test  hours before travel or an antigen test  hours before travel in a bid to slow the spread of the iant in Ireland. This antigen test must be professionally conducted and cannot be a self-test purchased in a store.Most ReadSammy Wilson slammed for ‘distasteful ding dong’ tweet as DUP MPs vote against rules to combat Omicron in EnglandDeaths of Russell McAfee and Nigel McGraw leave Coleraine community stunned – they were ‘best mates who got on with everyone’Michelle O’Neill shares happy photos of daughter’s weddingJeffrey Epstein’s ‘Lolita Express’ jet made stops in Belfast, Dublin and ShannonThomas Garfield Gilmour: Only man convicted of sectarian killing of three Quinn brothers dies suddenlyTop VideosPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayVideo: Middle class madam Anglea Cosgrave - brothel queen behind one of Northern Ireland’s biggest prostitution ringsPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentLatest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageSammy Wilson slammed for ‘distasteful ding dong’ tweet as DUP MPs vote against rules to combat Omicron in EnglandCircuit-breaker schools shutdown urged as heads tell of cancelled classesUUP defends Beattie’s US visit amid ‘work from home’ guidanceFive Northern Ireland people fined for not wearing face maskLatestWest End theatre ‘very healthy’ despite pandemic, says Mamma Mia! creatorAlec Baldwin in tears during first interview since fatal set shooting‘Majority of MLAs in favour of united Ireland required to trigger border poll’Youngest Maxwell accuser tells court she flew with Andrew in private planeEU should consider making Covid- jabs mandatory, says von der Leyen,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Criticised RUC investigation. Family to consider findings. More detail later.— Pat Finucane CentreDecember , “There was a third injury to the top of the skull, perhaps caused by a fall or perhaps caused by a missile.”Mr McCrisken said the scene was likely to have been “fast paced, frenzied and chaotic”.He added: “At least two, and probably more than two, rubber batons were discharged striking at least two people.“I am not persuaded based upon the evidence that I have heard that Thomas Friel was struck with a rubber baton round. It is of course possible that he may have been, but I do not consider this as the most likely scenario based on the evidence which I have heard.”He said it did seem to have been considered by police that Mr Friel had been present and injured at an earlier altercation, describing a “glaring inconsistency in timings”, with a rubber bullet having been fired at .am, after an ambulance had been called for Mr Friel at .am.“No further investigative leads were suggested to resolve this issue, the RUC did not, it seems, have access to the military logs and sought no access,” he said, adding he relied on “crucial evidence” from four forensic pathologists.The coroner described a local background of “savage violence” as “essential to understand what happened”, and recalled a very dferent background to now, with  people losing their lives in  in the Troubles.“The passage of such a period of time is bound to have affected the recollections of those who witnessed and participated in the events of the tragic night of - May  … it is not possible to overestimate the dficulty in relying on sworn testimony and a search for the truth at a remove of  years from the event to which it relates,” he said.He described being left with the impression that former soldiers who gave evidence had poor recall but were “trying their best to help the inquest but genuinely and understandably found it dficult to remember these events”.One of Mr Friel’s surviving brothers was present as the findings were read by Mr McCrisken.The coroner recognised the “resolve and determination” of the Friel family, waiting almost  years for a fresh inquest into Mr Friel’s death, with his sister Margaret having died before the hearings started.“I hope that these findings provide some measure of closure. Justice of course can mean dferent things to dferent people, but in terms of these so-called legacy inquests, it should, in my opinion, mean answers,” he said.He added: “Thomas Friel was clearly a man much loved by his family … Liam Friel, his younger brother, told me at inquest that Thomas would have helped anyone. Clearly his loss was felt very deeply by the family and that remains the case, and the disputed circumstances of his death has only added to that grief.“Liam Friel told me at inquest that the family wanted justice for Thomas after all these years. Liam told me that he believes Thomas was struck by a rubber baton round and that this caused his death. My findings are therefore not what Liam was expecting.“I believe that justice in the context of an inquest administered fairly means answers to certain questions concerning the death of a person.“Each issue considered during this inquest was forensically examined in a degree of detail that was simply not possible  years ago.“Thousands of pages of evidence were considered and oral evidence taken from  witnesses with evidence read from many others, experts in ballistics, forensic pathology were examined for many hours and I consider that the family have been treated justly, fairly and reasonably.“They in turn have shown great patience and have themselves behaved in a fair and respectful manner. I urge them to consider these findings and trust that when they do they will consider that justice has indeed been done and answers have been provided explaining finally the circumstances around the death of Thomas Friel.”A lawyer for Mr Friel’s family, who long campaigned for a fresh inquest, said they are “shocked and disappointed” by the findings.Ruairi Muldoon told the BBC: “The family has always been convinced that he died as a result of a blow to the head by a rubber bullet fired at short range.”Most ReadSammy Wilson slammed for ‘distasteful ding dong’ tweet as DUP MPs vote against rules to combat Omicron in EnglandDeaths of Russell McAfee and Nigel McGraw leave Coleraine community stunned – they were ‘best mates who got on with everyone’Michelle O’Neill shares happy photos of daughter’s weddingJeffrey Epstein’s ‘Lolita Express’ jet made stops in Belfast, Dublin and ShannonThomas Garfield Gilmour: Only man convicted of sectarian killing of three Quinn brothers dies suddenlyTop VideosPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayVideo: Middle class madam Anglea Cosgrave - brothel queen behind one of Northern Ireland’s biggest prostitution ringsPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentLatest Northern IrelandTurner Prize winner announced after collectives dominate shortlistEnniskillen building site machinery set alight in ‘possible arson’, resulting in £k worth of damage‘Majority of MLAs in favour of united Ireland required to trigger border poll’Flags report: SDLP and Greens call for action plan, while DUP MLA criticises Sinn FeinCulture commission raises possibility of new civic flag for Northern IrelandLatestTurner Prize winner announced after collectives dominate shortlistRory McIlroy: Players want to know where they stand amid golf’s power struggleSpoof art prize won by entry inspired by coronavirus pandemicEnniskillen building site machinery set alight in ‘possible arson’, resulting in £k worth of damageLabour presses Government to make energy bills VAT-free during ‘tough winter’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Unable to even mark the Duke of Edinburgh’s passing in the same way as other countries.“Such cultural and identity weaponisation will make solutions very dficult to come by as some want cultural domination rather than respect.”He also backed the FICT report’s conclusion that paramilitary flags and murals should not be displayed.Mr Kelly said the five main political parties were involved in producing the report.He claimed the DUP was “unwilling to confront sectarianism” associated with flying flags at hospitals, schools, places of worship, interfaces and mixed housing developments.“And it has chosen to support those engaged in intimidation and anti-social behaviour at [contentious] bonfires which have no regard for the protection of people, property or the environment,” added Mr Kelly.“Progress in tackling sectarianism in this society will be made in spite of the DUP’s efforts to deny rights and equality.”Meanwhile, SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said it was a “disgrace” that an implementation plan has not been developed -  months after the Executive was first shown the FICT report.“This report has cost £, to produce and there’s no actual plan at all to bring forward any of the recommendations and here’s why - the Executive Office, the two principal parties, can’t agree - now there’s a surprise,” she stated.“They can’t agree on a way forward. We know this isn#t easy and that is why the commission was set up in the first place.“It was to deal with the contentious issues that surround flags and emblems in our communities, and after five long years, and after sitting on a report for  months, they are publishing it today without a plan to move forward.”Green Party NI leader Claire Bailey MLA said the FICT report “saga” is the latest example of the five-party Executive’s “failure” to govern.“I’m glad it has now finally been published, but disappointingly there’s no agreed plan to implement any of its recommendations,” she continued.“What’s the point in spending hundreds of thousands on a reportit’s not acted on “Whilst on the ground, grassroots leadership has made progress, the Executive parties have failed to provide meaningful political leadership on these issues.“Contentious issues around flags, bonfires and cultural expression in Northern Ireland will continue to provoke isive debate for as long as the Executive parties fail to agree on a way forward.“The FICT report provides the framework for developing future legislation and policy around these issues.”TUV leader Jim Allister described the report as a “complete waste of time” and a “colossal” waste of money.“That said, it is already clear that some within the media are intent on using the ideas which the report says were discussed but not agreed - such as the preposterous suggestion that the Irish tricolour would be given parity on buildings - as the basis to frame public debate,” he stated. “Therein lies the real danger of the report.“Discredited ideas, such as a shared day of reflection where innocent victims would supposedly be remembered alongside victim makers, have similarly been given a new lease of le not because they were agreed but because the report says they were discussed.“The report doesn’t event mention some of the issues which innocent victims find most offensive, such as the continued practice of paramilitary-style funerals.“For all the talk of the lack of an action or implementation plan the truth is there appears to be very little in this document around which there was agreement and hence little to implement.”Related topicsGreen PartySDLPSinn FéinSinead McLaughlinChristopher StalfordClare BaileyTraditional Unionist VoiceJim AllisterMost ReadSammy Wilson slammed for ‘distasteful ding dong’ tweet as DUP MPs vote against rules to combat Omicron in EnglandDeaths of Russell McAfee and Nigel McGraw leave Coleraine community stunned – they were ‘best mates who got on with everyone’Michelle O’Neill shares happy photos of daughter’s weddingJeffrey Epstein’s ‘Lolita Express’ jet made stops in Belfast, Dublin and ShannonThomas Garfield Gilmour: Only man convicted of sectarian killing of three Quinn brothers dies suddenlyLatest Northern Ireland‘Majority of MLAs in favour of united Ireland required to trigger border poll’Culture commission raises possibility of new civic flag for Northern IrelandEC vice president urges UK to reciprocate in Brexit protocol talksThe  NI people who made the latest edition of Who’s WhoWhat are the key points from the  recommendations included in the flags and culture reportLatestHealing power of music needed now more than ever – violinist Jenner PikeDog that killed -year-old boy was not an illegal breedTeenager charged over high school shooting that left four deadWhat are the Government’s plans for social care West End theatre ‘very healthy’ despite pandemic, says Mamma Mia! creator,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Keep our fingers crossed, we can still qualy for this World Cup!”Northern Ireland ladies have already qualied for their first-ever major tournament in the form of Euro .“To qualy for the Euros next summer is incredible,” Armstrong continued. “That’s a hell of an achievement, with  or  semi-professional amateur girls in the squad. That really is unheard of.“The girls deserve the credit. They have proven that they can compete with the best and they’ve made everybody proud. During Covid, it has lted everybody’s spirits and has done so much for the whole of Northern Ireland.”Furness made her debut in the green jersey in  and has gone on to win  caps for her nation.“It’s fantastic.

Speaking from Syria, David said his thorough research ensures that he always feels safe. There are countless checkpoints which might make it sound otherwise but these have been permanent fixtures since the civil war and are an effective way for the government to show control. It really takes to have travelled around the Middle East to understand this is just how it is, a way of le.”And just as Northern Ireland people became inured to the tragedy going on around them during the Troubles, Syrian people were much the same, David says.“We’ve had our own issues with conflicts at home in Northern Ireland but rarely do we bat an eyelid, and the people here have a similar mentality,” he added.How these people hold themselves, how they are so welcoming and the warmth they continue to show after going through one of the worst atrocities of our generation, it’s something that humbles me, a huge reason why I visit these places.”He adds: “The biggest security risk will be my trip around Idlib, an area still controlled by the rebels not far from Aleppo.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDavid Simpson in Cape Town, South Africa FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDavid Simpson in Cape Town, South AfricaAlso, a trip to Palmyra can only be confirmed at the last minute, depending on the activity in these areas and whether it is safe to do so.”The pandemic means that travel plans can be thrown into chaos at the last minute — as we saw when the emergence of the Omicron iant of coronavirus upended travel from South Africa.But seasoned traveller David has got a detailed itinerary planned. Next, he intends to take in West Africa, followed by some silverback gorilla trekking in Uganda and driving theof the Serengeti for the Great Migration.A more sedate pace awaits when he spends two weeks driving from Normandy to Belgium on a war history tour, while luxury is ahead on a trip to the Seychelles.David, who writes about his travels at www.djjsimpson and has an Instagram account, djjsimpson, takes the challenge of visiting some of the world’s most troubled territories in his stride after falling in love with travel as a student.“I went to university in Glasgow where my interest in seeing more of the world was ignited. I began travelling and being part of new cultures but it wasn’t until I was in New Zealand where I counted the countries I had already visited and was shocked by how many more there was to see,” he explained.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDavid at the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, Moscow FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDavid at the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, Moscow“This was the first time I had the idea of continuing my travelling to corners of the world I had never heard of let alone planned to visit. I do expect this next year to be a bit more challenging but nothing I won’t be able to overcome, as I have already been in some situations that, for many, could be off-putting.”Ordeals like a five-hour interrogation from police in Algeria, being subjected to a strip-search before boarding a flight to Israel and being held at gunpoint in Austin, Texas, haven’t put him off.“These negative accounts all become positive learning experiences in the end and are far outweighed by the many great adventures I get to see.“Some of the most controversial places I have visited have been the most eye-opening and friendliest, for example, my last trip before the pandemic was to Sudan, a country many believe to be entirely unsafe but the people there turned out to be some of the friendliest I’ve met to date.“Quite often it is these places that surprise you the most. Countries that pose a security risk just require more research and planning. You may pay a little extra for the privilege but it’s all worth it.”David has taken all precautions for his upcoming travel expeditions including completing testing, investigating testing stations abroad and ensuring his Covid- vaccination and visa requirements are up to date.Despite ensuring all his documents are in order, he still anticipates challenges.“It’s inevitable when you are trying to visit the far corners of the earth that you will come into dficulty. That’s why, for me, it’s important to have a plan b, but who can plan for something like coronavirus “I recently visited the Caribbean and it actually proved to be a logistical nightmare with arranging PCR tests and arrival forms, not the way the Caribbean should be enjoyed. It’s safe to sayI thought the challenge of visiting every country was dficult before Covid then now it’s an entirely new level.”David believes he is in a demographic of no more than  people who have visited every country in the world and is, so far, the first Northern Ireland person to take on the challenge.And the very detail of deciding how many countries there are to visit is part of the process. “The community of which I am a part of focuses on several lists of countries,” he says.One is the UN list of  as well as the others such as FIFA, The Olympics and also disputed territories. When I eventually complete this goal I didn#t want to be in any doubt that I hadn#t visited somewhere which should have been included so hence my list being slightly longer and more thorough.“I also didn#t want to just choose the shortest list of  for the sake of completing this as soon as possible.”Most ReadSammy Wilson slammed for ‘distasteful ding dong’ tweet as DUP MPs vote against rules to combat Omicron in EnglandDeaths of Russell McAfee and Nigel McGraw leave Coleraine community stunned – they were ‘best mates who got on with everyone’Michelle O’Neill shares happy photos of daughter’s weddingJeffrey Epstein’s ‘Lolita Express’ jet made stops in Belfast, Dublin and ShannonThomas Garfield Gilmour: Only man convicted of sectarian killing of three Quinn brothers dies suddenlyTop VideosPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayVideo: Middle class madam Anglea Cosgrave - brothel queen behind one of Northern Ireland’s biggest prostitution ringsPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentLatest Northern IrelandTurner Prize winner announced after collectives dominate shortlistEnniskillen building site machinery set alight in ‘possible arson’, resulting in £k worth of damage‘Majority of MLAs in favour of united Ireland required to trigger border poll’Flags report: SDLP and Greens call for action plan, while DUP MLA criticises Sinn FeinCulture commission raises possibility of new civic flag for Northern IrelandLatestTurner Prize winner announced after collectives dominate shortlistRory McIlroy: Players want to know where they stand amid golf’s power struggleSpoof art prize won by entry inspired by coronavirus pandemicEnniskillen building site machinery set alight in ‘possible arson’, resulting in £k worth of damageLabour presses Government to make energy bills VAT-free during ‘tough winter’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It opened earlier this week and seeks to gain insights from stakeholders and the wider public on the best way to shape and develop the rail network across Ireland. Mr Durkan has encouraged local people and businesses to have their say by responding to the consultation. He said: “This public consultation is an exciting opportunity for everyone to have their say on the future of rail provision across Ireland. “This island once had a thriving railway network and since coming into office SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has committed to exploring an expanded railway network, which has the potential to be transformative for communities across our island. “The benefits of an overhaul of our current railway network are clear, it would allow us to address the regional imbalances that exist across the island, making our communities better connected and making rail a real option for people who regularly travel for work, to visit friends and family and to socialise. “It would also bring a boost for our economy, with poor public transport links regularly cited as a reason for the lack of investment outside our population centres. “More public transport options would also take more cars off our roads, which is a key part of plans to tackle the climate crisis and protect our environment. “I welcome SDLP Minister Mallon’s work on progressing this project so far and hope this public consultation marks the next step in making the revolution of our island’s rail network a reality. “I know this an issue many people in Derry feel very passionate about and would urge them not to miss this unique opportunity to give their view. “While other political parties are busy politicking, the SDLP is focused on delivering for people. After almost  years of Sinn Feacutein-DUP joint Government, the public deserve delivery. We’re up for the job.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTop BBC volunteer award for County Derry man overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Roads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland a council meeting has heardDerry NewsRoads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsEastwood: We have ten days to save the climate overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Mayor has invited Santa and his Elf and Safety helpers to Derry for a quick visit before Christmas Derry NewsDerry Christmas market to bring food, fun and festive cheer this December overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

It opened earlier this week and seeks to gain insights from stakeholders and the wider public on the best way to shape and develop the rail network across Ireland. Mr Durkan has encouraged local people and businesses to have their say by responding to the consultation. He said: “This public consultation is an exciting opportunity for everyone to have their say on the future of rail provision across Ireland. “This island once had a thriving railway network and since coming into office SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has committed to exploring an expanded railway network, which has the potential to be transformative for communities across our island. “The benefits of an overhaul of our current railway network are clear, it would allow us to address the regional imbalances that exist across the island, making our communities better connected and making rail a real option for people who regularly travel for work, to visit friends and family and to socialise. “It would also bring a boost for our economy, with poor public transport links regularly cited as a reason for the lack of investment outside our population centres. “More public transport options would also take more cars off our roads, which is a key part of plans to tackle the climate crisis and protect our environment. “I welcome SDLP Minister Mallon’s work on progressing this project so far and hope this public consultation marks the next step in making the revolution of our island’s rail network a reality. “I know this an issue many people in Derry feel very passionate about and would urge them not to miss this unique opportunity to give their view. “While other political parties are busy politicking, the SDLP is focused on delivering for people. After almost  years of Sinn Feacutein-DUP joint Government, the public deserve delivery. We’re up for the job.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTop BBC volunteer award for County Derry man overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Roads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland a council meeting has heardDerry NewsRoads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsEastwood: We have ten days to save the climate overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Mayor has invited Santa and his Elf and Safety helpers to Derry for a quick visit before Christmas Derry NewsDerry Christmas market to bring food, fun and festive cheer this December overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The survey found Northern Ireland to be the most charitable UK region, with more than three-quartersagreeing that it is better to give gts than to receive them. Eileen Wilson, Food Services Manager at Footprints, Northern Ireland, a partner of national food distribution charityFareSharesaid: “Christmas does bring extra challenges for people close to poverty or struggling with mental health. “Expenses go up this time of year. Not just trying to buy food and gts, but also heating in winter.” A campaign organised by the Big Give and backed by celebrities such as Stephen Fry, Dame Judi Dench, Russell Brandand others is aiming to help. The Big Give Christmas Challenge is the UK’s biggest Christmas coordinated fundraising appeal, supporting over  charities to raise funds with the unique offer of matching any donations made during the week of November  to December . This gives thehundreds of participating charities the opportunity to have their donations doubled. Alex Day, Director of The Big Give said: “Our study shows that, sadly, people across Great Britain and Northern Ireland are facing an imperfect storm high fuel prices, chronic mental health problems, rising debt, loneliness and fears about Covid- will mean that, for many, this festive period will be a far cry from picture perfect scenes portrayed on Christmas cards. “Some will rely on charities which will be further and further stretched as demand grows. “That is why, for those who can, supporting charities is more important than ever.

The survey found Northern Ireland to be the most charitable UK region, with more than three-quartersagreeing that it is better to give gts than to receive them. Eileen Wilson, Food Services Manager at Footprints, Northern Ireland, a partner of national food distribution charityFareSharesaid: “Christmas does bring extra challenges for people close to poverty or struggling with mental health. “Expenses go up this time of year. Not just trying to buy food and gts, but also heating in winter.” A campaign organised by the Big Give and backed by celebrities such as Stephen Fry, Dame Judi Dench, Russell Brandand others is aiming to help. The Big Give Christmas Challenge is the UK’s biggest Christmas coordinated fundraising appeal, supporting over  charities to raise funds with the unique offer of matching any donations made during the week of November  to December . This gives thehundreds of participating charities the opportunity to have their donations doubled. Alex Day, Director of The Big Give said: “Our study shows that, sadly, people across Great Britain and Northern Ireland are facing an imperfect storm high fuel prices, chronic mental health problems, rising debt, loneliness and fears about Covid- will mean that, for many, this festive period will be a far cry from picture perfect scenes portrayed on Christmas cards. “Some will rely on charities which will be further and further stretched as demand grows. “That is why, for those who can, supporting charities is more important than ever. Through The Christmas Challenge campaign, we are offering to match any donation made to hundreds of amazing charities throughtheBigGive.org.ukThat means whatever you can give will go twice as far.” The Christmas Challenge consists of many dferent charities, from small local organisations to large international charities.

Council will now look at ways to allocate resources to establish a new Greenway link connecting Judges Road to the proposed site for the ‘Rural Greenway Hub’ at the Auld School Site on Temple Road. Councillor Fleming said: “This would be transformational. It would be a greater use and safer use of the Country Park, Gransha Woods andEnaghLough. “Also, it would mean the site, known to people as the old school and Church site, being brought back into use. This won’t just have an effect on the locality ofStrathfoylePark but also the city and greater district.Councillor Ferguson continued: “The Lough is on my doorstep and even I don’t know its full history. It has its own eco-system. “It is a rural hub and over lockdown, many people have discovered the Lough and have used it for a number of activities. It is a very rural area and this has impacted on many residents. “We are hoping with the aspirations for theEnaghLough country park that some of these issues would be addressed. “We are asking to secure a connection from theStrathfoylegreenway to the Lough and Gransha area which would be impactful for the new houses so they could actively walk or cycle to the Lough. “It would link the moss area to, hopefully, a country hub at the old school where safe parking could be accessed. “If we were to overlook this small connection, we would be overlooking an absolute gem in the area.” The Council also hopes in time toexpand the Greenway within the district to areas such as Eglinton. Councillor Mooney added:I was struck by the work that has already gone into this concept. Thisisa rural tourism project that will seek to bring eco, adventure, cultural and rural tourism within the site.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTop BBC volunteer award for County Derry man overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Roads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland a council meeting has heardDerry NewsRoads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsEastwood: We have ten days to save the climate overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Mayor has invited Santa and his Elf and Safety helpers to Derry for a quick visit before Christmas Derry NewsDerry Christmas market to bring food, fun and festive cheer this December overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Council will write toDfIfor investment in roads as a “matter of urgency.” Councillor Sandra Duffy brough the motion to Council and said that despite an allocation toDfI, with astructuralbudget of pound million, Derry roads are “not seeing the benefit of that investment”. CouncillorDuffy said that currently motorists were “dealing with a road network that is in an unacceptable condition and badly in need of investment”. Councillor Duffy described the roads in and out ofGalliaghas “patchwork quilts that have been filled and refilled.” Councillors supported the motion with many bringing forward their constituents concerns over potholes and road conditions. Councillor McCready said: “I have been on roads in Baghdad and Kabul and the roads are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland.” Councillor McKinney described the situation as a disgrace. He said: “There are parts of our district where the roads and the traffic system are like driving in a third world country. I have written on many occasions to the DfI roads, only to be told there are no funds. Councillor Reilly added: “All the councillors havedemonstratedthat there are issues affecting the roads in their area and that is an historical issue.” Councillor Devenney described the conditions of the roads as the worst he has seen them in at least  years.

Council will write toDfIfor investment in roads as a “matter of urgency.” Councillor Sandra Duffy brough the motion to Council and said that despite an allocation toDfI, with astructuralbudget of pound million, Derry roads are “not seeing the benefit of that investment”. CouncillorDuffy said that currently motorists were “dealing with a road network that is in an unacceptable condition and badly in need of investment”. Councillor Duffy described the roads in and out ofGalliaghas “patchwork quilts that have been filled and refilled.” Councillors supported the motion with many bringing forward their constituents concerns over potholes and road conditions. Councillor McCready said: “I have been on roads in Baghdad and Kabul and the roads are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland.” Councillor McKinney described the situation as a disgrace. He said: “There are parts of our district where the roads and the traffic system are like driving in a third world country. I have written on many occasions to the DfI roads, only to be told there are no funds. Councillor Reilly added: “All the councillors havedemonstratedthat there are issues affecting the roads in their area and that is an historical issue.” Councillor Devenney described the conditions of the roads as the worst he has seen them in at least  years. Due to a legal challenge, the resurfacing contracts for the council area have been delayed to next year. The pound.m resurfacing programme locally for the year up to March  had included the Clooney Road between Caw and Gransha Roundabouts, Church Street, Claudy,BarnailtRoad,Glensha neRoad,Killalooto Claudy and theArdloughRoad.

My whole le came to a halt.Derry Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch aims to raise more awareness and funds for an “illness we don’t talk about enough” Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseReporter: Nicole Lang Dec   addthis, Leslie Hill was sadly diagnosed with Parkinsons disease in April . googletag.cmd.push Parkinsons disease is a condition that affects the brain. It causes problems like shaking and stfness that get worse over time. The main symptoms of the disease are shaking, slow movements and stfness. Treatments for Parkinsons disease include therapies to help with movement problems, medicines and sometimes brain surgery. Parkinsons disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain. It’s not yet clear exactly why this happens. Leslie’s first symptoms were shown in his handwriting when it was still neat but very small. Then, in January , the -year-old, was getting ready to go to the dentist when his left hand would not move to brush his teeth. Leslie said: “After several attempts to brush my teeth, I realised something wasnt right. I contacted my GP and was sent to the hospital to do tests. “I was kept in for five days and had numerous tests. It was then that I was diagnosed. My whole le came to a halt. “Shortly after, I became a member of Parkinsons Foyle branch. I really enjoyed and appreciated the support that I got. “I helped to organise events and helped with fundraising. I was a committee member within six months and then I was asked to become Chairman. “It is and was such an honour, I was very pleased to be voted in. I have a vice chairman, Jackie Brolly. “There is a committee of  dedicated members, nothing is a bother to them. My we Rhonda is the secretary and Wendy Stuart is treasurer. “We have approximately  members and we are all one big family. “I have been acting Chairman since September  and officially since March . During my time as Chairman, we have given approximatelyfive to six thousand pounds every year to Parkinson’s research.” Parkinson’s Foyle Branch is a self-funded charity and they depend on the generosity of members of the public to keep the branch going. Their mission is ‘Together we will find a cure, and improve le for everybody affected by Parkinson’s.’ Leslie continued: “We’re close to major breakthroughs. Funding the right research into the most promising treatments, we get closer to a cure every day. “Until then, were here for everyone affected by Parkinson’s. Fighting for fair treatment and better services. Making everyone see its real impact. “People with Parkinson’s, scientists and supporters, fundraisers and families, carers and clinicians, all working side by side. “We are impatient for change, we’re taking a stand, speaking out, chipping in, and playing our part. “I cannot thank the members of the public enough as they have been tremendous. We also organise events with the money we receive to help Parkinson’s patients. “This includes dancing to music, exercise classes, massage and reflexology classes, yoga and many more as exercise is a good medicine for Parkinsons sufferers. “In the month of March, we hold our Annual General Meeting. Then, from April to December, we have monthly meetings. “At our meetings,we have  plus members and carers and we have a guest at every one of them. “Our meetings came to a halt in March  due to the Covid pandemic, the whole world had stopped due to this deadly virus. “With our dedicated committee members, we rang round all of our members and kept in touch. The Mayor of Derry and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke is attending the Foyle Branch’s Christmas Dinner on Friday December  to celebrate all the member’s efforts during this dficult period. Leslie concluded: “I want to speak about and raise awareness for Parkinson’s because you don’t see a lot about it on the news and not many people know about this illness but, together, we will beat Parkinson’s.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTop BBC volunteer award for County Derry man overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Roads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland a council meeting has heardDerry NewsRoads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsEastwood: We have ten days to save the climate overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Mayor has invited Santa and his Elf and Safety helpers to Derry for a quick visit before Christmas Derry NewsDerry Christmas market to bring food, fun and festive cheer this December overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

My whole le came to a halt.Derry Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch aims to raise more awareness and funds for an “illness we don’t talk about enough” Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseReporter: Nicole Lang Dec   addthis, Leslie Hill was sadly diagnosed with Parkinsons disease in April . googletag.cmd.push Parkinsons disease is a condition that affects the brain. It causes problems like shaking and stfness that get worse over time. The main symptoms of the disease are shaking, slow movements and stfness. Treatments for Parkinsons disease include therapies to help with movement problems, medicines and sometimes brain surgery. Parkinsons disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain. It’s not yet clear exactly why this happens. Leslie’s first symptoms were shown in his handwriting when it was still neat but very small. Then, in January , the -year-old, was getting ready to go to the dentist when his left hand would not move to brush his teeth. Leslie said: “After several attempts to brush my teeth, I realised something wasnt right. I contacted my GP and was sent to the hospital to do tests. “I was kept in for five days and had numerous tests. It was then that I was diagnosed. My whole le came to a halt. “Shortly after, I became a member of Parkinsons Foyle branch. I really enjoyed and appreciated the support that I got. “I helped to organise events and helped with fundraising. I was a committee member within six months and then I was asked to become Chairman. “It is and was such an honour, I was very pleased to be voted in. I have a vice chairman, Jackie Brolly. “There is a committee of  dedicated members, nothing is a bother to them. My we Rhonda is the secretary and Wendy Stuart is treasurer. “We have approximately  members and we are all one big family. “I have been acting Chairman since September  and officially since March . During my time as Chairman, we have given approximatelyfive to six thousand pounds every year to Parkinson’s research.” Parkinson’s Foyle Branch is a self-funded charity and they depend on the generosity of members of the public to keep the branch going. Their mission is ‘Together we will find a cure, and improve le for everybody affected by Parkinson’s.’ Leslie continued: “We’re close to major breakthroughs. Funding the right research into the most promising treatments, we get closer to a cure every day. “Until then, were here for everyone affected by Parkinson’s. Fighting for fair treatment and better services. Making everyone see its real impact. “People with Parkinson’s, scientists and supporters, fundraisers and families, carers and clinicians, all working side by side. “We are impatient for change, we’re taking a stand, speaking out, chipping in, and playing our part. “I cannot thank the members of the public enough as they have been tremendous. We also organise events with the money we receive to help Parkinson’s patients. “This includes dancing to music, exercise classes, massage and reflexology classes, yoga and many more as exercise is a good medicine for Parkinsons sufferers. “In the month of March, we hold our Annual General Meeting. Then, from April to December, we have monthly meetings. “At our meetings,we have  plus members and carers and we have a guest at every one of them. “Our meetings came to a halt in March  due to the Covid pandemic, the whole world had stopped due to this deadly virus. “With our dedicated committee members, we rang round all of our members and kept in touch. The Mayor of Derry and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke is attending the Foyle Branch’s Christmas Dinner on Friday December  to celebrate all the member’s efforts during this dficult period. Leslie concluded: “I want to speak about and raise awareness for Parkinson’s because you don’t see a lot about it on the news and not many people know about this illness but, together, we will beat Parkinson’s.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTop BBC volunteer award for County Derry man overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Roads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland a council meeting has heardDerry NewsRoads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsEastwood: We have ten days to save the climate overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Mayor has invited Santa and his Elf and Safety helpers to Derry for a quick visit before Christmas Derry NewsDerry Christmas market to bring food, fun and festive cheer this December overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTop BBC volunteer award for County Derry man overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Roads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland a council meeting has heardDerry NewsRoads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsEastwood: We have ten days to save the climate overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Mayor has invited Santa and his Elf and Safety helpers to Derry for a quick visit before Christmas Derry NewsDerry Christmas market to bring food, fun and festive cheer this December overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTop BBC volunteer award for County Derry man overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Roads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland a council meeting has heardDerry NewsRoads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsEastwood: We have ten days to save the climate overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Mayor has invited Santa and his Elf and Safety helpers to Derry for a quick visit before Christmas Derry NewsDerry Christmas market to bring food, fun and festive cheer this December overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

She said: “The announcement that the booster vaccine programme has been extended to include younger people is very welcome. “The COVID booster vaccination has been shown to be highly effective at preventing serious illness and the spread of the virus. “It is also notable that the gap between the second and third dose is to be cut to three months in an effort to stymie the further spread of COVID-. “While these measures are welcome it must be remembered that vaccines are but one tool in the kit. “It is vital that the Department of Health have an optimal level of testing and tracing in constant operation and that we all observe public health advice on hygiene and mask wearing. “Together all these tools can work to keep us safe and to reduce the pressures being endured by our health and social care workers.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

A number of questions were asked of respondents – one of which enquired about bullying in the workplace to which  per cent replied that they had been a victim of it. Other figures made for disturbing reading as well with  per cent saying that when off work for illness, they get no sick pay from their employer and have to rely on the governments statutory sick pay – a rate signicantly lower than their monthly wage. A further  per cent said they were struggling to pay their household bills while  per cent said their workforce was not friendly towards trade unions. DTUC Chairperson, Niall McCarroll said: “Derry Trades Union Council through this local workers survey, have provided an opportunity, a  and a voice for workers to have their say, local workers have now spoken. “The political classes and the bosses must now act to address the exploitation and undervaluing of our young people and the wider local labour force. “The local chambers of commerce must now also take on the responsibility, with others, of reversing years of wage inequalities and hardships, which have been created through profit driven local employment practices. “A local culture within our employment market which has derisory and insulting take home pay as fundamental to its existence, leaving local workers barely able to survive. “When it comes to telling us, what’s best for local people and what we need to improve and advance like other city’s, local business leaders, the council and other departments of a refined nature, regularly bestow upon us their collective unity of purpose, an unquestionable expertise. “In the knowledge that  per cent of local workers have experienced bullying and or harassment in the workplace and  per cent struggle to pay their bills, their message grows weak and lacks credibility, as they continue to profit and feed off grandiose statements. “Sixty nine per cent of local workers surveyed were women with  per cent of those surveyed earning below pound. per hour for their labour and  per cent gained employment under zero hours contracts, conditions stacked in favour of the rich and the business classes. “The laughter of our children is being muffled by local capitalists, we should not accept any young person being paid pound. an hour. Local businesses should be asked and make it known, how much they pay their workers and in turn we decide where we spend our money. “Pay rates should be listed on such things as restaurant menus, front doors of public houses and every retail outlet in shopping centres. “Forty eight per cent of local workers who completed the survey were employed in retail or the hospitality and tourism sectors with  per cent being left with no option but to use a food bank. “It would be disappointing and unjustied to think that local workers received such pittance during such times as the Fleadh Cheoil, City of Culture, Clipper Festival and other boom times for business and commerce groups. “Poverty pay and precarious working conditions suit our business leaders and creates the ideal environment to promote investment, come to Derry and you will have cheap labour at your disposal and a workforce which is largely non unionised and therefore not organised to challenge wage inequalities, voiceless. “Sixty five per cent of local workers surveyed said their workplace was not trade union friendly, this needs called out and challenged politically. “As a guiding principle, moving forward, every worker across the city and district should have unhindered access to the trade union of their choice and encouraged to organise and become active in that trade union. “We read regularly that our health and social care system is overstretched, the AE at Altnagelvin Hospital being unable to cope with demand, we have a mental health crisis, young people with a sense of hopelessness no future no vision, with local communities having some of the highest statistics in terms of social deprivation and poverty. “The link between substandard contracts of employment, poverty pay and socio economic hardships is well researched, poor terms and conditions of employment is putting pressure on our health service and working class communities. “Sixty seven per cent of local workers surveyed had no company sick pay and  per cent were unable to self isolate due to Covid- because they could not afford financially to do so. “The findings of this survey are stark and must be addressed as a matter of urgency, these findings must now be incorporated into any future party political election manestos and a central focus of any corporate plan from Derry City and Strabane District Council. “Our livelihoods and prosperity are of course important but we must also reconcile this with our identity, who we are and what we cherish the most.” The Derry News contacted the Derry Chamber of Commerce to comment in response to the DTUCs survey results but they declined to do so.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\"

A number of questions were asked of respondents – one of which enquired about bullying in the workplace to which  per cent replied that they had been a victim of it. Other figures made for disturbing reading as well with  per cent saying that when off work for illness, they get no sick pay from their employer and have to rely on the governments statutory sick pay – a rate signicantly lower than their monthly wage. A further  per cent said they were struggling to pay their household bills while  per cent said their workforce was not friendly towards trade unions. DTUC Chairperson, Niall McCarroll said: “Derry Trades Union Council through this local workers survey, have provided an opportunity, a  and a voice for workers to have their say, local workers have now spoken. “The political classes and the bosses must now act to address the exploitation and undervaluing of our young people and the wider local labour force. “The local chambers of commerce must now also take on the responsibility, with others, of reversing years of wage inequalities and hardships, which have been created through profit driven local employment practices. “A local culture within our employment market which has derisory and insulting take home pay as fundamental to its existence, leaving local workers barely able to survive. “When it comes to telling us, what’s best for local people and what we need to improve and advance like other city’s, local business leaders, the council and other departments of a refined nature, regularly bestow upon us their collective unity of purpose, an unquestionable expertise. “In the knowledge that  per cent of local workers have experienced bullying and or harassment in the workplace and  per cent struggle to pay their bills, their message grows weak and lacks credibility, as they continue to profit and feed off grandiose statements. “Sixty nine per cent of local workers surveyed were women with  per cent of those surveyed earning below pound. per hour for their labour and  per cent gained employment under zero hours contracts, conditions stacked in favour of the rich and the business classes. “The laughter of our children is being muffled by local capitalists, we should not accept any young person being paid pound. an hour. Local businesses should be asked and make it known, how much they pay their workers and in turn we decide where we spend our money. “Pay rates should be listed on such things as restaurant menus, front doors of public houses and every retail outlet in shopping centres. “Forty eight per cent of local workers who completed the survey were employed in retail or the hospitality and tourism sectors with  per cent being left with no option but to use a food bank. “It would be disappointing and unjustied to think that local workers received such pittance during such times as the Fleadh Cheoil, City of Culture, Clipper Festival and other boom times for business and commerce groups. “Poverty pay and precarious working conditions suit our business leaders and creates the ideal environment to promote investment, come to Derry and you will have cheap labour at your disposal and a workforce which is largely non unionised and therefore not organised to challenge wage inequalities, voiceless. “Sixty five per cent of local workers surveyed said their workplace was not trade union friendly, this needs called out and challenged politically. “As a guiding principle, moving forward, every worker across the city and district should have unhindered access to the trade union of their choice and encouraged to organise and become active in that trade union. “We read regularly that our health and social care system is overstretched, the AE at Altnagelvin Hospital being unable to cope with demand, we have a mental health crisis, young people with a sense of hopelessness no future no vision, with local communities having some of the highest statistics in terms of social deprivation and poverty. “The link between substandard contracts of employment, poverty pay and socio economic hardships is well researched, poor terms and conditions of employment is putting pressure on our health service and working class communities. “Sixty seven per cent of local workers surveyed had no company sick pay and  per cent were unable to self isolate due to Covid- because they could not afford financially to do so. “The findings of this survey are stark and must be addressed as a matter of urgency, these findings must now be incorporated into any future party political election manestos and a central focus of any corporate plan from Derry City and Strabane District Council. “Our livelihoods and prosperity are of course important but we must also reconcile this with our identity, who we are and what we cherish the most.” The Derry News contacted the Derry Chamber of Commerce to comment in response to the DTUCs survey results but they declined to do so.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\"

Mr Delargy insisted that current “dithering” from the Minister has lead to little action being taken and warned that the consequences could be direefforts are not stepped up to fight climate change. “As a planet and a species we are facing an existential crisis that requires ambition and determinationwe are to play our part in the global fight against climate change,” he said. “Unfortunately, to date we have seen far too much dithering from the DUP Environment Minister Edwin Poots and precious little action. “That simply isn’t good enough and I made the point that the North needs robust climate change legislationwe are to make a dference for this and future generations. “We need net zero targets which enable our businesses, agriculture, infrastructure and energy providers to plan for the future in a transformative way that creates opportunities for green economic growth and jobs. “It is also crucial that we leave no inidual, community or sector behind in our pursuit of a sustainable future. Nor can we expect the least well off or the vulnerable to pay the cost. “The climate crisis must be tackled on the premise of a just transition. It recognises no borders. “Society across this island is demanding a robust response to the crisis we face and it is just common sense that it should be organised on an all-Ireland basis.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTop BBC volunteer award for County Derry man overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Roads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland a council meeting has heardDerry NewsRoads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsEastwood: We have ten days to save the climate overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Mayor has invited Santa and his Elf and Safety helpers to Derry for a quick visit before Christmas Derry NewsDerry Christmas market to bring food, fun and festive cheer this December overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

However, Phase Two of the stadiums redevelopment has yet to proceed.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Dec Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Aontuacute councillor, Emmet Doyle, has demanded Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey to stop dragging her feet in progressing Phase Two of the redevelopment of Derry City FCs Brandywell Stadium. googletag.cmd.push In  a new  seater stand incorporating changing rooms and media facilities was completed at a cost of poundmillion. That brought the existing capacity of the ground to around . However, that was supposed to be part of wider development at the stadium with a second phase increasing capacity to . Cllr Doyle, who represents the Ballyarnett ward, expressed concern that Phase Two has yet to proceed and following a meeting with the Department of Communities, he said his was “dismayed” and “frustrated” at the lack of progress. He said: “A number of months ago I called for a meeting between Council and the Department to understand the level of progress made in progressing the Sub-Regional stadia programme which is currently holding up Phase Two of the Brandywell. “I am dismayed following the meeting that no time-frame has yet been set for the opening of the funding programme, and indeed the Department has not even set criteria. “Engagement has taken place with clubs and officials which is positive but this programme first opened a decade ago, and yet we are still waiting for movement despite it being part of New Decade New Approach. “I am massively frustrated that we are still at this early stage and the Minister needs to step in before the Assembly election next year to deliver on what was a programme that has raised the expectations of fans throughout the Council area.” Cllr Brian Tierney of the SDLP echoed Cllr Doyles concerns and accused Sinn Feacutein of failing to deliver. He added: “It’s extremely frustrating that the Department for Communities are unable to give us any indication around funding for the second phase of redevelopment work at the Brandywell Stadiun. “Over five years ago Sinn Feacutein told us this funding was guaranteed and the party’s Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey seems to have abandoned this promise.  “The Brandywell is an important community hub in our city, it’s not just used by our football clubs, but the general public and is open to everyone. The first phase of the redevelopment was a massive success, it delivered a modern stand for fans, a new greyhound track and much improved facilities. The second phase is now long overdue. “With fortunes changing for the better for Derry City on the pitch there could be no better time for Minister Hargey to recommit herself to this project. There is a new-found feeling of optimism around the club and we need to capitalise on this. “If we wish to bring more fans through the turnstiles then we have to be able to offer an experience befitting a modern football match. “Time and time again Sinn Feacutein have made promises to the people of Derry, but failed to deliver.

The Foyle MP will formally move the second reading of his Climate Emergency and Green Jobs Bill which aims to bring forward the date by which the British Government must achieve net-zero emissions to . Climate Change is the greatest threat our world faces, and we have ten days to legislate to save our planet. On th Dec, I’m bringing my Climate Change Bill to the Commons with progressive ideas to do our part to arrest the slide into climate catastrophe. #ClimateChangeBill pic RDOeSu     — Colum Eastwood December ,     The Bill also places a duty on Government Ministers to bring forward proposals for a corporate green levy on large businesses to resource climate action. Eastwood said global leaders have failed to grasp the chance to take action on climate change. “Over the last number of months, senior British Government Ministers have been at pains to establish their green credentials ahead of and during the COP conference in Glasgow, he said. While global leaders failed to grasp the real opportunity to take the bold action needed to prevent climate breakdown, the commitments made over that fortnight were substantial.  A unique opportunity - Irish public invited to share views on all-island rail network    Now Conservative Ministers have the opportunity to prove that Glasgow wasn’t all hot air and grandstanding for the world’s media. “The Bill I have produced alongside environmental leaders would signal a step change in this government’s attitude toward climate action and demonstrate that this is an emergency. I am proposing bringing forward the date by which net-zero emissions must be achieved to , introducing the first legislative climate emergency declaration and seeking the introduction of a new corporate green levy recognising that the burden for paying for climate rehabilitation should fall on those companies that have done the most damage. “Passing this Bill would be the first real demonstration that this government acknowledges that the house is on fire and we need to do something about it now. This legislation is radical because we cannot afford to be timid in the face of an emergency like this. I hope that political leaders will commit themselves to it in the days ahead.”  Foyle MLA Delargy accuses Poots of dithering on climate change     *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTop BBC volunteer award for County Derry man overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Roads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland a council meeting has heardDerry NewsRoads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsEastwood: We have ten days to save the climate overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Mayor has invited Santa and his Elf and Safety helpers to Derry for a quick visit before Christmas Derry NewsDerry Christmas market to bring food, fun and festive cheer this December overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The Foyle MP will formally move the second reading of his Climate Emergency and Green Jobs Bill which aims to bring forward the date by which the British Government must achieve net-zero emissions to . Climate Change is the greatest threat our world faces, and we have ten days to legislate to save our planet. On th Dec, I’m bringing my Climate Change Bill to the Commons with progressive ideas to do our part to arrest the slide into climate catastrophe. #ClimateChangeBill pic RDOeSu     — Colum Eastwood December ,     The Bill also places a duty on Government Ministers to bring forward proposals for a corporate green levy on large businesses to resource climate action. Eastwood said global leaders have failed to grasp the chance to take action on climate change. “Over the last number of months, senior British Government Ministers have been at pains to establish their green credentials ahead of and during the COP conference in Glasgow, he said. While global leaders failed to grasp the real opportunity to take the bold action needed to prevent climate breakdown, the commitments made over that fortnight were substantial.  A unique opportunity - Irish public invited to share views on all-island rail network    Now Conservative Ministers have the opportunity to prove that Glasgow wasn’t all hot air and grandstanding for the world’s media. “The Bill I have produced alongside environmental leaders would signal a step change in this government’s attitude toward climate action and demonstrate that this is an emergency. I am proposing bringing forward the date by which net-zero emissions must be achieved to , introducing the first legislative climate emergency declaration and seeking the introduction of a new corporate green levy recognising that the burden for paying for climate rehabilitation should fall on those companies that have done the most damage. “Passing this Bill would be the first real demonstration that this government acknowledges that the house is on fire and we need to do something about it now. This legislation is radical because we cannot afford to be timid in the face of an emergency like this. I hope that political leaders will commit themselves to it in the days ahead.”  Foyle MLA Delargy accuses Poots of dithering on climate change     *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTop BBC volunteer award for County Derry man overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Roads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland a council meeting has heardDerry NewsRoads in Baghdad and Kabul are in better condition than what our roads are here” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsEastwood: We have ten days to save the climate overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Mayor has invited Santa and his Elf and Safety helpers to Derry for a quick visit before Christmas Derry NewsDerry Christmas market to bring food, fun and festive cheer this December overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.    More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Pic by MonoPix.Reporter: Liam Tunney Dec Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, As the victorious Na Magha team came off the pitch at Kingspan Breffni Park on Saturday, one supporter signalled to manager Dee Doherty to keep hold of the black armbands. googletag.cmd.push The bands, worn by every member of the squad, were worn in memory of club stalwart Seaacuten Mellon, who passed away this month, and who coached many of the current senior team at one stage. Under the stand, with the inimitable sounds of championship victory coming from the changing room, Doherty said Seaacuten Mellons fingerprints were all over the win. “Theres not too many boys in that changing room that havent been coached by Seaacuten at some stage, whether it was underage or senior,” he told the County Derry Post. “He was an absolute legend of hurling in Derry and had a massive impact on the game today to be honest. Breandaacuten Quigley fields a high ball. Pic by MonoPix. “I would say we tried to keep the emotion out of it, and just used it to drive the boys on,” he added. The sight of Ruaidhriacute McLaughlin reeling off under the floodlights was greeted with joy in the stands, but also with a certain degree of relief. Having looked untroubled throughout the first half, Cootehill had forced their way back into the game and trailed by just a point going into the final quarter. “It was nervous enough at one stage,” said Doherty. “When we played the first half and talked about it in the changing room at half time, we thought we were fairly well in control. “Then we came out in the second half, and they put the pressure on us, and had it down to a one-point game at one stage.  Na Magha seal Ulster semi final spot with blistering final quarter  Ruaidhriacute McLaughlins th minute goal saw off a stubborn Cootehill side at Breffni Park.   “We talked about how we had let them back into it again, and we needed a big - minutes of hurling out of them. “Then Ruaidhriacute went up and scored the goal for us, and that sort of gave us a wee bit of a cushion. “To be fair, they responded well. I thought the subs came in and freshened things up, the likes of young Keelan there and boys like that helped us get a few scores.” There was a certain degree of rustiness on display. Na Magha had not had a competitive game since October  after Coleraine were unable to field in the junior final. However, with the cobwebs hopefully blown away, Doherty is looking towards the next game. “The big problem at the minute is that were in this competition and we havent won our county championship, so the preparations werent ideal,” he said. “Weve got a couple of challenge games in, which is the best we could do, but obviously not getting to play your county final meant we had no competitive games and we were very rusty. “Everybody wants to get to the final, but were in the semi final first, so hopefully we can get through that and see how it goes. “Weve a fair bit of work to do before this next game against Carrickmacross in two weeks time.”  Deep sadness as Derry hurling stalwart passes away  Seaacuten Mellon was one of the founding members of Na Magha CLG.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Pic by Mary K Burke.Reporter: Liam Tunney Dec Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, A satisfied James McNicholl shted back and forth underneath the Owenbeg stand, trying to shake the effects of an hour and a half on the sideline in Storm Arwen. googletag.cmd.push His Dungiven side had just sealed back-to-back Jack Cassidy Cup titles with a win over Loup and with the howling wind muting the celebrations slightly, he had his eye on the future. “Hopefully we can get a springboard from this into senior football,” he told the County Derry Post. “We won in , and any momentum we would have got was halted with Covid and obviously that was more important at the time.  Derry GAA vice chairman Kieran McKeever presents the Jack Cassidy cup to Dungiven joint captains Darragh McGilligan and Cahair Higgins. Pic by Mary K Burke. “Weve four or five starting on the senior team there and most of the  lads are senior footballers now. There is plenty there to work with over the next couple of years. “[With Geoffrey in] its exciting times for the players and you know theyll buy into it. The talent is there – its always been there, but sometimes other things get in the way. “We are where we are as a senior team, thats the way the league tables are, and hopefully now well kick on and in four or five years time well be back in that conversation further up the table.” Despite a Carl Lagan goal bringing the deficit to just one in the second half, McNicholls St Canices side looked controlled and composed throughout the encounter. McNicholl said the elements had ruined the game as a spectacle, but that his side had a plan for managing the situation. “We got settled down at half time. We were a wee bit nervous and passes were going astray in the first half, but I thought we controlled it really well after half time,” he said.  Dungiven master the elements to seal back-to-back Jack Cassidy titles  A late Niall McGonagle penalty stretched the winning margin to five.   “There was such a big breeze in the first half the conditions dictated the game to be honest. Its nearly too big a breeze at times we were kicking the ball out of play and that. “Look, we worked on it, weve done it in training, so it was a matter of taking it from the training field onto the pitch.” “Its all about patience. We work hard on isolating one-on-ones and getting at your man, andyou cant do that in Gaelic football, you shouldnt be in the team. “The spaces will always open up at some point, it was a very defensive first half from them, and rightly so, they were facing a big breeze. “We knew theyd be there in the second half, but it just takes a bit of time. You get a bit of luck as well, but they knew they had it in them,” he added.

An Innocent Man: Saturday, Talking Pictures TV @ pm Jimmies living a grand le in Calornia. Mike and Danny are two crooked cops not averse to robbing and framing suspects. One day they all collide and lives are shattered. A gritty and vicious thriller from  that didnt strike a chord with TV audiences used to Sellecks friendly Magnum persona but its a film thats really worth reevaluation. Selleck, David Rasche, Laila Robins, Bjada Djola and F. Murray Abraham add to a heady mix. Zombieland: Saturday, Syfy @ pm Americas been overthrown by the undead and a young man from Columbus, Ohio just wants to get home. On his danger fraught journey he meets another survivor from Tallahassee, Florida and both decide to stick together. This is a joy, from its Metallica scored opening scene to its fairground set climax its pure and utter fun. Jesse Eisenberg,Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin are all game for a laugh here. Parasite: Saturday, Channel  @ pm The Kims are living a miserable existence in a basement apartment in Seoul. The Parks live a comfortable le in a beautul home overlooking the city. The youngest Kim goes to work for the Parks and things are never the same again. Parasite is amazing. A e into Korean society that manages to be hilarious, nervewracking, terrying and exhilarating all at once. A totally deserved best picture winner.Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin and Cho Yeo-jeong are just perfect in their parts. I Went Down: Sunday, RTEacute One @ .am  Two criminals travel into the wilds of rural Ireland to carry out a kidnapping at the behest of a man who owns them both. Things dont work out exactly as planned. For my money one the the best Irish comedies ever made. Brendan Gleeson is on fire as Bunny Kelly and Peter McDonald is good craic in his film debut. As always with Irish films the laughs come with a healthy dose of pathos and the two blend brilliantly. Apocalypse Now: Sunday, BBC Two @ .am  Captain Willard has been tasked with going up the NugravengRiver to terminate a rogue American Colonel with extreme prejudice. What he sees on his journey with stay with him and you forever. A nightmarish, drug fueled masterpiece and a harrowing, troubling, darkly comic  psychotic look into the troubling heart of man. If you havent seen it yet Im very jealous. Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Larry Fishburne, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper will all blow you away. The Day Of The Locust: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .am The film where Donald Sutherland plays Homer Simpson. Yup. The s were a bad time in America and people flooded into Hollywood to find fame and fortune away from the Great depression. It worked out for some and not for others. A vicious and biting satire of the film industry. Flamboyant and extravagant in places, downright horrying in others. Its fantastic though and packed full of too many famous faces to list. Gone Baby Gone: Monday, Great! Movies @ pm A young girl goes missing in South Boston and a pair of investigators are hired to find her. A tough ask made tougher by red tape and the web of crime surrounding every aspect of the case. Ben Afflecks adaption of Dennis Lehanes book is a powerful and upsetting watch that will make you ask yourself questions you might not like the answers to. Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Amy Ryan and Ed Harris all do affecting work. Alfie: Monday, TCM @ pm Alfies a self centred ass, he loves himself, loves to hear himself talk. Women love him too but he treats them like dirt, taking what he wants from them before throwing them aside. Then one day le decides to slap him in the face. Controversial on release and highly influential in the years since this  drama is an excellent look at the light and dark of the swinging s. Michael Caine, Shelley Winters and Julia Foster all nail their parts. Transsiberian: Monday, Great! Movies Action @ .pm A couple are travelling home from China and take the train to Moscow. Along the way they meet another couple. Things get......well youll just have to see for yourself. A finely crafted and atmospheric watch from the Hitchcockian school of thrillers. Its rather violent and one scene may have you reaching for the remote but stick with it, its worth your time. Woody Harrelson, Emily Mortimer, Kate Mara and Ben Kingsley do good work The Man From Colorado: Tuesday, Film @ .pm Owen Devereauxs been appointed the federal judge of a region in Colorado but hes not exactly suited to the job. He has psychopathic tendencies that have, in the past during the civil war, been covered up by his friend Del, a man not willing to do it anymore. From  comes an uncommonly deep and thoughtful western that isnt afraid to shy away from big themes. For once Glenn Ford plays a villainous part and he does it well. William Holden and James Millican excel in supporting roles. The Man Who Knew Too Much: Wednesday, Film @ .pm An American family take an impulsive trip to Morocco and finds themselves in the midst of an assassination attempt and their lives are immediately in danger. It sounds heavy but this is one of Alfred Hitchcocks lighter and more enjoyable films. James Stewart and Doris Day lead the film and are delightful as their roles as always. A highly enjoyable and suspenseful film worth recording for a rainy afternoon. Deep Blue Sea: Wednesday, TCM @ pm In an attempt to find a cure for Alzheimers disease a scientist grows mega sharks so she can experiment on their brains. These sharks are kept in a secret facility but guess what  They are really brainy and really hungry. Renny Harlins sci actioner from  is gloriously stupid but its loads and loads of fun too. Blood spills and jokes fly as a wicked cast that includes Thomas Jane, Aida Turturro, Saffron Burrows and Samuel L. Jackson struggle to stay in one piece. The Conversation: Thursday, BBC @ pm Harrys a surveillance expert and hes got a new job. But the work is getting to him and his paranoia is at an all time high due to past events. Francis Ford Coppolas  thriller is a stunner. A post Watergate classic seeped in the pervading atmosphere of a broken country. Gene Hackmans spectacular as a man coming apart at the seams and the late John Cazale as his partner is as always magnicent. A nerve shredding watch. The Blood On Satans Claw: Friday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm A rural village in th century England is thrown into upheaval when an evil looking skull is unearthed by a plough and sinister things start happening in the aftermath. A prime example of folk horror, a subgenre from the early s that would still give you the chills nearly  years later. Its hefty stuff, that in places will offend but its genuinely effective. Patrick Wymark, Linda Hayden and Barry Andrews all do strong work. Damsel: Friday, TG @ .pm A man travels across the American Frontier of the th century on a little horse called Butterscotch. Hes looking for the love of his le so he can propose and the only thing between him and happiness is danger. A lot of danger. A slowburn pace might annoy some but this left-field take on the western genre is an entertaining and twisting watch propelled by nice turns from Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska. Lapsis: Friday, Film @ .pm Rays taken a strange new job to help support his ailing brother. Hes marching into the woods, dragging miles of cable behind him to connect up cubes used for futuristic trading. To say more would be a ruin a unique and humorous satirical look at the exploitative techniques modern day employment is made up of. Its not always successful but its last  minutes really hits the spot. Dean Imperial as Ray is one to keep an eye out for.

However, the scoreboard remained the same as heroic UCC defence and a lack of accuracy at crucial times undid all the hard work.A forward pass undid one multi-phase attack and a penalty given away in an attacking position from an otherwise excellent line-out maul foiled another.Then a superb scrummaging effort won the home side a penalty on the UCC five-metre line. Ballynahinch looked to turn the screw and opted for another scrum, only to give away a penalty and come away from another stint in the UCC  with nothing.As the opportunities came and went UCC continued to defend well and kick superbly and when Squires got them out of trouble with a brilliantly executed - kick to give them a foothold in Ballynahinch territory they were visibly lted and reasserted themselves in attack.They were able to close out the game, despite missing a penalty in front of the posts and having another kick and chase try disallowed for a knock-on, leaving Ballynahinch reflecting on how they failed to turn all their possession and territory statistics into points.The league table, which is the only statistic that counts at the end of the season, shows Ballynahinch at the bottom, having been defeated by their nearest rivals in their last two outings.There is no respite as Munster giants Cork Constitution roll into Ballymacarn Park this weekend on the back of three consecutive wins, having shrugged off their uncharacteristically slow start to the season.Ballynahinch : John Dickson, Zack McCall, Kyle McCall, James Simpson, John Donnan, Thomas Donnan, Oli Loughead, Bradley Luney, Chris Gibson, Jack Milligan, Aaron Cairns, Rory Butler, Tagen Strydom, Shane Ball, Yasser Omar, Josh Hanlon, Nacho Cladera Crespo, Diego Vidal Souza, Callum Irvine, Conor McCauley, Greg Hutley..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Business boost for high street  ","story":"BUSINESSES across the district are being given a unique opportunity to help shape the future of high streets across the Newry, Mourne and Down area.Members of a Stormont task force spearheading a new initiative will be in Downpatrick next week for a workshop designed to provide local people with their say on how to rejuvenate town centres in a post-Covid world.Junior ministers Gary Middleton and Declan Kearney mdash who are leading the task force mdash will be at Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn on Thursday,December , and are encouraging business owners and residents to come along and have their say during what is being billed as an evidence gathering exercise.A number of local councillors have echoed their appeal for people to take part in the two-hour event which starts at pm.Designed to help make town, city and village centres places where people can do business, socialise, shop, be creative and use public services, the task force is determined to make a dference, with its membership including a raft of government departments and key organisations including Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster.The junior ministers say while there are many common and shared challenges, they recognise that every high street is dferent and has its own character, personality and needs that will each require bespoke local solutions.They want to hear views and evidence from far and wide, across both urban and rural areas and are urging e everyone with an interest in the future of their local high street to respond to the call for evidence and share their views.The task forcersquos visit to Downpatrick comes after it was revealed that there are currently  empty shop units in the town centre.In addition, the finishing touches are being put to a pound, revitalisation scheme in Church Street, while work is continuing to redevelop the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty, adjacent buildings as part of a major retail and commercial development opportunity which, it is hoped, can attract a number of leading retailers.Ahead of the Downpatrick consultation event, the business community and wider civic society is being asked to put forward ideas on what success in high streets could look like, with the focus on family friendly destinations where people want to shop, socialise, live and work.The task force said the series of workshops provide important opportunities for everyone to have their say and make their views known, with the junior ministers particularly keen to hear from a wide spectrum of people.Mr Kearney added: ldquoOur high streets are for everyone.

This was due mostly to a long, very arduous hill along the back straight but there were also some very tricky tight turns which were treacherous.There was a long downhill which some used as recovery but others saw this as a chance to gain places and they threw caution to the wind, flinging themselves down the descent in an alarming fashion.The spectators had plenty to watch and saw the runners several times per lap.Mackenzie Murray found it hard to get himself into the groove in the U-  race and despite coming second overall, he felt that his performance was under par.Looking back at how well he ran in Ballyclare recently, it is hard to argue with this self assessment.

You canrsquot just leave it at home on Sunday night and go out without it on Monday.Mrs Foster said she does not hold grudges against those who had hurt her, including former colleague Edwin Poots, who ousted her from the DUP leadership in May before being forced out of office himself just weeks later.Reflecting on the decision by Sinn Fein to collapse the executive with the resignation of then Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness in , she said: ldquoWe got into a spiral and we couldnrsquot stop it and it got to a point then where the assembly collapsed and of course I regret that it was down for three years.She said she liked the late DUP leader Ian Paisley very much. ldquoHe used to joke with me and say, lsquoHow are the Anglicans doing Arlenersquo Asked by Mr Kellyshe thought Dr Paisley had mellowed over the years, she said: ldquoI never knew Dr Paisley personally until   and I think he probably was in a dferent space than he had been in the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties.She declined to speculate on what might have changed him. ldquoI donrsquot know.

While the police could do more, I realise they may not have all the resources they require at their disposal and this situation also has to be addressed, he declared.BALLYNAHINCH mdash All takeaways in Ballynahinch should be close at midnight to cut down on sectarian trouble in the town, according to a local politician.South Down Assemblyman Jim Wells has called upon Down Council to introduce a blanket closure time on all takeaways claiming that the late opening hours, especially on Friday and Saturday nights, has led to an increase of sectarian trouble in the town.At a meeting of the Corporate Services Committee last week, Mr Wells claimed that a large number of residents living around Main Street are being wakened in the early hours of the morning by drunken youths hanging about the shops.He also pointed out that a large number of violent incidents occur in the early hours outside takeaways in the town.Mr Wells said he received complaints from an  year-old woman living close to a takeaway, who is left terried by drunken shouting at around am on a Saturday and Sunday morning.ldquoI really think it would be a good idea to consider closing these places at midnight. Once people leave the bars they then head over to the takeaways where they hang out until around .am.ldquoEveryone is usually very drunk and I believe this is leading to a lot of the sectarian trouble in the town. It is completely unfair to any residents living close by who are trying to sleep and are kept awake by drunk people hanging around the streets, he said.SEAFORDE mdash A mother of five feels she has no choice to to move house following plans to erect a telecommunications mast at Seaforde.Siobhan Devlin recently moved into her home at Dunnanew Road and was horried to discover that a number of mobile telephone companies are planning to extend an existing mast close to her house to accommodate  new antennae.She is so concerned about the effects the mast could boast to her childrenrsquos health she is seriously considering selling her newly build dream house.Accusing mobile phone companies of being completely undemocratic by putting masts up against the wishes of the local community, she said she cannot understand why a decision was taken to extend a mast so close to a large number of houses.The Seaforde community is overwhelmingly behind Siobhan and a group of parents, concerned for the health of their children, have written a letter to planners demanding the development is stopped.She said: ldquoEveryone is completely shocked that such a major proposal has ben put to planners so close to our homes. A large area of residential land will be affectedthis plan goes ahead and nobody is happy about it.ldquoWe feel that we are being used as guinea pigs as nobody can tell us they are  per cent sure that these masts do not pose any health risks.ldquoDo planners honestly believe that residents, especially those with young children, will accept this proposal  If the plan goes ahead I really think I will have to move as I do not want my children living so close to that mast.KILLOUGH mdash Plans for the regeneration of Killough were put before Down councillors at a meeting on Monday night.Representatives from the Palatine Trust met with members of the councilrsquos recreation and technical services committee to give an update on how the regeneration work in the village is developing and discussed future plans for the area.The council has funded pound, towards the refurbishment of the harbour area since the trust was first set up in .

It is right that the public have a chance to see the report and have their say, and today’s publication will allow them to do that.”The deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The FICT report examines a number of sensitive issues across our community. Addressing these issues is an important part of moving our shared society forward and I put on record my thanks to the Commission for their efforts in undertaking this challenging work.”The working group led by Junior Minister Middleton and Junior Minister Kearney, which was established to consider issues in relation to the report, will continue to meet.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

We got agreement through all the political parties on these issues.”On the failure of Stormont’s Executive Office to publish the report until now, Dr Bryan said: “I can’t speak for why the Executive Office haven’t been able to get it through but there are quite a lot of complexities going on here around the cultural area — including two new language commissions being set up, the setting up of an office of identity and cultural expression which was in the new deal new approach, and all of this stuff has been going forward.“And all of this is in the mix so, in fairness to them [the Executive Office], there are quite a lot of complexities into how you move this forward.”Dr Bryan also said the report had sought to find ways to enable, rather than restrict, “cultural practice”.“If you look at bonfires, for example, they are surrounded by a whole lot of legislation which is really nothing to do with the celebrations and commemorations which bonfires are part of,” he said. “And they sort of get in the way.“So this report is starting to look at the legislative areas and we are suggesting ways that will enable cultural practice.“We haven’t set out in this to stop anybody doing anything. Actually, contrary to that, we look at ways people can be enabled to do things within the law.”He said there was “less progress” on the topic of flags in public areas.Dr Bryan added: “With the flags on public buildings, that is the one area of all of our chapters where I think we got less progress and I think we are all disappointed at that.”Justice Minister Naomi Long has accused Stormont’s Executive Office of a “complete failure of leadership” for failing to “drive forward” progress on the report.The Alliance Party leader, speaking to BBC Radio Ulster, criticised the absence of a plan to put the report’s proposals into practice.She said the long awaited report had now been “abandoned”.She also slammed the long delay in publishing the report, which was given to the Executive “nearly two years ago”.“I think it’s absolutely scandalous that £, was spent on a report that we have had to wait almost two years to see,” she said. “We were told it would be published with an implementation plan.”She continued: “I’ve been writing to the Executive Office and my party’s had a debate in the Assembly on this in March, asking that it be published with an implementation plan so that we could start to take up some of those themes, and where there wasn’t agreement try to find agreement and where there was agreement try to implement it.“Instead, it’s now just being orphaned with nobody taking responsibility for it, which I think is absolutely scandalous.”The minister added: “These are issues that affect people’s everyday lives - bonfires, flags, paramilitary trappings on buildings, all of those things that people are constantly concerned about and raise with us regularly. Instead of taking political leadership and trying to drive a programme of work to address them, this is now simply being abandoned.“Unfortunately, I did say at the time of the Haas talks that that might well be the outcome which was one of the reasons we were very lukewarm on the outcome of those talks.”On whether the report’s findings would be put into practice by the devolved administration, she said: “It certainly doesn’t seem to be going to be implemented by the Executive Office.“We will seek to try to drive forward some progress where we can on that report as a party.“But obviously it should be being done on a cross-departmental basis, and it should be driven forward by the Executive Office. It’s a complete failure of leadership on their part.”South Belfast DUP MLA and lead member on the Executive Office Committee Christopher Stalford welcomed the publication of the report.Flags, Identity, Culture and Tradition Report.“The public should now give its views,” he said.“The answer on these matters is mutual respect but it is hard to come by when Sinn Fein campaigns to remove every trace of Britishness from Northern Ireland. “Sinn Fein in  denied unionist MLAs the opportunity to mark Northern Ireland’s centenary by laying a simple stone or planting a rose bush in Stormont. Sinn Fein snub the Royal Family. Unable to even mark the Duke of Edinburgh’s passing in the same way as other counties.“Such cultural and identity weaponization will make solutions very dficult to come by as some want cultural domination rather than respect.“We are complex society drawn mainly from the British Isles. A mix of Irish, English, Welsh and Scots. Some of us are British, some are Irish, some are Northern Irish and there are new and emerging identities.“I will always defend the dignied display of the flag of my country but I will never make excuses for the display of anything that could be associated with a paramilitary organisation. I will always promote the celebration of culture but I will never support anything which glories terrorism or promotes violence. I trust every Party will arrive at a similar position.”Loyalist activist Jamie Bryson said loyalists should be very attentive to the ultimate outworking of any regulation. “It is not about enhancing culture, it is about strangling it- slowly but decisively- via carefully constructed regulatory architecture which is superficially attractive, and often buttressed with financial incentives, but which is ultimately culturally corrosive,” he said.“The purpose of all of these things is to neutralise, and by extension diminish, PUL culture and traditions. The ‘process’ requires the incremental dismantling of the Union, and a key part of that is stage by stage watering down expressions of British and Unionist culture and sovereignty. “This is never more evident than in the FICT proposal for a civic flag. This requires unionism accepting that the sovereign flag of the United Kingdom should not fly, and instead should be replaced by a neutral flag. That of course therefore means further dilution of visible manestations of our sovereignty. “If the  Agreement was a settlement rather than a process, then that settlement should respect the primacy of sovereignty and expressions of same. “The way forward on flags and bonfires in voluntary regulation schemes whereby loyalist communities would self regulate. Any engagement with statutory schemes, in the context of the cultural war whereby statutory bodies are often nationalist soldiers in that battle, would be foolish and self defeating. “You can not regulate culture. I should say however that the proposals for education in terms of Human Rights and the Law is a valuable proposal. PUL communities have been frozen out of the legal arena, and there is a signicant disconnect. In contrast, nationalist communities have very successfully weaponised the law to advance their political objectives. Unionists and loyalists must build the capacity to engage in this kind of lawfare, rather than being confined to the sidelines.”Read the full report here.MORE NEWS:When is Spoty wrapped  How to find your data and who is expected to be the most streamed artist of  A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

And we need vaccines to get into the arms of all of those who are at risk in every single country, not just in some countries, and not adding more vaccines to people who are already protected, but getting that first and second dose to those iniduals who are at risk in all countries.ldquoAnd this is really important that this is crystal clear today because there is still a lot of uncertainty around Omicron, and this data will come in and there are scientists around the world that are studying this.ldquoBut therersquos no indication to suggest that the vaccines wonrsquot work. Eventhere is a reduction in efficacy, itrsquos still better to have the vaccine because it will save your le, she said at a press briefing.Meanwhile, the global health experts said there is a lack of evidence to support offering Covid- booster jabs to an entire population.The remarks from the WHO come after the UK Government set the challenge for the NHS to offer boosters to all adults in just  days.The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationadvised on Monday that the booster programme should be extended to include all adults amid concerns about the Omicron iant ndash making  million more people eligible for a booster shot.But doubt has been cast on the benefits of offering these booster jabs to healthy iniduals.Dr Mike Ryan, executive director of WHOrsquos health emergencies programme, said he is not aware of any evidence that would suggest offering booster jabs to the entire population gives any greater protection to healthy people.Asked about the acceleration of the UKrsquos booster programme, he told the press briefing: ldquoThe primary objective, I think of all governments, now must be, in the face of Delta and Omicron and others, is to ensure that all vulnerable iniduals, people of older age, people with underlying conditions, are immediately offered the vaccine to ensure that everyone has had at least a primary course of vaccine. vw,vw,px, px\"ldquoThere are others here who can better answer than me regarding the benefits of a booster regarding other iants, but right now there is no evidence that Irsquom aware of that would suggest that boosting the entire population is going to necessarily provide any greater protection for otherwise healthy iniduals against hospitalisation or death.ldquoThe real risk of severe disease, hospitalisation, and death lies in particularly at risk and vulnerable iniduals who do require protection against all iants of Covid-.He said having excess amounts of vaccine and deciding what to do with it is not a problem being faced by many countries around the world who are struggling to get even one jab to their most vulnerable.Dr Soumya Swaminathan, WHOrsquos chief scientist, said the focus should be on people who have not yet received a first jab, rather than on giving booster jabs.Speaking at the press conference, she said: ldquoI just want to reiterate what was just said, that our goal should be really to protect those who have not yet received their primary cause of vaccination.ldquoAnd this is true in all countries.She added: ldquoSome countries are doing, as a precautionary principle, providing additional doses to people because they have adequate supplies, and theyrsquore just doing it.ldquoThere isnrsquot a whole lot of evidence that everybody over the age of , or for that matter above any age, is going to benefit from this.ldquoSo what we really need is the data to come in from many countries using dferent vaccines, dferent demographics, dferent populations, and coverage, and also dferent iants at dferent times during the year to have a comprehensive view on when boosters are going to be needed, which subgroups of people theyrsquore going to be most useful and which vaccines should indeed be used.Boris Johnson said all adults will be offered a booster by the end of January.Experts have said the expansion of the vaccine booster programme poses a ldquohuge logistical challenge for the NHS..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: WHO experts expect details of Omicron transmission  uwithin days u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
