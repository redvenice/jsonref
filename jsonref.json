Kugler opens his door and comes face to face with Silberbauer. ‘Who owns this building?’ he yells.‘We just rent it,’ Kugler replies. ‘Stop playing games with me! Who’s the boss here?’‘I am,’ Kugler says calmly. Miep hides her illegal ration cards and money she used to buy groceries.10.55amKugler is opening filing cabinets for Silberbauer. He finds nothing incriminating, but asks to see the other rooms in the building.Kugler takes him on a tour of the first floor, including the lavatory and kitchen. ‘Outwardly I showed great calm, but inwardly I was terrified,’ he later recalled.Upstairs in the annexe, Otto Frank hears a noise, but thinks nothing of it. He carries on with Peter’s English lesson.11.10amSilberbauer demands to be taken to the second floor. With a gun inches from his back, Kugler leads him up the staircase and into the first of three storerooms.The three Dutch henchmen wait outside. Silberbauer paces up and down, his heavy boots loud on the wooden floor. He wants to know if there are hidden weapons and orders Kugler to open the crates, sacks and barrels.Downstairs Miep hears her husband Jan arriving to collect his packed lunch as usual. She leaps up and grabs him by the arm before he can come into the office.‘Jan, it’s wrong here,’ she says, handing him his lunch, the illegal ration cards and money. Miep gives him a little push. ‘Jan understood me completely and disappeared,’ she said years later.11.40amThe storerooms have revealed nothing but Silberbauer wants to see the rear of the building and the two men walk onto a landing. In front of them is a bookcase with shelves holding grey box files. The bookcase conceals the door to the annexe — Kugler’s idea.‘My heart was in my mouth. We had come to the crucial place,’ he later said.To his dismay, the Gestapo men start trying to move it. He now realises they have been betrayed. ‘The moment I had been dreading for two years had arrived.’         In March 1945, Anne and Margot contracted typhus at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp and never recovered. It was Lin and Janny who carried their emaciated bodies to a mass grave in the camp. A few weeks later, Bergen-Belsen was liberated by the BritishThe Gestapo find the hook to unfasten the bookcase and it swings open, revealing a grey door.‘No one would ever guess that there could be so many rooms hidden behind that plain grey door,’ Anne had written.Kugler hesitates, but is pushed through the door from behind. He walks up a narrow set of stairs and into the Franks’ room. Its walls are covered in old peeling yellow wallpaper and sitting motionless at a table is Anne’s mother, Edith.Kugler’s mouth is so dry, all he can whisper is: ‘Gestapo!’ Edith doesn’t move even when a man with a pistol appears from behind him.‘Hands up!’ the man shouts. Edith had dreamed of emigrating to the United States, just like her two brothers did before the war. That dream is over.Another Gestapo agent brings in Anne and Margot, who walk over to stand next to their mother with their hands over their heads.Above them in Peter’s room, Otto is checking the results of his pupil’s dictation and saying: ‘In English “double” is spelled with only one “b”!’ when suddenly they hear the sound of running feet.Otto stands indignantly — none of them should be making such a loud noise at this time of day. The door opens an armed man stands there. Peter and Otto put their hands up and the man orders them to walk downstairs.‘When the Gestapo came in with their guns, that was the end of everything,’ Otto later said.11.55amVictor Kugler and all the inhabitants of the secret annexe are gathered in the Franks’ bedroom with their hands in the air. Margot is crying quietly.Standing in the middle of the room is Silberbauer, studying their faces. ‘Where is your money?’ he snaps. ‘Where are your valuables? Come on, come on, we don’t have all day!’Otto points towards a cupboard and Silberbauer walks over and drags out the Franks’ wooden chest. He spots Otto’s briefcase that contains Anne’s diaries and tips them on the floor, putting the chest’s contents into the briefcase.Anne looks on, not saying a word. ‘Perhaps she had a premonition all was lost now,’ said her father.Silberbauer is irritated by how calm they all are. ‘Get ready! Everyone must be back here in five minutes!’MiddayThe eight have backpacks full of clothes already packed in case of an emergency.Anne calls hers ‘my escape bag’, and during night-time Allied air raids she would hug it for comfort she goes next door to her bedroom to collect it. Victor Kugler can see fear on their faces.As Otto takes his backpack from a hook on the bedroom wall, Silberbauer notices a large grey trunk on the floor by the window with ‘Reserve Lieutenant, Otto Frank’ stencilled on the lid.‘Where did you get this?’ he demands. ‘It belongs to me. I was a reserve officer in the First World War,’ Otto replies.Silberbauer, outranked by his prisoner, blushes. ‘But why didn’t you register as a veteran? They certainly would have taken that into consideration, man! You would have been sent to Theresienstadt.’Silberbauer believes the Nazi propaganda that Theresienstadt is a refuge for Jewish veterans and the elderly, when in reality it is a concentration camp.Otto remains silent and Silberbauer quickly changes the subject. ‘How long have you been hiding here?’ he asks.‘Two years and one month,’ Otto replies.The Gestapo officer shakes his head in disbelief, so Otto points to the pencil marks on the wallpaper that show how far Margot and Anne have grown since July 1942.Convinced, Silberbauer says: ‘All right. Get your things together. Take your time.’12.05pmOne of the Gestapo men is in Miep Gies’ office phoning for a truck. Silberbauer walks in and stands over Miep.‘Now it’s your turn,’ he says threateningly. Miep stands to face him. ‘You’re Viennese. I’m from Vienna, too,’ she says.Silberbauer is taken aback for a moment, then demands to see her ID card, which she hands over.In a rage he throws it back. ‘Aren’t you ashamed that you’re helping Jewish garbage?’He calls her a traitor and threatens terrible punishments. Miep stands as tall as she can. Silberbauer calms down and says she can stay put, but if she runs away they will arrest her husband Jan.Miep can’t stop herself saying: ‘You keep your hands off my husband! This is my business. He doesn’t know anything about it.’Silberbauer says he knows Jan is involved, but lets Miep go. ‘She was such a nice girl,’ he said later.12.30pmThe truck pulls up close to the doorway of 263 Prinsengracht.12.45pmFritz Pfeffer, the Franks and van Pels are brought down one by one. Silberbauer tells Kugler and Kleiman they, too, are under arrest. As Kugler walks past foreman Willem van Maaren, he wonders if he is the one who betrayed them. A small crowd has gathered. Clutching her backpack, Anne steps into the sunlight for the first time in over two years. She knows her fate. Jews are sent to camps and murdered.‘The English radio speaks of their being gassed,’ she wrote. ‘Perhaps that it is the quickest way to die.’The door of the truck is slammed shut behind her.1pmThe truck and a police car carrying the prisoners arrive at Gestapo HQ — a former school. On the journey, none of them said a word. They are locked in a room.Otto apologises to Kleiman, who interrupts him, saying: ‘Don’t give it another thought. I wouldn’t have done it any differently.’5pmMiep and husband Jan stand in the annexe. All the rooms have been turned upside down.On the floor of Otto and Edith’s room, Miep spots Anne’s precious red-and-white checked diary and exercise books and scoops them up.Jan has found some library books that need returning, plus Pfeffer’s Spanish books. As they pass the bathroom Miep sees Anne’s beige shawl and brings it with her.Miep locks the door and takes Anne’s belongings to her office and puts them in her desk bottom drawer. She hopes one day Anne will return to retrieve them.ConclusionThree days later at Centraal Station, two sisters named Lin and Janny Brilleslijper, members of the Dutch resistance about to be taken to a transit camp, spotted the Frank family on the platform.‘A very worried father and a nervous mother and two children wearing sports-type clothes and backpacks . . . all these people had a sort of silent melancholy about them,’ she remembered.All four men from the annexe ended up in the same barracks in Auschwitz Peter looked after the older men as best he could. Only Otto survived.His wife Edith died in Auschwitz in January 1945 and it is thought Auguste van Pels perished on a transport the following month.Peter was moved to a labour camp, where he fell ill. Five days after the camp was liberated by the Americans, he died. He was 18.In March 1945, Anne and Margot contracted typhus at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp and never recovered. It was Lin and Janny who carried their emaciated bodies to a mass grave in the camp. A few weeks later, Bergen-Belsen was liberated by the British.On the day Otto learned his daughters’ fate, Miep gave him Anne’s diary with the words: ‘Here is your daughter Anne’s legacy to you.’The grieving Otto left them unread for some time, but was eventually persuaded they were important testimony to the persecution so many suffered at the hands of the Nazis. He agreed to publish them.The Diary Of Anne Frank has since been translated into more than 70 languages and has sold more than 30 million copies.The building at 263 Prinsengracht was later saved from demolition by Otto, with the Anne Frank Foundation and funded by public donations. It opened as a museum in 1960 and still attracts more than one million visitors a year.SS officer Julius Dettmann committed suicide in July 1945 while awaiting trial in Amsterdam. The Simon Wiesenthal Center identified Karl Josef Silberbauer in 1958, but the Austrian authorities never charged him.

But a  investigation has uncovered serious doubts The federal government gave $8m of $20m earmarked to progress high-speed rail to a consortium led by a man who has no expertise in major infrastructure projects, who had been a bankrupt and who was once a National party candidate.The Consolidated Land and Rail Australia consortium, better known by its acronym Clara, is headed by Nick Cleary, a would-be property developer from the southern highlands of New South Wales.Cleary is a man with big dreams. Clara has sold bureaucrats and ministers on a vision so large it’s almost eye-watering: a high-speed rail network between Melbourne and Sydney that would open the way for not one but eight new cities, each between 200,0000 and 600,000 people, to be constructed along its route.They would rise from the paddocks over the next 50 years, taking the pressure off Sydney and Melbourne as workers moved to the regions, but still with access to highly paid jobs just an hour away by rail.Some of the new centres would be planned for the outskirts of existing regional towns, helping to revive their economies.“The policy on population has failed because we have failed to overcome the tyranny of distance,” Cleary says. “Between now and 2061 we are going to grow the population by 15 million. Our plan is to build cities at scale connected by high-speed rail.”Proponents say the “value uplift” of turning rural land into city and suburban blocks – generating billions for Clara – would more than cover the cost of the rail line, well north of $100bn, plus the estimated $5.5bn of infrastructure such as roads, water, waste services, schools and hospitals needed in each new city.It’s a vision to transform the settlement patterns of Australia entrenched for more than 200 years. And all to be achieved by the private sector, with only minimal government involvement.“How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time,” Cleary says.But can Clara deliver on the vision?The $8m given to Clara is for a business case for the first stage, a line between Melbourne and Shepparton, and two new cities at Nagambie and Shepparton. Clara’s plan, which at this stage does not specify a technology, says it can cut the travel time between Melbourne and Shepparton from three hours to just 32 minutes. Too good to be true?An investigation by the  has revealed that Clara has no office – its principal place of business, according to Asic records, is the office of its law firm, DLA Piper in Melbourne. It has just $422,000 in paid-up capital and so far has no major shareholders or directors with expertise in infrastructure projects, property development, construction or financing.Asic searches show a web of companies behind Clara, but the ultimate controlling shareholders are Cleary, his wife, Erin Cleary, and his assistant, Alexandra Johnson, who acts as Clara’s contact point.Cleary says there is a separate consortium agreement and “there are a number of firms that are funding us while we pass those milestones” of developing the business plan.He names the computer giant Cisco the Japanese industrial company Hitachi the urban planners Roberts Day and Clarke Hopkins Clarke the consultant PWC and DLA Piper.“There are 16 firms who have signed up to the Clara consortium,” Cleary says. “They are part of Clara to deliver a strategic vision. Our financing is coming from large-scale institutional money down the track. We have to go through those milestones.”He says a number of companies are providing in-kind support. DLA Piper acknowledged that the firm was doing work for Clara, but expressed surprise that it was listed as the consortium’s principal place of business.Cleary also says he has secured some of the crucial land around the sites of the first two new cities. “We have some land in our control around those locations. It’s around those areas, about 10km from Shepparton.”But Clara has also had some setbacks. When it launched in 2016, its advisory board included several high-profile former politicians including the former Victorian premier Steve Bracks, the former NSW premier Barry O’Farrell and the former federal trade minister Andrew Robb. Only Robb remains.Robb describes himself as an enthusiastic supporter. “I think there will be a level of surprise about the comprehensive nature of the business plan,” he told  Australia.“It doesn’t have to be all taxpayer dollars. Governments are increasingly using value creation as a source of funding. Hong Kong hasn’t spent any taxpayer funds on its underground. Instead it identifies where it will build stations and buys up the land, then builds the retail centres and apartments.”The Melbourne wealth management company Newhaven was also involved, but its principal, Jay Grant, who served as the consortium’s managing director, pulled out. So did some of the Americans Clara had approached, including a former US transport secretary, Ray LaHood. has also learned that many of the options Clara signed with landowners along the proposed route for the high-speed train have lapsed, leaving a bitter taste for farmers who were swept away by Cleary’s promises of cities rising from the paddocks.Rather than put the line though the centre of Shepparton, a move likely to lead to objections, Cleary’s plan involves finding the greenest of greenfield sites. He began securing land around the eight sites for proposed new cities in 2016. One is at Tallygaroopna, population 579, just north of Shepparton.The farmers who signed up with Cleary in 2017 thought they were on the cusp of a gold rush that would change their lives. But two years on Cleary has not been seen for months, and the options agreements have lapsed.Trevor Hosie, who has 120 hectares with “a few sheep and cattle and a bit of irrigation” says it was October or November when he last saw Cleary.Cleary and his offsider, Alex Johnson, brought teams of engineers and investors to visit the site, but last year the visits stopped, and no one in Tallygaroopna has seen Cleary for about eight months.“I signed an agreement but it was all their way,” Hosie says. “There was a three-month option, then another one, but then it ran out in October last year.” He had been promised nearly $3m for his farm.Greig Buckland, a dairy farmer, is particularly aggrieved. “We signed up to it in 2016,” Buckland says, having first spent money on lawyers. “He told me he’d let me know when it was going public and he did call me the day before it was in the media. He was on TV saying they would be turning the first sod in 2018. But 12 months went by and nothing. I could have sold the dairy farm in that 12 months.”He add: “He had our hopes right up there. I have tried ringing him many times but got nowhere.”Other farmers, including Neville Moss of Glenara Angus Stud, were sceptical. Moss says he told Cleary: “I’ll sign when you hand over the money to one of the others.” He is still waiting.Around Nagambie it’s a similar story. Philip Deane, 65, signed up to sell his land, 8km north-east of the town. He went to the launch at RMIT and was excited by the vision outlined by Cleary and his associates, but especially by the $20m Cleary was offering for his farm.But the option has now lapsed, along with Deane’s dreams of a comfortable retirement. His son, Wesley, has come back to run the farm.Cleary insists he still has options on land earmarked for the eight cities.Cleary’s background seems to have passed the Department of Infrastructure by when it funded him.Around the southern highlands, memories of Cleary’s plan for developing dairy farms, his own included, are still raw. Several families lost money.Asic records show that the agricultural finance company CNH Capital filed to place him in bankruptcy in May 2010. Cleary sought to discharge the bankruptcy a year later but failed to provide written information about his property and income. He was discharged from bankruptcy in June 2013.In an excruciating session of Senate estimates last year the deputy secretary of the then Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities, Luke Yeaman, and the head of rail policy, Andrew Hyles, were forced to admit they were not aware of Cleary’s bankruptcy or that Clara had just $422,700 in capitalisation.“We fundamentally assess the proposed project that was put in front of us by the company on the basis of the criteria that were in front of us,” Yeaman said. “We didn’t go through a detailed assessment of the company’s history,” he said under questioning from the Labor senator Murray Watt.Watt then played his ace. “Was the department aware that Mr Cleary is a longtime member of the National party, and that at one time he was even a vice-chairman of the New South Wales Nationals?”Hyles said there were a range of partners with the company and that these were “international firms”. “They’re supporting Clara with their own in-kind contributions towards the work of building up this business case,” he said.He said he was aware of Clara securing land options. “We have not gone and assessed that ourselves at this stage,” Hyles said.Who the responsible minister was when Clara was chosen as frontrunner to build the most important infrastructure project of this century is less easy to say.Responsibility for fast rail is shared between the minister for infrastructure and transport and the minister responsible for cities – and the people occupying both jobs have changed regularly.Angus Taylor, who hails from Goulburn, has been an advocate for the Sydney-to-Melbourne fast rail, as it would go through his electorate. He was minister for cities at the time of the first call for submissions, which yielded 26 proposals, and he was still the minister during the process to whittle it down to a field of 13 which went on to stage two. The transport minister was Darren Chester, a National.But soon after the stage two bids were submitted in late November 2017, both portfolios changed. Barnaby Joyce became transport minister and Paul Fletcher became cities minister on 20 December.By February 2018 Joyce was dealing with more personal crises: revelations of his affair with his staffer Vikki Campion had come to light, costing him his marriage, the deputy prime minister’s job and his portfolio.Campion by this time was working in the office of the Victorian Nationals MP Damien Drum, whose seat covers Shepparton and Tallygaroopna.By the time the winners were announced on 9 March 2018, the new Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, was transport minister, while Fletcher remained cities minister.“The whole assessment was considered by cabinet,” Hyles told estimates. He said the three selected after stage two were top of the list the department recommended.Clara and the other two successful groups that shared the $20m are due to hand their business cases to the government imminently.The other two projects are more conventional and involve state governments and the private sector. They are an upgrade to the line between Sydney and Newcastle, proposed by the NSW government, and a proposal for faster rail between Brisbane and Nambour proposed by North Coast Connect, a consortium involving the property developer Stockland, the engineering firm SMEC and urban planners Urbis. The Queensland government is giving in-kind support.Whether Clara will again impress the bureaucrats with its bold plan remains to be seen. Theoretically, the value uplift model does not depend on government funding. But government support, both state and federal, would be essential to realise a 50-year plan crossing state boundaries.The government has left itself an exit strategy with Clara.“The Australian Government funding contribution to the Clara proposal is up to $8,000,000,” its fact sheets on high-speed rail say. “However, it should be noted that financial support for the development of a business case does not indicate Australian Government support for delivery of a project.”The question is: would such a move set high-speed rail back another decade or more?• Next: How faster rail could change our cities"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98483fcfb48d174f14f69402e894fe20b5d0ce7c/322_397_3159_1895/master/3159.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9fb6820bbb4b5d20bb11625c25650de","title":"hargreaves lansdown faces questions over neil woodford fund","story":"Firm, which reports results this week, recommended fund until block on withdrawals in JuneHargreaves Lansdown will face questions about its backing for Neil Woodford’s stricken flagship fund when the investment group reports its annual results on Thursday.The company has been in the spotlight for continuing to recommend Woodford’s equity income fund until he blocked withdrawals on 3 June. The suspension of the fund affected more than 290,000 Hargreaves customers, about a quarter of the company’s investors, with savings likely to be trapped for six months.Hargreaves will report results after a bad week for Woodford, the former star fund manager and favourite of retail investors. The equity income fund’s administrator said it would probably take until early December for the fund to reopen as Woodford disposes of difficult-to-sell stakes.Woodford was also revealed to have sold more than half his shares in a separate publicly traded fund whose board is considering sacking him as the asset manager.Chris Hill, Hargreaves’s chief executive, issued an apology to his customers a few days after the fund’s suspension. “We all share their disappointment and frustration,” he said. Hill has also offered to forgo a bonus of as much as £2.1m until the matter is resolved and has waived Hargreaves’s fees for Woodford investors.Hargreaves’s results will be the first time the company has commented about the impact of the Woodford affair on its business and reputation. Hill has answered written questions from the Treasury committee but these concentrated on his company’s dealings with Woodford and how it decides which funds to recommend.Gurjit Kambo, an analyst at JP Morgan Cazenove, said in a note to clients that customer deposits of funds into Hargreaves were likely to be affected by the Woodford debacle.“With investors in Woodford’s equity income fund still gated, and the relationship between Woodford funds and Hargreaves Lansdown under increased scrutiny, we have reduced our inflow estimates,” Kambo said. He cut his estimates for new funds for 2020 to £5bn from £7.9bn and to £5.5bn from £9bn the year after.Other analysts, such as the team at Deutsche Bank, have argued that the shares have fallen enough to take account of the dent to Hargreaves’s reputation from the Woodford saga.Woodford blocked withdrawals from the equity income fund because he was unable to sell assets quickly enough to meet investors’ demand for their money back. The value of the fund has fallen from more than £10bn at its peak to £3.5bn because of withdrawals and poor performance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/114e7ce03b6c5e6ffad8c404be303e250ce77373/0_132_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c5c8f46ad561eb2457ad254d0c8a7a7","title":"hsbc boss john flint resigns by mutual agreement","story":"HSBC chief executive John Flint has stepped down after the bank said it believed a change was needed “to meet the challenges” it faces.The bank said in a statement that Flint, 51, had resigned the role “by mutual agreement with the board”, saying the bank needed a change at the top to address “a challenging global environment.”He was promoted to CEO in February 2018 and has worked at the banking giant for 30 years.“Although not carrying out his day-to-day duties after today, he remains available to assist HSBC with the transition,” the bank added.Noel Quinn, 57, who has been the head of HSBC’s global commercial banking unit since 2015, will be the interim chief executive until a successor is appointed.HSBC’s chairman, Mark Tucker, said: “On behalf of the board, I would like to thank John for his personal commitment, dedication and the significant contribution that he has made over his long career at the bank.“Today’s positive interim results particularly reflect John’s achievements as group chief executive.”Tucker said that although HSBC “is in a strong position to deliver on its strategy”, a change of chief executive was necessary.“In the increasingly complex and challenging global environment in which the bank operates, the board believes a change is needed to meet the challenges that we face and to capture the very significant opportunities before us,” he said.Flint said it had been a privilege to spend his “entire career with HSBC” and that he was “proud of what we achieved together”.“I have agreed with the board that today’s good interim results indicate that this is the right time for change, both for me and the bank.“After almost 30 years with HSBC, I will be sad to leave but I do so looking forward to a new personal challenge, and confident that our people will continue to serve the bank’s stakeholders in the best possible way.”External candidates will be considered in the search for a new chief executive, the company said.

Such charges are “eroding the value of iniduals’ savings,” they said.Using the example of one pension fund which first reported it had £10m in management costs before being forced to revise the figure to £92m, MPs have said that many schemes are not aware of their costs.The inquiry also found that of the Financial Conduct Authority’s staff of 3,700, the scams team consisted of around only 10 people.The report calls for the government to bring forward legislation obliging funds to disclose the cost of investment in a uniform template. Frank Field, the independent MP who chairs the committee, said: “Ripping off pension savers could be eliminated.”It said the government should also publish a timetable by the end of this year for the roll-out of a non-commercial pensions dashboard.Lady Ros Altmann, a former pensions minister, compared the industry as it stands to “shoppers going into a supermarket and seeing similar-looking products on the shelves, but the prices are hidden”.“Displaying prices clearly for customers should be one of the most basic elements of a product sale, yet in pensions it seems to be an ‘optional extra’,” she said.The committee said it is important for trustees and others managing pension schemes to demonstrate whether or not they are delivering value for money in a way which can be compared across the industry and is accessible to the scheme members.Calls to make the cost of pension investment more transparent come after the inquiry found “worrying evidence” that some trustees are making investment decisions without a clear understanding of the costs.A previous report on the British Steel pension scheme found that members were “shamelessly bamboozled” by advisers and unregulated introducers into signing up to ongoing adviser fees, unsuitable pension products and investments, characterised by high investment risk, high management charges and punitive exit fees.A Department of Work and Pensions spokesman said: “We have taken decisive action to limit charges and make the costs of saving into a pension more transparent.“We’re backing pension dashboards and expect the first models to be ready for testing later this year.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f001e31b173d20e5c75b2e8135da21f8611e1ed2/0_71_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9df2deb63fa0f2653590dd2cca11c515","title":"what induces men to imitate the christchurch massacre","story":"After Christchurch and El Paso we need an open discussion – without euphemisms and evasions – about what fascism is and how it works“In general, I support the Christchurch shooter and his manifesto.”That’s how the man accused of shooting at least 20 people in a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, began the document he posted on 8chan.The atrocity comes in the wake of a murderous attack on the Chabad of Poway synagogue in California on 27 April. The man detained for that crime also posted a manifesto to 8chan and also described the Christchurch shooter as a catalyst, saying: “‘He showed me that it could be done.”What might induce people to imitate the Christchurch massacre, an atrocity in which a self-identified fascist allegedly murdered 51 innocents in cold blood?To answer that question, we must grasp the historical evolution of fascism in the 21st century.The ongoing War on Terror normalised an anti-Muslim rhetoric that replicated, almost exactly, all the traditional tropes of antisemitism.Yet, in the English-speaking world, the main beneficiaries of the new racism were not fascists but rightwing populists.A new generation of politicians, parties and media personalities openly embraced xenophobia and Islamophobia but, for the most part, they eschewed the culture of violence associated with genuine fascists.Racist populists denounced the “elite” for facilitating immigration. They didn’t, however, call for that elite to be executed, nor did they build paramilitary forces to physically attack those they deemed “traitors”.Fascism grew online rather than in the real world, with neo-Nazis and white supremacists finding an audience on sites like 4chan (and later 8chan). The distinctive online troll culture allowed rants about Hitler, gas chambers and death squads to circulate widely disguised as edgy “humour”.The election of Donald Trump, a man associated with racist populism, encouraged some fascists to move from online propaganda to real-world activism. In the United States, their efforts culminated in the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville in 2017, the event at which the anti-racist activist Heather Heyer was murdered.After Charlottesville, however, most of the fascist organisations fell apart: in part because of scrutiny from authorities and the media, but mostly because of the consistent counter-protests by anti-fascists.The Christchurch perpetrator planned his attack as a response to that defeat, and the similar decline of the Australian fascist grouplets he admired.That’s crucial to understanding both his massacre and the killings inspired by it.He embraced terrorism precisely because terror attacks could be launched by isolated iniduals, people without organisational backing or any real political support.Anti-fascists might prevent white supremacists from holding marches or meetings. But it was much harder to stop an unknown terrorist from opening fire in a public place.The Christchurch killer made clear in his manifesto that his decision to murder Muslims was entirely tactical. He regarded all non-whites as “invaders” and chose Muslims simply because Islamophobia made them unpopular.In a sense, violence was an end in itself, a way to distinguish himself from racist populists who talked but didn’t act.It was on that basis that an Islamophobic attack could inspire the Poway shooter to shoot up a synagogue and the El Paso killer to target Hiics, as one form of racism blended into another.“My whole life I have been preparing for a future that currently doesn’t exist,” complains the alleged perpetrator of the Walmart massacre.The bleakness of his manifesto, a lament about the supposed consequences of immigration and automation, echoed the grim vision presented by the Christchurch shooter, who advocated a doctrine that he called “accelerationism”.Precisely because he didn’t believe the organised fascist right could grow in the short term, the perpetrator thought society doomed – and saw mass murder as a way of speeding up a destruction that was already coming.His manifesto was addressed not to the public as a whole but to readers of fascist-inflected sites like 8chan. That was why he studded his manifesto with memes – even including some on the livestream of the actual murders, so that online fascists would feel a sense of ownership for the killing.In that way he hoped to make his actions a source of fascination for damaged people whose obsession with race theory cloaked a prevailing sense of their own inadequacy and failure.In America in particular, gun massacres have become a cultural phenomenon by which men vent all kinds of frustrations – the subsequent shooting in Ohio marked the 252nd such killing in the US in 2019 alone.The Christchurch killer sought to politicise the familiar script associated with such events.To the young men on 8chan, he presented gun massacre both as a political tactic and as a form of personal redemption – a way for socially awkward misfits to transform themselves into fascist supermen.As many commentators noted, the video of the Christchurch massacre looked like a computer game. The message for other online fascists who watched the awful footage was that, by opening fire on perceived enemies, they too could become the main player and not an non-player character – even if only for a moment.That perception was accentuated by the culture on 8chan, where self-identified Nazis discussed each new gun massacre like connoisseurs, debating the weapons tactics used and tallying up “scores” of victims.“It’s safe to say he is ‘our guy’,” said one poster in the hours after the El Paso killings.“Things ARE accelerating,” wrote another, “and attack are happening with increasing frequency. Hail our martyrs! Hail our heroes!”We can only prevent future massacres if we understand the threat we face. To that end, we need an open discussion – without euphemisms and evasions – about what fascism is and how it works.We need to distinguish genuine fascism, an ideology of violence centred on the extermination of opponents, from the rightwing populism of Trump and Fox News and Pauline Hanson.But we also need to recognise that the normalisation of racism – by populists and others – makes the work of fascists easier.When, for instance, Andrew Bolt says that “immigration is becoming colonisation”, his discussion of the proportion of Muslims in Lakemba and the number of Jews in North Caulfield doesn’t culminate in a call for immigrants to be killed.Bolt is not a fascist, but his work does help popularise the “Great Replacement” theory associated with all the recent fascist terrorists, as well as providing a context in which violence against supposed “colonisers” can seem necessary.With Donald Trump demonising American anti-fascists, it’s also important to recognise the importance of the protests that, after 2017, did so much to drive fascists off the streets.We need more of that sentiment, not less – and we need to take it online, so as to confront the radicalisation taking place on the internet.Most of all, we need, as a matter of urgency, to develop a positive political vision for the future.In their manifestoes, both the Christchurch killer and the man arrested in El Paso wrote about climate change, blaming immigrants for environmental destruction.At one level, the doctrine that the Christchurch perpetrator called “ecofascism” is obviously ridiculous. Global warming is, as the name suggests, a planetary problem: it can’t be solved by borders.But the widespread despair about a seemingly unstoppable environmental catastrophe allows fascist accelerationism to get a hearing. If the world’s fated to burn, the notion of fanning the flames – or, indeed, becoming the fire yourself – will always find adherents.That’s why, to counter fascist violence, we need to offer a better future, not simply more of the status quo. Confronted with the politics of hate, it’s all the more necessary to set a course on hope."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff20197396c336a011af6b4659112515160b835e/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026amp;s=8797ab4b9bb59ea8f465460cb0a4674c","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of shimmer","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘shimmer’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘shimmer’.Share your photos of what shimmer means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 7 August at 10am.

Speaking during its opening weekend, Fergus Linehan, who has been its director since 2015, said many performers had refused to be paid in sterling.Linehan said organisers had taken the decision around November last year to hedge £1m – locking it into a particular exchange rate to protect against future fluctuations – to guarantee artists’ fees.The pound fell to its lowest level in 28 months on Tuesday as the government insisted it was prepared to leave the EU without a deal. Sterling hit a low of $1.2120 against the dollar, while also sliding against the euro, at one point hitting €1.0881.Linehan said that the unstable pound meant that staging the festival had become more expensive at a time when public funding for the event was being cut. “There is a cost attached to hedging and we’ve also got this very low currency level at the moment, which doesn’t seem to be going anywhere but down,” he said.Linehan said the inability to plan ahead because of Brexit uncertainty was “the opposite of cost effective”. He said: “I’m sure it’s much worse for people who are running car factories and but conversations around planning and where we should be going have just been in hiatus for what seems like forever.“Of course all of this pales into insignificance if we have a serious downturn in the economy. The real worry is if this starts to bite into people’s day-to-day lives in terms of jobs.”This year’s festival, with its budget of just under £12m, opened with a performance from the Los Angeles Philharmonic, led by its conductor, Gustavo Dudamel. Highlights include a new version of Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring by Chinese choreographer Yang Liping and stage shows featuring Ian McKellen and Stephen Fry.“It just feels great to have this counterpoint in terms of people from all over the world coming in and working together,” said Linehan. “It feels more important than it’s ever felt. It feels like more than a great big shindig.”The Edinburgh international festival is not the only festival in Scotland’s capital to have suffered as a result of Brexit uncertainty. It was reported last week that the Edinburgh festival fringe was facing the loss of a $25m (£20m) five-year investment by the US circus company Spiegelworld.The company, one of Las Vegas’s biggest variety producers, is staging what was supposed to be the first of five annual productions created and premiered in Edinburgh, but its producers said they were considering relocating their European base to Berlin or Paris because of uncertainties relating to Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d27db2ed4dbdc2ca8591745ea053df89e9fce7b/0_300_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e881a855aa340d25a1e6f3d32072cb60","title":"only in canada weird and wonderful experiences countrywide","story":"Want to track down the mythical Ogopogo, ice-skate on the Atlantic Ocean or get your hands on a polar bear-shaped number plate?

We can thank Canadian institution Tim Hortons for the doughnut obsession. The shop, founded by the NHL defenseman of the same name, opened in 1964 and became a million-dollar-a-year franchise, outselling most (if not all) fast-food chains. If you’re feeling nostalgic, visit the original in Hamilton, Ontario or take a trip to independent doughnut chain, Donut Monster, also in the city, where yeast-risen rounds are topped with seasonal flavours.

Well then, listen up because we have a tale for you. Legend has it that Ogopogo inhabits Lake Okanagan in the BC interior. This creature has been described as a “giant snake” about 50 feet long, lurking in the dark expanse of the lake.

Not only can it lay claim to being the smallest in land area, but also in population of the three. The province, however, takes it in its stride, with the motto being “Parva sub ingenti” (The small under the protection of the great). There are few places more unusual than Basin Head provincial park, which is perhaps better known as Singing Sands, because the pure white sands do just that. Due to the high silica content, when heated by the sun, the sand produces a high-pitched squeaking sound when walked across – and endless fun.For a period of time, Canada suffered a shortage of coins. So, while they worked to produce more, playing cards were used as currencyIn the late 1600s, coins arriving from France were in short supply. This meant that as Canada worked hard to get more currency in, playing cards took the place of coins to keep the economy going. The Royal Canadian Mint made a nod to this in 2018 by releasing a special-edition coin set fashioned in the likeness of 17th-century playing cards.Fly WestJet to discover (and enjoy!) the weird and the wonderful things in Canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fd22a064e0a7bfffd96d16824125feb216aadf1/120_0_5655_3393/master/5655.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dc03729117a091f9565aec9e67ab0de","title":"hugh jackman shows the world the kind of australia we wish we were","story":"From self-deprecating jokes to tap-dancing to ACDC, The Man. The Music. The Show is two hours of joyous entertainment with an inclusive, heartfelt messageEarly into his show, Hugh Jackman tells us he always had a thing for numbers – he wasn’t good at sums, but numbers stuck firmly in his memory. His first home phone number. The license plate number of the family car from his childhood in Turramurra. Later, he says a figure so casually you might not register how staggering it is – 15,000: the number of audience members in Qudos Bank Arena for The Man. The Music. The Show, Hugh Jackman’s touring juggernaut.There are multiple, similarly attended dates in Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane. He has successfully lapped the UK already. In October he’ll play the United States and Mexico.Who are all these people going to see Hugh Jackman – a Sydney boy turned international movie star – sing and dance and chat for two affable hours? Even Jackman himself isn’t sure. Upfront, he pre-emptively forgives the audience members who’ll be checking their phones for updates on the cricket. He even promises us to tell us when he’s two songs from the end, just in case we’re the kind of people who like to leave early to beat the traffic.It’s easy to understand Jackman’s international appeal, with massive movies like The Greatest Showman and The X-Men franchise under his belt. But Australia seems to love him so fervently, this man out of time, singing Sinatra and tap-dancing to ACDC.Jackman is comfortable as himself. He dances freely and without cringe, even as he recreates the choreography from his turn as Gaston in Beauty and the Beast in 1996 at Melbourne’s Princess Theatre. He tells us his brother calling him a sissy prevented him from taking dance lessons he dances joyously now, secure in himself and his interests. The message is clear: follow your dreams, no matter what others might say.He shows himself as a loving husband and father – he descends into the audience to waltz with Deborra-Lee Furness, his wife of 23 years – but he immediately jokes about making all the other husbands look bad. He’s your mate. He plays piano onstage and immediately makes a self-deprecating joke about thinking he’s somehow qualified to play a piano at an arena show (with specific apologies to Billy Joel).He brings out two children’s choirs to sing You Will Be Found from Dear Evan Hansen, the reigning hit musical for sensitive teens, written by The Greatest Showman’s songwriters Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. He casually says the musical will be coming to Australia next year behind me, young women screamed in delight.And then Jackman begins the second act in character as Peter Allen, reprising his Tony award-winning turn as the Australian entertainer in The Boy From Oz. A woman is pulled from the audience to dance with him she clings in delight. Jackman shakes his hips and moves like Allen, a little queerness in every step. Later, he mugs in Wolverine poses, joking that the X-Men fans in the audience must have been suffering all night. He knows he pushes the boundaries of acceptable bloke behaviour he encourages you to let him.His audience is, typically, entranced. They cheer when the band plays the 20th Century Fox theme as Jackman describes his love for movie musicals. They even cheer at his take on Valjean’s Soliloquy and One Day More from Les Misérables. Jackman’s voice, which has always been more about charm and power than technique, serves him well in this enormous space. But when his special guest, The Greatest Showman’s Keala Settle, emerges to sing generic-outsider anthem This is Me, her stunning voice brings people around me to tears. Jackman made space for her to shine.Later in the second act, he gives the stage over to Walmatjarri and Bunuba blues singer Olive Knight who, with son Clifton Bieundurry and didgeridoo players Paul Boon and Nathan Mundraby, performs a number in Walmatjarri. After Jackman joins them for a rendition of Israel Kamakawiwo’ole’s Somewhere Over the Rainbow, he speaks movingly about living in “an increasingly ided world” and wanting to spread “the idea of reconciliation through art, through music, through culture”. He hands Knight the microphone to translate her words into English, so we do not miss them: “The land is crying for its people. The people are crying for the land. Do not be silent. Speak up for her.”The Man. The Music. The Show is a strange mix of earnest performance, a variety show for the heartfelt and easy-pushed buttons of popular entertainment. But popular entertainment is popular for a reason and it’s easy to get caught up in the spectacle.When I told my ride-share driver why I was going to the Qudos Bank Arena, he brightened. He loves Hugh Jackman like he loves former world No 1 tennis player Pat Rafter, he said, because “they show Australia’s face to the world”.Jackman, perhaps, shows the world who we wish we were: a nation that has attempted to heal the genocide and systemic racism that haunts and hurts us a nation where men don’t routinely and violently kill women a nation where gendered expectations are out the window. Where love and respect are the guiding tenets of our communities.And if that’s who we wish we were, maybe there’s hope for us yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1186039a31b6d053cd3f7e02cba4a3d214977b4c/0_210_3449_2069/master/3449.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4ac8ac061e312b2e84441fe3259add9","title":"manchester united juventus paulo dybala","story":"• Old Trafford club unable to agree terms with forward• Romelu Lukaku now unlikely to move the other wayManchester United are growing frustrated with their pursuit of Paulo Dybala, having failed to agree a deal with the Juventus forward regarding his salary, his image rights and any commission to his agent, Jorge Antun.With only four days to go before the Premier League transfer window closes, United feel they have made a very competitive offer but now expect to miss out on signing the 25-year-old Argentinian.United were hoping that they could sign Dybala as part of a swap deal in which Romelu Lukaku would join Juventus but the expected collapse of that proposal will lead to Inter renewing their interest in the Belgium forward. The Inter manager, Antonio Conte, remains confident the club will be able to sign Lukaku.Meanwhile, the failure of United and Dybala to agree a deal also means that the Premier League club will struggle to sign another of Juventus’s forwards, Mario Mandzukic. Juve saw a potential Dybala-Lukaku swap as an opening for the Croat to leave but if Lukaku does not join the club then they are unlikely to let Mandzukic depart.United will sign Harry Maguire once the defender passes a medical after agreeing an £80m fee with Leicester, to add to the £45m acquisition of Aaron Wan-Bissaka from Crystal Palace, but time is running out for reinforcements up front."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b933124848e968b1907339ad3294aaf397b375d/0_144_3705_2222/master/3705.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a642ffc5dd87e9d9893dd6c9b6da7d15","title":"tottenham dele alli hamstring injury","story":"Tottenham will begin the season without Dele Alli after he suffered another hamstring injury and his manager, Mauricio Pochettino, admitted he is worried about the England midfielder’s health.Alli has sustained damage to his left hamstring on four occasions in the past two years, including one strain that forced him out for 12 matches at the beginning of 2019.He was absent again for Spurs’ final preseason friendly against Antonio Conte’s Internazionale, which Tottenham lost on penalties. While Pochettino believes the injury is minor it will be “a few more weeks” before the 23‑year‑old player returns to training.Speaking more broadly about his squad at the start of the season he said: “We arrive in very good condition, though not ideal.” The transfer window closes on Thursday and whether Pochettino will add to his squad remains to be seen. Spurs’ club-record signing at £55m, Tanguy Ndombele, is the only new name Pochettino has at his disposal but, when asked about more players arriving, there was no repeat of the complaints made in Germany last week regarding a lack of involvement in transfer dealings.Spurs drew 1-1 over 90 minutes against Inter in an International Champions Cup match. Lucas Moura scored for Tottenham, making the most of a quick counterattack three minutes into the first half and powering a right-foot shot inside Samir Handanovic’s near post.Inter were slow to find their feet, despite the incessant promptings of Conte, the former Chelsea manager, but equalised in the 36th minute when the midfielder Stefano Sensi turned home an exquisite flick from the teenage striker Sebastiano Esposito.The best chance of the second half fell to Tottenham on the hour but Erik Lamela allowed Stefan de Vrij time to block his shot from 10 yards out. In general, Spurs struggled to make inroads against Inter’s back three, and the deluge of substitutions only disrupted play further.It was no surprise when the game went to penalties and Handanovic made the decisive intervention, saving the spot-kick of the young midfielder Oliver Skipp."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f418e210ae2b5d71f5cfbdd65d98b09266cdbe2/0_53_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0be99bbbe22b7f4f23396b837bc3ca3d","title":"manchester city liverpool rivalry community shield","story":"The Community Shield was sufficiently even for Liverpool to have won eventually and that is good news for the Premier LeagueIt is the Community Shield. Both sides were very obviously rusty. Both sides were slack in ways one would not expect them to be. Even the spray of shiny streamers to greet the winners felt understated, a little half-hearted. It is probably unwise to draw too many conclusions from a sultry August afternoon at Wembley but, if there is a lesson to be drawn, it is that last season may not be a blip, that there really may not be much between Manchester City and Liverpool.This has the potential to be one of the great rivalries, what Sunderland v Aston Villa was in the 1890s or Liverpool v Leeds in the late 1960s and early 70s or what Manchester United v Arsenal was around the turn of the millennium. These are two excellent sides – even if there was much that was not excellent here – and the jostling for honours is beginning to build an antipathy. There was even a brief spark in the buildup of the sort of mind games that were almost entirely absent last season as Jürgen Klopp chuntered about City’s spending. But if that rivalry is properly to develop, there is a need for Liverpool to win, to beat City either to the title or in a major final. Or even a minor final – or whatever the Community Shield is.In truth, other than bolstering Pep Guardiola’s trophy count City’s penalty shootout victory does not much matter. Far more significant is that this was a relatively even game, one in fact that Liverpool will feel they might have won in the second half. And that is good news for the Premier League and English football more generally because the alternative, frankly, is a troubling prospect.There is evidence that a dominant figure in inidual sports is attractive, that Tiger Woods added millions to the viewership of golf tournaments even in his days of overwhelming superiority, long before his fall and redemption. The evidence for team sports is less clear. Perhaps there is a constituency that simply wants to watch a team playing football extremely well, that does not care too much about the opposition and places no great value on how hard‑earned that virtuosity is. It is the logic that continues to sustain the Harlem Globetrotters.That, though, is entertainment while sport, as countless fans of Football League clubs were reminded on Saturday, is very often not entertainment. Struggle is integral to sport: excellence must be earned.And the problem for City is that they are so good – thanks to the intensity and brilliance of their manager, to a talented and well‑balanced squad assembled with extraordinary efficiency and, yes, to the vast resources of a foreign government with a dubious human rights record – that there have been times when it did not feel as though they were having to try especially hard, that the machine was so well‑conceived and constructed that it just bore down inevitably to victory, crushing all before it.There is something paradoxical in this, of course. Sheikh Mansour’s investment in the club in 2008 was an exercise in sportswashing, in familiarising a global audience with Abu Dhabi and making at least a proportion of them feel benignly disposed towards the emirate. But the better City have got, the more likely the prospect of a lengthy hegemony, the more troubling their ownership has come to seem. That came to a head in the FA Cup final and City’s 6-0 victory against Watford. For a mid‑table side who had had a decent season to be so comprehensively outplayed felt a desecration of one of football’s showpieces.There was a spell, just after Raheem Sterling had given City the lead following the sort of defending that had characterised Liverpool in the pre-Virgil van Dijk days of the season before last, when it seemed Guardiola’s side might be on course for another straightforward victory, one that might have suggested a gulf between the sides, the sort of superiority that might have dampened the belief of Klopp’s side before the real business had even begun.Liverpool, though, responded, found an equaliser and had the chances to have won, hitting the woodwork twice while Mohamed Salah squandered eight chances – a remarkable statistic given City on average ceded only 6.3 chances per game in the Premier League last season.City, equally, had the chances to win the match without recourse to a shootout but Sterling was demonstrating the sort of indecision that so often seems to afflict him when playing for England.Both sides, without question, will improve. Neither, surely, will be quite as open as this when the season begins for real. The sense of undercookedness about both sides will yield soon enough to fatigue. But the early sense, particularly if, as Klopp suggested, Liverpool were slightly less prepared than City, is that the champions will again have a proper race to run."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37766d4fc3dc8d074300cc7fe678993ad0dd0308/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba3a9ac08581f13e25beb449ca740cf7","title":"should i lend money to my financially frivolous boyfriend","story":"I am saving to buy a house, but he still wants me to help him out until payday.

Cues can be internal or external (for example, feeling hungry or making a cup of tea) and are most effective when encountered every day, including the weekend, to minimise daily planning and willpower. Good ones include getting up, and mealtimes. Narrow down what you want to do. “Don’t say something broad like, ‘I want to eat more fruit and vegetables’,” says Lally. “You need to have a specific plan to work out exactly when and how you’re going to do that” – for example, by having fruit and vegetables in the house. A behaviour is more likely to become habitual if it’s something you enjoy or find rewarding. Even if it’s something you think you’d rather not do, like exercise, “when you’ve done it you’re likely to be pleased with yourself”.“Make use of what we called ‘habit discontinuities’,” says Verplanken. These are the “moments when people go through life-course changes, such as moving house, starting a family or a relationship, orce, retirement or organisation changes”. These kind of events disrupt old habits, and allow you to create new ones. It’s why New Year’s resolutions tend to fail – your life, and old routines, are still the same on 2 January. But switching jobs or schools, or getting a pet, can become a catalyst for broader change.Lally’s research debunked the widespread assertion that forming a habit takes 21 days – she found the average was 66 days, with some people taking as much as 254 days (and some only 18). “We modelled the habit-formation curve, where it goes up in the first place and at some point reaches a level where it’s as habitual as it’s going to be, then plateaus – so my message from that is it’s very variable.” And don’t despair if you miss a day. “We don’t know how much you can miss and it still be OK, but definitely one occasion is not disastrous.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52813b453d497325507b0b09f6b572402bef1486/0_0_5538_3323/master/5538.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c68c69c52c322d45fbb416dd613e53bd","title":"how to say sorry and why you should stop saying it so much","story":"Sorry is the hardest word. When an apology is needed, keep it personal and to the pointIn Britain, we over-apologise out of politeness. That not only detracts from an apology when we do have something to be sorry for, but it can be seen as submission, especially in our professional lives.The classic example is at a social gathering or networking event. If you try to infiltrate a group by saying, “sorry to interrupt”, the first thing you have told people who do not know you is that you are apologetic and interrupting, which are not positive traits. Likewise, people responding to emails with “sorry for the delay in getting back to you” are alerting the recipient to the fact there was a delay. Instead, start by thanking the person for allowing you the time to come back to them.In terms of saying sorry when you have something to apologise for, it is better to do it succinctly: you can tell a sincere apology by the fact that it is short and to the point. Qualifying an apology generally means the apologiser does not fully mean it. Preferably, the apology should be face to face if that is not possible, then do it over the phone. If you have really annoyed someone and done the initial apology face-to-face or over the phone, it is fine to follow up with something more expansive in writing.You have to know your audience. Flowers might not always work if your apology is to a blokey man, but it is always good to add something tangible and thoughtful to your words.William Hanson is an etiquette expert at Help I Sexted My Boss podcast.

The recent heatwave across Europe brought thunderstorms which left thousands stranded in UK airports having to endure cancellations and delays with many sleeping on the floor as hotels ran out of space.And the coming weeks could see a series of further disruptions with the possibility of strikes looming. This week, the results of a ballot of members of Ryanair’s pilot union will emerge after a vote on strike action in a dispute over working conditions.Meanwhile, possible strikes by British Airways pilots could also cause disruption after the airline lost a second legal attempt to block industrial action last week.So what consumer rights do travellers need to be aware of?European Union law kicks in for passengers on flights which originate in the EU or arrive there and are operated by an EU airline.The next question is how long was the delay. If more than two hours for short-haul (less than 1,500km), three hours for a medium-haul (1,500-3,500km) and more than four hours for long-haul (over 3,500km), then passengers are entitled to food, drink and access to communications such as a phone, as well as accommodation if the delay is overnight. If it is for more than five hours, passengers are entitled to a refund if they don’t want to travel any more.Compensation may be due if the fault was the airline’s. “For instance, you can probably claim if the delay was caused by poor aircraft maintenance or flight crew being unavailable,” says the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). “However, delays caused by things like extreme weather, air traffic control or airport employee strikes, situations where the entire airport was closed or other ‘extraordinary circumstances’ are not eligible for compensation.”Levels of compensation are again dictated by distance and time and range from €250 for a three-hour delay on a short-haul flight to €600 for delays of more than four hours on a long-haul journey.If a flight is cancelled, passengers can’t be left stranded. Under EU laws, they can get their money back for the parts of the ticket which have not been used, such as a leg of a return ticket. If they still want to fly, then the airline is obliged to find another flight, whether it be as soon as possible or at a later date.If flights are extremely heavily booked, travellers may find that the next flight available is several days away. Compensation may be available if less than 14 days notice of the cancellation is given, but this again depends on the cause, with the “extraordinary circumstances” get-out a possibility.If compensation is available, it again depends on distance and time, going from €125 for a flight that arrives two hours later than an original short-haul flight was expected, to the €600 for a long-haul replacement flight that arrives four hours later than the original was expected.With the prospect of strikes looming, it is good practice for travellers to know where they stand if they face delays or have their flights cancelled. Airlines are not normally obliged to offer compensation as strikes are deemed extraordinary circumstances. This is not always the case, however.“Under EU rules, strikes may be considered as ‘extraordinary circumstances’, which means the airline does not have to pay compensation. To be exempted from paying compensation, the airline must prove that: A, there is a link between the extraordinary circumstances and the delay or the cancellation and B, the delay or cancellation could not have been avoided, even if all reasonable measures had been taken,” according to the European Commission’s Europa.eu. If passengers are unhappy with the explanation, they should contact the CAA.Naomi Leach of Which? says that in the case of strikes by BA and Ryanair staff, there may be compensation due. “If delays or cancellations are a result of the airline’s own staff striking, passengers may be entitled to fixed compensation under EU law as this won’t usually be considered an extraordinary circumstance,” she adds.The first port of call when seeking redress for delays or cancellation should be the airline, not the travel insurer, which is unlikely to be of much help, according to Which? “It is worth checking what travel insurance you already have – many bank accounts, for example, may include holiday cover. But even if your travel insurance policy does offer compensation for a delay, in most cases this will only cover extra expenses such as food and drink at the airport,” says Leach.In the case of holidays having to be abandoned as a result of severe delays or cancellations at a busy time, such as during the calamitous drone incident at Gatwick last year, a decent travel insurance policy should cover the cost of travellers having to abandon their plans – including hotel and car hire cancellation at their destination."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9def2229b9e3575caae4d6cd0791f3867047614a/767_1106_2003_1202/master/2003.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b5231f249c9473d71c614693a7409db","title":"noel gallagher i liked my mum until she gave birth to liam","story":"Jeremy Corbyn, the climate crisis, nuclear war and feminism: the former Oasis songwriter has opinions to burn. But it’s all a bit of a laugh until it gets to his younger brother‘This,” says Noel Gallagher, nodding towards my dictaphone, “is going to end in trouble. It always does.” Well, let’s hope so! An hour spent in Gallagher’s company is thrillingly unfiltered territory. “Interviews are an occupational hazard,” he says, settling down with a cup of tea. “But that’s because they’re such weird situations. You’re sat in a room with some guy from Stockholm who you’ve never met and he’s asking you about your mum. It’s fucking preposterous. Because the honest answer to that is: ‘What’s it got to do with you?’ But the smart answer is always: ‘I liked her until she gave birth to Liam.’”Oh yes, Liam. There will be plenty more about the youngest Gallagher brother, some of it delivered with real venom now their relationship has sunk to its lowest point. Last month, Noel accused Liam of “intimidating women” after posting screenshots allegedly showing aggressive texts sent to Noel’s teenage daughter, Anaïs. And there will be plenty more on other subjects likely to land him in a spot of bother, too: including the rarely discussed benefits of global warming. “I’m walking around today in a T-shirt, and I’m thinking ...” Gallagher looks up to mock-assess the weather, fully aware he is about to send some  readers berserk, “... it’s not even remotely chilly. Sure, it’ll be bad for my grandkids. But I’ve not met them yet. They might be a load of cunts, d’you know what I mean?”But let’s start with the music, as Noel prepares to release This Is the Place, the second of three EPs planned for this year. It follows Black Star Dancing, his Nile Rodgers-approved disco single. That saw him throw away the shackles of the guitar-led sound that once dominated his career as it moved from incredible peaks – those glorious first Oasis albums, whose melodic euphoria led to generation-defining gigs at Knebworth in 1996 – to the troughs, in which the band became plodding and predictable, only to implode with a blazing backstage row before a gig in Paris in 2009.Gallagher admits to being “set in my ways”, but it sounds like he is having fun writing music again. He credits the producer David Holmes – “one of the biggest musical influences in my life” – for getting him to ditch his favoured instrument and write in the studio. This Is the Place (the title is taken from Tony Walsh’s poem to Manchester, read aloud in Albert Square after the Manchester arena bombing) takes a space-rock journey through Ian Brown, Primal Scream and the Smiths, and it is almost frustrating it has taken him so long to get here. You wonder how things might have panned out if he had written more adventurous songs like these for Oasis back in the late 90s.“And people started calling me a Nazi!” he says. “I thought: ‘Really? A member of the Third Reich?’ Look, I think it’s ridiculous that we’re leaving. None of us were even qualified to vote. You ask a guy above a chippy in Bradford if we should leave Europe. ‘Yeah!’ But I still think if there’s a second referendum, as a nation, we’ll never recover. We have to come out because, no matter how ill-informed people were, you’re saying to them their vote doesn’t count. And its symptomatic of shutting people’s opinions down.”Oasis were renowned for drunken debauchery, bust-ups and brawls, but what is often forgotten is the spirit of togetherness they fostered. While their Britpop rivals Blur examined the country’s condition with lofty detachment, Oasis were all about the collective experience. Noel says he has the Hacienda and rave culture to thank for it.“Acid house changed my life,” he says. “You look at the words to those songs ... it’s all about unity, ‘us’, the whole communal thing. So when I started writing songs, instinctively, that’s how I did it. It was never about me, it was ‘you and me’. It was never ‘us versus them’ because there is no them! So when people go on about Oasis, they miss the point. It wasn’t about snarling and shouting and gobbing in the street. It was inclusive. That’s why so many people turned up to the gigs. And that’s why if I got up tomorrow morning and said: ‘Let’s do it’” – he clicks his fingers – “the world would change again. Because people never forget the way you made them feel.”Can’t he just reunite the group and bring the country back together, then? He sighs. Despite his opinionated outbursts in the press, he is no more sure than any of us about how to get out of this mess. In fact, he seems genuinely curious about it all. “Do you think there should be a second referendum?” he asks at one point. Probably, I say, which is met with a sharp intake of breath. “Oooh, really? That’s just going to cause more ision, though, innit?”Despite all the ision, Gallagher remains sanguine about the future. “That’s the great thing about nuclear bombs,” he says, introducing the subject of apocalypse with alarming cheer. “Ever since they’ve been invented, everyone’s been like: ‘Hang on a minute, are we going for it or what?’ We’re all fed this thing that the guy from North Korea is an insane lunatic. But he’s into basketball! How mad can he be? So we’ll be all right. As for beyond that, well ... fuck the grandkids – remember, they might be cunts. I’ve said it to my sons many times. They go: ‘Dad!’ but I tell them they don’t know who they’re gonna marry. She might be an idiot. Or he might be. We’re all modern men.”Does Noel feel modern? Over the years, he has developed something of a grumpy old man persona.“I feel modern in some respects and old-fashioned in others.”How does he feel about gender fluidity?“What’s that?” he asks. “I know what gender I am – Mancunian.”Would he describe himself as a feminist?“Oh, absolutely. I didn’t realise until my wife told me I was and I said: ‘Really? Well, I’ve got to announce that to the world then.’ But definitely, I am. When you’ve got a teenage daughter, you better get with it pretty quick. She comes to my gigs with her teenage pals now and … it’s something else, believe me. They can talk to you, lucidly, without missing a beat, while texting someone in Ghana, while buying a pair of shoes and listening to music at the same time ... who invented these people?”Gallagher is 52 now, but it seems Anaïs and his boys, Donovan and Sonny, are helping him keep up with the changing cultural landscape. Last month, on tour in the Netherlands, he turned on his hotel TV to watch Stormzy headlining Glastonbury and thought: “Oh, so that’s what my two lads are on about. Because they’ll be doing these dances in the kitchen when they’re getting ready for school and I’ll be thinking: ‘What’s a vossi bop?’ I didn’t realise it was to do with grime.”Stormzy and Oasis are musically worlds apart, but both are products of working-class Britain, even if Stormzy’s union flag stab vest is a different beast to the one painted on Gallagher’s guitar for Oasis’s triumphant shows at Manchester City’s ground in 1996 – a symbol of Cool Britannia, an icon of a country shaking off years of Tory rule.“It’s music as English as Pulp, or the Jam or the Kinks,” says Noel of grime in general. “And it’s their own language, which is a great thing that something born on council estates out of poverty and street culture has got to the main stage at Glastonbury. Now, if I’m a 52-year-old father of three living in Maida Vale, then he’s talking street jive to me. He’s talking about some guy stabbing him in the back when he was a kid – I’m not humming along to that! He is good, though, and Skepta is great. I remember seeing him at the Brits – just him under the spotlight, and thinking: ‘Wow, it’s fucking powerful, man.’”In 2008, Gallagher was criticised for saying Jay-Z was the “wrong” act to headline Glastonbury (“Glastonbury has a tradition of guitar music,” he said. “I’m not having hip-hop at Glastonbury.”) Does he regret that now?“That happened because I’d been away in the States for four months and some reporter told me Glastonbury had hip-hop on and hadn’t sold out. So, I was just like: ‘Oh well, hip-hop’s shit!’ That was it. Of course, your esteemed colleagues at the  seemed to make a lot more of it than it was …”So, it is all our fault then?“Absolutely it’s your fault. Everything is your fault.”There is, however, one person Gallagher thinks will always be wrong to appear at Glastonbury: Jeremy Corbyn, who received a rapturous reception when he delivered a speech there in 2017.“I saw him walk onstage to ‘Oooh, Jeremy Corbyn’ and thought: ‘Really? For a start, your name’s Jeremy.’ I don’t trust him. I think that the bare requirement for a politician, particularly a leader, is to be forward-looking. When I watch the news, I just think that, for these people, the big picture is communism, right? And that’s not British.”They are not communists, though.And just wait until we get to Liam’s recent solo performance at the festival. “I’d read somewhere that it was a headline set in the making, so I thought: ‘Fucking hell, better watch this,’” he says. “I don’t think I’ve ever been so embarrassed for a man in my entire life. He’s pulled off the incredible magic trick of making those Oasis songs sound weedy and thin. And he looked like he was having the worst day of his life, walking around in what looks like a pair of my son’s pyjamas, shouting into a mic about some perceived injustice ... if you can’t sing ’em, don’t play ’em!”Noel hasn’t seen Liam’s recent documentary, As it Was, although he plans to: “Because I’ve heard it’s hilarious.” The film is clearly a PR job for Liam’s side of the story, although it is an entertaining watch due to Liam’s onscreen charisma and the fact it shows a different side to the singer – one who displays self-doubt and admits to being lost after the breakup of Oasis. Noel isn’t the focus, but he is portrayed as aloof and uncaring, the brother who wasn’t there for Liam when he was struggling through his orce from Nicole Appleton.Noel bursts out laughing when I bring this up: “I wasn’t there for him? Well, he wasn’t there for his wife either, was he?”Noel’s tone changes dramatically when we talk about Liam. Most of his outrageous comments are said for a laugh, but when it comes to Liam he seems genuinely angry. What did he mean when he accused his brother of intimidating women?“That’s not the first time he’s sent texts to my daughter, or left threatening phone calls on my wife’s answering machine. So when he’s threatening my wife via my teenage daughter, I’m thinking, you know, if you weren’t a rock star, if you were just an uncle who worked in a garage, you’d be getting a visit from the police. But because you’re a rockstar, wahey, you get away with that shit.”Has this gone past the point of you two ever making up?Noel nods: “Because I’ve got one fatal flaw in my otherwise perfect makeup as a human being, which is I don’t forgive people. Once you start texting my children – and his two sons have been going for her, too – and legitimise my wife being bullied on the internet, where she has to shut down Instagram accounts because of the vile shit being written about her and my daughter, then it ain’t happening.”When did he last see Liam?“At the Etihad Stadium when City won the league about three years ago. Whenever I see him, he’s actually very polite, and you can see in his eyes that he’s just about to piss his trousers. But then he comes up with these scenarios of when we meet, that only ever take place in his own head.” He puts on his Liam voice again: “Ah fuckin’ went over and flicked him in the ear and said: ‘Eh, fuckin’ ’ell, keep it dangerous, you cunt.’”Has he heard Liam’s solo material?“I don’t listen to the albums, because I can’t stand his voice. But I hear it on the radio.”What does he think?“I think it’s unsophisticated music. For unsophisticated people. Made by an unsophisticated man. Who’s giving unsophisticated orders to a load of songwriters who think they’re doing the Oasis thing. Which goes back to what I was saying before. You can turn the Marshall amp up to 12 all you want and do a bit of glam, but Oasis words were about including people, everyone in it together. And what I hear from him is just a load of bile ... angry nonsense.”It is time to wrap up, but Gallagher’s still going.“I reckon if I put my two sons in a room – one’s nine, one’s 11 – for about 45 minutes, they could probably muster up something better than that new single of his,” he says.Is this all just a crafty way of hyping up a future Oasis reunion?“I wish it was,” he laughs. “It boils down to, on a personal level, fuck him. But also, artistically, why do it again? You know, I was watching the news the other night and he was on there, threatening to break my jaw – live on the ITV news! Isn’t there a law against that? – and it’s about an Oasis reunion and he’s like: ‘Me bags are packed, mate.’ And I’m thinking: ‘Who are you expecting to call you? Me?’ Nobody wants to be in a band with him apart from a load of indie Championship players – journeymen, who are in it for all the crisps they can eat.”It seems silly to ask whether Gallagher has anything else he would like to add. Because of course he does. He always does.“Yeah,” he says, getting up and pointing again at my dictaphone: “Don’t quote me on any of that.”This Is the Place is out today, taken from the EP of the same name, which will be released on 27 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a2655bada45aa983ddb7a03d59c5b63dc7a85a0/0_2_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=885bf50ce171bf4138ab121a177f9106","title":"we cant get carried away readers on lib dem byelection win jane dodds brecon and radnorshire","story":"You have been reacting to Jane Dodds’ win in Brecon and Radnorshire, a result cutting Boris Johnson’s majority to oneOne cannot view Brecon and Radnor as an ordinary constituency, this was a Lib Dem stronghold even during Blairs most successful years, the profile of the constituency is very middle class and a world away from the poverty of the Valleys or the eastern suburbs of London.

RedSalamanderI’m delighted that a party which unequivocally opposes Brexit won last night.But we shouldn’t get carried away.

And given the circumstances of this by-election, a seat they’d been widely expected to lose heavily from what I’ve read over the past few weeks, the narrow losing margin seems to confirm that.What the result shows is what can be achieved through electoral alliances. The winning margin was about the same as Plaid Cymru’s vote at the last election, and they didn’t stand this time. The Brexit Party’s 3,300 votes would have given the Tories a comfortable majority. Very grim result for Labour. stringvestorThere is still a substantial pro-Brexit vote out there. That is not surprising since we have not yet left the EU and what might happen is still speculation.

Javid held several senior executive positions at the German investment bank, including a role selling collateralised debt obligations (CDOs), a type of complex and risky financial product responsible for turbocharging the financial crisis.McDonnell said the new chancellor must also answer questions over any connection he may have had with a tax avoidance scheme known as “dark blue” during his time at Deutsche.The shadow chancellor demanded that the prime minister launches an investigation, adding there was evidence that would raise alarm bells over Javid’s suitability to look after the nation’s finances.In the letter sent on Monday, seen by the , he said: “It will not be lost on those that have suffered the consequences of the last nine years of austerity following the 2008 financial crisis that the newly appointed chancellor profited from the greed that contributed to it.”Before his election as the Conservative MP for Bromsgrove in 2010, Javid had an 18-year career in the City, and latterly with Deutsche Bank in Asia. As global head of credit trading for the region, excluding Japan, he sold risky bonds and complex derivative products, including CDOs.CDOs are complex financial products that gained a toxic reputation during the financial crisis for fuelling the collapse of the global banking system. They have been labelled by the US investor Warren Buffett as “financial weapons of mass destruction”.Deutsche Bank, which was among the biggest sellers of CDOs, was described by US senator Carl Levin as a “financial snake pit rife with greed, conflicts of interest and wrongdoing” ahead of the 2008 crash.The bank has faced repeated scandals, including for internally referring to some of its CDOs as “crap” that “blows”. Deutsche Bank has spent more than $18bn (£15bn) on fines and to settle legal disputes in the past decade, according to Bloomberg.McDonnell said Javid was a senior office holder at the German bank around the time that a US Senate committee concluded it had inflicted “material damage to ordinary people and the wider global economy”.According to the magazine, Javid worked at Deutsche Bank when it sold $500m (£411m) of collateralised loan obligations (CLOs) – similar to CDOs but using loans rather than bonds – to investors who later sued the German bank for losses of as much as $37m (£30m). The case was dismissed because it came after the expiration of a five-year statute of limitations on legal disputes.Javid had also previously told the magazine that CDOs were “very appropriate” for buyers as long as they understood the risks associated with them.Warning that the comments should call into question whether the new chancellor should be trusted with the nation’s finances, McDonnell said Javid was implicated in “some of the worst excesses of the casino economy”.Demanding that Javid publish his tax returns, McDonnell questioned whether the chancellor benefited from a tax avoidance scheme while at Deutsche Bank. The Mail on Sunday reported in 2014 that Javid opted into a scheme known as “dark blue” that channelled bankers’ bonus payments through the Cayman Islands.McDonnell said: “It critically undermines this government’s response to the scourge of tax avoidance for the chancellor to stand accused of this practise.“Every penny avoided in tax by wealthy large corporations is a penny taken from our desperately underfunded public service.”A Conservative spokesman said: “Frankly, Labour might want to use the time better thinking about their own credentials for governing. Not content with antisemitism being rife in their party and their totally incoherent Brexit policy, the only threat to the UK economy is them.“Their reckless plans would see debt soaring as they spend one thousand billion pounds, tax raids on hard working families and upheaval of our economic system by replacing key posts such as the governor of the Bank of England with their hard left choices. Utter disaster. If any party knows about failure and bogus investigations, it’s them.”Deutsche Bank declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54d2ddd03bd8c41e72ac0af51c1240df6a7c3a5f/0_98_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06bd62711ac0b2c9c718893c5a598f06","title":"low income britons more vulnerable to recession than in 2008","story":"Weak wage growth and years of austerity mean Brexit downturn will be harder for poor Low-income households in Britain are more vulnerable to recession than they were before the financial crisis, the Resolution Foundation has warned, amid the mounting risks of a Brexit downturn.According to the thinktank, a decade of weak wage growth has left the poorest UK households and middle-income families less prepared for another downturn. It also warned the gradual dismantling of the benefits system under the policy of austerity imposed over the past decade by Conservative-led governments has left people without the same degree of support.The warning comes ahead of official growth figures for the second quarter, due this Friday, that are expected to show the British economy stalled or slid into contraction for the first time since 2012 during the three months to June.Two consecutive quarters of contraction are regarded as a recession. The last time the UK suffered a period of falling GDP was during the 2008 financial crisis, which caused the loss of more than 1m jobs as unemployment rose to its highest level since the 1990s.The warning signals for the economy come after the Bank of England said last week that Britain has a one-in-three chance of plunging into recession at the start of 2020, even if a no-deal Brexit can be avoided.Threadneedle Street said chronic uncertainty facing British businesses over the future EU trading relationship, as well as slowing international trade volumes due to the US-China trade war, was serving as a handbrake on the economy.Should Britain sink into another downturn, the Resolution Foundation warned that poor households would struggle most.James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said: “We know from previous downturns that it is lower income households that bear the brunt of economic downturns when it comes to their living standards.“The global slowdown and continued Brexit uncertainty are making recession preparedness even more urgent. In its response, the government should consider policies that limit and mitigate the effects of the recession, particularly for the most vulnerable in society.”By analysing household spending patterns over the past decade, the thinktank found that poor families were forced to tighten their belts to a greater extent than the rich in the years that followed the 2008 crash.It also said low and middle-income families had yet to recover. Average salaries in Britain have failed to rise above the level recorded before the financial crisis after inflation is taken into account.Pay growth is on track to complete the weakest decade since the final decade of the Napoleonic wars in the 1810s. Wages fell by £32 a week on average after inflation between 2008 and 2014.In its analysis, the Resolution Foundation said that a decade of weak wage growth had left poorer households with less scope to cut down on essentials, while a higher proportion than before the last crash had no savings upon which to draw.The Resolution Foundation said the government needed to take greater steps to prepare Britain for a recession.“When the next recession hits – as it surely will – there is every chance that it is particularly damaging for those low-to-middle income households that are already close to the edge.“The policy response will matter, but so too will the action taken ahead of any future downturn,” it warned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b072d431ea899643781ff9fea0dd8ed2fbb8e84c/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c8417ce81d3b811a8520963daa54a33","title":"medical procedure delay menopause","story":"Operation could benefit thousands of women who experience serious health issuesA medical procedure that aims to allow women to delay the menopause for up to 20 years has been launched by IVF specialists in Britain.Doctors claim the operation could benefit thousands of women who experience serious health problems, such as heart conditions and bone-weakening osteoporosis, that are brought on by the menopause.But the specialists believe the same procedure could also improve the lives of millions more women by delaying the onset of more common symptoms of the menopause, which range from low mood, anxiety and difficulty sleeping, to hot flushes, night sweats and a reduced sex drive.The procedure, which costs between £7,000 and £11,000, is being offered to women up to the age of 40 through ProFam, a Birmingham-based company set up by Simon Fishel, an IVF doctor and president of the UK Care Fertility Group, in collaboration with other specialists.“This has the potential to be of significant benefit to any woman who may want to delay the menopause for any reason, or those women who would have taken HRT, and there are lots of benefits around that,” Prof Fishel told the .Nine women have so far had the procedure to remove and freeze their ovarian tissue with a view to delaying the menopause when they are older. Doctors use keyhole surgery to remove a small piece of ovarian tissue, which is then sliced up and frozen to preserve it.When the women enter the menopause, potentially decades from now, the frozen tissue can be thawed out and grafted back into the body. To restore falling hormone levels, doctors typically choose a site with a good blood supply, such as the armpit. Provided the ovarian tissue survives the process, it should restore the woman’s declining sex hormones and halt the menopause.“This is the first project in the world to provide healthy women ovarian tissue cryopreservation purely to delay the menopause,” the company’s chief medical officer, Yousri Afifi, told the Sunday Times.Doctors already use a similar procedure to protect the fertility of girls and women who are about to have cancer treatment. Before they begin anti-cancer therapy, doctors remove some ovarian tissue and freeze it. If the woman wishes to have children in the future, the tissue is then thawed out and reimplanted next to the fallopian tubes, which pick up the mature eggs that are released by the tissue.How much the new procedure will delay the menopause depends on the age when the tissue is taken and when it is put back. Tissue taken from a 25-year-old might postpone the menopause for 20 years, while that taken from a 40-year-old might only delay its onset for five years.Fishel points out that young women today can expect to spend 30 to 40 years in the menopausal stage and while many will benefit from hormone replacement therapy, it does not suit everyone.Richard Anderson, the deputy director of the Centre for Reproductive Health at Edinburgh University, has performed ovarian tissue freezing for young girls and women for 25 years. He said it was “old news” that the transplants could restore hormone levels, but added: “What is less clear is whether this is a safe and effective way of doing so.”Beyond postponing menopause, the doctors believe the procedure could save the NHS substantial amounts of money by reducing treatment costs for the menopause and more serious, related problems such as heart conditions and osteoporosis.But it could also be a game-changer for fertility treatment. Unlike IVF, ovarian tissue preservation does not require drugs to stimulate the ovaries, and is likely to produce far more eggs. If women in their 20s routinely had ovarian tissue removed and stored, Fishel said, they could potentially have access to thousands of eggs should they later decide to have children.Women could even have part of their tissue reimplanted to restore their fertility before starting a family, and the rest regrafted later to hold off the menopause, he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6137ee149a08f9b37ca5a18e8879c863334d8f1/0_0_5718_3430/master/5718.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9013738ee2677afe578afdb02e413903","title":"surge in eu citizens unfairly refused access to universal credit","story":"‘Hostile environment’ of benefits system leads EU nationals to destitutionEU citizens are being made homeless and destitute after being turned down for universal credit despite having the legal right to reside in the UK, in what critics are calling the benefit system’s very own “hostile environment”.Ministers are being urged to review “unfair practices” after law centres and welfare advisers reported a surge in cases in which EU nationals without UK citizenship have ended up in debt or sleeping rough because of incorrect decisions to refuse their application for universal credit that cut off their benefits overnight.Claimants who challenge the decision typically have to wait up to 40 weeks for an appeal hearing. Welfare advisers say they win their the appeal in almost all cases, resulting in back payments of thousands of pounds.However, during the wait for an appeal claimants struggle to pay rent as the claim for universal credit automatically ends previous awards, including housing benefit. With zero income, they experience stress, eviction and debt, and rely on family loans and food banks to survive.Welfare advisers argue that extra complexity introduced into the benefits system to address public and media concerns about so-called “benefit tourism” mean universal credit is now wrongly penalising EU citizens who have earned permanent residence though years of work or family connections.It is believed potentially thousands of EU citizens have been affected. One law centre said that while it saw just a handful of cases each month last autumn it was now seeing at least three a week. Several others contacted by the  said they had seen a surge in cases as claimants moved onto universal credit from legacy benefits as a result of a change in circumstances, such as moving home.“What is happening to our EU citizen clients is little short of scandalous,” said Michael Bates of the Central England Law Centre in Birmingham. “To see people who have lived and worked here for so long being told they don’t qualify for benefit when they so obviously do is a disgrace”.Janet Coe, assistant director of Merseyside Law Centre, said it had seen a large increase in EU citizens incorrectly refused access to universal credit over the past six months. “I would absolutely say it is a hostile environment,” she said.Single people, often women, and those who are disabled or in low-paid work are disproportionately affected when the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) refuses universal credit to EU citizens, say welfare advisers. Claimants who lack financial savings or the language skills to pursue the tortuous process of overturning the decision are most likely to end up destitute.The problem has grown as more EU citizens move onto universal credit from existing benefits, at which point under DWP rules they must show again they are habitually resident in the UK. Some claimants struggle to show evidence that they are eligible because they have not kept employment and benefits paperwork.Welfare advisers say the DWP makes little effort to access its own records. These often show that the DWP had previously agreed the claimant had a right to reside in order to receive legacy benefits, and in almost all cases the circumstances informing that decision will not have changed.“We’ve been doing welfare work for over 30 years. We’ve often seen poor decisions, but not this poor,” said Coe. “The more complex the case the less likely the DWP will make a correct decision. It is partly about how they train the staff and what appears to be a lack of will to help and assist.”Although the welfare system has never been straightforward for EU citizens to navigate, under the old system claimants refused a particular benefit were rarely left penniless. Under universal credit, which rolls six main benefits into one payment, claimants seeking social security support are put in an “all or nothing” situation.EU officials are said to be aware of the complexity of the rollout of universal credit.Luisa Porritt, deputy leader of Liberal Democrat MEPs, called for an urgent review: “ The government must urgently review these unfair practices. The inhumane, hostile environment created by the Tories is a disgraceful way to treat our friends, family and neighbours.”The DWP said it was not aware of a rise in tribunal cases involving habitual residence test decisions. Universal credit decision makers were specially trained and mentored in this area. A DWP spokesperson said: “Staff must pass rigorous training before taking these decisions and we expect them to offer a high standard of support to help people with the evidence they need to provide.”It added: “There’s been no change in the eligibility for universal credit since 2015 and there have been no changes to access to benefits ahead of EU Exit.”Roxana Adamczyk, 32, from Poland, has spent 13 years in Birmingham working for local firms and studying for a degree. When she applied for universal credit in January she was turned down, on the incorrect basis that she did not have a legal right to reside.Adamczyk’s son – whose British father is estranged – had reached school age and she had moved off income support expecting universal credit would provide some support while she set up her own business – which she had been planning with job centre help.Despite her work record, and her receipt of income support being a clear sign she had the right to reside, the DWP knocked back her application. It said did not believe she was habitually resident in the UK, and her income stopped overnight.Attempting to rectify the error was a nightmare, said Adamczyk. “They told me they could not speed up the appeal process because I was not a priority. I said: ‘Listen, I have a small son, all my money has stopped and I could lose my house. How am I not a priority?’”Having previously volunteered with Citizen’s Advice, Adamczyk was not daunted by universal credit’s bureaucratic maze. She made a second application in February, which was again rejected. She took steps towards another appeal, and threatened the DWP with legal action. The DWP granted the second application on review.She received no income between January and the end of May. She is still appealing the first application.The process has been stressful, she says: “I was able to take out an overdraft. My landlord was understanding. And my mum flew over from Poland to help,” she said. “Without that we would have been homeless.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca36e9c1b7deacb4212331ef3808bd882141dbc1/0_36_5056_3034/master/5056.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39026bc4966b057f03fa3bc32a304323","title":"sports quiz week football cricket ashes transfers","story":"Who moved?

In following his first-innings 144 with a masterful 142 from 207 balls in the second, the right‑hander became the first Australian since Steve Waugh at Old Trafford in 1997 to score two centuries in the same Test on English soil.That near-indomitable effort, allied with a century for the returning Matt Wade, allowed Tim Paine to declare Australia’s second innings on 487 for seven and set England an improbable 398 to win.Rory Burns and Jason Roy survived seven overs with the new ball late on and will now resume this morning needing a strong start on a pitch that has slowed down for the seamers but offers Nathan Lyon significant rough.Smith, speaking after the close and still basking in his 25th century as his first Test back after a year’s suspension continues to unfold like a dream, said: “I love Test cricket and I love playing against England. I’ve loved these last four days. It’s felt like Christmas morning every morning.“I have never doubted my ability but it has been a dream comeback in a way. To score two hundreds in the first Ashes … well, I have never done it in any form of cricket. It’s incredibly special and also special to put us into the position we are in.”England have never batted through a final day to save a Test during the Trevor Bayliss era, with the 2009 Ashes opener in Cardiff the last time they have done so at home. On that occasion the final pair of Jimmy Anderson and Monty Panesar survived 11.3 overs in 40 tense minutes at the end to deny Ricky Ponting’s side a 1-0 lead in the series.Graham Thorpe, the England batting coach, outlined the challenge ahead but insisted that blocking alone would not suffice. Instead he called on his charges to build positive partnerships for their rearguard attempt.“Fundamentally it’s a case of not looking too far ahead,” Thorpe said. “It’s how the inidual wants to go about it, how he sees the situation in front of him. Have a positive mindset, look to score runs and that builds confidence.“Whatever happens, we hope the team can show character and skill. We are going to need a lot of that because we know it will be a challenge. It is a fifth-day pitch and they have a very good spinner in their attack. We have to have the belief we can do it throughout the course of the day.”Asked whether England could somehow tap their never-say-die performance during their victory against New Zealand in the World Cup final at Lord’s last month, Thorpe replied: “Certainly in our dressing room that is the type of conversations we have. A lot of the guys gained a lot of confidence from that. It is a different form of the game but the belief they have when confronted with different situations is there.”While Wade’s 110 in his first Test after a near two-year absence was fine reward for dominating at domestic level, there is little doubting the story of the match. Smith has twice driven England’s attack to distraction and laid down a significant marker for the remainder of the series.Though banned from a formal leadership role for his part of the Cape Town ball-tampering scandal last year, the 30-year-old has still been playing an active role in Paine’s on-field tactics. That has prompted talk of a return to the top job in future but Smith looked to play down such thoughts.If Smith’s glowing form is a concern for England, then so too is Anderson, who was finally ruled out of bowling before the fourth day because of the calf muscle he reinjured on day one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99feec61674c23ceed28646ba6018b2af6b6e0da/0_103_4099_2458/master/4099.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=630f1e62f45bed23c135717973bf408b","title":"hinako shibuno wins british womens open","story":"Hinako Shibuno captured hearts and minds long before she decided to take delivery of the Women’s British Open trophy for good measure.

Shibuno’s back nine of 31 on her major championship debut afforded her a one-shot victory over Lizette Salas.“I feel like I’m going to vomit,” said Shibuno, suggesting anxiety that was not at all apparent. “Contending at a tournament like this is nerve-racking but I was determined to enjoy it.”Shibuno looked destined to fall short. She made a double bogey at the 3rd and played the front nine in 37. The inward half at Woburn was kind to Shibuno all week – she played it in a four-round total of minus 18.As Shibuno celebrated, it was impossible not to feel sympathy for Salas. The American found herself an unwanted centre of attention at this tournament in 2015, owing to its hosting by Donald Trump’s Turnberry resort. Salas was bombarded by news outlets then and by her own admission felt desperately uncomfortable after the then-US president elect had made disparaging remarks about Mexicans. Salas, a US Solheim Cup player, is of Mexican descent.Salas was on the verge of regarding the British Open in altogether different light. Playing two groups in front of Shibuno, she stood over a 5ft putt on the 18th green with the chance to move to 18 under. The birdie attempt remained above ground.Her hopes of possible salvation via a play-off were ended by Shibuno’s brilliance. The roar as the Japanese converted reverberated to the practice putting green, where Salas was preparing for potential extra holes. These kind of defeats tend to linger, especially for a 30-year-old without a major title.In tears, Salas admitted there was a “sting” attached to what transpired. “I told myself: ‘You got this. You’re made for this,’” said Salas of her fateful moment. “I put a good stroke on it. I’m not going to lie. I was nervous. I haven’t been in that position in a long time. I gave it a good stroke, I controlled all my thoughts, it just didn’t drop. So congrats to our winner.”On an engrossing final afternoon, Ko Jin-young flirted with the making of history. The South Korean was seeking to become the seventh player – male or female – to win three majors in a single calendar year. Ko could barely have given this a better run her birdie putt at the 72nd hole stopped agonisingly short, meaning a 16-under-par total and third place after a 66. Ko and Salas, as Sunday playing partners, had a better-ball score of 12 under par, which was also the case inside 15 holes.Morgan Pressel dropped a shot at the last to finish a shot and a place behind Ko. Pressel should have now done enough to earn a wildcard pick for what would be a sixth appearance for USA at next month’s Solheim Cup. As Pressel challenged at the top here, her closest Solheim challengers had made a halfway exit. Ashleigh Buhai’s 70 left her fifth, one stroke adrift of Pressel at 14 under par.Georgia Hall’s title defence concluded with a 73, meaning a share of 35th. With Hall essentially out of the championship equation before a ball was struck on Sunday, home hopes fell on Charley Hull and Bronte Law.A double-bogey seven at the 7th put paid to Hull’s aspirations, with her 76 contributing to a tie for 24th at five under. Law had not dropped a shot inside 54 holes but proceeded to ship five inside her front nine. A 78, her worst score of the tournament by eight shots, ensured she matched Hall’s three-under aggregate.There was, however, one name – a new name – on everyone’s lips. Mainstream sport is all the better for delving into the land of fairytale now and again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ff03039aeacd15af35e9d5d6d14d5c47ebdbe3d/0_108_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=455844bce4828b4102dd3f03f7730b23","title":"lewis hamilton wins hungarian gp f1 max verstappen","story":"After the disappointment and disarray of Hockenheim, Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes enjoyed a remarkable, redemptive comeback at the Hungarian Grand Prix. This time – in the natural amphitheatre of the Hungaroring – sunshine, driver and team all burned brightly, with the latter’s stagecraft magnificent to behold as Hamilton beat Red Bull’s Max Verstappen to first place.The race was gripping, tense and almost impossible to call until the final laps and even Hamilton had doubted whether he could pull it off but when the world champion and Mercedes are this good they are irrepressible.This was yet another masterclass from the British driver and his team. Mercedes had taken a gamble but in doing so called the race to perfection, returning one of the best victories this season – no small praise given they have won 10 of the 12 grands prix. The race had hung in the balance but although Verstappen had led almost throughout, Hamilton, on fresher tyres, swept past the 21-year-old Dutchman with three laps to go to take the flag. Mercedes’ decision to pit their driver a second time gave Hamilton a decisive advantage he exploited brilliantly.Knowing that overtaking is tricky through the twisting corners of the circuit, he believed his team would have to play a strong strategic game to ensure he could gain places and they proved more than up to the task. The team and drivers had been through an extensive debrief after performing poorly in the German Prix at Hockenheim a week earlier and duly came back with a display of precision execution, with Hamilton at the sharp end, delivering with a clinical drive.Hamilton also acknowledged what a team effort it had been. “The guys are very calm when they talk about the strategy like the one today. ‘No, no, I truly believed you could do it,’ they told me. But I am sure they were nervous as hell that it wasn’t going to work. But collectively we made it happen.”Hamilton’s 81st career win is also his seventh at the Hungarian GP and he has eight wins from 12 races, his best start to a season. His position looks almost unassailable, leading his teammate Valtteri Bottas by 62 points. Verstappen is a further seven points back in third and Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, who was third here, trails the Dutchman by 25 points.The race unfolded in an almost classical three-act structure into which the protagonists threw so much effort that even Verstappen emerged smiling after his suitably theatrical engagement with Hamilton. “I think Lewis was on fire,” he said.Verstappen held the lead from pole and with Hamilton immediately up to second from third at the expense of Bottas, they were nose to tail until the first stops, a teasing, tense scene-setter.Red Bull pitted their man first, on lap 25, with Mercedes following six laps later. Hamilton immediately attacked. He flew after Verstappen, taking almost two and a half seconds out of his lead in two laps. He had caught him by lap 34 and his pace was superb. He climbed all over the back of Verstappen, who defended stoutly. With Hamilton harrying, on lap 39 they went wheel to wheel through turns one to four, in a thrilling battle. Hamilton went wide in a brave bid to pass on the outside of turn four as Verstappen held his place.This was clean, gripping racing but not enough for Hamilton to win so Mercedes rolled the dice in the final third. They pulled him in unexpectedly for a second stop to take the medium tyre on lap 48. It was a bold move. Red Bull could not respond to pit Verstappen without losing the lead so he had to stay out while Hamilton set off to make up the 20 seconds he needed to catch him.Hamilton had the fresher rubber but Verstappen track position, either might yet have won it. However once in clean air, he pumped out fastest laps and, with Verstappen’s tyres gone, had caught up by lap 66 of 70. Verstappen had given his all but was powerless while Hamilton, relentless, was not to be denied. He swept past round the outside of turn one a lap later to take the lead and the win.“I was really proud of how I delegated my work throughout and collectively with the team we did an exceptional job,” Hamilton said. “This morning they said a two-stop would not happen and when they called for it I wondered if it would work.“A gamble is always a good thing. It felt like a big gamble. It was collectively a bold, risky strategy call, then it was doing the job at the end of the day. I had to do those laps to chew out the gap he had on me.”Ecstasy and relief seemed to vie for dominance as Hamilton climbed from his car both had turned to exultation by the time he reached the podium with an ear-to-ear grin.As he goes into F1’s summer break he and Mercedes delivered the perfect adieu. Only seven days after their season low, Hamilton and his team are soaring once more.Charles Leclerc was fourth for Ferrari. Carlos Sainz took an excellent fifth, his second in a row for McLaren, in front of the second Red Bull of Pierre Gasly. Alfa Romeo’s Kimi Räikkönen was seventh. Bottas was eighth with Lando Norris ninth for McLaren in front of the Toro Rosso of Alexander Albon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78aa16df726992f7d315721f42733c1632cf646a/0_87_3845_2308/master/3845.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e095c62c3f3d192ea4e4661d1ccf0b19","title":"steve smith australia england ashes second hundred","story":"Well, what did you see my blue eyed son? And what did you see, my darling young one? I saw a man batting without a chance for 149 overs. I saw Joe Denly bowling in mid-afternoon. I saw a thousand pad-roll fiddles and five hundred box-flicks. I saw a game and a series and a career defined.And yes, like everyone else I saw quite a lot of Steve Smith. The fourth day of this first Ashes Test may have ended with England’s openers battling for survival, set an impossible 398 to win and a day to play out for a draw. But once again the chorus, the melody, the rhythm of the occasion belonged to the greatest Test batsman of the age.From early morning to mid‑afternoon Smith reeled off his second mind-bendingly fine hundred of this match and his 25th in his past 54 Tests. This is a man operating at a pitch that no longer requires a nod to the records of the noble dead, use of the phrase “not since” or sepia references to childhoods hitting a golf ball against a water tank with a stump. Right now Smith is simply in a space all of his own.Throughout this Test a weather‑beaten busker has been stationed outside Edgbaston, running through a repertoire of Bob Dylan standards as the crowds depart. At the end of day two he warned that the times were a-changing. As the skies opened at the end of day three he’d been absent from his post, but the message was still clear. Smith was on 46 at the close and not just playing nicely but wreathed in a peculiar sense of destiny. This match was already edging one way. And, for England, a hard rain was going to fall.So it came to pass on the fourth day as Smith batted in a way nobody has ever really batted before, en route to a chanceless 142 off 207 balls. The small details, as ever, were gripping, each one seeming to capture some part of what he does and how he does it.Half an hour into the afternoon session Moeen Ali came on to bowl. Australia were 261 for four and Smith was on 115. Moeen bowled a horrible half-tracker. Smith clattered it, but only as far as the deep midwicket fielder he grimaced and stamped his feet and seemed close to beating his own brow in frustration as he ran the single.And yet even in the middle of this personal anguish Smith could be seen veering in a sudden loop across the pitch, brain whirring, aware that Matthew Wade is left-handed, that Moeen will change the angle for his second ball and so naturally he, Smith, must sprint as fast as possible across the wicket in order to continue his self-castigation in the most efficient fashion.Shortly afterwards he came hopping out to another Ali off-break and punted a glorious on-drive to the fence, as though scrubbing out that fault in the programme.On days like these Smith is the opposite of a highlights player. To appreciate him it is necessary to lose yourself in the forces around him just as he does. Watching him ease his way through the morning session there was even something oddly devotional about those rituals between deliveries. Pad roll, pad roll, helmet and box. Spectacles, testicles, wallet and watch. This all has a function, a way of resetting, of clearing his history and focusing only on the next page.The usual spirit-sapping stream of singles appeared through the leg side. In between Smith drove with thrilling, easy power through the covers. And England’s bowling began to look a little thin, its weak points teased out and pulled apart.Smith just seems to have a more powerful processor, to have extra information flashing across his circuit boards at times like these. Those twitches and fidgets, the whirling leaves: these are all part of the calculations, minority reports, ticker tape spooling out of the computer bank en route to the right answer.Perhaps this is why he seems to be operating at double speed. Has any batsmen ever had so much time to play his shots? At one point Ben Stokes bowled a full slower ball and Smith seemed to weigh up four or five options, to revise his calculations, have a chuckle to himself, then finally dink it away with a cuff. The next ball was pitched up and driven with startling power from a totally static position, just the way he felt like playing it in the moment, to take him on to 93.Ah yes, the numbers. In the rush to appreciate all this brilliance there has already been a blizzard of Smith stats, with a search for the best, the most apt, the most clinching of Smith numbers.How about this one? England had Smith out for six, seven, five and six in successive innings at Edgbaston and Trent Bridge four years ago. Each time he was caught behind the wicket fending at a full ball early on. Since then he has scored 1,100 runs against England at 158. Lol. Maybe there was a plan in there somewhere.Edgbaston rose to Smith as his hundred arrived in the afternoon sun. Perhaps the story of this series will be his journey from boo‑magnet, pariah and enemy of the boorish, to a sporting phenomenon to be treasured whatever your passport. As England battle to save this match there will be a wider sense of dread that this process is only just getting started."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/955e6c6c47f3c6c72a58190e6e5c4ffa8278aacf/425_930_3865_2319/master/3865.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=311ebd06abc3e69f07c5d47324fc5276","title":"the crucible review edinburgh playhouse","story":"Edinburgh PlayhouseMomentous dance and strong performances make Helen Pickett’s canny reworking of the story a gift of a showChoreographer Helen Pickett’s clever reinvention of The Crucible burns with white-hot intensity and antic energy. It’s a riveting gift of a show for Scottish Ballet.Heavy on archaic dialogue and authorial interpolation, Arthur Miller’s 1953 play about the Salem witch trials of 1692 – famously an allegory for McCarthyism – might seem like a risky choice for the ballet stage.But Pickett cannily brings narrative episodes that happen off stage in the play to life, out of which emerge a sense of potently un-Puritan physicality. We see Salem’s adolescent girls frolicking in the forest at night – their childish play with shadow puppets gradually turning to a collective pheromonal frenzy – as well as the crucial tryst between married farmer John Proctor (Nicholas Shoesmith) and teenage servant Abigail (Constance Devernay).The latter is not just some saucy minx but a girl tremulously eager for experience, whose burgeoning sexual power animates her unfurling limbs and develops into the brief bloom of an arabesque. Despite her girlish guile, she clearly believes that Proctor reciprocates her feelings.Post-adultery, there’s an intricate duet for Proctor and his wife Elizabeth (Araminta Wraith) that finely traces the emotional faultlines of their marriage. Shoesmith’s turbulent dance of contrition is both fervent and unforced – he makes an airborne triple turn look like a sincere apology – while Wraith’s bowed humiliation and rigid outrage develops into a believably tender rapprochement that is nevertheless stained with sadness.Set against this private turmoil are scenes of public life which use the regimentation and eventual rupture of the corps de ballet to excellent effect. Their modest jumps and gestures of supplication soon develop into momentous dances of devil-based disinformation: out of the girls’ chattering bourres emerge slashing accusations, spurious screams and fits of collapse. Peter Salem’s atmospheric score mixes devotional songs with jolting electro crow caws and shrieking strings, while David Finn’s spare set and lighting amplifies the gloom.For all the depressingly resonant themes – falsehood and fear as political currency, the demonisation of women, the re-emergence of an older man’s sexual encounter with a vulnerable girl – it is also a heartening testament to the strength of contemporary narrative ballet.• Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a15f4284f3a7cea4b823b2267be1820fb4648b39/1181_1041_3639_2184/master/3639.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e282be98d954c046b234a79e2ded070","title":"deafness its part of who you are one mans journey to inspire","story":"Ed Rex has enjoyed some memorable travel experiences over the years. He tells  Lucy Jolin about how he started his travel blogging business and the tech that helps himTravel blogger Ed Rex has had plenty of memorable moments in his career to date, from snorkelling in Fiji to marvelling at the Iguazu Falls on the border of Brazil and Argentina. But one of the most memorable was when he accidentally signed up for a job at a nudist resort in Australia.“The plan was to work at resorts in return for bed and breakfast,” he says with a grin. “The resort sent me a nice email saying they were looking forward to me coming and would pick me up – and by the way, we’re nudists: is that OK with you? And I had to be nude as well. That was a challenge! I’ve certainly never done naked gardening in the UK ...”Rex was born deaf, but he’s never let that stand in the way of his determination to experience life to the full. He studied environmental biology and science at the University of Leeds and worked in the sector for several years before jacking in his job to see the world.“I’d always had a love of travel but I didn’t have anyone to travel with, and I didn’t have the confidence to travel on my own,” he says. “Then, just before I left my last job, I had an operation to insert a cochlear implant into my right ear, as the hearing in that ear had gone completely. I was struggling to be involved in social situations, and feeling pretty down.”While the operation isn’t the preferred choice for all, for Rex it made a huge difference. “I was a completely different person,” he says. “Suddenly, I had so much confidence. So off I went, around the world. That was the start of the travel blogging, too. I realised I had a love of storytelling.”Rex charts all his travels on his blog, rexyedventures (strapline: “Adventures of a handsome backpacker travelling the unexpected”), which quickly caught the attention of major brands, including KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, MyDestination and Hotel.info. These days he’s a well-known figure on the travel blogger scene. He’s often asked to go on trips and to review accommodation and experiences – recent adventures include quad biking in Australia and two weeks in South Africa. And he’s written widely about his experiences as a deaf traveller too, on rexyedventures and his Deaf Traveller blog.There have been challenges, of course, as well as some some odd attitudes. “I remember one Australian guy saying: ‘Can I catch deafness from you?’ which was bizarre! I took out my hearing aid, which I use for my left ear, and said: ‘Quick, quick, the germs are on the loose!’ But most of the time, it’s fine. Sometimes people have questions but they are afraid to ask, so you have to start the conversation yourself. For me, deafness is not a taboo subject and you can make fun of yourself. It’s part of who you are.”But odd attitudes like the earlier one are rare, he points out. “Most of the time it’s just about looking after yourself and making sure you’re not in a situation where you could be vulnerable. I’ve always felt quite safe. And if something happens – like being dropped off by a bus in Thailand in the middle of nowhere – it’s fine if you don’t lose your cool and get stressed.”Rex is a keen user and advocate of better accessibility tech – he’s passionate about the need to get British transport right, particularly train companies that still use tannoys to make announcements. He’s pleased that Microsoft’s most recent software is taking steps in the right direction.“I particularly like the visual notification feature, which sets the screen to flash, rather than making a sound, and the accessibility checker on Word, Excel and Powerpoint,” he says. “Subtitling is great: it’s a massive thing to be able to turn on subtitles in Powerpoint,” he says, adding that it gets better every time you use it.“You can get subtitles for every video on the web, too. And I’ve used Skype for yonks, but I never realised before that you can turn on subtitles for every single Skype call, and you can download the transcript at the end of it. That’s so good for business meetings.”In the future, Rex is looking forward to more trips and continuing to use his platform to inspire others and break down stereotypes, particularly among young people.“Deafness is associated with people who are old! But there are so many deaf kids who don’t have any role models. And there’s a wide spectrum of deafness, too: people who use sign language, people who have mild hearing loss and so on. I want to say: you can do this. If I can do it, you can do it. It’s all about standing up and believing in yourself,” he says.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

What is it about malts, bourbons and blends that inspires such dedication?Few drinks inspire the way whisky does. Proud Scottish writer and raconteur Compton Mackenzie declared: “Love makes the world go round? Not at all. Whisky makes it go round twice as fast.” And Irish playwright and activist George Bernard Shaw romantically described whisky as “liquid sunshine”.While it’s easy to conjure the image of the spirit being swilled by middle-aged men wearing tweed the truth is that whisky’s appeal knows no boundaries. It’s been the go-to drink of celebrities (as well as politicians) for decades. Everyone from Kate Moss - who once threw a Burns Night party in a hotel that stocks 1,000 bottles - to Hollywood royalty such as Humphrey Bogart and Ava Gardner, to Margaret Thatcher, have been keen fans … and they know it’s much more than just a drink. Tobermory whisky holds true to that philosophy. Born and distilled on the Isle of Mull, it’s a homage to the rich palate of its Hebridean home, where creativity and nature exist side by side.Tobermory’s spirit is rich with character and culture, like some of history’s most expressive whisky-lovers. Here’s what they have to say about one of life’s finest pleasures.Ol’ Blue Eyes Frank Sinatra enjoyed a whisky on stage during his shows - so much so he was even buried with a bottle in 1998. He famously said: “Alcohol may be man’s worst enemy, but the bible says love your enemy.”It’s no wonder his second wife, Ava Gardner, loved it too. She once said: “I wish to live to 150 years old, but the day I die, I wish it to be with a cigarette in one hand and a glass of whiskey in the other.”According to some – although this is much contested – Humphrey Bogart’s last words were: “I should never have switched from scotch to martinis.”Winston Churchill drank a whisky and soda every day at 11am. During the war in India, he said: “The water was not fit to drink. To make it palatable, we had to add whisky. By diligent effort, I learned to like it.”Margaret Thatcher also enjoyed whisky and soda, believing it gave her strength. “You must have whisky to give you energy,” she said.Carry On legend Sid James kept bottles to hand on set, after quickly learning he got sent freebies if he could sneak them into shot. Shortly after James’s death, Les Dawson was in the dressing room of the theatre where James had collapsed when he saw a ghostly apparition – and the room began to smell of whisky.Fancying a lifestyle change, their pal Tommy Cooper once joked: “I’m on a whisky diet. I’ve lost three days already.”Mark Twain, author of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, was also in the “less is more” camp – until it came to the spirit. “Too much of anything is bad,” he declared, “but too much good whiskey is barely enough.”To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62c72ca9e7385e9f0198b73c823d891108ebe08f/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c6457d70c65c9744ad215d549d8d100","title":"zambia seeks to expel london listed copper miner vedanta","story":"Move comes amid row over alleged underinvestment and underpayment of taxesThe government of Zambia has defended its efforts to kick London-listed copper miner Vedanta Resources out of the country, in an escalating row over tax and alleged underinvestment.The southern African nation’s national mining vehicle, ZCCM, is seeking to have Vedanta subsidiary Konkola Copper Mines (KCM), its partner in the country’s largest copper mine, placed into liquidation.Vedanta responded earlier this week by seeking to have the case referred to arbitration in South Africa.The Zambian government, including its president, Edgar Lungu, has accused KCM of underpayment of idends and taxes, as well as underinvestment in the mine, a crucial plank in Zambia’s copper-fuelled economy. It appointed a liquidator to run the company in May.“We need the idends from that mine to invest in schools, to invest in hospitals,” the Zambian information minister, Dora Siliya, said.“We can’t keep talking like this over and over. We want a partner that we can work with so we can invest elsewhere. The time for mediation is over.”“This is not nationalisation, it is not compulsory liquidation, it is following law.”She added that local suppliers in Zambia’s mining region, known as the Copperbelt, had been made to wait for payments, hurting the local economy.A South African court has ruled that the sale process should be halted but the government has pressed on regardless.One source within the Zambian tax authorities said the company owed about $100m (£82m) in VAT, customs duties and other taxes, even once refunds due to the company were taken into account. The source added that KCM, which has previously been criticised over pollution, has also withheld $10m (£8.2m) in idend payments.“On the balance of numbers they owe the government more than they are owed. They’ve not been consistent in meeting their tax obligations. It’s a worsening situation.”Vedanta disputed this, saying that it was owed $164m (£139m) by the Zambian Revenue Authority and had not been informed about outstanding payments it was required to make.The Indian-owned company said it had “fulfilled its commitments” in Zambia and was concerned about the “apparent misuse of the legal process” by ZCCM.It said it had paid $2.3bn (£1.9bn) in wages, $1.2bn (£1bn) in power bills and $700m (£576m) in taxes and royalties since 2006, as well as $72m (£59m) in idends.It admitted KCM had made local suppliers wait for payment but blamed this on the financial stresses caused by the tripling of power costs, tax increases, import restrictions on copper concentrate and the government’s failure to pay VAT refunds."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3972952.1564572254!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"that new car smell and other consumer enigmas","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDoes a new car  really smell good or do you just think it does?

It also outlines the significant economic and political risks for the Republic, warning that exceptional measures would be needed to save jobsThe draft version of the risks register –which outlines a range of economic, political and social risks facing the country – was published earlier this year and interest groups have subsequently fed in their observations. The revised version of the register, published on Monday, includes new warnings about the risks of paramilitary violence in Northern Ireland after Brexit.Following submissions in the consultation process querying the Border poll issue, the document says that it is not for the risk register to deal in detail with the “very important and sensitive policy issues “raised by this. However, it says that the Government “ has always recognised the need for advance preparations for referenda and this would be of particular importance in the case of a Border poll given the potential impact on all the people of the island of Ireland”. It adds that “the lessons of the UK Brexit Referendum are of particular resonance in this context.”With a no-deal Brexit now appearing a greater threat, following the election of Boris Johnson as Conservative leader, the register warns that “uncertainty around a physical border on the island could also be expected to become a focus for dissident republican paramilitary recruitment and activity”. Garda and PSNI authorities have said publicly that any border infrastructure or personnel would become targets for dissident republican paramilitaries and require police or other protection, it says,“A no-deal Brexit also has the potential to become a focus for increased loyalist paramilitary recruitment and activity, including in response to dissident republican paramilitary actions and an increased public focus on a Border poll, “ the register warns. It emphasises that the Government wants to see the Stormont institutions restored and says that if they were not in place in the event of a no-deal Brexit, there was risk that the UK government could seek to impose direct rule. “The central priority of the Government in this regard is to work urgently and in partnership with the UK Government to support the restoration of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement to full operation,” it says.While questions had been raised about the applicability of any special arrangements reached for Northern Ireland to the case of Scotland, the register said that the situation in the North was unique, given the Good Friday Agreement and thus not directly comparable to Scotland.The report warns that that Brexit will “amplify” potential looming risks to the Irish economy. It says that regardless of the form Brexit takes, it will impact negatively on the Irish economy “which in turn will have implications both for other potential risks for the economy including the risk of overheating and loss of competitiveness on the one hand, as well as impacting on social risks identified, including expectations for public expenditure, and risks and issues around migration and integration, to name but two”. The report states that Brexit can be seen as “an overarching, umbrella risk, interacting with and amplifying the majority of the risks identified across the geopolitical, economic, social, environmental and technological spheres”.CompetitivenessThe report also warns of the risk of the economy overheating , causing risks to competitiveness. It also cautions that expectations of the extent of additional resources available to address social and economic problems may be unrealistic.“Public expectations of additional expenditure are an increasing concern, especially at this point in the economic cycle,” it says.“There are also indications that escalating trade conflicts at the international level now appear to be impacting growth, with the IMF warning national governments to prepare for an ‘economic storm’ as global growth levels undershoot expectations.”It finds that as a small open economy “Ireland is highly exposed to such fluctuations in global economic and trading conditions, and the economic risks in this context for Ireland are significant.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

"},{"url":null,"title":"ex psni chief north s lack of progress on past tragic","story":"Former Police Service of Northern Ireland chief constable, Sir Hugh Orde is one of the few people who actually made practical progress on dealing with the past during his time in Northern Ireland. Today, he wonders, as everyone else flounders trying to bring forward a solution that will win the support of both communities, if a model he created 14 years ago still might have useful application.Dealing with the past, the unsolved killings, the wounds, the misery left, is a very emotive and explosive subject, though it is one which Boris Johnson, newly-installed in No 10 Downing Street, has quickly waded into.Early in July before he won the election for Conservative Party leader Johnson told the Sun newspaper that “we need to end unfair trials of people who served Queen and country”.He also told the newspaper he would look at the issue of a proposed law change whereby former or serving British soldiers, including those who served in Northern Ireland, would not face prosecution for alleged offences that were more than a decade old.Shortly after entering Downing Street Johnson appointed former British army officer Johnny Mercer as minister for veterans, prompting Sinn Féin to raise concerns that Johnson’s government would extend a proposed amnesty for ex-soldiers to former soldiers who served in Northern Ireland.This is all against the toxic backdrop of the campaign on behalf of Soldier F charged in relation to two Bloody Sunday killings.More generally it is also against the equally poisonous backdrop of the failure to deal with the past in Northern Ireland.It is almost ten years since Orde stood down as chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. He has moved on but there is one issue that still riles him, still triggers his passion, and that is the mortal wound inflicted on the Historical Enquiries Team (HET) by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary in 2013.‘Less rigour’That year a report from an inspectorate team headed by another English former chief constable Stephen Otter found that the HET reviewed some killings committed by the British army and Royal Ulster Constabulary during the Troubles with “less rigour” than other cases.That effectively was the death knell for the HET, even though it stumbled on for about another year. Nationalists wouldn’t go near it after that.Orde, still furious, feels that Otter had no understanding of the HET or Northern Ireland, and all its complexities. “It’s the only thing I really got angry about in policing,” he says, recalling the publication of the inspectorate’s report in Belfast in July 2013. He had stood down in 2009 with Matt Baggott taking over as PSNI chief. Baggott accepted the inspectorate’s report in full – an additional matter that infuriates Orde.“If I had been there when the report came out I would have called a press conference and thrown it in the bin on live television. I would have said, ‘Now what are we going to do? We are going to keep going. Take me to court if you want.’ We would have finished it.“The ultimate success of the inspectorate’s report was to stop the one thing that was trying to do its best to do something about the past.”The remit of the HET was to review some 3,500 Troubles-related killings. They got through 2,000 of them and, as Orde believes, if it had continued its work those reviews could be finished by now.Instead the past remains an insoluble and debilitating drain on Northern Ireland. Thousands of people who were injured or maimed or bereaved continue to suffer trauma and deep physical, emotional and mental pain.Prosecution rateOne of the key proposals currently being considered by the British government is a new Historical Investigations Unit (HIU) that would have more clout than its processor, the HET.Last October eight members of the House of Lords with direct experience of Northern Ireland voiced their opposition to the HIU. They included former Northern secretaries Peter Hain, John Reid, Paul Murphy and Tom King Chris Patten, whose report on police reform led to the creation of the PSNI and the former Church of Ireland primate Archbishop Robin Eames.They noted how, of the HET cases which were concluded, “only 17 were referred to the public prosecution service, and only three resulted in prosecutions for murder”.With such a poor prosecution rate they argued that, rather than create the HET’s proposed more powerful successor, the HIU, it would be far better to use the £150 million earmarked for that organisation for victims and survivors of the Troubles.In July the Northern Ireland Office published a summary of some 17,000 public submissions to its consultation on the past.It was clear in those responses that there is nothing approximating to an agreed view on the past or on the HIU. Different families, as victims’ groups acknowledge, have different requirements: some just want the truth while others seek truth and justice. Others worry about the rewriting of history while a “clear majority” feel an amnesty or statute of limitations for Troubles-related offences would “not be appropriate”.Johnson, in the aforementioned Sun interview, raised the possibility of an effective amnesty for former British soldiers. But an amnesty for one would result in a demand for an amnesty for all – which would infuriate many victims and their representatives.The issue is contentious and live but despite the consultation there is no deadline for when the British government will pronounce on the way forward.‘Bonkers’The evidence from the HET is that, while truth is possible, there is very little prospect of justice by way of prosecutions. Politicians must know this but because the past is such a sensitive and emotional issue, most appear incapable of negotiating a path to a solution.Orde, as straight-talking as he was in his chief constable days, has no such reservations. He believes that the fact that the HET, which addressed killings chronologically, was getting close to more modern-day murders was a factor in its demise. “I think it just suited people to get rid of it.”He still has faith in his design of the HET which was established in 2005 and effectively folded in 2014. It was pressure from families that prompted the HET, he explains: “I realised in 2003 when I started thinking about this that the chances of getting a conviction were close to zero simply because of time, not because of lack of ambition.”“The notion that even further down the line that the HIU is going to bring any satisfaction of any nature through a judicial nature is absolutely bonkers,” he adds.“There is less chance now, not more. All they are going to do is raise false hope among families that something is going to happen.”Orde trenchantly argues that the HET, had it been allowed to complete its job, would not have done away with all the hurt but at least Northern Ireland would be far further on in confronting the past.As Orde expresses it the HET was designed to do what was possible. “We realised from the beginning it was never going to be perfect. We realised some families would not want to go near it.“I know what the ambition was because I invented it. It was the only unique idea I ever had in policing. It was about to give families more information than they ever had before. And of course if we did get evidence we would run the case.”One-off paymentPoliticians, victims groups and community leaders have been struggling and failing for years to tackle this issue. In 2009 Lord Eames, with former vice-chairman of the North’s Policing Board Denis Bradley, got close when they produced the report of the Consultative Group on the Past, more generally known as the Eames-Bradley report.Orde says whatever the British government ultimately devises to deal with the past – if it can ever grasp that nettle – will be modelled on the template produced by Eames-Bradley – “but less effective, I would have thought”.Eames-Bradley proposed a five-year Legacy Commission that would include an investigative body to replace the HET an information recovery unit to allow the bereaved discover to how and why their loved ones were killed £100 million for projects to address sectarianism and other reconciliation issues and no more public inquiries into controversial killings.Those proposals never were implemented, largely because of considerable public and political opposition to an additional Eames-Bradley recommendation that relatives of all people killed in the Troubles, including paramilitary families, should receive a one-off “recognition payment” of £12,000.Well-placed sources said that Eames-Bradley had support for this controversial recommendation from several politicians, including the late Ian Paisley.“Everyone seized on the compensation issue,” recalls Orde. “The only reason that went in was because at the private hearings people said they wanted such compensation but then they all denied it and sold it down the river.”Still, he muses, perhaps it would have been better if the payment was excluded from the report.The second major push was the December 2014 Stormont House Agreement which proposed the controversial HIU an independent commission on information retrieval where perpetrators could tell the truth about their involvement in Troubles killings without fear of prosecution and an oral history archive where victims and others could tell their stories of the conflict. The similarities with Eames-Bradley are obvious.But, despite the consultation and all the wider structured proposals to tackle the legacy of the Troubles, nothing tangible has happened.What families wantedOrde believes that a realistic appraisal of what is possible is required. The search for perfection won’t work, is his argument – the best is the enemy of the good.He knows that, considering the pain and trauma of the bereaved and survivors, it is difficult to urge realism, or to argue that if there were only three prosecutions from 2,000 killings that there would be even less prospect several years further on of many prosecutions arising from HIU investigations. Here some families acknowledge that the HIU won’t get justice for them but they contend that with stronger teeth it might have a better chance of delivering truth.Orde says the HET also sought to achieve convictions. What made it different, he adds, was that it was victims and families’ focused. “The first thing the HET did was sit down and ask the families what they wanted. We asked them what it was they hadn’t known in the past. They wanted to know all sorts of things: did the person die alone, was there someone with them, were they in pain, what way were they facing, was it a good investigation? All those things are really important to families, and that hadn’t happened before.”If families didn’t get justice they frequently got truth. Former BBC and Irish Press journalist Ann Cadwallader, a case worker with the Pat Finucane Centre human rights group, acknowledges that her book, Lethal Allies, partly was based on HET reviews. That book exposed the workings of the infamous Glennane Gang from mid-Ulster who, in regular collusion with RUC officers and Ulster Defence Regiment soldiers, was implicated in more than 120 loyalist paramilitary killings between 1972 and 1978.Cadwallader isn’t universally approving, saying that some HET inquiries were “shoddily” handled, and that some of the work was “patchy”, but that generally it did good work and brought considerable consolation to a lot of families. “Without the HET, Lethal Allies would never have been written,” she says.And not that there was much doubt the HET officially nailed the lie that the killings of ten Protestant workmen at Kingsmill in south Armagh was carried out by a splinter republican group, the South Armagh Republican Action Force. The IRA was responsible for the “purely sectarian” and “calculated slaughter” of the textile workers, the HET found.Numerous other families, whether their loved ones were killed by republicans or loyalists, or the British army or RUC, also got varying degrees of relief. “The HET did exactly what I wanted to do, to work through from start to finish each case and try and bring some resolution to families,” says Orde. “If it got a conviction, brilliant if we didn’t then the families would get some satisfaction. The satisfaction rates we had were in the 90 per cents. If families did not want to engage that was their absolute right.”The former chief constable rejects the notion that it was biased in favour of British soldiers and the RUC. “There was no favouritism given whatsoever,” he insists, while adding, “But what people seem to have forgotten is that, of the 3,000-plus people who died, the vast majority of them were not killed by the state.”He says he has memories of archive murder files from the 1970s relating to the killings of police officers. They were barely half an inch thick because the “cop investigating the murder of a cop one week was himself murdered the following week”.‘We don’t learn’Orde is 60. After the PSNI he was president of the Association of Chief Police Officers in England. He now runs a consulting business dealing with police reform and counter terrorism issues. He is also involved with Tony Blair’s former chief of staff Jonathan Powell in international peace-process matters. He has been in “challenging parts of the world trying to negotiate” conflict issues and is coming to believe that people just can’t or won’t take the lessons of history. “What we learn is that we don’t learn,” he says.He adds that he is “staggered” by the lack of progress on the past in Northern Ireland. “It is just tragic, absolutely tragic.”“The consequence is that the families have nothing. If they think a new sort of quasi-legal police unit is going to investigate everything and is going to solve the problem well it isn’t, it just isn’t. It’s not going to get close.”A Historical Investigations Unit modelled on the HET might have some chance, he allows. But – his anger still palpable – he can’t resist adding, “If it’s the same as the HET why on earth did they close the HET down?”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3977040.1564938181!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no deal brexit can be averted says british labour party","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Tory government has urged the EU to seek a new negotiating mandate from the 27 member states because the UK will not accept a Brexit deal involving the Border backstop. Downing Street would be wrong to think it is already too late for MPs to stop a no-deal Brexit, the British Labour party has said.The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said on Sunday he did not accept a claim, attributed to Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s key adviser, that even if MPs were to pass a vote of no confidence in the prime minister in the autumn, the electoral timetable means that any general election would not take place in time to stop the UK from leaving the European Union on October 31st.“There will be opportunities when parliament returns in September to stop no deal,” Ashworth told Sky.The issue of what is or is not possible in September is crucial because Johnson has said he is determined to take the UK out of the EU at the end of October come what may. A majority of MPs oppose a no-deal Brexit, but opinion is ided as to whether they can mobilise in such a way in September as to stop this happening.According to the Sunday , Cummings has told colleagues it is too late for MPs to use a no-confidence vote to deliver a change of government before October 31st. “If there is a no-confidence vote in September or October, we’ll call an election for after 31 October and leave anyway,” Cummings has reportedly said.This view is based on an analysis from the House of Commons library saying that, because of the timetable for an election following a vote of no confidence under the Fixed-terms Parliament Act, the vote would have to be on Tuesday, September 3rd for an election definitely to take place before October 31st.For a debate to take place on September 3rd, the first day back after the summer recess, Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, would have had to table a no-confidence motion before recess. But that did not happen.In an interview on Sky, Ashworth did not address the argument about the timing of a no-confidence motion, but said other mechanisms would be available to MPs in the autumn.“Let’s see what happens in September,” he said. “Because the government will have to bring forward appropriate legislation to prepare for this Brexit no-deal exit that they want. And we will use all the means available to us, working across the parties – because we know there are plenty of Tory MPs who want to block no deal as well, particularly a lot of those who Boris Johnson, perhaps rather foolishly in retrospect, sacked from the cabinet two weeks ago.“We’re working with MPs across the House of Commons, and we will work to stop no deal.”BackstopIn a separate development, Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has used an article in the Mail on Sunday to urge Michel Barnier to seek a new negotiating mandate from the EU 27 because the UK will not accept a Brexit deal involving the Border backstop. In the article, which is published under the headline “You don’t have a mandate now, Monsieur Barnier. Go back to you EU masters”, Barclay argues that the “political realities” have changed since the EU set out its negotiating mandate for Barnier to follow.“Since the last mandate was agreed, 61 per cent of all the EU states’ MEPs have changed. Such a fundamental shift illustrates the need for a change of approach,” Barclay writes.“Mr Barnier needs to urge EU leaders to consider this if they too want an agreement, to enable him to negotiate in a way that finds common ground with the UK. Otherwise, no deal is coming down the tracks.”Johnson has said repeatedly that the backstop – the mechanism intended to keep Northern Ireland aligned to EU single-market and customs rules, to prevent the need for border controls with Ireland if the final Brexit outcome does not achieve this – must be abandoned. –  Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

basking best ever summer thanks hot weather","story":"The population of the common blue butterfly is expected to boom because of record heatwaves.Experts believe the insect may be enjoying its best ever summer, due to soaring temperatures in July and an above-average forecast for this month.The common blue has been struggling for 40 years, according to the Butterfly Conservation charity, but last summer the population increased by 104 per cent thanks to warm weather.Overall, butterfly numbers rose by 110 per cent in England last year, compared with 2017, and 94 per cent in Wales, according to the charity. The long-term trend had seen three quarters of species decline since 1976.Butterflies are particularly sensitive to climate change and destruction of habitats. Any decline in numbers is a clearly visible early warning sign of wider insect loss, experts say.Without butterflies, birds that rely on them for food and plants that depend on them for pollination will die out, leading to a knock-on effect further up the food chain.The male common blue has bright blue, unmarked wings, whereas the female is decorated with orange crescents and dark spots near the wing-tips, with a tinge of blue closer to the body.Dr Zoe Randle, a senior surveys officer for the charity, said: “People should be able to spot these butterflies in National Park areas as their caterpillars mainly feed on the wildflower common bird’s foot trefoil.”The painted lady butterfly, which has orange, brown and white markings, could also enjoy a record year.Butterfly Conservation is urging people

food customers can tricked choosing healthier options switching","story":"Researchers from universities in Manchester and the University of Warwick found that sales of Coke Zero increased and sales of Coca-Cola decreased - both by more than 300 per store when the menu order was switched  University of ManchesterUniversity of WarwickIt is best known for its meal deals, calorie-laden fast foods and for being a guilty pleasure.Yet McDonald\u0027s - home of the Big Mac, Happy Meal, and McNuggets - has discovered how to “trick” customers into choosing healthier meal options. The revelation came about when the fast-food chain changed the position of items on the menu. It found that customers using touch-screen order kiosks were persuaded to choose less sugary options when researchers changed the order of the list of soft drinks.The icon for Coke Zero, which contains no sugar, was moved to the first spot on the top left of the touch screens in 622 stores for 12 weeks in 2016.Meanwhile, Coca-Cola - which contains 140 calories per can - was relocated down the list to the lowest location on the screens.Almost two thirds of adults in the UK are overweight or obeseResearchers from universities in Manchester and the University of Warwick found that sales of Coke Zero increased and sales of Coca-Cola decreased - both by more than 300 per store.Customers expecting Coca-Cola to be in a certain place were prompted to consider the sugar-free alternative when the two were swapped.The authors believe that, by disrupting the expectation of the consumer, they were given a chance to reconsider their otherwise habitual menu choice.The swap was effective regardless of how deprived the area the restaurant was in, the study, published in the Psychology \u0026amp Marketing journal, found.Dr Ivo Vlaev, a behavioural scientist from Warwick Business School who co-authored the study, said he found it shocking that such a significant change had been observed, given that all of the options were still available to consumers.He said: You can call it a cognitive trick. It\u0027s based on a bias, or a psychological blind spot we have when we are looking at the range of options in front of us or the world outside of us, because we focus our attention on things that are more salient, or are immediately coming in front of us - our eyes follow certain patterns when we are looking at the world, as when you\u0027re reading a page in a magazine.The researchers initially worked with McDonald\u0027s, which funded the study, to make Coke Zero the default choice when ordering a meal.However, they were not able to do this because some people are allergic to the sweeteners used to replace sugar.They also tried to get staff to prompt customers to choose healthier options but found that they did not always have time or remember, Dr Vlaev said.He said that other retailers should take note of the promising results, amid policy interventions such as the sugar tax and rules around fast food outlets by schools.University of ManchesterUniversity of WarwickComment: The Royal Navy has been decimated, but Iran\u0026#39s insolence shows why Britain must still rule the wavesSutton Hoo gets £4m transformation to be more than \u0026#39a field with bumps\u0026#39Malaysian police search for Irish girl, 15, missing from resortHong Kong paralysed in citywide strike as anti-government protests continue into third monthMurder inquiry launched after woman, 89, found dead after attack in her own homeTrump says ‘hate has no place’ in US after two mass killingsButterfly basking in \u0026#39best ever summer\u0026#39 thanks to hot weatherNew tax adds to steep rise in the cost of dyingEmma Watson helps launch sexual harassment advice line for womenRip-off pension funds must be forced to disclose fees after making a \u0026#39fat living\u0026#39 off people\u0026#39s savings, MPs sayPolice deploy drones in hunt for sheep rustlers as battle against rural crime goes high-techEl Paso shooting: Texas massacre investigated as domestic terrorDayton seconds away from a \u0026#39catastrophic loss of life\u0026#39 as gunman who killed nine named as Connor BettsHeathrow Airport chaos persists even as strike is suspendedWhaley Bridge residents putting \u0026#39officers\u0026#39 lives at risk\u0026#39, as 35 homes still refuse to evacuateComment: Boris Johnson is right to prioritise the NHS – it shows voters he cares as much about security as freedom Boris Johnson pledges hospital upgrades in Leave-voting seats as he attempts to see off Brexit Party threatPolice could be allowed to mount \u0026#39emergency\u0026#39 stop and searches in knife crime hotspots for up to 48 hours Holidaymakers given reprieve over cancelled Heathrow flights in pay strike farceWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"french inventor franky zapata has successfully crossed english","story":"An inventor nicknamed the “flying Frenchman” on Sunday became the first person to cross the Channel on a jet-powered hoverboard barely larger than a tea-tray.“This feels magnificent,” said a triumphant Franky Zapata after he touched down in St Margaret’s Bay in Kent, just 23 minutes after taking off from Sangatte beach in Calais to cheers and shouts of “Go Franky, go”.He flew across the 22-mile Channel at an average speed of 87 mph, about 50 to 65 feet above the water, on his self-designed hoverboard, powered by five turbojets.It was fuelled by a backpack containing enough kerosene to keep him airborne for about 10 minutes. He stopped to swap backpacks on a boat in mid-Channel, which took no more than two minutes. The 40-year-old’s first attempt had ended in failure when he tumbled into the sea while trying to refuel last month. This time, the refuelling boat was bigger and the landing area was larger.Frenchman who has spent years developing a jet-powered hoverboard will again try to zoom across the English Channel on August 4The French maritime authorities granted permission to keep the boat in French waters, which they had refused to do last time, citing safety concerns. Mr Zapata had blamed that decision for his initial failure.This time he was escorted by three helicopters while French navy ships kept an eye out in case of mishaps on one of the world’s busiest shipping routes.“There were no problems,” he said after reaching the picturesque bay where dozens of supporters and journalists were waiting.“Thanks so much to my team, and my wife,” said the former jet ski champion and army reservist from Marseille.“For the last five or six kilometres I just really enjoyed it. Whether this is a historic event or not, I’m not the one to decide that, time will tell. We made a machine three years ago… and now we’ve crossed the Channel.”Breaking into tears of joy, he added: “It’s crazy.”Franky Zapata stands on his jet-powered \u0026#34flyboard\u0026#34 next to helicopters as he arrives at St. Margaret\u0026#39s Bay in Dover, on August 4, 2019His team had been racing to repair his “Flyboard” after it was damaged when he crashed 10 days ago. Before his successful crossing, Mr Zapata said he feared that the hoverboard might develop “a little problem” as there had been no time to put it through prolonged tests, which he would normally have done before “a big event”.The weather was perfect, with a calm sea, hardly any wind and temperatures just above 25 degrees C. Mr Zapata hopes his device will eventually be used as a revolutionary piece of military equipment. “We created a new way of flying,” he said. “We don’t use wings. You are like a bird. It is your body that’s flying. It is a boyhood dream. We want to follow a little bit in the footsteps of the pioneers of aviation.”Comment: The Royal Navy has been decimated, but Iran\u0026#39s insolence shows why Britain must still rule the wavesSutton Hoo gets £4m transformation to be more than \u0026#39a field with bumps\u0026#39Malaysian police search for Irish girl, 15, missing from resortHong Kong paralysed in citywide strike as anti-government protests continue into third monthMurder inquiry launched after woman, 89, found dead after attack in her own homeTrump says ‘hate has no place’ in US after two mass killingsButterfly basking in \u0026#39best ever summer\u0026#39 thanks to hot weatherNew tax adds to steep rise in the cost of dyingEmma Watson helps launch sexual harassment advice line for womenRip-off pension funds must be forced to disclose fees after making a \u0026#39fat living\u0026#39 off people\u0026#39s savings, MPs sayFast-food customers can be \u0026#39tricked\u0026#39 into choosing healthier options by switching menu order, study findsPolice deploy drones in hunt for sheep rustlers as battle against rural crime goes high-techEl Paso shooting: Texas massacre investigated as domestic terrorDayton seconds away from a \u0026#39catastrophic loss of life\u0026#39 as gunman who killed nine named as Connor BettsHeathrow Airport chaos persists even as strike is suspendedWhaley Bridge residents putting \u0026#39officers\u0026#39 lives at risk\u0026#39, as 35 homes still refuse to evacuateComment: Boris Johnson is right to prioritise the NHS – it shows voters he cares as much about security as freedom Boris Johnson pledges hospital upgrades in Leave-voting seats as he attempts to see off Brexit Party threatPolice could be allowed to mount \u0026#39emergency\u0026#39 stop and searches in knife crime hotspots for up to 48 hours Holidaymakers given reprieve over cancelled Heathrow flights in pay strike farceWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 4 august 2019","story":"Firefighters battle the Marsh Fire near Brentwood, Calif.Comment: The Royal Navy has been decimated, but Iran\u0026#39s insolence shows why Britain must still rule the wavesSutton Hoo gets £4m transformation to be more than \u0026#39a field with bumps\u0026#39Malaysian police search for Irish girl, 15, missing from resortHong Kong paralysed in citywide strike as anti-government protests continue into third monthMurder inquiry launched after woman, 89, found dead after attack in her own homeTrump says ‘hate has no place’ in US after two mass killingsButterfly basking in \u0026#39best ever summer\u0026#39 thanks to hot weatherNew tax adds to steep rise in the cost of dyingEmma Watson helps launch sexual harassment advice line for womenFast-food customers can be \u0026#39tricked\u0026#39 into choosing healthier options by switching menu order, study findsRip-off pension funds must be forced to disclose fees after making a \u0026#39fat living\u0026#39 off people\u0026#39s savings, MPs sayPolice deploy drones in hunt for sheep rustlers as battle against rural crime goes high-techEl Paso shooting: Texas massacre investigated as domestic terrorDayton seconds away from a \u0026#39catastrophic loss of life\u0026#39 as gunman who killed nine named as Connor BettsHeathrow Airport chaos persists even as strike is suspendedWhaley Bridge residents putting \u0026#39officers\u0026#39 lives at risk\u0026#39, as 35 homes still refuse to evacuateComment: Boris Johnson is right to prioritise the NHS – it shows voters he cares as much about security as freedom Boris Johnson pledges hospital upgrades in Leave-voting seats as he attempts to see off Brexit Party threatPolice could be allowed to mount \u0026#39emergency\u0026#39 stop and searches in knife crime hotspots for up to 48 hours Holidaymakers given reprieve over cancelled Heathrow flights in pay strike farceWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/19/TELEMMGLPICT000187246571_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"rather tat loving tourist traveller holiday","story":"Is that monstrous regiment of boozers, brawlers and bangers really becoming shy on holiday?I nearly choked on my preprandial Slippery Nipple when I read that British holidaymakers – that monstrous regiment of boozers, brawlers and bangers regarded with shock and awe from the alleyways of Amsterdam to the beaches of the Costa Blanca – are becoming shy.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018Siri, Apple’s iconic voice assistant, allows users to work their iPhone without using their hands, and can send messages, make calls and open multiple applications with voice commands alone.Consumers have become accustomed to calling out names for popular voice assistants, such as Amazon Inc’s Alexa, Google Inc’s Google Assistant, among others.In an effort to perform quality checks and improve the voice assistant’s responses, contractors graded Siri’s answers to user queries. They also looked at whether the response was triggered accidentally, without a deliberate query from the user, the newspaper said.Amazon, which operates the hugely-popular Alexa assistant, is yet to make a similar commitment to Apple and Google, despite admitting in April that\u0026nbspemployees can listen to customer voice recordings\u0026nbspfrom Echo and other Alexa-enabled smart speakers.“This information helps us train our speech recognition and natural language understanding systems, so Alexa can better understand your requests, and ensure the service works well for everyone,” Amazon said in a statement at the time.“We have strict technical and operational safeguards, and have a zero tolerance policy for the abuse of our system.

Brexit turmoil was blamed for the fall, alongside a world economy undermined by trade tensions. On this measure, UK manufacturing has now shrunk for three consecutive months.\u0026nbspDowning Street and the Treasury declined to respond to Mr Carney’s comments, citing the need to respect central bank independence.\u0026nbspBut Peter\u0026nbspDowd, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury,\u0026nbspsaid the inflation report gave “a bird’s eye view of the mess the Tories have made of our economy, with slumping business investment, weak productivity, stagnant pay, and stuttering growth”.And Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman\u0026nbspChuka Umunna\u0026nbspsaid: “It is perfectly clear Brexit is already harming our economy: the manufacturing sector is nearing record lows and the pound is trapped in stark decline. How can the Tory government claim they can end austerity and grow the economy when their policy of Brexit is pushing it to the brink?“The Liberal Democrat message is now more urgent than ever: give the people a final say, stop Brexit, and with the country back on track, fix the economy. Stopping a no-deal Brexit is vital, but stopping Brexit altogether must be the goal.”Labour MP\u0026nbspRachel Reeves, the chair of the House of Commons Business Committee,\u0026nbspsaid it was “pure recklessness” on the part of the government that it had not ruled out no deal.The £2.1bn committed by Sajid\u0026nbspJavid, the chancellor, to no-deal preparations on Wednesday should be spent on reversing benefit cuts and investing in schools and hospitals, “not shoring up the defences against a tsunami”, said Ms Reeves.Minutes of the Wednesday meeting of the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, released at the same time as the forecasts, showed that the\u0026nbspMPC\u0026nbsphad voted unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.75 per cent.“The\u0026nbspMPC\u0026nbspjudges that underlying GDP growth is likely to remain subdued over the coming year, with Brexit-related uncertainties weighing on spending to a greater extent than in May,” the\u0026nbspBoE\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbspSpeaking to reporters, Mr Carney pointed out that business investment – which accounts for just over 9 per cent of Britain’s GDP – remains low both historically and compared with other countries.\u0026nbspPointing to another constraint on investment that is likely to persist beyond October, he noted that in recent months companies have grown less certain about Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU, with a long-term free trade agreement likely to take “some time” to negotiate. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A section of the dam wall at Toddbrook Reservoir in Derbyshire has collapsed following heavy rainfall in the areaA collapsed bridge near Grinton, North Yorkshire, after parts of the region had up to 82.2mm of rain in 24 hours on TuesdayAcrobats Beren d\u0027Amico, Louis Gift and Charlie Wheeller, from Barely Methodical Troupe perform a routine on Calton Hill in Edinburgh as they bring their debut show Bromance to the Edinburgh FringeTheresa the robotic waitress at The Tea Terrace\u0027s Cobham branch in Surrey.

What they do\u0026nbspknow is that the\u0026nbsproad ahead is\u0026nbsplooking\u0026nbsprockier by the day.\u0026nbspCarney reiterated that the Bank’s forecasts and projections are still predicated on a deal getting done, which is still more or less official government policy. But they’ve been downgraded, in part reflective of the fact that the UK economy has started to seize up as a result of all the uncertainty. \u0026nbspIn the meantime, he and his people have done their best to ensure that, for example, the banking system will be able to cope with the hard shock of a no-deal outcome. The big ones are pretty well capitalised. Hopefully we’ll avoid an RBS or HBOS 2.0 if the yucky stuff hits the fan courtesy of the Conservative Party’s descent into a nationalist pit and its determination to break the country on the back of its fevered fantasies.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Some of them are showing real signs of strain and, as Northern Rock graphically demonstrated, it only takes a small bank tipping up to create a very big mess.At least consumers are behaving in a “prudent manner”. In other words, they’re being careful not to borrow too much to fund their spending, offering some crumbs to Carney and his colleagues. \u0026nbspBut that\u0026nbspcomfort is slim. Really, they’ve been left in the position of crossing their fingers in the hope that something turns up to ert the good ship Britannia from the iceberg its steaming into, because if it hits they’ll be left on the horns of a nasty dilemma.The pound is already plumbing new depths daily. No deal will cause it to fall further.

Brexit turmoil was blamed for the fall, alongside a world economy undermined by trade tensions. On this measure, UK manufacturing has now shrunk for three consecutive months.\u0026nbspDowning Street and the Treasury declined to respond to Mr Carney’s comments, citing the need to respect central bank independence.\u0026nbspBut Peter\u0026nbspDowd, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury,\u0026nbspsaid the inflation report gave “a bird’s eye view of the mess the Tories have made of our economy, with slumping business investment, weak productivity, stagnant pay, and stuttering growth”.And Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman\u0026nbspChuka Umunna\u0026nbspsaid: “It is perfectly clear Brexit is already harming our economy: the manufacturing sector is nearing record lows and the pound is trapped in stark decline. How can the Tory government claim they can end austerity and grow the economy when their policy of Brexit is pushing it to the brink?“The Liberal Democrat message is now more urgent than ever: give the people a final say, stop Brexit, and with the country back on track, fix the economy. Stopping a no-deal Brexit is vital, but stopping Brexit altogether must be the goal.”Labour MP\u0026nbspRachel Reeves, the chair of the House of Commons Business Committee,\u0026nbspsaid it was “pure recklessness” on the part of the government that it had not ruled out no deal.The £2.1bn committed by Sajid\u0026nbspJavid, the chancellor, to no-deal preparations on Wednesday should be spent on reversing benefit cuts and investing in schools and hospitals, “not shoring up the defences against a tsunami”, said Ms Reeves.Minutes of the Wednesday meeting of the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, released at the same time as the forecasts, showed that the\u0026nbspMPC\u0026nbsphad voted unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.75 per cent.“The\u0026nbspMPC\u0026nbspjudges that underlying GDP growth is likely to remain subdued over the coming year, with Brexit-related uncertainties weighing on spending to a greater extent than in May,” the\u0026nbspBoE\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbspSpeaking to reporters, Mr Carney pointed out that business investment – which accounts for just over 9 per cent of Britain’s GDP – remains low both historically and compared with other countries.\u0026nbspPointing to another constraint on investment that is likely to persist beyond October, he noted that in recent months companies have grown less certain about Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU, with a long-term free trade agreement likely to take “some time” to negotiate. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A section of the dam wall at Toddbrook Reservoir in Derbyshire has collapsed following heavy rainfall in the areaA collapsed bridge near Grinton, North Yorkshire, after parts of the region had up to 82.2mm of rain in 24 hours on TuesdayAcrobats Beren d\u0027Amico, Louis Gift and Charlie Wheeller, from Barely Methodical Troupe perform a routine on Calton Hill in Edinburgh as they bring their debut show Bromance to the Edinburgh FringeTheresa the robotic waitress at The Tea Terrace\u0027s Cobham branch in Surrey.

The worst reading since then was in June, an only slightly lower 43.1.“July data revealed declines in house building, commercial work and civil engineering, with all three areas suffering to some degree from domestic political uncertainty and delayed decision-making,” said Tim Moore at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.“If the current speed of construction sector retrenchment is sustained, it will soon ripple through the supply chain, and spillovers to other parts of the UK economy will quickly become apparent.”The measure of the sector’s optimism about the year ahead dropped to its lowest level since November 2012 as firms worried about Brexit, the prospect of a general election and delays to infrastructure work.In the nearer term, the outlook was also bleak as the number of new orders fell sharply, with firms blaming mainly a sluggish economy and political uncertainty.\u0026nbspHoward Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, pointed out this was the first time since 2016 that new orders had fallen for four successive months.\u0026nbsp“The weak July construction survey increases the concern that the UK economy has started the third quarter poorly, after GDP likely stagnated in the second quarter and could have contracted marginally,” he said.\u0026nbspThe PMI measure of the larger manufacturing sector, released on Thursday, was also weak, coming in at 48 –\u0026nbspthe same as in June and the lowest level in six and a half years.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts.

Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This retro R\u0026ampB track doesn’t boast the same slick production of some of the more popular Spice Girls songs, but that’s part of the appeal. It could do without Mel B’s rapping, but you can’t have everything.It’s odd that this wasn’t released as a single, because it’s one of the best in the Spice Girls canon: catchy, slickly produced, and with some of the best harmonies the group had to offer. 310 8) \u0027Walk of Life\u0027Did the Spice Girls pull off a reggae track? Kind of (barely), because it’s a lyrical tribute to “straight-talking London town”, which suited the group just fine. The vivacity of these five young women is arguably only more forceful on “Wannabe”. “Spice Up Your Life” was clumsy in its approach as “a song for the world”, with Latin influences and a Bollywood-inspired video, but the energy of the song is what makes it – the result of the five members recording the track in one chaotic afternoon.Despite the rather bizarre safe-sex disclaimer (“Be a little wiser, baby Put it on, put it on”), “2 Become 1” boasts a beautifully textured arrangement and unpolished vocals that capture the group’s unique character. On Spiceworld, “Viva Forever” was a surprisingly moving ballad that reflected on a past love. With the context of Baby Spice (Geri Halliwell) departing from the group with little-to-no warning for fans, many now use it as a fond reflection on what the Spice Girls contributed to pop culture. Those flamenco guitars and heady summer vibes only add to the sense that, however fleeting that time was, certain memories stay with us forever.This disco-infused number should sound more dated than it actually does. “Who Do You Think You Are” is the Spice Girls at the height of their pop powers a slick, infectious and superbly produced jam with that brass punching through.Mel C gets the spotlight on this funk-influenced number, which was written during the same session as “Love Thing” and features an excellent harmonica solo from Judd Lander. It was their second number one single in the UK – released just as the popularity of “Wannabe” was beginning to wane – and also a top five song in the US.The Spice Girls cribbed a number of musical influences for their catalogue, but Motown is one that really shouldn’t have worked. “Stop”, however, is an uplifting song telling a significant other to slow down and just enjoy the ride, bolstered by a fantastic brass section and a jubilant bass line. A war cry that heralded the dawn of the Girl Power movement, and one of the most enduring pop songs of all time. “Wannabe” is the catchiest of all the Spice Girls songs, and through those defiant, half-laughing spoken word moments you understand why so many fans were desperate to be part of the gang.

Spice Girls told a generation of young girls that friends are more important than boys. She said she was also determined for Victoria Beckham to take part, saying: ”Victoria is Victoria. She didn’t want to do it. She missed out.“But my plan is for all five of us to do Glastonbury next year for the 50th anniversary. I’m in the process of persuading Victoria to do it. And I will make it happen.”Victoria Beckham: ‘It took courage’ to turn down Spice Girls reunion’The Spice Girls show at Wembley was less glitter and more grimacingBeckham, who was known as Posh Spice in the group, had consistently said she did not want to take part in the reunion and that it took “courage” to turn down the invite.“It took me a lot of courage not to go on tour with the Spice Girls again, but to be the one who says: ‘You know, I’m not doing it because things feel different now than they used to’,” she said in an interview with Vogue Germany.“I’d rather concentrate on my family and my company. I’m 45 now and very happy to be the woman I am… I’m not trying to change, I want to be the best version of myself. Before I turned 40, I wasn’t that confident. I learned to listen to my gut feeling.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ticket prices include a carbon-offsetting levy, while even the soap in the stadium toilets is made with grass cuttings from the playing field.Most notably of all, perhaps, fans wanting a half-time pie or burger are offered vegan options only. The stadium is meat- and dairy-free, a state of affairs that has resulted in one of English football’s more surreal chants. “Where,” sing away supporters, “have your hot dogs gone?”Walking into the Forest Green Rovers’ 5,100 capacity stadium, The New Lawn in Nailsworth, there are immediate signs that this is a club on an eco-mission.UK ‘needs to plant 1.5 billion trees’ to tackle climate changeWild planting borders the ground a wind turbine stands in one corner the hoardings advertise things like Quorn and the Sea Shepherd conservation society.Vince, himself – T-shirt, jeans, earrings – buzzes about, speaking to players, groundsmen, kitchen staff. Somehow, he gives the impression of being both entirely energised and laid back to the point of being horizontal. During his 20s, he had repeated run-ins with police at a range of environmental protests, and, despite now\u0026nbspliving in a £4m mansion, still has the vibe of a man who’d consider chaining himself to a tree if push came to shove.The Independent is here because, if the UK is to achieve its now legally enshrined target of achieving zero carbon emissions by 2050, there’s probably no one better qualified to understand the possibilities and potential pitfalls than Dale Vince.After all, if he can make sustainability work in the entrenched, macho world of professional football, everything else should be a piece of dairy-free cake, right?“I would say 2050 is easily doable,” nods the father-of-two over coffee – liquid oats instead of milk – in the club’s green-walled boardroom. “Actually, I think in five years’ time, we could see that target coming down to 2040, which would still be achievable. But the super-important thing is that we now have this target because it’s an acknowledgement there’s a problem and that we have to get to grips with it.”He has previously donated money to both the Labour and Green parties but says he would work with the current Tory government on reducing climate change. He met Theresa May a couple of weeks ago to workshop ideas and would be available if he got the call from Boris Johnson. “This is the biggest problem facing the planet,” he says. “And it will only be solved by people working together.”That turning soccer sustainable hasn’t been easy, there can be little doubt.Rovers fans, certainly, have been known to voice scepticism about Vince’s methods since he took over the club in 2010. Specifically, they have voiced scepticism about their match-day sausage rolls disappearing.“I had someone say to me they used to be able to come here and have a pie and a pint,” smiles Vince. “I said you can still have a pie and pint – but our pies don’t have animal bits in and our pints aren’t made with fish bladders.”Another fan told him his ideas were feminising football. “I said I’ll take that and wear it as a badge of honour,” he says.Firms that don’t respond to climate change ‘will go bankrupt’- CarneyGreta Thunberg to sail across Atlantic for climate summitsGlobal heatwaves are pushing human bodies ‘close to thermal limits’How climate change and mass migration created a village of womenIs he forcing his values on others, though? “Look, there’s a football match here for two hours once a fortnight. So we’re not starving anyone off meat. We’re saying use that opportunity to try something different. And it’s super-tasty. Most people have come on board.”Fans visit from other clubs just to try the food, he reckons. Jamie and Jimmy have been here for their Friday Night Feast. When I later tuck into a burger and nut salad, I can see why. Put it this way, it knocks the socks off a cup of Bovril.Probably more significant in easing these changes through, however, is that they have come alongside – and probably helped bring – success.When Vince, who is originally from Great Yamouth, took over Rovers in 2010, they had just survived relegation to the sixth tier of English football and were facing a winding up order because of mounting debt.“The club asked for £30,000 to help survive that summer,” he recalls. “It’s been here 125 years and is a big part of the community, so why not help? Then in the autumn, that had run out. They said: you need to be chairman. And I said: I really don’t, I have enough going on. But it became clear it was a choice between taking responsibility or it folding. So, there was no choice, really.”There was never a set decision to take the club green as such, he adds – but he also saw no reason why his new project shouldn’t adhere to his lifelong belief in being low impact.Today, nine years on, the club is financially stable, established in League Two following promotion in 2017, and is currently applying to build a new stadium – a sweepingly beautiful design by Zaha Hadid, made all from wood and surrounded (but of course) by trees.Zaha Hadid Architects)Players and coaching staff have bought into Vince’s revolution pretty much from day one. They talk about feeling more energised because of their diet of suffering less soft tissue injuries of recovering quicker between games.“This is the way football is going,” manager Mark Cooper tells me. “Top players like Sergio Aguero have gone vegan to stay sharper longer, and more will do it. We’re just ahead of the curve.”The eco-identity, meanwhile, has created an overseas fan base among supporters who share the philosophy. This season’s new kit has sold in 16 different countries – unheard of for a club at this level. Last season, media from Russia, Japan, the US and Germany were all in the press box at some point.“You’re aware when you come here you have to buy into the principles and be willing to be educated” says defender Matt Mills. “And that breeds success. You’re constantly striving to improve because you’re part of a project that is so ambitious.”So ambitious, indeed, that the UN has now asked the club to lead its new Sport For Climate Action initiative, an international project which will see professional and amateur clubs across the world encouraged – and offered practical help – to reduce their carbon footprint. Many of the ideas shared will be taken directly from Rovers.“It’s pretty amazing,” says Vince. “We’ve gone from a rescue mission of a local football club to, nine years later, advising a global programme of work with the UN.”He shakes his head. “I wasn’t expecting that,” he admits.The journey to here, indeed, has been even more extraordinary when one considers that Vince himself spent much of his youth and young manhood living, as he calls it, “off grid”. As a teenager he dropped out of school early and then spent a decade travelling the country in an old army truck converted to use battery power.In 1991, he parked up on a hill in Stroud for a bit, realised a mini wind turbine he’d installed on the back of his vehicle was generating more electricity than he was using,\u0026nbspand had something of an epiphany.“I just had this moment where I’ve been living this low-impact lifestyle for 10 years,” he says. “And I thought I could spend another 10 years doing the same or I could drop back in to the world and try and build a big windmill on this hill, and do some good for the world.”He chose the latter got permission off the landowner (who was persuaded after Vince hooked up his caravan with electric lights) and spent five years constructing that windmill. His first customer, signed up in 1996, was a college in Cheltenham.“I told their energy manager, ‘You’ll be the first place in the country using green energy’,” he says. “I think he mainly just asked what the bills would be.”From there, Ecotricity, as he named the fledgling company, expanded rapidly.Today, it has 186,000 customers across the UK powered by 70 turbines, generating 80 megawatts of power. It has also opened Britain’s first solar farm, a five-acre site in Lincolnshire which adds another megawatt, and operates a vast network of electric car recharging points.And for the future?The company is confident it will continue to expand as more people – such as those young climate change activists – choose renewable, while Forest Green Rovers are aiming for nothing short of reaching the Championship: they kicked off the new campaign on Saturday with a 1-0 win at home to Oldham. All while continuing to prioritise sustainability in everything it does.“This way isn’t always easy,” says Vince. “But then nothing is, I think. When you’re challenging and pushing boundaries, it’s inevitable you hit obstacles and bumps in the road, but you keep going. It’s too important not to.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The worst reading since then was in June, an only slightly lower 43.1.“July data revealed declines in house building, commercial work and civil engineering, with all three areas suffering to some degree from domestic political uncertainty and delayed decision-making,” said Tim Moore at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.“If the current speed of construction sector retrenchment is sustained, it will soon ripple through the supply chain, and spillovers to other parts of the UK economy will quickly become apparent.”The measure of the sector’s optimism about the year ahead dropped to its lowest level since November 2012 as firms worried about Brexit, the prospect of a general election and delays to infrastructure work.In the nearer term, the outlook was also bleak as the number of new orders fell sharply, with firms blaming mainly a sluggish economy and political uncertainty.\u0026nbspHoward Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, pointed out this was the first time since 2016 that new orders had fallen for four successive months.\u0026nbsp“The weak July construction survey increases the concern that the UK economy has started the third quarter poorly, after GDP likely stagnated in the second quarter and could have contracted marginally,” he said.\u0026nbspThe PMI measure of the larger manufacturing sector, released on Thursday, was also weak, coming in at 48 –\u0026nbspthe same as in June and the lowest level in six and a half years.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Civil society groups and the country’s military began to negotiate over the country’s political future, and women have once again been pushed aside.Created with Sketch.The women at the front of Sudan\u0027s political protests Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Khadija Saleh, 41, a political activist and blogger, poses for a photograph in Khartoum, Sudan. After six years abroad, Saleh returned to her home country when people took to the streets demanding change. She was at a sit-in near the Defence Ministry in Khartoum on June 3 when security forces stormed the site. The area had become a centre for anti-government protests. Saleh said she was beaten with sticks, and still wears bandages on her wounds. I came back from a safer place because I want a better future for this country, she said. Awadiya Mahmoud Koko Ahmed, 60, the head of Food and Tea Sellers Union. I went to see the sit-in area to check what is happening there. I served them free tea with the money my daughter gave me. And we made a kitchen as a group of union members. We prepared food every day. All the people were good. They called me \u0027mom.\u0027 When I was in America, I saw that even animals had rights. If I was the president, I would make sure that there was justice. I would treat everyone equally, she said. Duha Mohmed, 23, student. Mohmed who escaped the sit-in site near the Defence Ministry in Khartoum at the beginning of the June 3 raid, returning later to help the injured, said she was also motivated by a desire for a better life. I don\u0027t want to wear headscarf, but it is not my choice. I want my right to wear what I want.Shems Osman, 32, employee at an international company. Osman studied psychology in Canada. She has Canadian citizenship but she chose to return to Sudan. In Sudan it is definitely different how women carry themselves and how they are treated, and I think this is because of our African culture more than our Arab culture. Sudanese women are just naturally strong. So, they are naturally on the frontline and they are naturally a part of revolution, she said. Mai Atya, 27, a musician. Atya said she was beaten during the raid by security services at a sit-in protest camp outside Khartoum\u0027s Defence Ministry on June 3, 2019. My main objective like many others is that we believe there should be a change a good change in a good direction. I was at the sit-in area during the raid. I heard gun shots and ran away but when I jumped over a fence a Rapid Support Force (RSF) soldier caught us, she said. They kept beating us again and again ... they think women should stay at home. Amel Tajeldin, 41, a housewife and mother of four. Tajeldin said she would take turns with her husband to watch the children so that she could go out and protest. While it was his turn to look after the children, I took part in the demonstrations, she said. She used to teach songs to street children in a makeshift tent at the sit-in. On June 3, members of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces shouted at her and other protesters and told them to run, she said. We ran. We were surrounded by soldiers and policemen, she said. Both her arms are now wrapped in bandages. While we were running, they beat us. To protect my head, I used my hands. This is why my two arms are broken, she said. The ones like us beaten by police were lucky, the ones beaten by RSF members were brutally injured.Nagda Mansour, 39, translator. Mansour who was imprisoned for 75 days after attending a demonstration in December, said it was difficult for many to accept the idea of negotiating with the military because of its leadership\u0027s involvement in the war in Darfur. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), headed by the deputy leader of the council Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, are accused of committing atrocities in Darfur - charges officials have in the past denied. The finalisation of an agreement with the military council remains the beginning not the end, said Mansour. We as human rights defenders want to have a guarantee for transitional justice in Sudan. Hadia Hasaballah, 42, a counsellor and political activist. Hasaballah works for an NGO dealing with the victims of the June 3 raid by the security forces at the sit-in site near the Defence Ministry in Khartoum. She and her team are supporting more than 100 victims. This regime thinks in a traditional way, she said. They know that if they humiliate the women, they will humiliate the whole people... None of the Sudanese women will officially say that they were raped because of the stigma. Samra Siralkhatim, 21, a student. During the June protests, Siralkhatim hid from the military in various people\u0027s homes for five days as she was unable to seek refuge in the Defence Ministry compound as she has in the previous attack. Sudanese are almost like refugees in their own country. During the June 3 raid night, we sought refuge from the military like we did in previous attacks. That time, they let us go into the Defence Ministry compound. But this time, the doors were closed during the raid. Security personnel were laughing and a member of the military behind the fence told us that the military was \u0027taking a holiday\u0027, she said. Mahi Aba-Yazid, 35, unemployed. Under President Omar al-Bashir\u0027s rule, women\u0027s lives were tightly controlled by men, even the way they dressed. Morality laws meant that a woman could be arrested for wearing trousers. For that reason, Aba-Yazid wore trousers while she called for change at the sit-in site near the Defence Ministry in Khartoum on June 3 when security forces stormed the site. She believes she was beaten more because of her choice. There was already a bullet in my arm. I was bleeding but they continued to beat me, she said. Nahid Gabralla, 53, human rights activis. Gabriela said she was beaten with sticks and threatened with rape at a sit-in near the Defence Ministry in Khartoum on June 3 when security forces stormed the site. Sudan can be better, she said. My daughter deserves to live in a nice country... We will fight for a democratic Sudan, real change and for our rights.Manal Farah, 49, housewife. Farah lost her son, a 22-year-old university student, in the violence when security forces stormed the sit-in site near the Defence Ministry in Khartoum on June 3. She said he insisted on protesting even though she asked him to stay home. The aim of the government is to convince mothers of revolutionaries to prevent their sons to join the revolution, but no matter what we say to them they will never stop before achieving their objectives, Farah said. When he started in university he started to ask why there is corruption in Sudan. He said there must be a change, a new Sudan ... I pray for my son\u0027s dreams to come true.

Atya said she was beaten during the raid by security services at a sit-in protest camp outside Khartoum\u0027s Defence Ministry on June 3, 2019. My main objective like many others is that we believe there should be a change a good change in a good direction. I was at the sit-in area during the raid. I heard gun shots and ran away but when I jumped over a fence a Rapid Support Force (RSF) soldier caught us, she said. They kept beating us again and again ... they think women should stay at home. Amel Tajeldin, 41, a housewife and mother of four. Tajeldin said she would take turns with her husband to watch the children so that she could go out and protest. While it was his turn to look after the children, I took part in the demonstrations, she said. She used to teach songs to street children in a makeshift tent at the sit-in. On June 3, members of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces shouted at her and other protesters and told them to run, she said. We ran. We were surrounded by soldiers and policemen, she said. Both her arms are now wrapped in bandages. While we were running, they beat us. To protect my head, I used my hands. This is why my two arms are broken, she said. The ones like us beaten by police were lucky, the ones beaten by RSF members were brutally injured.Nagda Mansour, 39, translator. Mansour who was imprisoned for 75 days after attending a demonstration in December, said it was difficult for many to accept the idea of negotiating with the military because of its leadership\u0027s involvement in the war in Darfur. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), headed by the deputy leader of the council Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, are accused of committing atrocities in Darfur - charges officials have in the past denied. The finalisation of an agreement with the military council remains the beginning not the end, said Mansour. We as human rights defenders want to have a guarantee for transitional justice in Sudan. Hadia Hasaballah, 42, a counsellor and political activist. Hasaballah works for an NGO dealing with the victims of the June 3 raid by the security forces at the sit-in site near the Defence Ministry in Khartoum. She and her team are supporting more than 100 victims. This regime thinks in a traditional way, she said. They know that if they humiliate the women, they will humiliate the whole people... None of the Sudanese women will officially say that they were raped because of the stigma. Samra Siralkhatim, 21, a student. During the June protests, Siralkhatim hid from the military in various people\u0027s homes for five days as she was unable to seek refuge in the Defence Ministry compound as she has in the previous attack. Sudanese are almost like refugees in their own country. During the June 3 raid night, we sought refuge from the military like we did in previous attacks. That time, they let us go into the Defence Ministry compound. But this time, the doors were closed during the raid. Security personnel were laughing and a member of the military behind the fence told us that the military was \u0027taking a holiday\u0027, she said. Mahi Aba-Yazid, 35, unemployed. Under President Omar al-Bashir\u0027s rule, women\u0027s lives were tightly controlled by men, even the way they dressed. Morality laws meant that a woman could be arrested for wearing trousers. For that reason, Aba-Yazid wore trousers while she called for change at the sit-in site near the Defence Ministry in Khartoum on June 3 when security forces stormed the site. She believes she was beaten more because of her choice. There was already a bullet in my arm. I was bleeding but they continued to beat me, she said. Nahid Gabralla, 53, human rights activis. Gabriela said she was beaten with sticks and threatened with rape at a sit-in near the Defence Ministry in Khartoum on June 3 when security forces stormed the site. Sudan can be better, she said. My daughter deserves to live in a nice country... We will fight for a democratic Sudan, real change and for our rights.Manal Farah, 49, housewife. Farah lost her son, a 22-year-old university student, in the violence when security forces stormed the sit-in site near the Defence Ministry in Khartoum on June 3. She said he insisted on protesting even though she asked him to stay home. The aim of the government is to convince mothers of revolutionaries to prevent their sons to join the revolution, but no matter what we say to them they will never stop before achieving their objectives, Farah said. When he started in university he started to ask why there is corruption in Sudan. He said there must be a change, a new Sudan ... I pray for my son\u0027s dreams to come true. Although they made up an estimated 60 to 70 per cent of demonstrators that took down Bashir, women are almost entirely absent from political leadership positions hashing out the country’s future.The high-wire negotiations have a familiar uniform of suits and ties on one side and camouflaged uniforms on the other.“Where are the women?” jokes Sara Abdelgalil, one of the few top officials in the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), the group that organised the protests.“For the last 30 years, women were invisible in politics and we didn’t have women at the top of these organisations.”Sudan’s military and protesters sign power-sharing accordAnd the lack of female leaders in Sudan’s democratic movement is not just a question of equality for the sake of equality, say women’s activists, but will affect the quality of the transition and, ultimately, the success of the revolution.The collapse of Bashir’s rule was followed by negotiations between civilian groups and the army, aimed at reaching a power-sharing agreement.But the civilian groups have fallen into vicious disputes, in part over the fact that the men at the negotiating table do not accurately reflect those demonstrators who catalysed the revolution.Of the dozens of civilians who have participated in the negotiations, only one is a woman, Mervat Hamadelneel, about whom little is known.There has been criticism that the leadership of civilian groups, called the Forces of Freedom and Change, has\u0026nbspbeen more willing to compromise with the country’s junta than the demonstrators they represent would like.“The lack of ersity makes the negotiating team extremely closed-minded and they can’t come up with the results that represent the revolutionary forces,” says Hala Alkharib, the regional director of the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa.“Most of the political parties who are currently negotiating on behalf of the Sudanese people did not invest on addressing the challenges of women, so women are not interested in joining.”At a neighbourhood forum on a hot\u0026nbspKhartoum evening, there is a preview of Sudan’s potential political future.Samahir Mubarak, a 28-year-old pharmacist-turned revolutionary leader, lectures on a stage draped in Sudanese flagsTalks about Sudan’s political future have dragged on in part because the junta has\u0026nbspdemanded control over the next government and wants immunity for the many crimes it is\u0026nbspaccused of, including a 3 June massacre that killed more than 100 people, and the rap-sheet of allegations during the genocide in Darfur.The civilian negotiators are willing to accept that, but many protesters are not. Mubarak is one of the most prominent faces of Sudan’s new political era, and she is considering a career in politics.“We are hopefully going into a new democratic era. Political parties need to reorganise by involving more people, and there is no way you are going to get the votes of women if their views are not going to be represented,” Mubarak says.For the first time Mubarak can remember, a majority of speakers that night are women.Mubarak does not like to plan her speeches in detail, but prefers to feed off the energy of the audience in front of her.“I rely on my instinct,” Mubarak says. “I think it is genetic because my mum is good.”Mubarak believes that women will naturally rise up into political leadership positions in a new democratic era that rewards parties for broader membership. But others are taking a more immediate approach.Protesters, largely women, demonstrated outside the SPA headquarters on Saturday to demand more representation in the country’s political future.Listening to Mubarak speak are a few hundred men in clean white jalabiyas. The robed men sit on one side in thin plastic chairs, and a handful of women sit on the other. This well-off neighbourhood used to be a staunch supporter of Bashir and his regime, but after Mubarak is done speaking she is crowded by admirers.A group of boys tell her how the neighbourhood has transformed to support the revolution, and a woman asks her details for public demonstrations taking place the next day.Mubarak appears to represent the revival of Sudan’s female leaders who were decimated under Bashir’s era. Perhaps Sudan’s biggest\u0026nbspfeminist icon is socialist writer and thinker Fatima Ahmed Ibrahim, born in 1932, who became the country’s first female member of parliament in 1965 and died in London in 2017.Sudan’s protesters paid homage to Ibrahim by putting her face on signs bearing the slogan “Our mother Fatima”. Graffiti artists have tagged her image across Khartoum’s crumbling walls.Ibrahim “was determined and strong, even in high school”, says Fatima Elgalil, a historian of women’s rights in Sudan and a colleague of the former journalist.Ibrahim challenged some of the repressive cultural and legal norms in Sudan, creating a viral magazine that compared women’s rights in Sudan to other countries. But Ibrahim preferred to work in stages of change and did not challenge all of the country’s oppressive norms at once, according to Elgalil.Four children ‘shot dead by security forces’ at Sudan demonstrationDeal between Sudan’s military and opposition falls short of democracySudan’s strongman has a fragile grip on the military – civil war loomsSudan death toll rises to 11 after violent clashesSudan’s former president Omar al-Bashir charged with corruption“You must be flexible,” Elgalil explains of Ibrahim’s tactics.But the generational gap of Sudanese feminists is evident as Elgalil speaks. Elgalil is 84 and her granddaughter Zeinab is 17. As Zeinab listens to her grandmother talk, she agrees with the objectives, but not the approach\u0026nbspof working in gradual steps.“When they grew up and fought in this regime, it was by being women who fit into society.” Zeinab says. “But for us, living in this environment has been very repressive.”Zeinab recounts stories of a friend getting married at 15 and another friend’s cousin being raped at 12 years old. She says that instead of working in steps like Ibrahim, the Sudanese feminist icon, young women are demanding a complete overhaul in women’s rights during protests. “The fact that we are angry and going to fight is very weird for her generation because they took it step by step, but we say: ‘We want to fight.’”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing.

Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.“The idea of the book is that Saddam entered Kuwait without the knowledge of the generals. It was forbidden.”Mutanabbi’s Street’s troubles didn’t end with Hussein. In 2007, a car bomb ripped through the market, killing 30 people and injuring hundreds. It took years for it to recover.Today, the street is alive again, and the bestseller list is moving with the times.“The people who are buying are young people, honestly. They are currently looking for novels, or stories,” says Maher Muhammad, a bookshop owner on the street.“But this thing will not last. What do we say about that?

And Pompeo\u0026nbsptold reporters that a lot of conversations are taking place.\u0026nbspMarine general\u0026nbspJoseph Dunford, the chair\u0026nbspof the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said the Pentagon has developed a specific plan for Operation Sentinel, which would see the US military’s main role as providing “maritime domain awareness” – intelligence and surveillance information – to the ships of coalition partners.Any escorting of commercial ships would be done by military ships sailing under the flag of the commercial vessel, he said.\u0026nbspAfter the US last year pulled out of the Iranian nuclear deal, the Trump administration also increased sanctions against Iran, and this could help explain what we are now seeing in the increasingly tense Strait of Hormuz, said Holly Dagres, Iran expert and non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council.“Iran believes the United States declared economic warfare when it announced as part of its ‘maximum pressure’ policy to bring Iranian oil exports down to zero,” Ms Dagres told The Independent.“Tehran threatened to retaliate by closing the Strait of Hormuz – though it didn’t explain how. What we are seeing in recent weeks is Iran begin to make good on that threat, by making shipping more precarious through the strait.”In rare meeting between Iran and Gulf rival, some see possible harmonyCrew of British oil tanker captured by Iran are ‘safe’Pompeo says ‘responsibility falls to UK to take care of its ships’It is Trump that needs to be deterred from war, not IranBrexit leaves UK with no choice but to do Trump’s bidding in Iran“Whether this latest oil tanker was in fact smuggling oil or not, the United States will point to this latest incident as more incentive for allies to join Operation Sentinel,”\u0026nbspshe added.“Having that been said, if this operation goes into full force, it will likely lead down a path of direct conflict in the near future – as long as Tehran continues to feel the impact of sanctions.”The tanker has been taken to the southern Iranian port city of Bushehr, an IRGC naval commander has said.The cargo of the unnamed ship, which was seized on Wednesday, has been handed over to the National Oil Distribution Company’s branch in Bushehr, Brig-Gen Ramezan Zirahi (Ramazan Zirahi) said, the semi-official ISNA news agency reported on Sunday.“Naval units of IRGC’s\u0026nbspnavy second zone are performing duty as per routine and with all-out intelligence domination to protect the national interests with full force and will not hesitate for a moment in performing this crucial task,” Mr Zirahi said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And so a huge amount of effort is going into that.Mr Johnson, who arrived by helicopter, said he thought they had to get the level of the water down about eight metres, although there was some discussion with the surrounding officials about whether this was the exact figure.He added: I was talking to one of the villagers from Whaley Bridge who said that he remembered something like this happening  years ago.Weve had an exceptional weather event, we must make sure that this dam can cope with it in the future.That will mean a major rebuild, clearly.Those evacuated from their homes were allowed tobriefly last night to pick up any vital items or pets.Around , people were evacuated from the town but most found their own accommodation with family and friends, according to Derbyshire County Council.Police have closed railway lines in the Whaley Bridge area over the risk of potential flooding which is due to continue into the weekend.

FBI agents opened a domestic terrorism investigation, and Texas is considering the death penalty for captured Crusius.His mass shooting — the eighth deadliest in US history — came  hours before a massacre in Dayton, Ohio, ,-miles away, which left nine dead and  injured.In his manesto, titled The Inconvenient Truth and posted on messageboard chan, he cited book The Great Replacement, which promotes a racist theory that whites are being “replaced” by non-whites.Crusius said he supported the Christchurch shooter, who gunned down  Muslims in New Zealand in March, and said his attack was “in response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas”.He wrote: “I’m simply defending my country from cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion. I can’t bring myself to kill my fellow Americans.”He said the US was “rotting from the inside out”, adding that his views “predate Trump and his campaign for president”, despite backing his border wall.Describing how he’d opted for an AK-, he casually added: “I realized pretty quickly that this isn’t a great choice… it’s not designed to shoot rounds quickly.”Calling his death “inevitable”, he wrote: “I didn’t spend much time at all preparing for this attack. Maybe a month, probably less. I have to do this before I lose my nerve.”Crusius travelled nine hours from his home in Allen, Texas, to the Walmart in El Paso, a city with a high number of Mexicans.First he fired at adults and children outside the store who were fundraising by selling water.

Of  injured,  were taken to the University Medical Center. Two were later transferred to El Paso Children’s Hospital. Eleven victims, aged  to , were being treated at Del Sol Medical Center. Three were critical.Crusius was arrested “without incident” near the Walmart. He is understood to have told investigators he wanted to shoot as many Mexicans as possible. County Jail records showed he was booked on a capital murder charge.Jail boss Sherf Richard Wiles said: “This Anglo man came here to kill Hispanics.

The reality is that maybe she only has time for one more.But, whether it’s for the environment or not, I don’t blame him for not wanting more than two children.I have two and the very idea of having had a third makes me feel weary.

And I commend them for that.I also think Harry should be applauded for speaking up about climate change, especially as this week the Met Office confirmed that the hottest years on record have occurred in the past ten years.So why shouldn’t he use his very public  to talk about things that matter to him and to try to inspire others But, as is often the case, this royal couple seem to be damnedthey do and damnedthey don’t.They’ve already learned the hard way — with their wedding their handling of Archie’s birth and their choice of residence — that you can’t please all the people all of the time.And that, in a way, is a liberation. Because all that is left is to please yourselves.  By ignoring pressures about how many children they “should” have, they are going to have as many as they damn well please.Although why they have to announce it is another question.

Otherwise, no-deal is coming down the tracks.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ramped up his rhetoric over his desires to take the UK out of the EU by October , as part of his do or die commitment.He has clashed with EU leaders, saying the Irish backstop to prevent a hard border must be abolished and insisted a new deal can be achieved.But Brussels has refused to reopen Theresa Mays Withdrawal Agreement and Irish premier Leo Varadkar told him this week that the backstop was necessary as a consequence of decisions taken in the UK.The warnings have been echoed by Mr Johnsons most senior aide Dominic Cummings who warned MPs they were too late to prevent a no-deal Brexit in a series of briefings last week.He is said to have suggested that the new Prime Minister will honour his October  pledge evenJeremy Corbyn and pro-EU Conservatives succeeded in forcing a general election, according to the Sunday .The threat posed by a no-deal departure has been disclosed in a series of departmental leaks this week.Citing Dover as having the highest risk, a Department for Education document says: Risk of travel disruption could result in school and early years settings closures, pupil and staff absence and exam disruption.It says that communications could spark undue alarm or panic food buying among the general public and that in light of any food shortages it will guide on how schools can interpret the food menu standards flexibly.Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: This document lays bare the potential consequences of a disastrous no-deal Brexit for our schools and nurseries, and the parents and children who rely on them.By the Governments own admission, head teachers may be left unable to feed their pupils or forced to close their doors entirely.The DfE said schools provisions is likely to be protected in the event of no-deal.We are confident provision for schools will be protected in the event of the UK having to leave the EU without an agreement and there are robust contingency plans in place to ensure schools are prepared in all eventualities, a spokeswoman said.So Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay is right to tell Merkel, Macron and the EU’s  other national leaders to give Brussels the instruction it needs: get rid of the backstop, and show some imagination.The public have already rejected Brussels’ hard-line, federalist nonsense out of hand in the European elections, and sent a clear message that they weren’t going to be bullied by centralising bureaucrats.Europe can demonstrate it’s changed by working with Britain on a deal that works in the interests of both sides and can get through Parliaments in London and in Brussels. But will it The risk is that the true believers will once again choose their principles of ever-closer union over pragmatism, no matter the economic cost.To those pen-pushers the Project — a United Europe — is all that matters. That’s one of the main reasons we left. And why, although it may be a bumpy ride, we’re still sure we’re better off out.The Continent’s political leaders must step in and tell Brussels to sing a dferent tune.If Britain leaves without a deal, it won’t be for our lack of trying.A separate leaked Government document suggested no-deal could trigger consumer panic, food shortages and an increased security threat within a fortnight.Warnings also came from Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who said that shoppers and motorists will face higher prices and a substantial number of firms could find they can no longer compete in its event.The Governments spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, also recently warned that no-deal would increase borrowing by £ billion a year and plunge the nation into a recession."},{"url":null,"title":"couple shed more 10 stone","story":"NewsCouple shed more than  stone in last-ditch bid to start familyDella Waterfield and Dean Parker, who used to have four takeaways a week, have undergone a massive transformationShareByCharlotte Paxton:,  AUG NewsThe couple started living a healthy lestyle in a last-ditch attempt to conceive \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Birmingham couple who were told they needed a healthy BMI before they could get IVF have shed an impressive  stone.Dedicated Della Waterfield and Dean Parker, who have been together for six-and-a-half years, completely overhauled their lestyle and diet just five months ago after struggling for five years to have a child, Birmingham Live reports.The duo, who used to gorge on four takeaways a week, have shed more than ten stone in a desperate last-ditch bid to conceive.

One shopper told Reuters the gunshots sounded like they began outside the building. The suspect surrendered himself to police at the scene and was taken into custody. In the shootingaposs aftermath, Walmart and adjacent businesses, including the mall and a movie theater, were closed as police conducted an initial search for additional possible suspects. Authorities later said the gunman had acted alone. The carnage ranked as the eighth-deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, after a  shooting in San Ysidro, Calornia, that claimed  lives.Who are the victims     The victims of the attack have yet to be named. Three of them are said to be Mexican, according to Mexicoaposs President Manuel Lopez Obrador. A further six Mexicans are reportedly injured, Mexicoaposs Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard added. El Paso Police Chief Greg Allen said the ages of victims were numerous. Children and babies are said to be among those injured. Two hospitals in the area said they received at least  people, CNN reports. Eleven victims were transported to the Del Sol Medical Center where nine remain in critical condition. At least two patients are in a le-threatening predicament, the hospital confirmed.The victims range between the ages of  to .What has the response been so far        The shooting has sparked widespread condemnation from US political figures and people around the world. US President Donald Trump described the shooting as an act of cowardice. He wrote on Twitter: Today’s shooting in El Paso, Texas, was not only tragic, it was an act of cowardice. I know that I stand with everyone in this Country to condemn today’s hateful act. There are no reasons or excuses that will ever justy killing innocent people. Melania and I send our heartfelt thoughts and prayers to the great people of Texas. Texas Governor Greg Abbott described the shooting as one of the most deadly days in the history of Texas. He said: We as a state unite in support of these victims and their family members. We must do one thing today, one thing tomorrow and each and every day after this - we must unite.

But trippers are snapping up swastika mugs, Hitler busts and other ­memorabilia of hate at a tourist site. Predappio in Italy is becoming a mecca for extreme right-wing ghouls – many from Britain – because fascist dictator Mussolini is buried there. The Sunday People travelled to the town  miles north-east of Florence as bus-loads visited the former Italian ­tyrant’s crypt to mark his birthday. Some performed Nazi salutes while others shouted about sending their enemies “to the ovens”. And they browsed shops selling ­everything from smiley Hitler T-shirts to babygrows with figures performing fascist salutes. One shopkeeper said: “The English are our biggest customers after Italians and French. They come here because this is where Mussolini is buried.” The crypt is opened three times a year to mark the birthday of Hitler’s pal on July  , his death on April   and his march on Rome when he seized power in .    Many want it opened all the year round to boost trade. Pierluigi Pompignoli, who owns the most popular souvenir shop in Predappio, Tricolore, described his far-right products as “antiques”though most appear to be freshly made. He said: “It is not weird for us to sell these antiques. We’re not doing ­anything wrong.”  Askedhe is a fascist, white-haired Mr Pompignoli – who claimed he could be arrested for performing what he calls “a Roman salute” – replied: “I am a Mussolini supporter. “I am not against immigration. One thousand people is OK but , is too many. “I want the crypt to be opened ­because it will be good for my business. Shops here need the extra business.” He is backed by the town’s first right-wing mayor for  years, Roberto Canali, who was elected in May as the far-right movement made major gains across Italy.  Mr Canali, who was born and raised in Predappio, says he is not a Mussolini supporter but is in favour of opening the dictator’s crypt full-time. Sitting in his grand office, where Mussolini once sat, he said: “I think it could bring , visitors a year to the town, which would be worth over €million in revenue.  “I met with Mussolini’s great-grandson Caio on Sunday and he said he would like it to be reopened. The ­people  here want it because of the money it will bring. “I don’t think it will attract more ­fascists. I think normal people will come out of ­curiosity. We want to attract good tourism. “I hope the crypt will be open by the end of this year and I think it will happen.”  Speaking about the shops, he claimed: “I’ve never been into the Tricolore shop so I’ve never paid much ­attention to what it sells. Told it sells swastika ­armbands, he said: “I want to thank you for bringing this to my attention. I will raise it at our next meeting.”  He added: “The shops are unique to this area. They are quite visually striking and may be considered disrespectful. “They can sell souvenirs because they comply with the law, but ­maybe they should keep a lower profile while doing so.” Predappio’s former mayor Giorgio Frassinetti tried – and failed – to close the dubious memorabilia shops ten years ago.  “We cannot talk about normal tourism when we speak about people visiting Predappio,” he said. “Tourism here is not normal and we should not be naive about it. The people of Predappio began to lose their dignity when these shops were opened. “They’re selling out their dignity, but sadly everything is driven by ­money. I feel bad that fascist symbols are sold and tourists go there to buy these kind of products. They shouldn’t be a tourist attraction. “People who came here last week to mark the anniversary of Mussolini’s death were shouting, ‘Send them to the ovens.’ It is terrible.”    Dubbed Il Duce, meaning The Leader, Mussolini allied with Adolf Hitler’s Germany in the Second World War and was ­responsible for , deaths. Italian partisans shot him in  and hung his body upside down beside those of his mistress and other fascists in Milan.  The remains were hidden until they were brought to the family crypt in his birthplace in . Miro Gori, president of a local anti-fascist group, said: “On the day of the anniversary of Mussolini’s death last week we reported many instances to the police of people being extremely right wing. This kind of tourism is worse than sick.”  He added: “I am extremely ­worried about the rise of right-wing politics here in Italy and other parts of Europe. These people are focusing on ­hatred and are very racist and against immigrants. “I want to thank the Sunday People for ­highlighting this. It is an ­important to tell people what is happening.” The nationalist anti-immigration far-right wiped out traditional centre party leaders in May’s European elections.

No player in the europa League or Champions League has netted as many as goal machine Cosgrove.However, McInnes insists Main can provide strong competition for Cosgrove which can only spell danger for rival defences.A summer capture having left Motherwell at the end of last season, Main has been hitting the heights in training, says McInnes.Main was left out of the squad for the - europa League destruction of Chikhura Sachkhere as a precaution having picked up a thigh strain.He is expected to be fit to face Hearts in today’s Premiership opener at Pittodrie.McInnes said: “Curtis Main will be a very important player for me and Sam Cosgrove sees that as well.“Curtis has been fantastic in training and is bursting to go.“He has been doing all he can to get involved.“I have no doubt in my mind that although Sam is scoring goals he will see how well Curtis has been doing in training.“Sam has started the season well and knows he has real competition from Curtis.“I feel as though I have the benefit of having a couple of really strong strikers up there.“Having that competition is good for everyone.”Main has only featured as a substitute competitively for the Dons so far, coming on midway through the second half of the - defeat of RoPS Rovaniemi in Finland in the Europa League first qualying round.Having picked up a minor thigh strain in training  hours before Thursday’s clash with Chikhura Sachkhere Main was not risked – with the Hearts game in mind.McInnes said: “Although Curtis picked up a wee strain he will hopefullly be okay.”McInnes aims to freshen up his squad for the Premiership opener after their Euro rigours.Aberdeen begin their domestic campaign with the Pittodrie clash today.He said: “Hearts will be rubbing their hands at the amount of energy we put out in the euro tie and that is our biggest concern.“We have dealt with the European games now and it is important we regroup for Hearts.“I took players off against Chikhura and kept players back with Sunday in mind.“We will try to get as fresh a team as possible out there to deal with what will be a tough game but an exciting one.”Aberdeen will be without centre-backs Mikey Devlin and Ash Taylor tomorrow.Taylor suffered a hamstring injury in the - first-leg draw with Chikhura in Georgia last week. Scan results confirmed Taylor will be sidelined for up to a month and will miss the Europa League third qualying round ties against HNK Rijeka.McInnes said: “Sometimes when you play in Europe the excitement and anticipation of the first league game proper can be diluted.“However, everyone who was at Pittodrie on Thursday will be back and Hearts will bring a big support.“So the game will generate a fantastic atmosphere and hopefully we deliver a performance that gets us three points.”McInnes anticipates a testing league opener against a Hearts side strengthened during the summer transfer window by boss Craig Levein.The Jambos have secured Scotland international striker Steven Naismith on a permanent four-year deal following his exit from Norwich City.Naismith, , spent the last  months on loan at Tynecastle, scoring  times in  appearances.Despite suffering injury and undergoing two knee operations last season, Naismith was Hearts’ top scorer with  goals in  gamesAlso signed were former QPR and Sheffield United striker Conor Washington and ex-Livingston defender Craig Halkett.Scotland Under- international Jamie Walker has ed to Tynecastle following a season with Wigan Athletic.McInnes said: “Hearts will be tough and the four signings they have made have been very good.“Washington has a pedigree, Walker did well at Hearts previously and Halkett is a player I really like who will do fantastically well for them.“Naismith is a huge boost for them because for me he was arguably the best player in Scottish football last season until he suffered his injury.“It is important for us we start our domestic campaign with a win and hopefully we can do that.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/5d4412d51bdbd6.79102281-e1564743396720.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet could rehome any of these animals1","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.This energetic girl is  years old.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Front line staff are working hard to provide care in very dficult circumstances, but care in the community can only workproperly resourced by senior management.It is hard to avoid the conclusion that many of the decisions to sht care away from centres such as hospitals are as much to do with saving money as the genuine best interest of patients.In times of recession it is, once again, the most vulnerable in society who bear the brunt.The rain is teeming down as this is being written, but last weekend saw sunshine and crowds in Tarbert.The atmosphere was fantastic for the seafood festival, and there is no doubt the weather helped in a big way.Congratulations to the small band of organisers for another great weekend."},{"url":null,"title":"dolphins wave off coach after 30 years","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe MacPool Dolphins prizegiving was held on Thursday June .Swimmer of the month for May and June was awarded to Jodie Samson and Nikkita Todd, pictured on the right.Outgoing Dolphins Captains, Molly Dykes and Felix Maddox were given Contribution Awards.The Dolphins also said goodbye to John Gillies who has been a regular volunteer Dolphins Coach for over  years and is now retiring.

He turned Duncan MacKinnon inside-out before flicking an inch-perfect ball to Fraser Watt on the left of the D and he slammed the ball high into the middle of the goal from  yards to make it -.Lochaber had their first shot on goal on six minutes when Ben Delaney found space on the left but his strike went wide of the left-hand post.Inveraray were showing good movement up front and they increased their advantage on nine minutes. The goal came from a corner and Garry MacPherson caught the Lochaber defence napping as he played the ball low from a wide area towards the front post where full centre Lewis MacNicol waltzed into the box and his first-time shot beat the helpless Callum MacDonald to make it -.Lochaber keeper MacDonald pulled off a great save on  minutes as he blocked Garry MacPherson’s fine drive from the left with his chest before clearing the ball to safety.Lochaber’s Ben Delaney and Stuart Callison tested Inveraray keeper Scott MacLachlan but it was the Winterton side who would add a third goal on  minutes. Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining. Lachlan Campbell played the ball across from the right and it came perfectly to the on-running Findlay MacDonald and his  yard shot from the left flew past the keeper to make it -, setting up a tense finishLochaber had a great chance to snatch a point on  minutes when referee John Angus Gillies awarded them a spot-hit, penalising keeper MacLachlan for a “kick” inside the D. Ben Delaney’s well-struck effort went straight down the middle and MacLachlan redeemed himself, saving superbly with his stick before clearing the ball for a corner.Inveraray saw out the rest of the game to claim two valuable points in what was a cleanly fought contest with no cards shown.The win sets Inveraray up for another crucial relegation battle this time at Kilmallie this coming Saturday.Caberfeidh  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from behind to beat Caberfeidh - in their pm throw up at Castle Leod.Caberfeidh have been on a bit of a scoring spree of late and they took the lead in the opening minute through Craig Morrison.It didn’t take Kyles long to level with Ross MacRae netting on  minutes and Colin MacDonald’s effort on  minutes meant they went into the break - ahead.Ross MacRae got his second on  minutes with Colin MacDonald doing like-wise with just  minutes remaining.Mowi South Division Inveraray  Kyles Athletic The Inveraray seconds and the Kyles Athletic seconds met in a match originally rearranged Thursday  July which was then put back  hours.Kane Kirkhope was playing in a more advanced role for Inveraray and he scored a well-taken goal in eight minutes after some impressive forward play.John MacKenzie was working hard in the middle of the park and he set up Inveraray’s second goal on  minutes. MacKenzie found Campbell Watt who let go a  yard strike which gave the Kyles keeper no chance.Inveraray sealed both points when Campbell Watt continued his good scoring run with his second goal of the game with  minutes remaining."},{"url":null,"title":"ardrishaig community trust maintains partnership with lochgilphead soccer centre","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMembers of the board of Ardrishaig Community Trust turned out on Saturday July  morning to watch an exhibition game from some of the boys and girls of Lochgilphead Soccer Centre and took the time to formally renew their strategic partnership.Chair of the Trust Hamish Nicol said: #We are delighted to be associated with Lochgilphead Soccer Centre who share our values about a community approach to development.

Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne ."},{"url":null,"title":"districts","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPreserving historic KilbrideA GoFundMe donation page is making the rounds after community group Friends of Kilbride made a plea for funds to preserve historic Kilbride.Kilbride, located three miles south of Oban, includes the ruins of a th-century church, Clan MacDougall’s memorial aisle and an extensive graveyard dating back many centuries.

Some crews were hoping for rain but this year it wasn’t to be. Last year’s winner Bruce Edwards in the Darrian T GTR was favourite and since Bruce had not driven the car competitively since Mach   we all thought he would be a bit rusty.Bruce led from the start and set some impressive times throughout the two days but on the last stage he threw it all away and rolled the car as he clipped a large lorry tyre a mile from the finish line, unable to right the car and with the stage blocked the clerk of the course decided on the grounds of safety to cancel the final stage. This allowed Alistair Inglis in the lotus Exige and a previous Mach  winner to clinch the top spot.Class  had  STRC registered this year and new to class  was Tom Blackwood in the gorgeous yellow and Black Fiesta R+. Tom#s first event driving in anger and showed that with some tweaks here and there with suspension settings it’s a great car to drive. How well the car drives notwithstanding, there was a slight moment coming out of one of the tight sections onto the main runway when Tom ran wide and clipped a boundary fence damaging the front bumper of the car but kept the fence intact. Tom finished third Overall and second in class .John Rintoul in another Fiesta R on the back of the recent win at Crail was on it all weekend but just couldn’t clinch the win this year, John finished second overall and took the class win.Alan Wallace in the distinctive green and white Mitsubishi Evo finished a very well deserved th overall and third in class. Harry Chalmers was a Mach  virgin and loved every mile of the venue. Harry commented at the end of the event they we had no problems at all on day one and the car ran faultlessly all day to give him a real confidence boost to push on harder and let him get used to some new parts on the car. Harry kept it neat all day and came away with rd overall after day one.Day two was very fast. Fastest he’s probably been in the car to date with these faster stages suiting faster cars Harry just had to push on brake late and keep it tidy and with that being said the team dropped to th overall due to some of the quicker cars retiring out.Harry said: #I couldn’t be happier for how this event turned out for the team and are all delighted with the result and how far they have come.#Harry also managed the full two days on the same Hankook Tyres Finishing th overall.Alan Stark in the stunning Red Mitsubishi Evo had decided he was playing the long game and would drive accordingly. The plan went well and they played about with tyres trying to make them last for the two days. On the second last stage on the Saturday the manold gasket started to blow and he lost a fair bit of power mid stage. The service crew managed to bolt it up again but the long stages were killing it and it usually faded about  rds in each time.On Sunday he decided to push on a bit and of course it bit him. The interior mirror fell off and he became aware there was a car coming up behind after a merge but wasn’t sure how close. He decided to do the next lollipop and then see where he was on the straight but in his enthusiasm got to him and he understeered into the bales bouncing off them, hitting his bonnet. He also noticed the brake pads were rattling more than usual and it turned out they had lost a pin. The team had to improvise with spare tyre borrowed from Allan Wallace which didn’t quite fit but they wired it in and it lasted.Class  had  STRC registered crews this year and top spot and current championship leader in class went to Colin Gemmell in the Mark  Escort. Colin had a trouble-free run on both days and managed to finish the event th overall just  seconds behind Tom Blackwood and second in class.Alistair Inglis winner of the  Mach  stages kept just ahead all weekend. Nothing could touch his car which stuck to the road like glue.Inglis said: #Overall victory and a class win  Can’t get any better.#Robert Marshall in the Mark  Escort was looking forward to some decent results but an issue on day one with the car losing all its water put an end to any real chances and on day two an engine mount broke putting an end to what Robert described as a perfect weekend.Ross Auld was a welcomethe Mark  Escort and also managed a couple of days assistance in setting up the venue. Ross had managed to set some decent times on Saturday but late in the day the alternator belt snapped and took with it the dry sump belt causing the engine to cease. Ross loaded up the car and headed home and by the Sunday evening he had the engine out the car ahead of its rebuild.Class  saw four STRC registered crews compete in Kintyre this year and top of the list was Greg Inglis in the Lotus Exige. Greg exited the last stage on the Saturday and noticed the rear brake calliper hanging off. A call was made to Montrose where a spare part was removed from a car and the handover was done half way between Montrose and Machrihanish. Greg finished a respectful fth overall and took the class win.Second in class and th overall was Michael Harbour in the Mark  Escort, on the back of electrical problems that saw the team fail to finish the last round at Crail the team have now got the car singing on the stages. Michael didn’t report any issues during the weekend and brought the car home in one piece.Michael Robertson isn’t having the best of luck this season as the Honda Civic Type R driver reported issues with the CV joint that led to driveshaft and df failure but as usual the team loved the event and will be back for sure.Class , with eight registered STRC in class  the battles were all tensely close. Taking top honours in the class was Kyle Adam a full two minutes ahead of nearest class  car of Des Campbell. Kyle also managed a top  overall clinching th spot and despite some overheating at one point the car ran faultlessly doing his championship hopes no harm.Lochgilphead local, Jamie Miller in the C R Max loves the track and had the luxury of booking indoor servicing. With navigator Ian McCulloch, his biggest problems were brake related but with some fluid changes and adjustments it was just all back to normal for the team finishing a well-deserved th overall and fourth in class.Kayleigh Strachan in the Citroen Saxo finished th in class on the event and th overall but managed to pick up  points and th in class in the STRC.Gary Coutts in the Fiesta commented after the final stage on the Sunday that on the second to last stage of day one he developed a few ‘minor’ issues. A change of driveshaft, ball joint, wheels and tyres seemed to cure the problem. With an early start on the Sunday morning the car was back on form. Loss of intercom on way to stage  and a half spin on stage  cost them a bit of time and after a few tweaks at service they were away again.

Some older cars rely on  ron petrol and with the replacement of the pumps in the Esso garage, drivers will be forced to drive almost  miles to Dunbeg, by Oban, or  miles to Helensburgh.Lochgilphead resident Lockhart Leitch raised the issue with MSP Michael Russell who contacted Esso for a response.A spokesperson for Esso said: #We recently replaced the pumps at the Tesco Esso Lochgilphead service station, removing supreme unleaded and replacing it with supreme diesel in addition to the regular unleaded and diesel products.#Sales of regular diesel make up two thirds of all fuel sales at this site, therefore having this additional diesel grade provides an alternative option for a bigger proportion of our customerswe experience dficulties with replenishing regular diesel stocks when the weather challenges us to reach Lochgilphead.#Although it would be a long drive, we can offer a supreme unleaded grade at Helensburgh Express as well as a site near Oban.#We continually review the fuel offerings at all our sites but at the current time we have no plans to reinstate supreme unleaded at Lochgilphead. We did advise the community with two weeks notice of our plans to close the forecourt during the works, however, I note we could have done better in providing advance notice of the grade change specically and we will endeavour to provide notices on site in advance of any future changes.#MSP Michael Russell said: #I would be concernedthere was a reduction in choice in any of the garages. If people need  ron they should be able to get it locally, particularly where there is more than one petrol station.#Narrowing the choice and making people drive to buy petrol is never a good idea.#In response, Lockhart Leitch said: #The reply from Esso is, to my mind, a typical big company response. They are entitled to change productsthey are not selling as they would like, however, to change from Supreme petrol to Supreme diesel without at least notying customers in advance that Supreme unleaded will no longer be sold is diabolical.#"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead teams win big at the mach1 rally","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe sun shined of the Lochgilphead teams of July  and #s MACH Rally, since most went home with great results.Innes and Kirsty Mochrie started car  on Saturday July  at stage .

Huge crowds gathered on both sides of the street to support both of Innerleithenrsquos fine bands and to enjoy the music at this yearrsquos Beating of the Retreat.Presiding over the performance was the President of St Ronans Border Games Alan Patterson along with St Ronan and the Dux Girl, Standard Bearer Ronan Caine and Lass Caitlin Urquhart, their supporters, Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James, and his we Sarah, the monks, and the dersquoil.The two town bands marched on together under the expert direction Band Sergeant David Lindsay playing Scotland the Brave. The Pipe Band then performed an excellent Drummerrsquos Call followed by the traditional Retreat marches Greens Hills of Tyrol, The Battles Oer and Lochanside.Next the Silver Band played an upbeat version of the Queen hit, Fat Bottomed Girls which featured one of the bandrsquos percussionists, Cameron McCreadie, on drum kit and soprano cornet player, Simon Railton, as soloists.The Pipe Band followed on with a rendition of their new competition medley set comprising a iety of time signatures, featuring an emotional arrangement of the slow air Mingulay Boat Song.More marches back and forth had the crowds clapping and tapping their feet before it was time for the combined piece, which was a beautul arrangement of The Rose of Kelvingrove featuring Pipe Major Gillie as soloist. The Silver Band then rendered Sunset with Callum Anderson and Callum Robb sounding the calls. The hymn tune Eventide was played by principal cornet player, Callum Robb, and conducted by Band Secretary Keith Belleville.Games President Alan Patterson then gave permission for the Bands to take their leave. To resounding applause, the bands marched off playing On, StRonans, On!.There was only one important task that remained, the matter of the dersquoil. We were honorary torch bearers lighting the way for our neighbours the St Ronanites, to burn an effigy of the dersquoil.I quickly ran to the High Street for a prime view of the black cloaked carrier of the dersquoil, monks dressed in their habits chanting and punching their croziers in the air, Standard Bearer Ronan carrying the Blue Banner. The magic of this ancient tale was brought to le. I can only compare it to watching the village mob with torchlights off to kill the beast in the classic Disney film.The friendly Innerleithen mob halts on Hall Street and the dersquoil strangely disappears out of sight.I think of the Cleikum Ceremony and remark to my husband, who carried out the duties of the Dux Boy in, how nice it is that the old customs and traditions exist today, said exactly as it was since its inception in .He recalls word for word the outgoing speech of the Dux Boy which makes me think back to the words of Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James: ldquoInnerleithen and the Games will be in your DNA forever. Never a truer word. You can take the man out of Innerleithen but yoursquoll never take Innerleithen out of the boy!We begin the climb of Curly Hill to the soul-stirring sounds of the Pipe Band. It is dark and the fire-lit torches have been extinguished. The climb feels never-ending and locals start to sing On St Ronanrsquos On. We finally reach the top and, as I look out over the valley, it is simply breathtaking. Some things are better felt that telt.My eyes are drawn to the dark figure that sits on the pyre. A haunting figure approaches bearing a flame, St Ronan has ed in the form of Aaron Glendinning. The pyre bursts into flames and the crowds on the hillside cheer the effigyrsquos fiery demise. Fireworks then light up the dark sky.The dersquoil is now in ashes and the evil spirit has been banished once more. And I, along with the people of Innerleithen, head safely home after truly enchanting evening."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclists-set-leg-lavender-touch","story":"A CYCLING team which has raised tens of thousands of pounds for charity is preparing for its toughest challenge yet.The Over The Hill cyclists are in serious training ahead of their  Border Settlements which will see them complete  miles over three days.The nine-man team - which includes Keith Irvine, Stevie Halls, Sinclair Paterson, Ronnie Murray, Josh Irvine, Kevin Mania, Alan Brown, Doug Welsh and Chris Lightfoot - are tackling the route for the Lavender Touch, a charity which raises funds for people in the Scottish Borders living with cancer.The team have previously cycled  miles from Settle in Yorkshire to Galashiels in aid of Prostate Scotland in , and  miles for the Rowan Boland Memorial Trust in .Stevie Halls said: \"The team, which has an age range of mid-s to over , will be passing through over  towns, villages and hamlets in a journey of  miles across the Borders.\"The route mirrors the geographic reach of the Lavender Touch and although our trip will only last three days, the impact we hope to raise through sponsorship and donations will allow the Lavender Touch to continue to support patients for years to come.\"We will be supported across the Borders by a tour bus which will follow the route and stop off at many towns and villages where the Lavender Touch volunteers will be holding a number of events to promote the charitys work.\"The cyclists head off on Friday, August  and hope to reach Gala Cricket Club before the close of play on until Sunday, August .Local businesses can advertise on the side of tour bus -interested, contact Keith Irvine .Donations can be made to the Over the Hills team at www.lavendertouch project over_the_hill_elite_riders "},{"url":null,"title":"garden-delights-opens-peebles","story":"A NEW community garden in Peebles was officially opened last week.Tesco store manager Tracy Wilson was given the honour of cutting the ribbon at the Gutterbluids Societyrsquos Dovecot Community Garden.A grant from the Tescos Bags for Help scheme along with local donations helped fund the project on land at the junction of Dovecot Road and March Street.Andrew Fraser, secretary of Peebles Gutterbluids Society told us: \"The project would not have been possible without a pound grant received from Tescorsquos Bags of Help Scheme, and the firmrsquos willingness to allow the project to go ahead on their land.\"The pound grant, plus a few generous local donations, paid for the  small, ornamental trees which were required for the garden.\"Tescorsquos local Community Champion, Pauline Weir, was very supportive of the project and was keen that bench-seats should be included in the plans.\"Two bench seats were also donated by local iniduals and have been refurbished, plus two new seats were kindly donated, one by the Rotary Club of Peebles, and the other by private donors.\"Gutterbluids Society members and a few friends planted out the five groves of trees early last December.And each of the saplings was in blossom this spring.As well as its aesthetic appeal the new garden is also benefitting nature.Mr Fraser added: ldquoThe grass in amongst the tree groves has been left deliberately to grow, providing a natural area for pollenating insects, etc, and a surprising number of wild flowers are growing there.\"Our bench-seats are proving popular, - and not only for human use.\"As a result we have had to install lsquopigeon perchesrsquo behind two of the seats, in a bid to stop them perching on the seat backs and defacing them.

The dancers fought every inch of the way to put our small town on the map.Our thanks once again to the following: MACC, Tangy Wind Farm, West Kintyre Wind Farm, Killieguer Caravan Park, DM Fabrication, Glenside Tractors, Howdens, Kintyre Youth Fund, McFadyens Contractors, Tesco Bags of Help, Jim Martin Supplies, Southend Parish Church, Peter McKerral  Son, C’town Co-Op, C’town Running Club, C’town Rotary Club, C’town Firemans Club, C’town Motor Co, C’town Rotary Club, C’town Loyal, C’town Common Good Fund, C’town Inner Wheel, C’town Community Council, Paul Grumoli, Mr and Mrs Brown, Mr and Mrs Russell, and Laura and Jake, Tesco Staff.Yours,James McCorkindale,McCorkindale School of Dancing.Sir,On Monday evening, July , five sacks of tin cans had been placed in the clear glass bin in Tesco#s car park. Some sort of gathering must have taken place over the weekend. You cannot run a countryyou can#t distinguish between a glass bottle and a tin can.At least something sensible is going to be done about the Rest and Be Thankful road. It was acceptable to try to prevent the hillside from being washed onto the roadway. It has been obvious for several months,not years, that that was not possible.At last someone has seen thata wide trench is dug between the hillside and the road, the hillside can still be washed down but will not reach the roadway.Yours,James W Mackay,Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"campbeltown rallies to independence march","story":"The independence march through Campbeltown on Saturday was a huge success and put a real zest for le back into the town which has been too long forgotten.That was the view of organiser Manny Singh who despite his apparent sacking from the All Under One Banner organisation was very much still in charge at the Campbeltown march.Afterwards he said: #It was a huge success for Campbeltown and the biggest demonstration for decades. There was a lot of spirit and a feeling that a number of towns in Scotland which have been forgotten, like Campbeltown, will not be left behind after independence.#He put the turnout at more than , and added: #The fact that the march extended theof Longrow gives a fair indication of the numbers who were there.He also told the Courier this week that he remained the #legal indentity# of the All Under One Banner group, despite a bitter public row among the hierarchy which looks like splitting the group in two.It was the biggest rally held in the town in recent years with marchers coming from as far afield as Aberdeen and Alloa and as well as Oban, Glasgow and Islay, with many travelling on the weekend ferry from Ardrossan.#It really exceeded expectations and made a big splash in the town, Ron Wilson of Yes Kintyre told The National.#There was a real buzz as people came early and most of the hotels were booked up. The pubs and cafes were busy so it was good for local businesses. Campbeltown is a Yes town and it was brilliant to have all these people come here. Local people were coming off the pavements and joining the procession so it created a good, positive vibe.Pro-Unionists opponents held their own counter demonstation. However, the march went off without any incident and there were no arrests, with only one warning which was drug related.A spit of rain earlier in the day failed to develop into poor weather as the marchers would round the town to hear speakers and listen to musicians at the rally at Kinloch Green.Mr Wilson said he was particuarly pleased at the turnout as there had been some confusion over whether the march would go ahead due to internal sions within the hierachcy of All Under One Banner, which has organised independence marches across the country.Following Mr Singh#s sacking, founder Neil Mackay resigned from his position on its national executive pending an internal investigation.Pro-UK Unionist group A Force For Good met the march on the shore front and say they filmed and counted the marchers, as they have at previous events, and afterwards claimed the turnout was just .Director, Alistair McConnachie, said: #All Under One Banner is basically the marching wing of the SNP. AUOB, and SNP MPs and MSPs, lie about the numbers which attend their marches, sometimes up to  or  times.#Unfortunately, they are not challenged by the Scottish media. The good news is that A Force For Good has a presence at every AUOB march. We bear witness to the huge value of the United Kingdom.  Our #Thin Red Line# stands for everyone who likes being British, who likes the UK, and who wants us to stay together.#A group from Barrowfield at the Campbeltown cross ahead of the march.

Are the faces staring out from the pages of glossy magazines shining with wellbeing  They might be tanned, toned, and expensively exfoliated, butany of these iniduals has a heart full of joy, it is unlikely to be as a result of their lestyle.In a recent talk, Nicola Sturgeon made an appeal to commonsense, stating what, deep down, most of us already know. She claims that when calibrating a countryrsquos standing and success, gross domestic product is not the most accurate measure. Not least among the misleading factors when using GDP as a guide is that its figures ignore unpaid carersrsquo work, yet put a value on illegal drug consumption. Just as worryingly, says Ms Sturgeon, ldquoIt values activity in the short term that boosts the economy eventhat activity is hugely damaging to the sustainability of our planet in the longer term.The First Ministerrsquos laudable aspiration is that ldquothe objective of economic policy should be collective wellbeing ndash how happy and healthy a population is, not just how wealthy a population is. Hoping to establish a fairer and truer scale of assessment, she is collaborating with the prime ministers of New Zealand and Iceland ndash women all, in charge of countries geographically on the fringes, who are prepared to challenge convention.Cynics might, of course, say that Ms Sturgeon is simply laying the groundwork for another independence bid, in which those predicting dire financial consequences will be brushed off as old-fashioned and out of touch by placing too much emphasis on our economic prowess. Yet with Brexit, not just economists but rabid Leavers acknowledge that orce from the EU will cause financial shockwaves. Clearly, this is a risk they think worth running. By the same token, idealists north of the Border, who want us to exit from the UK, often say that the possibility of diminished economic performance after independence would not in itself be a deal breaker. There are bigger issues at stake.That argument is for another day. At this point, were Scotland to become a pioneer in putting a fairer society ahead of a more affluent one, this would represent nothing less than a second enlightenment. The inequalities in health and housing, education and attainment that are nakedly apparent all around us, are shaming for one of the wealthiest countries in the world. No matter how much those at the top make, or how vibrant our financial markets, poverty and desperate hardship for too many people persists. Itrsquos tempting to think that those who see GDP and similar indices as telling the whole story have also embraced the biblical creed that the poor will always be with us ndash in other words, there is nothing we can do about their plight.While the SNP has not been far-sighted or proactive enough to combat the recent shocking rise in drug-related deaths, many of them linked to deprivation and hopelessness, nevertheless Ms Sturgeon and the like-minded leaders with whom she is allied, have a strong social conscience. If the message that money is only part of the equation takes hold, it could potentially prove a turning point for the way all rich societies see, and regulate, themselves.Naturally therersquos a danger when writing disparagingly about high-income earners of appearing either green-eyed or preachy. Despite spending a childhood in the pews, hearing how the widowrsquos mite was as valuable as the millionairersquos cheque, and that those who are hard up today will be blessed with eternal treasures in the hereafter, I nevertheless know that no pair of rose-tinted spectacles can make a terrying bill, an unattainable holiday or too-expensive winter coat, one bit easier to bear. As Mae West put it bluntly: ldquoIrsquove been rich and Irsquove been poor, and rich is better.When it comes to wellbeing, you donrsquot need a carbon monoxide monitor to recognise that the air in Stornoway or St Abbs is far better for us than that in the throbbing financial hearts of Edinburgh or Glasgow, or for that matter Tokyo and New York. Wellbeing consists of something way beyond liquidity, location, or assets. Those in their gated communities, who store their Cartier watches in a vault, have cut themselves off from the rest of society. Is that really enviable  This is not to say they might not be really decent, kind-hearted people who give generously to good causes. Perhaps some of them are. But no matter how open-handed they appear to be, money creates a spiralling gulf between the haves and the have-nots, and sometimes cause rts much closer to home, as family lawyers will attest.Far from solving the problem by capitalistsrsquo pet theory of ldquotrickle-down, too much capital at the top of society actually entrenches inequality. Thus, the endless pursuit of higher incomes, pricier properties, competitive conspicuous consumption, whether at a personal or national level, is intrinsically unhealthy. Once you believe that the GDP graph should show an inexorable year-on-year increase, you become blinkered. This is as true, I suspect, for those running the country as for the inidual.Hunger for amassing hundreds of thousands of pounds, and the power that comes with it, is a recipe for potential disaster. It is psychologically and spiritually corrosive. Slowing the Gradgrind pursuit of ever-greater productivity, focusing on more nourishing and longer-lasting priorities, is a way of calling time on the fallacy that the bottom line is all that matters, and that cash is king. It is a way of taking an ethical stance, and saying enough is enough. How to calculate what constitutes enough, of course ndash be it income, savings, love, leisure, charity, you name it ndash is even harder than measuring happiness.Read more: Scotlands history has lain in the British shadow for too long"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-39-s-newest-party-leader-swaps-big-top-political-circus","story":"When not working full-time as an engineer, Lorna Slater mdash the new co-leader of the Scottish Greens mdash can be found flying through the air on a trapeze.The -year-old even trained with Aerial Edge, Glasgowrsquos circus school, for four months last year.As she puts it: ldquoYou canrsquot worry about politics or work when yoursquore hanging upside down by one hand.Ms Slater and long-standing MSP Patrick Harvie were elected co-leaders of the Scottish Greens last week, and will lead the party into the crucial  Holyrood polls.Both have put the climate emergency centre stage, while Brexit and independence also loom large.Speaking to The Herald following her election, Ms Slater outlined the balancing act of priorities the party now faces.And she also revealed her unusual way of letting off steam ndash sparked by flying trapeze lessons she was given for her th birthday.ldquoTo me the most important issue is the climate emergency, but unfortunately, with Brexit and all that, we have to swim in the waters that we find ourselves in, she said.ldquoSo we canrsquot ignore Brexit.

They vote with the Tories we vote with Labour.ldquoSo I think that that would actually be a terrible idea. It would be a terrible idea because we would end up signing up to policies that we donrsquot agree with at all.ldquoI think where we are right now is quite a good position to be in, where we can push the SNP on issues that matter to us, but we are not signed up to things that we really donrsquot agree with.Ms Slater said the SNP had failed ldquomiserably on land reform, and had left power ldquoin the hands of developers and big corporations and landowners.And she insisted the Nationalists ldquohave to finally pull their finger out on council tax.She added: ldquoThey have promised in manesto after manesto to reform it, and they keep not doing it. This is a very regressive tax. It would make a huge dference to public services.ldquoThey canrsquot keep complaining that Westminster is imposing this austerity on us when they themselves are not bold enough to reform that council tax.ldquoSo, for me, thatrsquos really important. As is taking action on this climate emergency that theyrsquove declared, and then havenrsquot done anything about.ldquoThey cannot continue to support grouse shooting and the fossil fuel industry and expanding the roads and so on.

To call the drug testing programme tokenistic is a wild over-exaggeration. Itrsquos almost non-existent.According to the latest figures for the first three months of this year from UKAD, the anti-doping authority, there were just  Scottish players tested in competition. If the concentration was on the Premiership, which it almost certainly was, then that spanned at least  games involving more than , playerswhich, by my rudimentary maths, means the chance of even being tested was about one in , never mind getting caught.Of course the testing programme is meant to cover all four isions, or  teams, but I doubtthe testers turn up on a wet Wednesday in Brechin, so Irsquove kept the analysis to our top league, otherwise there would be considerably more chance of being hit by lightning than caught out.By contrast, in England a player in the Premier League can expect to be tested four times over the season, in the Championship marginally less. The four English leagues comprise  teams, with Scottish numbers at just under half that. For the quarter in England there were  in-competition tests, so a Scottish equivalent should have been around  ... six times the actual number.The drug authorities stress another key to catching out cheats is out-of-competition testing. In Scotland there were just , in England . But donrsquot imagine that the testers turn up at the door without warning at ungodly hours, as they do in athletics and tennis for instance. No, ours are done at training sessions and there is anecdotal evidence that testersrsquo targets are sometimes leaked in advance.Overall there were  tests carried out and paid for by the English FA in the quarter, , in the year, whereas in Scotland, for the SFA, the comparable totals were , and just .

No excrement Sherlock!I asked UKADthey believed that the SFA was carrying out adequate testing. Interpreting a rather circuitous response from the organisation, itrsquos the case that there is a basic public interest and intelligence-led programme, but the FA provides additional funds for a premium service, whereas it is clear the SFA does not, and this accounts for the yawning disparity.Mascot or mas-notThe place is hoachinrsquo with World Cups.

Today we may have warped feet but at least we donrsquot rattle.It was Marie Curie and her husband Pierre who coined the word ldquoradioactive.

Radium bath salts claimed to treat insomnia. Pots and jugs lined with radon and uranium were prescribed for flatulence.Of course, we donrsquot believe this nonsense nowadays. Well, not quite. Thousands of people each year, from around the world, travel to four former uranium mines in Montana to pay to sit in radioactive mine shafts, believing that being exposed to radon gas can cure their ailments, or at least mitigate pain. The theory is that exposure to low-dose radiation, while it damages cells, prompts compensatory processes that stimulate repair, decrease free radicals, and activate proteins that prevent inflammation. No, I donrsquot know what that means either.In the centre of it all is Butte, Montana ndash with its wonderfully-named bar called Pisserrsquos ndash a town of , people built on a honeycomb of old copper mines, and probably the most radioactive populated place in world, with radon gas leaking into homes. Many of the old houses are built from bricks made from phosphate slag, large portions of the town are paved with it.

So herersquos a question for your next pub quiz. What do Russian president Vladimir Putin and Teodoro Obiang Nguema, president of Equatorial Guinea, have in common Well, to begin with, excluding monarchs, they are both among some of the world leaders who have held power the longest.This weekend, -year-old president Obiang will have been in power for a staggering  years, a record time for any sitting president in the world.You have to go all the way back to August , , to mark the day that Obiang overthrew his uncle, the dictator Francisco Macias Nguema, who was shot two months later. In the intervening decades, Obiang claims to have foiled at least  coups or assassinations against him, all the time accusing the countryrsquos army, political opposition or foreign powers.Vladimir PutinIn that same period, Obiangrsquos rule of Equatorial Guinea has often been cited by human rights groups such as Amnesty International as one where repressive measures including torture, extra-judicial executions, arbitrary arrests, and the persecution of political activists and human rights defenders is commonplace.:Pictures: Hundreds more arrested in Russian pro-democracy protestsOil-rich Equatorial Guinea is also one of the most corrupt countries in the world, a place where Obiangrsquos cohorts in power have a penchant for investing in luxury private mansions in Europe rather than helping rid the country of its widespread poverty.By comparison to Obiang, as world leaders go, Putin is a new kid on the block, evenhis time in the Kremlin is fast approaching  years. Yes, it really has been that long since the steely president stepped into the Kremlin and the world sat up and took notice.Earlier this year, after almost three decades in power, an autocratic neighbour of Putin, Kazakhstanrsquos president Nursultan Nazarbayev, himself one of the last political survivors of the former Soviet Union, finally resigned, effectively taking him off what has sometimes in derisory terms been dubbed the ldquoleaders for le list.Nursultan NazarbayevFollowing the stepping down of Nazarbayev, and with Algerian president Abdelaziz Bouteflikarsquos decision to end his re-election bid and the fall of Sudanrsquos Omar al-Bashir in the face of mass protests, perhaps now is as good a time as any to examine just what it is that helps keep such leaders in power for so long.Currently, according to the independent watchdog organisation Freedom House, which monitors freedom and democracy around the world, the  or so longest-serving leaders in the world all represent countries considered ldquonot free by the organisationrsquos criteria.The fact the first  of these leaders are also men speaks volumes about the ways in which global political structures remain weighted.Indeed, itrsquos not until number  on the list that one comes across what is deemed a ldquofree country, or indeed a female leader, in this case Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.In an arena where political power is slippery and can vanish with one wrong move, what is it that helps keep the longest-serving leaders in place Angela MerkelldquoAt the very essence of it is the hunger for continued power, says Anneke Van Woudenberg, who as a former director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watchspent years monitoring and researching the role of many leaders on a continent home to half of the  longest-serving leaders and five of the top seven.But as well as the human desire for authority and prestige, Van Woudenberg points to other purely practical factors at play in preventing many leaders, especially in Africa, from standing down willingly or gracefully.ldquoRetiring as a head of state in Africa doesnrsquot usually come with a lot of benefits, Van Woudenberg, who is now executive editor of the organisation Rights and Accountability in Development, told Newsweek.ldquoVery few African countries ndash in fact almost none ndash have any kind of pension or security scheme for former presidents or heads of state. So out of power means out of money.In Africarsquos case, ever since the turn of the st century the trend of entrenched leadership had spread across the region. In its wake it often spurred corruption, instability, social ision and economic stagnation. While that trend might now show signs of reversing, it persisted for a iety of reasons.As a recent study by the US-based international affairs think tank the Council on Foreign Relationsconcluded, many of Africarsquos leaders increasingly secured longer terms through ldquoconstitutional coups, proposing amendments for approval by the legislature or judiciary, or in national referendums, that allowed for additional terms in office.Around the year , when many post-colonial leaders were nearing the ends of their constitutional term limits, this pattern became more distinct. Since then, says CFR,  heads of state have tried to remain in power by adjusting their countriesrsquo constitutions.Among them was Namibian president Sam Nujoma in , followed by Gnassingbe Eyadema, the president of Togo, in . One year later, the Gabonese parliament voted to remove term limits from its constitution, allowing president to run for a sixth term.David Cameron and deposed Algerian strongman Abdelaziz BouteflikaThis quickly became regular practice every few years in African nations as widespread as Angola, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea, Niger, Nigeria, the Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Senegal, Sudan and Uganda.Another reason for Africarsquos recurring third-term problem is the lack of effective political opposition in many countries, say analysts.ldquoThe opposition to these constitutional changes comes from inside, says Phil Clark, lecturer in comparative international politics at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London.ldquoIt tends to come from domestic oppositions, rather than the African Union or regional powers or international donors.Clark goes on to cite Rwanda as one example, which, although widely considered a one-party state, has several opposition parties, though none offers a credible challenge to current president Paul Kagamersquos Rwandan Patriotic Front .Should some opposition parties ever pose a threat to the status quo, many African governments and leaders think nothing of quashing their challengers. In the past, military coups were common as a means to seize power, with both Equatorial Guinearsquos president Obiang and his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni entering their presidencies this way.In all, in Africa, there were  successful coups from  to , but only  from  to , and just the one ndash against Zimbabwersquos ndash since then, according to CFR analysis.It would be very wrong to single out Africa as the sole region where the rulers of countries have held on to power for long periods through nefarious or authoritarian means.From Latin America to Europe and the Middle East to Asia, there are many examples of those who qualy in the leaders-for-le stakes. At their disposal is a ied bag of political strategies and tricks.A small number of rulers stays in office, of course, simply by ignoring the letter or spirit of the law. Some veteran leaders, as Freedom House points out, simply reset the clock, evading time limits by arguing that the restrictions in new constitutions do not apply retroactively.Others use what has been called a ldquolegislative assist, among them Kazakhstanrsquos president Nazarbayev, who as far back as  used a loyalist legislature to push through constitutional amendments that exempted him ndash and only him, as the first president of independent Kazakhstan ndash from a two-term limit.Freedom House says other aspiring leaders-for-le have turned to referendums ndash riggednecessary ndash to extend their rule. The options are surprisingly ied, which brings us back to Putin.While it may seem a long way off, whether Putin retains power after , when his current term ends, is the key question of Russian politics today. The outcome will also have a major influence in shaping international affairs and policies.Robert MugabeAs Leonid Bershidsky, columnist with the media company Bloomberg, recently pointed out, constitutional limits in Russia ndash just as in parts of Africa ndash are not what they are in other places. In effect, the Kremlin controls the Russian parliament to an extent that makes it possible to change the constitution at any moment, making Putin president for le.ldquoThat lsquonuclear optionrsquo, however, is anathema to Putin, who, despite persistent election rigging in his favour, insists on democratic legitimacy as the basis for his rule, explained Bershidsky in an article last month.Like many Russia watchers, Bershidsky is intrigued by how none of the relatively legitimate scenarios for keeping Putin in power past  look comfortable to the Russian leader.The pressure on Putin has lately been compounded by increasing protests on the streets of Moscow challenging the government over the rejection of independent candidatesrsquo applications for the cityrsquos council elections.The Moscow protests are part of a trend of local demonstrations showing a growing defiant stance against Putinrsquos managed democracy.:Two autocrats deposed in a week in Sudan and AlgeriaOne Russian media outlet has even reported that the Kremlin believed the protests were being backed by foreign influences intent on starting a ldquocolour revolution, a reference to protests that have overturned governments in other post-Soviet republics.Even as Putin runs out of palatable options for prolonging his reign beyond the constitutional limits, Russian democrats know not to get their hopes up as he undoubtedly remains in charge.That said, as a New York Times editorial pointed out last week, leaders of post-Soviet states have typically lost their grip on power by making one of two big mistakes.The first is brazen manipulation of elections the second is official impunity ndash above all, brutality by law-enforcement agencies.ldquoFew things make people quite so mad, observed the NYT. ldquoThe so-called Rose Revolution in Georgia in , Orange Revolution in Ukraine in , and Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan in  were all touched off by phony vote counts and other electoral fraud.Faced with such challenges to his ldquosoft dictatorship and desire to stay in power, Putin has only a few options. One might be to push for Russiarsquos merger with neighbouring Belarus.Such a manoeuvre would make it possible for Putin to head up the unied country.According to Bloomberg analysts, another would be for Putin to do what he did in , letting a dependable ally, Dmitry Medvedev, run for president and staying on as prime minister to sit out a presidential term as required by the constitution. and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin REUTERS Sergei Karpukhin\" alt\"HeraldScotland: Russias President Dmitry Medvedevand Prime Minister Vladimir Putin REUTERS Sergei Karpukhin\" class\"editor-image\"Vladimir Putin and Dmitri Medvedev, when Mr Medvedev was presidentBut Putin these days has perhaps fewer people in the Kremlinrsquos inner circle that he can trust, unlike back then.Around the world, of course, not all leaders resort to unscrupulous or ruthless methods for their longevity.As Freedom House observes, ldquoin some cases, these rulers have earned their long tenures through relatively free elections and remained within constitutional bounds. In the vast majority, however, a single leader has stayed in power by abusing, weakening or completely overriding key democratic institutions.In many cases their long reigns begin to resemble those of kings and sultans. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, once described as the ldquoinventor of st-century populism, is a case in point.Yesterday, president Nguema of Equatorial Guinea marked  years in power. Evenhe should stand down, itrsquos said he has already been grooming his -year-old son Teodorin and his vice-president to take over the top job of the small oil state in central Africa.Certain leaders, it appears, find it near impossible to relinquish power completely. It was another African long-time ruler, former president Yahya Jammeh of the Gambia, who once declared he would rule for ldquoone billion yearsGod wills it, and that only God can set term limits.

Amazingly, most motorists agreed. Oh for those more innocent, less fractious, pre-Extinction Rebellion days.It helped enormously, of course, that it was summer and MPs and peers were on holiday. Westminster and Holyrood are ghost towns during recess, their corridors silent save for the noise of maintenance work. With no politicians around, normal political programming on television is suspended. So it was yesterday.These, however, are hardly normal times. The papers were crammed with reporting and analysis of Boris Johnsonrsquos first week as Prime Minister, and speculation over a General Election continued to mount. Plenty to keep the Sunday political programmes busy, but any viewer in search of ministerial answers was left to wander through the schedules like Cillian Murphy, crying out ldquoHello  Anyone there : Greens lose membersThere was one exception: Sky News had Ridge on Sunday. But even it was sans Sophy Ridge, with Scots presenter Niall Paterson standing in for the holidaying anchor.With a series of guests who would struggle to be household names outside their own front doors, the show made a good case for political programmes shutting up shop for the summer.The only news lines which emerged came from an interview with Conservative party chairman James Cleverly MP, who said the Government was not going to initiate a general election , and that the party would be setting up an independent inquiry into alleged Islamophobia within its ranks.Otherwise, Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth doubtless earned himself some Brownie points with the Labour press office for putting on a suit and tie on a Sunday and standing before the camera, but he added precious little to the national debate about Brexit or much .: Paul Hutcheon on a no deal BrexitAt one point Paterson askedit was the case, as had been reported, that MPs were now too late to stop a no deal Brexit.

Politics programmes stand or fall on the quality of their guests, andno-one is around that is another reason to pull the plug.Everyone deserves a break.

It is not just Brenda from Bristol who is sick of General Election talk.In any case, there may be no mainstream political programmes on, no Peston, no Question Time, no Marr, and the rest, but politics continues to be covered in newspapers, online, and on radio. So why the fuss Whatever  it does, the summer break raises questions about how politics is covered by broadcasters and whether methods are keeping up with the times. It has become accepted that readers, viewers and listeners want their news and analysis at a time and in a form that suits them. Most of the media has changed accordingly. The only major change in television, however, has been Pestons move from Sundays to midweek ndash a sht that has paid off.: SNP Westminster leader in call for summitPolitics coverage on television continues to revolve around big personalities. With so many sources of news, and when anyone can be their own broadcaster via social media, you might think TV political editors and commentators are among those ldquoexperts Michael Gove once dismissed as surplus to public requirement. Television does not think so.But does the quality of coverage and debate really suffer because Robert Peston is sipping Rose somewhere nice or Laura Kuenssberg is on a cruise  Are we not done with the days of expecting one all-seeing, all-knowing person to have all the answers There remains an assumption among broadcasters that viewers like to hear from a trusted voice, an inidual who can cut through the white noise and convey clearly what is going on. It is a big responsibility but that is supposedly why it comes with the big bucks. The BBCrsquos political editor Kuenssberg is paid between pound,-pound,, more than the PM and First Minister, and her commercial counterparts are thought to be on more.Then again, politics since the EU referendum has often seemed to be one long exercise in proving that screenwriter William Goldman was right when he said nobody knows anything.Do viewers really need or want yet more speculation from political editors  Perhaps they should go old school, like Danny Boyle on the set of  Days Later, and wait for things to happen before reporting on them. But how would   news fill all those hours then The fact remains that it is the stated policy of the British Government to leave the EU on October  with or without a deal. The clock is ticking.If this is not a time when Ministers need to supply answers to pressing questions it is hard to know when that might be.Broadcast coverage of politics since the EU referendum was one of peaks and troughs. Before and during the campaign it was wall to wall. After that, a strange silence descended, years passed, and suddenly Theresa May had a deal that needed she had to get through parliament. By the time problems surfaced there was no time to sort them out.Here we are today,  days to Brexit, and the same sense of denial is taking hold. It is quiet out there in TV land.

According to the International Passenger Survey, , Chinese visitors toured Scotland last year, spending a total of pound. million.But it is thought those figures may be conservative, with Edinburgh Castle reporting , visitors from China between March  and April .Figures for this year are expected to show a further jump reflecting the launch of direct flights between Edinburgh and Beijing last summer, while VisitBritain has predicted Chinese visitors to the UK are expected to soar by almost % over the next five years.According to Richard Morecroft, Director and Co-Founder of JGOO, which provides Western retailers access to the Chinese market through WeChat Pay and Alipay, a sliding pound sparked by Brexit fears could spark extra tourists and lead to a wave of fresh trade as Chinese customers seek to spend high with UK retailers.ldquoIfdoes fall, this will no doubt have a negative impact on many parts of the UK economy. Such a fall is likely to be a huge boost for UK retailers when selling their goods to tourists, to those buying remotely from China and for the countryrsquos tourism industry as a whole.A spokeswoman for Edinburgh-based tour firm Rabbies said: ldquoWersquove seen an over % increase year on year in the number of Chinese passengers across all of our tours in the UK.ldquoThe most visited locations tend to go in line with the market demand, for Loch Ness and the Isle of Skye. But we have also seen an increasing number on our St Andrews and Fe tour and our tours out of Inverness have been popular.\"Earlier this year China Ready, an Edinburgh-based initiative designed to help businesses overcome language and cultural barriers, was expanded to other Scottish cities. More than  businesses have attended seminars to pick up key tips for handling Chinese tourists, such as paying particular respect towards the most senior members of a party, offering complimentary toothbrushes and lsquopotrsquo noodles, and translating menus into Mandarin.A vital element is for businesses to be geared up to take electronic payments from Chinese tourists, says Kenneth Barlow of Global Blue, which helps international visitors take advantage of tax-free shopping.He added: ldquoThey are relatively wealthy travellers and when they come here they like to spend. They want a nice hotel, good dining experiences, luxury goods. The exchange rate is not so crucial to whether they come or not, but it plays into their overall thinking.Hazel Sellar, VisitScotland Market Manager for China, said the organisation is further developing its social media channels including WeChat and Weibo as a priority.She added: ldquoWe know that many businesses across Scotland are taking the initiative to cater for what is becoming one of Scotlandrsquos fastest-growing tourism markets. In addition to this work, we annually take Scottish suppliers on business development missions to China, bringing them face-to-face with the travel trade and giving them a sense of the market requirements first-hand."},{"url":null,"title":"race-time-keep-humble-scots-tattie-menu","story":"Scots have tucked into potatoes ever since the first spuds arrived from South America in the late th century, while Scottish growers today supply about per cent of the UKrsquos supplies.But new research suggests that genetic dferences and climate change have left the humble spud vulnerable to the same disease that caused the devastating Irish and Highland potato famines.According to plant scientists at Dundee University and the James Hutton Institute, commercial potato crops in Scotland and America are under constant threat of potato blight, the disease that sparked the  Irish famine and also devastated Highland crops.Now, in an attempt to make our favourite ieties of potatoes more effective at staving off the disease and any effects of climate change, scientists have turned to unusual ieties of ldquowild and often slightly wonky looking potatoes to help battle the blight.They have developed tools which have unravelled for the first time the historical and geographical patterns of resilient genes in American and British cultivated potatoes, as well as identied genes in the wild ieties that could help boost commercial cropsrsquo resistance.Itrsquos hoped that by combining the genes, potato farmers will be able to grow ldquosuper spuds with extra-resistance and therefore ensure tatties stay on the menu.Dr Ingo Hein, Principal Investigator in plant pathogen co-evolution, says tackling the threat of blight using gene technology developed in Scotland in collaboration with the Sainsbury Laboratory in Norwich, would also help farmers avoid the use of pesticides on their crops.ldquoOur preliminary data suggests that the most commercially valuable potato ieties grown in the UK and US contain a maximum of four genes already defeated by the late blight pathogen, P. infestans, he said.ldquoCrucially, we have also been ableto identy new genes that remain effective against this disease that arenot currently used in commercial potato production.ldquoBy combining these effective genes we can prolong the longevity of inidual resistances to the disease and reduce the need for chemical sprays on plants.ldquoThis is highly relevant for breeding as currently the control methods for late blight in most parts of the world are based mainly on the use of chemical sprays, which can be environmentally hazardous and expensive.But while the technology to cultivate our favourite potatoes with extra genes to make them disease-resistant may exist, a bigger challenge may be encouraging supermarkets, consumers and potato processors to embrace the new ieties ndash particularlythe genetic tweak affects how they look, cook and taste.Mr Hein added: ldquoPotato growers will be delighted because they will need fewer chemical sprays, but the consumer, processor and supermarket who tend to prefer ieties they know. They have the same ieties for  or  years, and there seems to be a hesitancy to adapt.The th-century potato blight devastated crops in Ireland but also brought hardship and starvation as it spread across Europe. In Scotland, potato crops continued to be affected by the disease for around  years, leading to the demise of Highland and island communities as families were forced to give up their crofts and farms and face little other option but to emigrate to Australia and Canada.Many at the time thought the days of cultivating potatoes were over because of the dficulty in eradicating the disease.However, just a few miles from where todayrsquos gene research is being carried out, th century Dundee fruit farmer William Paterson also used a form of ldquoselective breeding to grow improved strains of blight-resistance potatoes.He imported potatoes from South Africa, America and Australia, and grew the best tubers along with his own strongest crops. His new disease-resistant iety called Victoria is present in the parentage of many potato ieties still grown today.However, cultivated crops are not as resistant to blight as wild potatoes, while the pathogen responsible is said to have developed over the years to overwhelm what natural resistance commercially-grown crops might have.Crops require to be sprayed regularly with pesticides, while some of the countryrsquos most popular ieties, such as King Edwards, are said to be most at risk to the pathogen.According to Dr Glenn Bryan, who is responsible for the Commonwealth Potato Collection, which contains about , samples of wild potato species, European potato crops have been particularly vulnerable to blight since they first arrived here.He said: ldquoThe first potatoes that came to Europe lacked important genes for resistance. These pathogens that cause disease are very tricky, they can evolve quickly to overcome any weaknesses. They can spread across vast distances. They might have been blown here on the wind from Mexico, or carried on the boots of someone.Potatoes are the fourth most important global crop after wheat, rice and maize.Wild potatoes can dfer dramatically in colour and shape from potatoes typically found in todayrsquos supermarket aisles. In many cases, the potato is no bigger than a p coin, while high levels of glycoalkaloids make them bitter and in some cases toxic.However, according to Mr Bryan, there could be a place on the dinner table for certain ieties of wild potato.ldquoMost arenrsquot cut out for mass production, you couldnrsquot make chips from them or they are hard to peel because theyrsquore a bit knobbly. Theyrsquore also not so easy to grow, he said.ldquoButyou go to the Andes, Peru, Chile and Bolivia, you will see these primitive potatoes being sold. What we see in the supermarkets is a tiny amount of the ieties of potato that we could generate in Britain."},{"url":null,"title":"much-less-bother-hover-french-inventor-crosses-channel-fly-board","story":"From the first swim to crossings in steamboats, hot air balloons and aeroplanes, for centuries pioneers have used the stretch of water to try out daring feats and new technology.Now, Frenchman Franky Zapata can add his name to the record books after becoming the first person to cross the Channel on a jet-powered hover-board.The -year-old inventor completed the feat in just  minutes yesterday morning, landing in St Margaretrsquos Bayin Kent after taking off from Sangatte, near Calais.Speaking after he landed, Mr Zapata said completing the challenge was the best moment of his le.ldquoI just feel very happy. All my family, friends and my team were all behind me so I was so proud and so happy for them.ldquoIt was just a very big emotion, the best moment of my le ndash I was very happy.During the flight, Mr Zapata stayed - feet above the water for the most part and told onlookers that he reached speeds of up to mph.His hover-board is powered by a backpack of kerosene that can keep him airborne for only around  minutesndash which means he has to land on a supply boat to refuel halfway through the journey.Last week, the former jet-ski champion failed in his first attempt at the -mile crossing after he crashed into a refuelling boat  miles into the flight.However, he was able to overcome this setback by using a larger boat to make landing easier.Asked how dficult it had been to complete the feat, he said: ldquoIt has been very dficult. Irsquove had six months of hard, physical training, and wersquove had to push the technology to the maximum to be able to fly fast for a long time.ldquoAnd last week was especially hard because we crashed and exploded the machine and we had to completely rebuild the machine.ldquoBut today is really special. Peopleask me why I built it. I built it becauseI want to fly.Breaking into tears, he added: ldquoWe made a machine three years ago ndash and now wersquove crossed the Channel.Itrsquos crazy.ldquoWhether this is a historic event or not, Irsquom not the one to decide that, time will tell.Mr Zapata has been developing his hover-board for the past three years, undeterred by losing two fingers in its turbines during its maiden flight in his garage near Marseille.The fly-board has five turbines and can reach speeds of up to mph .The inventor received widespread attention during the annual Bastille Day parade in Paris last month, when he took part in a military display on his futuristic board.Francersquos military has also sought to develop the technology for itself, and recently gave Mr Zapatarsquos company, Z-AIR, a euro. milliongrant.In an interview with France Inter radio, French Defence Minister Florence Parly said the fly-board could serve several purposes, ldquofor example, asa flying logistical  or, indeed,as an assault .Mr Zapata hopes his device will one day enter commercial production as a revolutionary piece of military hardware.The first person to swim the Channel was Captain Matthew Webb in . The Englishman swam unaided from Dover to Calais in less than  hours and went on to become a celebrity, performing many stunts in public.He died in  trying to swim the whirlpool rapids below Niagara Falls.Since his Channel crossing, thousands have now completed the swim, including the first female to cross, American Gertrude Ederle, in , and Australian Trent Grimsey who holds the record for the fastest swim across the Channel at six hours and  minutes.The feat is also regularly completed to raise money for charity, with comedian David Walliams making the swim for Sports Relief in .Several pioneers have also crossed the stretch by air.The first aircraft crossing took place in  and was a balloon flight piloted by Frenchman Jean Pierre Franccedilois Blanchard and American John Jeffries.The flight, from Dover Castle to Guines, took two-and-a-half hours and saw Mr Blanchard awarded a substantial pension by Louis XVI.Another Frenchman, Louis Bleriot also piloted the first aeroplaneacross the Channel in . Flying at about mph in his Type XI aircraft,he took  minutes and  seconds to make the crossing on July .A Scottish-built ship also went on to become the first steamship to cross the Channel.Constructed in Dumbarton in , the ship was bought by Frenchman Pierre Andriel, who named her Elise, and sailed from Newhaven to Le Havre on March , .The crossing, which was seen as a chance to convince the public that steamships could be ocean-worthy, took  hours and Mr Andriel is said to have threatened his crew at gunpoint to get them to complete the journey."},{"url":null,"title":"splits-indyref2-set-hamper-bid-halt-hard-brexit","story":"The Peoplersquos Vote campaign, which wants a second EU referendum vote with Remain as an option, has already identied the ldquopolarising issue as a potential obstacle in a snap election.It emerged yesterday that the campaign will target about  marginal seatsMPs force Prime Minister Boris Johnson to go to the country by October .Campaigners said they would pour resources into about  seats to help remove no-deal MPs and into about  more to defend Remain MPs vulnerable to a challenge.South of the Border, the plan would focus on persuading Labour supporters to vote LibDem and vice versa, according to which party had the best chance of success.In Scotland, the Conservatives would be defending  seats, nine with majorities below ,, all won by the SNP in  but several held by the LibDems before then.They include Stirling, the UKrsquos third most marginal Tory seat, where Stephen Kerrrsquos majority is .The SNPrsquos Pete Wishart would be trying to fend off a Conservative challenge in Perth  NorthPerthshire after his majority was cut to just  in .In the Brecon  Radnorshire by-election last week, a tactical voting pact by Remain parties helped the LibDems win the Tory seat, while the Brexit Party split the Leave vote.The LibDemsrsquo gain reduced Mr Johnsonrsquos parliamentary majority to one, increasing speculation about an early election to overcome the Westminster impasse on Brexit.However, the independence issue could thwart any similar pact in Scotland because the Tories would play the Unionist card.A source at the Peoplersquos Vote campaign said: ldquoScotland is dficult because we need to be sure thatwe polarise the contest between the Tories and the SNP it delivers the results the campaign wants.ldquoThat is, it sees the Tories defeated rather than letting them present themselves as the best placed Unionist candidate to defeat the SNP. So we need to research and test further on this.ldquoThere isnrsquot the same issue in Wales because the independence debate is not so polarising.ldquoBut we will be pragmatic and take soundings from our supporters in all parties on this.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is due to give her thoughts on the developing situation in an appearance at the Edinburgh fringe today with the LBC presenter and political commentator Iain Dale. Mr Johnson added to speculation about an election by announcing a one-off pound. billion boost for NHS England yesterday ndash money critics dismissed as derisory, given its repairs backlog.The cash will result in pound million extra cash for Scotland via the Barnett formula.Mr Johnson also said NHS pensions would be reformed to end the UK-wide problem of consultants cutting back their hours ndash adding to waiting times ndash to avoid pension-related tax bills.An alliance to oust Tory MPs would threaten Ruth Davidsonrsquos leadership of the Scottish Tories, as it could wipe out most of the gains her party made in .But tribal isions among Remain parties are working in her favour.On Saturday, Orkney  Shetland MP Alastair Carmichael, the LibDem whip at Westminster, was asked by the BBChis party would step aside for SNP candidates in a Remain alliance.He said: ldquoNo we wouldnrsquot and for one very simple reason: the SNP are one side of another fundamental nationalist argument which is about Scottish independence. So no, we wouldnrsquot be able to work with them.The SNP seized on the comment to hark back to Jo Swinson serving as a minister in the Tory-LibDem Coalition.MP Neil Gray said: ldquoJo Swinson is showing her true colours and proving yet again that the LibDems simply cannot be trusted by completely ruling out working with us but keeping the door open to another disastrous coalition with the Tories.ldquoIt seems the LibDems are happy to jump back into bed with the extreme right Tory party but not work with us to ensure that the livelihoods of citizens across the UK are not destroyed by a disastrous Brexit.A Scottish Labour spokesman said: ldquoOnly Labour will ensure no-deal is avoided. The only way to get a Labour government is to vote Labour. We will not be doing deals with the SNP, LibDems or anyone . We are fighting for a Labour Government, no s and no buts.Tory party chairman James Cleverly insisted the Conservatives would not ldquoinitiate a general election. Asked on Skyrsquos Sophy Ridge On Sundaythere will be a general election, Mr Cleverly said: ldquoThere isnrsquot. We are not going to initiate a general election.It was also reported thatMr Johnson was forced into an election by a no-confidence vote in September, he could hold it on October  or later, allowing a no-deal Brexit by default.The Sundaysaid the PMrsquos top aide, Dominic Cummings, had told colleagues it was now too late for MPs to use a no-confidence vote to block Brexit.ldquoIf there is a no-confidence vote in September or October, wersquoll call an election for after October  and leave anyway, Mr Cummings said.However, rebel Tory MP Dominic Grieve said Mr Cummings was a ldquomaster of misinformation and losing a no-confidence vote created a -day window to form a new government.Labour MP Jonathan Ashworth also rejected Mr Cummingsrsquos analysis.ldquoThere will be opportunities for us when parliament s in September to stop no deal, he told Sky.The Cabinet manual also says that, during an election campaign, the government should not take decisions which would bind its successor.This would seem to rule out Mr Johnson engineering a no-deal exit.However, the Sunday Times reported the PM might carry on regardless, as much of the law in this area is untested, and only he can ask the EU to postpone Brexit or revoke Article .Ian Blackford, the SNP Westminster leader, yesterday asked all opposition parties bar the DUP to a cross-party summit on how to avoid a no-deal Brexit.He said: ldquoLetrsquos see what happens in September, he said. ldquoBecause the government will have to bring forward appropriate legislation to prepare for this Brexit no-deal exit that they want. And we will use all the means available to us, working across the parties ndash because we know there are plenty of Tory MPs who want to block no deal as well, particularly a lot of those who Boris Johnson, perhaps rather foolishly in retrospect, sacked from the cabinet two weeks ago.ldquoWersquore working with MPs across the House of Commons, and we will work to stop no deal.Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said the leaders of the EU should give their chief negotiator a free hand or a no-deal Brexit was ldquocoming down the tracks.In a newspaper article, Mr Barclay said Michel Barnier had to be given the latitude to rewrite the withdrawal agreement and remove the ldquoanti-democratic Irish backstop.Mr Barclay said the EU negotiator, who called abolishing the backstop ldquounacceptable, told him last week he was bound by instructions from the European Commission and EU leaders.Mr Barclay said ldquopolitical realities had changed, with  per cent of MEPs newly elected in May, and Mr Johnson in Downing Street vowing to deliver Brexit ldquodo or die in three months.He wrote: ldquoSuch a fundamental sht illustrates the need for a change of approachMr Barnier needs to urge EU leaders to consider thisthey too want an agreement, to enable him to negotiate in a way that finds common ground with the UK.

A while ago, I spent several months, through a friend, trying to convince a player with a Scottish premier league side to speak to me publicly about his sexuality. He appeared to be open to persuasion, but in the end he decided it just wasnrsquot worth the heartache.What was particularly interesting is that the playerrsquos team-mates and other players, the managers, and other staff, including my friend, all knew about his sexuality and were fine with it. Which leaves only one reason not to go public: the fans.Donrsquot misunderstand what Irsquom saying here: Irsquom not suggesting everyone in football management is cool with being gay ndash even now, most managers are older, working-class men who are often the last to adapt to changing social attitudes. Irsquove also spoken to a former youth coach who said he was told by a premier league side he couldnrsquot be employed with them because of his sexuality.However, itrsquos obvious that, on the whole, attitudes to sexuality within football have been changing and players and staff are generally much more open on the subject .The reaction of players has also possibly always been exaggerated. Karren Brady, the former boss of Birmingham City, said the other day that her husband, Paul Peschisolido, had played with Justin Fashanu in the s and no one in the dressing room had a problem with him being gay.The point is that, whether Karren Brady is right or not about the s, attitudes in the game have been improving, just as they have in society generally. There are several clubs in the UK now that have gay players who are honest about their sexuality within the team and even take their partners to club events ndash they are just not open about it in public.The Celtic captain Scott Brown was also clearly being honest when he said he would be supportive to a team-mate who was gay. And even players at Millwallhave said it doesnrsquot mattera team-mate is gay. As one football commentator put it to me: other players wouldnrsquot give a ****.The problem is that some fans are unlikely to feel the same way. Recently, my colleague Neil Cameron spoke to one of the players with the LGBT team HotScots FC, Craig Anderson, who said there have been times when the homophobic abuse hersquos heard at games has made him wonder whether football is the game for him. Irsquove also spoken to some of the HotScots players myself and they pretty much all say the same thing: in the changing room, sexuality is not a problem out in the stadium among some of the fans, it still is.Itrsquos interesting to speculate on what the reasons for this might be. One theory that amuses me is that the fans who are most vocal with homophobic abuse are trying to come to terms with the fact they love a game that idolises physically fit young men. A game like football in which the players are so uninhibited about kissing and touching each other should be the least homophobic of all, but some male fans may struggle with that, so they shout about poofs and queers to try to prove to the rest of us that theyrsquore not interested in the sight of players kissing and hugging other men. But wersquore on to them. We know they secretly love it.The idea that homophobia in football might be a problem with specic types of men rather than fans more generally is also borne out by the recent womenrsquos world cup. Menrsquos professional football has virtually no openly gay players, but the womenrsquos game is the opposite ndash it is full of out gay women at the highest level.And even the homophobia the female players experience confirms this is really a male problem wersquore talking about: some fans like to assume all female players are lesbians because they think football is essentially a manrsquos sport and any woman who wants to play it must ldquowant to be a man.Unfortunately, there is only one way to tackle this. Players can, and should, do positive interviews like the one Scott Brown did at the weekend. Football clubs can also prove how open they are, as Partick Thistle did recently with their kit inspired by the LGBT rainbow flag. But sadly, none of it will be enough to change the attitude of fans ndash that will only happen when the first British professional player in the premier league goes public about his sexuality.Are we getting closer to that point  You might think the tweets from ldquothe gay footballer prove we are. The tweeter said he was a professional player and would go public at the end of July. However, he then deleted the account which must obviously raise doubts about its authenticity. It also disappointed a lot of football fans because they know the game needs its first openly gay player.Whoever that player ends up being, he will definitely get abuse and there will be a backlash from some fans, and possibly players on other teams. But until someone openly challenges the homophobia in football by being openly gay, the homophobia will not go away.I realise thatrsquos a lot for one person to take on and he will have to be a pretty extraordinary person. But after it has happened, others will follow. Gay players will then become more visible. They will then be just part of the team. And finally homophobia in football will become socially unacceptable.It will also become a little ridiculous. Why would you scream abuse at someone whorsquos good  Why would you hate someone whorsquos brilliant at the game you love "},{"url":null,"title":"number-scottish-firms-going-rises-46-six-months","story":"Professional services firm KPMG said economic volatility is behind the trend, with Brexit creating uncertainty for businesses.The KPMG report comes a matter of weeks after the latest Scottish Chambers of CommerceQuarterly Economic Indicator said theeconomy is ldquorunning on fumes as the protracted uncertainty overBrexitcontinues to cause firms to put business investment on hold.A majority of firms were continuing to see cost rises because of skills shortages and sterling weakness sparked by the Brexit vote three years ago, which has pushed up the price of raw materials.KPMG advised Scottish businesses to plan for worst-case scenarios and be fiscally cautious.The firm said there were  corporate insolvency appointments between January and June, up from  in the previous six months.Of the  cases, the vast majorityinvolved a company liquidation, while  were administration and receivership appointments.:Fe manufacturer Havelock failed with office deal unresolvedThe number of insolvencies in the quarter ending June  is similar to that of the same period the previous year.Blair Nimmo, KPMG head of restructuring, said: \"While there is clearly a trend towards an increase in corporate insolvencies, there are some signs of resilience.\"The last quarter has remained far more static and a number of industries are taking proactive measures to put themselves on a more stable financial footing, including retailers, hoping corporate voluntary arrangement proposals could head off the prospect of administration.\"The ongoing Brexit discussions and change of Prime Minister and Cabinet have undoubtedly create a climate of uncertainty but there are wider challenges at play, creating a toxic mix of issues for businesses going through a period of distress.\"He added: \"The best approach for any business in Scotland right now is to maintain a fiscally cautious approach, ensuring you maximise reserves, proactively and regularly review contingency plans and - ultimately - plan for any worst case scenarios.:lsquoSerious implicationsrsquo for Scotland from threat to immigration, Fraser of Allander warns\"A number of challenges could be on the horizon, but with a resilient, focused approach, including taking appropriate advice at an early stage, Scotlands business community can continue to grow sustainably in the long-term.\"The Scottish Chambers of CommerceQuarterly Economic Indicator, published last monthlaidbare the ldquochaos caused by Brexit ldquodithering by the UKGovernment, which has so far failed to secure the support ofParliamentfor proposals rubber-stamping the departure from the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"inverurie aiming to shine for the community","story":"Judges will descend on Inverurie next week to assess the town for the coveted  Beautul Scotland awards.Inverurie Environmental Improvement Group has joined many others from across the country to celebrate more than  years of community improvement.The town is looking in fine colourful fettle for the judges arriving next weekAdministered by Keep Scotland Beautul - a member of the Royal Horticultural Society’s Bloom Federation - Beautul Scotland recognises the efforts of local authorities, communities and businesses which work tirelessly to improve their local cities, towns and villages.Entrants have together nurtured an astonishing number of plants, organised local environmental awareness campaigns and encouraged mass volunteer participation – all to improve the places they live and work in.Now the planters are blooming, the streets are clean and the community is ready to showcase its hard work to the Beautul Scotland judges.Three themes are examined during the judging - horticultural achievement,community participation and environmental responsibility - to discover which communities have been most successful in improving the attractiveness, cleanliness and sustainability of the places they care for.Winning communities will be presented with awards at a ceremony hosted by Dumfries and Galloway Council in September .The overall winner will be presented with the prestigious Rosebowl Trophy, while a number of discretionary awards will be presented for outstanding performance in areas such as bioersity, tourism, and community involvement.

These would be in place for up to three years, although it is unlikely that they would be required for thisof time.The equipment used on the met masts gathers a range of meteorological data in order to provide a detailed understanding of the area’s wind characteristics.Orkney Islands Council announced in April that is was intending to investigate an additional two sites for potential community wind farms in the county — to add to the project already under investigation on Hoy.The new sites under consideration are located at Faray, in the North Isles, and at Quanterness in St Ola. The aim of the project, which is being led by the OIC#s strategic projects team, would be to generate signicant income and community benefit for Orkney.Sweyn Johnston, the council’s strategic projects director, said: “Applying for planning permission for the #met masts# is the latest stage in further investigating the sites we have identied and have been discussing with folk at drop-in events over the last few months. Installing #met masts# would allow data to be gathered which could be critical in determining how we move forward with the project.”For more information visit the Planning Application Search and Submission page on the OIC website• For the Quanterness planning application search for   PP.• For the Hoy planning application search for   PP.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now, the environmental body hopes that this will be reduced by Scotland’s forthcoming depositscheme.Under the scheme, shoppers will pay a p deposit when buying drinks purchased in single-use plastic or glass bottles and aluminium or steel cans. People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling. The aim of that p will be to give people an extra incentive to recycle their empty bottles and cans, and make people think twice about dropping them.#Our new figures reveal how Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme could visibly slash the number of littered plastic bottles in the Orkney Islands,# said Zero Waste Scotland#s chief operating officer, Jill Farrell.#We all hate seeing empty bottles and cans littering our streets, green spaces and beaches. The great thing about Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme is it will give people a p incentive to do the right thing with their empty bottles — take them back for recycling, rather than risk them ending up on our streets or in our rivers.#Litter isn’t just an eyesore — it also pollutes our environment and seas. And for every bottle littered, more plastic has to be created, generating more planet-damaging emissions. When you take back your empty bottles to be recycled, you’ll not just be getting your p back — you’ll be doing your bit in the fight against the climate emergency.#Further figures from Zero Waste Scotland also show that Orkney goes through an estimated . million plastic bottles every year. An estimated , plastic bottles are littered in the county each year. With a p incentive not to throw away your empties, Zero Waste Scotland anticipates a  per cent reduction in litter for the materials included in the scheme. This would mean , fewer plastic bottles dropped in Orkney Islands each year.With plastic bottles only one of the materials included in the scheme, the overall impact on litter is expected to be even higher. Steel and aluminium cans, glass bottles will also be part of the scheme. The Scottish Government is expected to introduce legislation to enable the scheme later this year.

Orkney’s MSP highlighted the government’s continued failure to find a solution to the islands’ internal ferry services, including replacement vessels, and the lack of progress on implementing RET on external services, a year on from the promised start date. Mr McArthur said: “The National Islands Plan will be important in mapping out the areas where improvements are needed to secure a vibrant future for our island communities.“During the passage of the legislation, I moved amendments making clear that one of the most urgent priorities would be delivering changes and improvements to leline ferry services to meet the needs of people and businesses in Orkney.“This seems to be the message that is coming through loud and clear in the consultation, as demonstrated by the recent response from the NFUS.  It will come as a surprise to no one but should act as a clear signal to ministers that the continued failure to act is unacceptable.“We need a sustainable and long term solution to the funding and operation of our internal ferry services, on which some of our most fragile communities rely. This includes replacement vessels for a fleet that is ageing and no longer fit for purpose.“In addition, more than a year on from the date on which RET was supposed to be introduced, we seem no nearer seeing the reduction in fares. Those using these services are therefore continuing to pay over the odds.

Sadly, many are under threat from coastal erosion and the effects of climate change.“SCHARP is doing brilliant work engaging communities with this issue and working to identy and protect sites across Scotland, including a number here in Orkney.  Without the work of volunteers, however, this would simply not be possible. Those who get involved, devoting their time, energy and local knowledge, are due an enormous debt of gratitude.“For example, volunteers in Sanday helped to move and rebuild eroding structures from the Meur Burnt Mound to the local heritage centre, preserving an important cultural and historical attraction. This is just one example of the invaluable work carried out by volunteers that will allow current and future generations a better understanding of their heritage.“I know there is similar great work being undertaken in communities across Scotland and I’ve written to my MSP colleagues encouraging them to find out more about what is happening in their constituencies and regions. The summer recess provides a perfect opportunity to get out and learn more about these projects and the volunteers that make them possible.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Shetland football matches for the Milne Cup dating back to Jockie Wood£ . tax incl.One Hundred Glorious Games is the title chosen to describe the milestone just reached in the annual football fixture between teams representing Orkney and Shetland. But how can those words be justied Well, the first bit is easy. We have just witnessed the th match in the series and from an Orkney point of view the game and outcome were ‘glorious’. But they haven’t all been like that. Amidst many dazzling encounters there have been some dull, tepid affairs which have failed to raise the pulse rate for supporters of either hue.Ah, but that’s all right. Teams are allowed the odd blip or series of blips, safe in the knowledge that the deep sense of history and tradition built up over a long period of time will cover it. No lasting damage will be done to something so enduring as the annual Milne Cup fixture which is ingrained into the culture of the Northern Isles. It is a game like no other and to play in it represents the pinnacle of most players’ footballing ambitions.So, look at it like this. Despite what those from other sporting disciplines might say, football is the ‘glorious game.’ Orkney versus Shetland is our own ‘glorious game.’ And we have just reached number one hundred. Straightforward really!Now, feel free to open the covers and follow the story . . . so far. Experience the ups and downs, intrigue and controversy of more than a century of inter-county football.

The goodwill for such agreements was there, she added.It is easy to see the appeal of such agreements for those voters who believe that Brexit – especially the no-deal iety now envisaged by the Prime Minister – represents a catastrophic act of self-harm. If Swinson and the leaders of other avowedly anti-Brexit parties could reach agreements in key constituencies across the UK to stand only the candidate with the greatest chance of winning then, surely, the chances of the Johnson project being stopped in its tracks would be greatly enhanced.There are just one or two small hurdles in the way…The first of these is the fact that, although speculation runs feverishly, Johnson has not yet called a general election.It’s certainly true that many Conservative Party MPs would like the new PM to capitalise on a boost in the polls to try to increase their numbers at Westminster, but others believe this might be a risky strategy. If Nigel Farage’s Brexit Partysplits the right-wing Eurosceptic vote, then a snap election could bring the Johnson premiership to a sudden end.But let us imagine that Johnson goes down the general election route before the current Brexit deadline of  October and that Swinson sets about trying to build an anti-Brexit coalition. She might have been able to persuade Plaid and the Greens to step aside in a single by-election, but would these parties really be so keen to lay down their electoral chances across the country  Would they risk, by seeing their overall votes in a general election diminish severely, becoming less politically relevant And what about the SNP, every bit as opposed to Brexit as the Lib Dems  There are fewer seats in Scotland where anti-Brexit parties risk splitting the vote than there are in England, but one of them – East Dunbartonshire – is Swinson’s own.Swinson served as MP for that constituency between - and was then defeated by the SNP’s John Nicolson. She took the seat back in , largely, I suspect because of Nicolson’s unpopularity. But with a more impressive candidate, the SNP would surely have a fighting chance of snatching it back. The removal of the leader of the Liberal Democrats from the House of Commons would represent quite a scalp for the nationalists. Can you imagine Nicola Sturgeon passing up the opportunity to see off Swinson  I can’t. And nor would I blame the SNP leader for committing signicant resources to bringing down Swinson. Politics is a contact sport and Swinson is a major target. The suggestion from her that the SNP should give her a clear run at the seat would, rightly, be met with derision.Jo Swinson is not the only party leader now talking about pacts. Brexit Party leader Farage has raised the prospect of deals with the Conservatives, particularly in the north of England, to ensure the election of Eurosceptic MPs.Given the result of the  referendum, any such agreements would surely guarantee the evisceration of any anti-Brexit candidates in those areas.Yes, electoral pacts might be made to work for pro-EU parties but they could just as easily be the secret of Brexiteer success.Those now clamouring for agreements to be struck between the Lib Dems and other parties which take the same position on EU membership should, I think, be careful that they are not wishing for the creation of two-horse races in key constituencies across the country. That scenario would risk strengthening rather than weakening the Brexiteers’ squad at Westminster.Johnson is supported by a team in government that is fully committed to Brexit by  October at any cost. The PM will gladly sacrice the best interests of the UK economy to protect himself.This being so, and with Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour still embarrassingly weak on the matter of Brexit, the idea that the Johnson project might be stopped is an appealing one to those of us who would dearly like to see Brexit cancelled at this late stage.But I fear that any plan to run a single anti-Brexit candidate in a constituency would be met with a plan to run a single pro-Brexit candidate. Jiggery-pokery would be fought with jiggery-pokery.It is abundantly clear that Brexiteers won the  referendum with a campaign strewn with lies. Their promises of an effortless, painless departure from the EU have long since been exposed.But rather than turning against campaign leaders, pro-Brexit voters appear to be hardening their positions and cheering on a damaging no-deal departure.It may now be obvious that Brexit is going to be dficult to deliver. But stopping it will be harder still.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed out of touch scottish office in line to earn huge private incomes","story":"The new Scotland Office ministers have been accused of being #out of touch# after a Scotland on Sunday investigation revealed they were in line to earn private incomes reaching tens of thousands of pounds that do not appear on the MPs# register of interests.Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has been paid £, in idends by his self-storage company over the past three years, while investments held by junior Scotland Office minister Colin Clark distributed profits of nearly £m last year.Under parliamentary rules, MPs are not required to declare idends from shareholdings on the official register of financial interests.But the revelations have prompted fresh calls for parliamentary authorities to review the rules around shareholdings, so the public have a clear understanding of the scale and source of MPs’ wealth. Earlier this year, the new Leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, refused to comment on reports that the investment fund which he owns at least  per cent of had shared profits of £m over the past two years among its  members.None of the new Scotland Office ministers has any regular outside income recorded on their register of interests.However, analysis carried out by Scotland on Sunday comparing parliamentary records with accounts published by Companies House found that last year, both were eligible for payments running into tens of thousands of pounds – potentially matching their salaries as MPs and ministers.Neither David Mundell, former secretary of state for Scotland, nor under secretary Ian Duncan had declared any shareholdings at the time of their departures.Shadow secretary of state for Scotland Lesley Laird said: “Trust in politicians, governments and the wider political process is, arguably, at an all-time low, and these revelations will do nothing to change that.“Alister Jack and Colin Clark appear to be raking in far more cash from their private holdings alone than most people in Scotland earn.“Many people in Scotland will think there’s simply no way that compares to their own daily experience after almost a decade of Tory austerity.“This will obviously raise questions about the need to address the current lack of clarity on outside earnings.”And the SNP’s Scotland Office spokesperson Tommy Sheppard MP said: “It is clear the Scotland Office is not in touch with the ordinary Scot, nor does the department have Scotland’s best interests at heart, as the Tories continue to sideline Scotland’s needs.”But a UK government source hit back, saying: “The people who are really out of touch with the majority of Scots are the SNP and Labour.“It’s ridiculous to suggest business experience is a bad thing. Most people see it as an advantage to have people in parliament with an understanding of business and experience of le beyond politics. The important thing is they declare their interests in accordance with the rules.”Drawing attention to SNP MP Ian Blackford’s paid roles as chairman of two companies, the source added: “Politicians on all sides with a business background, such as the SNP leader in the Commons, would surely not disagree with that.”The latest company accounts indicate that in , Jack was paid a idend of £, by Edinburgh Self Storage Ltd. He continues to own up to  per cent of shares in the company. Accounts indicate the same sum was paid as a idend in .As a cabinet minister, the Scottish Secretary is expected to earn a salary of £, per year.Jack resigned as a director of Edinburgh Self Storage on  June, , shortly before the general election, and was replaced on the same day by his we Ann, who is described in Companies House records as an “interior designer”. She remains one of three directors of the company, who according to the accounts were entitled to pay totalling £, in , as well as a share of company contributions to a defined pension scheme totalling £,.On  June, , Ann Jack also replaced her husband as one of four directors of Mollin HEP Ltd, a company set up to manage the sale of renewable electricity generated on the family farm. The latest set of accounts indicate that Mollin HEP paid idends totalling £, to directors.Clark, who was named the parliamentary undersecretary of state at the Scotland Office, owns at least three quarters of the shares in Nessgro Ltd, an agricultural produce marketing company.His register of interests states that his position as one of two directors of the company is unpaid. However, the company’s latest annual accounts report that idends of £, were payable in the year ending  May, .Clark is also a member of a number of limited liability partnerships that manage investments including property holdings.According to the latest set of accounts, one of the companies, Maven CapitalLLP – which manages a Travelodge hotel in Wales – generated profits of £, which were available for distribution among  active members.Another company, Maven CapitalLLP – which manages a Georgian office block in Glasgow – reported profits of £,, in its latest set of accounts, for distribution among its  active members. It is not possible to determine Clark’s share of any payout. However, an equal share of the profits from both companies would total well over £, – nearly matching Clark’s salary as an MP.A UK government spokesperson said: “We do not recognise these figures.“Our ministers are clear that their financial interests are wholly and properly declared according to the rules, which are designed to ensure transparency and protect standards in public le.“Mr Jack and Mr Clark have set up businesses which employ hundreds of people across Scotland and the UK. They understand how important it is to support businesses and industry in Scotland, to keep people in jobs and contribute to our economic growth.”The spokesperson added: “When Mr Jack became an MP he stepped back from a number of business interests to allow him to concentrate on parliamentary matters. Some of these were roles in private family businesses, which were taken over by his we. There is nothing improper in this.”The register of interests does record details the extensive property and shareholdings owned by Mr Jack and Mr Clark, who both enjoyed successful business careers before entering parliament in .On his Dumfries and Galloway estate, Mr Jack has declared agricultural land, two cottages and a salmon fishery. Mr Clark’s register of interests includes his house in Inverurie, which he co-owns with his we, and a farm with agricultural land in Aberdeenshire which includes three cottages that are rented out.Both men have also declared signicant shareholdings beyond those that have paid idends in recent years: Mr Jack’s register of interests includes six companies where he holds at least  per cent of share capital, and another seven shareholdings valued at over £,. Mr Clark has reported nine shareholdings worth over £,.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep. But just like the visit of old friends tends to be too brief, so there is already a longing for next July."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2465-Raasay.jpg","title":"recruitment drive to restore nursing cover for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe move, which is part of the recommendations outlined bySir Lewis Ritchie in his out of hour health care report for Skye, Lochalsh andSouth West Ross, intends to end a period of four years in which the island hasbeen without an overnight nursing presence.In its advert, NHS Highland states: “Professor Sir LewisRitchie#s Report of May  into out of hours care in Skye, Raasay and SouthWest Ross has enabled a move towards innovative healthcare here when he saw theneed for equity of access to services even where numbers are relatively small…“Raasay offers a rare opportunity to provide cradle to gravepersonal nursing and primary care with continuity while working as part of amutually supportive team.”The chosen applicants will have a “considerable degree ofautonomy” and would liaise with “colleagues and line manager based in NorthSkye and with access to support from GPs in Portree and Rural Practitioners inMacKinnon Memorial Hospital, Broadford when required.”The band six positions at a salary scale of £, # £, per annum are permanent with both full-time and part-time hours available."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LOCHCARRON-GAMES-1-adj.jpg","title":"number 41 in the sun for lochcarron highland","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.Sinclair Patience of Tain and Angus Davren of Conon Bridge excelled at the st edition of the games as they wrote their names into the record books.Angus Davren hit new heights as he cleared . metres to set a new ground record in the high jump.

The results are projects which genuinely improve the lives of today#s residents # as well as visitors # and leave a legacy for future generations. What is even more remarkable is the fact these projects are achieved with very little access to loans. The good work of the community trusts is achieved through dogged determination to raise funds within the community combined with seriously clever navigation of the minefield of grant applications. By steadily securing the funds from a myriad public pots and local activities the trusts ensure each project is not only affordable now, but sustainable for generations to come.In Staffin # home to the iconic Old Man of Storr # the local community trust has raised over £, to upgrade existing footpaths and create new ones. There will be new parking, #welcome# structures and interpretation boards at all sites. The whole project will result in what the trust is calling #Skye Ecomuseum# which will encourage visitors to spend more time and therefore more money in Staffin.In the north west of Skye, the Glendale Trust covers a huge area that attracts , visitors a year # many travelling the long and winding single track road to the top five hotspot of Neist Point.The trust, under the leadership of Tim Hunter-Davies and three new directors, is working hard to develop sustainable facilities for the community and tourists. They have taken ownership of Meanish Pier and the foreshore, creating opportunities for local residents and regional businesses alike. It will be run commercially and provide income to enable the Trust to invest in further sustainable community projects.Glendale # which was the subject of Scotland#s first community buyout back in  # is rich in history and the trust is also looking to develop projects that preserve and share the story of the area, as Tim Hunter-Davies explains: #As well as being instrumental in land reform in the last century, Glendale has a rich heritage stretching back through the centuries. A steamer used to sail daily from Loch Dunvegan and was used as a point to transport many people away from Scotland during the Highland clearances. We want to preserve and share our history with the community and visitors.#In south Skye is the Sleat Community Trust. It has been working hard to provide and improve leline services for the community that also benefit visitors arriving and leaving Skye on the Armadale Mallaig ferry.The SCT currently provides shop, post office and fuel services in two buildings no longer fit for purpose. Over £, has been raised from public and private sources to build a new shop with a community #social# space and offices for the employees of the Trust. They hope to open the new shop in early summer .In addition, the purchase by the Trust of the -hectare Tormore Forest in  continues to create additional sources of income, including selling housing plots as well as an attraction for the community and visitors alike. As trust business development manager Mike Shucksmith explains, the success is based on a combination of commercial and voluntary activity.He said: #To maintain the forest, we have to generate income so we sell split logs to the community, create woodchip for biomass boilers and are developing a micro-hydro scheme. At the same time, we have a vibrant volunteer culture in Sleat who have created a network of paths, social areas and a polytunnel where local school children can help grow saplings to regenerate the forest. The trust also operates #Skyenet # a community broadband network # a community transport scheme, Tormore Explore Forest School and the Visit Sleat tourism group, which promotes the area as a destination of choice for visitors.#From the Sleat Peninsula to the gateway to Skye in the south where a new access route to the island is being created by the members of the Broadford and Strath Community Company. They are developing a cycle path all the way from Kyle of Lochalsh to Broadford. One of the project pioneers is keen local cyclist, Andy Neison.#I used to commute from Teangue on Sleat to Kyle by bike,# he said. #I was really unnerved by the road from Breakish to Kyle with a high volume of fast-moving traffic. When friends told me about the old road from Broadford to Kyle I started exploring sections of it. It#s a good starting point and will become a pioneer project for the highlands.#After receiving a grant of £, from Sustrans, a sustainable transport charity, to fund engineering and traffic surveys, the Trust is now working to secure funding for a project officer to take the Skye Cycleway to the next phase. The community is heavily invested in the project with volunteers coming out in all weathers to clear sections of the old road, but this is a long-term project with hundreds of thousands of pounds ultimately needed to complete the full route from Kyle to Broadford.Over the Skye bridge, the Kyle and Lochalsh Community Trust is creating a vast community and visitor experience on a piece of land known as the Plock.Securing funding from the Scottish Land Fund enabled the Trust to take ownership of the Plock and the old Skye Bridge toll office and develop a masterplan for these two community assets. On the Plock itself, there will be a hub building with cafe, carpark and toilets, a network of accessible paths, a #pitch and putt# course, a Viking living village, accommodation pods, a watersports centre, wildle hide and a for thrill-seekers a huge zipline across the bay.Jo Wawrzyczek of the trust expects the Plock to attract , visitors a year. #This is an ambitious project that will cost almost £million,# she said. #However, it is very important for local people and businesses as it will help to create a great community space as well as keep visitors in our community for longer.#The trust also owns and manages the public toilets and pontoons in Kyle which will be a source of income for the project. With the aim of making the project self-sustaining, the Trust plans to lease the café and watersports centre on the Plock as well as generating income through the accommodation pods. Inspired by the success of other community-driven harbour developments such as Tobermory on Mull, Portree and Braes Community Trust want to maximise opportunities for local people and visitors through taking ownership of the harbour and improving facilities.The trust is currently in talks about relocating the oil tanks at the pier head which would be a breakthrough for the project and open up commercial opportunities. They are also considering a new road from the south to improve access and ert traffic away from the town centre. But according to development officer Fiona Thompson a new breakwater and pontoons will be the real game-changer for Portree.She said: #There have been aspirations for improvements to facilities at the harbour for over  years with little major investment.The harbour group are now closer than ever to realizing the community#s vision for a new, vibrant, welcoming port.

They are intent on pursuing a strategy to undermine workers’ pay, terms and conditions as well as imposing price hikes excluding lower income users. There is now a substantial two-tier workforce with increasing numbers of casual workers coming in on poverty pay rates while those previously employed by Belfast City Council are being denied pay uplts, leaving their wages fall ever closer to the legal minimum.“The community has been left behind as well. Last year Unite called a protest against the price hikes and attacks on workers’ pay and conditions on the peaceline which drew signicant cross-community support from both the Shankill and Falls. Working class people are united in their opposition to the council’s austerity-driven policies on leisure services.“Belfast City Council voted to outsource leisure services to this company – they cannot wash their hands of the consequences of that for either the public or their former employees. We call on all parties to reconsider their positions and bring these public services back in-house and give all the GLL workers a decent pay uplt.”A spokesperson for GLL said the company would meet union representatives to “understand the issues they have”.“GLL remains committed to genuine engagement on these matters in the interests of all parties, and to ensure the seamless provision of services across all of our leisure centres,” the spokesperson added.A Belfast City Council spokesperson said: “Belfast City Council is disappointed to learn that strike action is being considered at the city’s leisure centres. Council is committed to working with GLL, its employees and their representatives to ensure the continued provision of leisure services to all our ratepayers across Belfast.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"bombay street play brings back memories for roma","story":"BRASSNECK Theatre Company’s latest productiontells the story of the burning of Bombay Street.Something in the Air will take to the stage at the Roddy’s for a limited run during the annual Féile an Phobail. Written by playwright Laurence McKeown and centred on events surrounding the pogroms, which led to the outbreak of the Troubles  years ago this August, the play details how sectarian violence erupted across the city, how families were forced to flee their homes and ended up taking refuge across the border. Brassneck Artistic Director Tony Devlin told the Andersonstown News how the play will coincide with the th anniversary of the events, which were the catalyst for the Troubles. “This play is a daring piece of writing that will force audiences to not only reflect on the  years since the Troubles began but through it we want to create a conversation for debate and discussion about how we collectively move forward for the benefit of future generations.“The play explores one woman’s journey from Bombay Street after that night when her family were forced from their home and forced to go to a place called Gormanston down south where these families stayed for a few months while Bombay Street was rebuilt or they were rehoused,” he said. “ years later, this woman, who was  at the time, is expecting a researcher from Dublin to come and talk to her about the events of that night. This character Rosie Murray is played by acclaimed actor Roma Tomelty who I have known for years and am delighted to be working with in this project.”Tony spoke of how the play was to be first performed at The MAC theatre back in May but had to be halted due to the tragic death of fellow lead actress Mary Jordan’s mother in a car accident in Dublin. “We cancelled the show and now are in a position to bring it back. Working on this, directing this has been an education for me having been born in the late ’s, I had never heard of Gormanston. I didn’t know we had refugees in our own country during this time in our history. “Myself and Laurence also wanted to focus on the North South ide which is an underlying theme in this play. We wanted to address how the North and South has been pulled apart since partition.”Roma Tomelty who portrays the character of Rosie Murray said she knew “exactly who she, Rosie, was” from the first few lines of the script. “I have known Tony a long time, he asked me to play the part and we have a long history. When I got the script, the first line is that ‘I went to St Vincent’s School’ – which I did so from then on in I thought I know exactly who you are. The play is marking this event. “I was on the road the night the burning of Bombay Street happened.

Left undiagnosed, it can cause sudden death where someone has an unexpected cardiac arrest.Every year since, Joe’s family and friends take part in the annual Belfast Marathon, with all proceeds going towards the British Heart Foundation who use the money to fund research into silent heart conditions.This year,  members of Joe’s family and friends raised £, from their Marathon efforts. Their recent fundraising efforts have brought their overall total since Joe’s death to an amazing £, for the charity.Joe’s sister Jeanette O’Neill said: “This is the third year we have taken part in the Belfast Marathon for the BHF in Joe’s memory. Each year we just keep getting bigger and better with more people from our community getting involved through the full marathon, fun run and relay.“When Joe died our family was absolutely devastated. He was a real character and everyone knew him. He made such a big impact on so many people and it’s amazing that so many of his friends are still so supportive and want to help our fundraising efforts.“We don’t want what happened to our family to happen to any other family so that’s why we fundraise for the BHF because their research into conditions like Long QT are making such a big dference.”Jeanette said they have been overwhelmed by the support from their local community since Joe’s death.“Friends and family have just been fantastic. We are also hugely grateful to the Thunderdome in Glengormley for hosting a buffet for Joe’s runners after the marathon. It gave us a chance to get together after the event and share stories about Joe. It was so lovely.”"},{"url":null,"title":"annual belfast eastside arts festival kicks off in style","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Those included Foyle Jobs and Benefits Office on Asylum Road, Carlisle House on Carlisle Road and Orchard House on Foyle Street from early morning until .am.After the picket lines, members gathered for a rally at the City Hotel which began at .am.The -hour strike was organised to highlight an imposed “pay deal” of .% and changes to terms and conditions of employment which union officials claim have been implemented without proper and meaningful consultation.Ms Gates addressed the rally along with Gerry Murphy, President of Irish Congress of Trade Unionsand Niall McCarroll, Chairman of the Derry Trades Union Council .Mr McCarroll addressed a packed room at the City Hotel where he said all workers had taken action to bring about better working conditions.He said the Tory government was “attacking working class communities” and it is time to “fight back” by building solidarity amongst workers. “Let us together build up a working-class spirit and let the Tories know we can bring them down.”Meanwhile, Ms Gates was keen to dispel the notion of civil servants having well-paid “cushy jobs” as an “absolute myth”. She added: “There are civil servants relying on tax credits, second jobs, credit cards to bring them to the end of the month or to pay off debts and those using food banks.”She praised those in the room for leading the way, recognising that many,not all of them, could ill afford to go without pay for the day. “We have to say, enough is enough, they can’t keep piling work on us and saying they can’t even give us a decent pay increase.“Many workers are % worse off than ten years ago in real terms.”Referring to legal action which has been initiated for “failure to consult”, she informed those in attendance, that the judge has decided to forego a pre-hearing by instead fixing a court date.She added that there will be a “few white faces” in the Department of Finance who know their actions have been “discriminatory” as they have been “acting outside the law”.

It is perched above the Co Donegal village of Burt and attracts thousands of visitors every year.The fort is a powerful manestation of what remains of ancient Ireland and on a clear day, from its pinnacle, it is possible to get a glimpse of three counties-Donegal, Derry and Tyrone. The commanding and spectacular waterways of Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle lie to its west and east respectively.But, in the th Century the fort, once home to kings of old Gaelic order, was rapidly disintegrating towards extinction. It was however saved by the vision of one man who spearheaded its restoration just over  years ago.Dr Walter Bernard was born on May ,  at Newmarket, Co Cork. His father was a captain in the th Rles, a regiment of the British Army and was amongst the reinforcements that arrived in Brussels on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo in June of  but was apparently too late to take part in the famed history changing conflict.Walter became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland in , a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland in  and Fellow of that college in .Between - Dr Bernard served as a surgeon throughout the Crimean War attending the wounded British soldiers at Inkerman and witnessed the ravages caused by small pox and cholera. He later recalled that for every man that was shot, fty more were killed by those diseases, particularly in the notoriously harsh winters of  and .On the journey home from the Ukranian battlefields, he saved a man from drowning and was awarded with a certicate from the Royal Humane Society. Then, with his experiences of military conflict at an end, Dr Bernard landed back in Ireland and settled in Buncrana before building up a very large medical practice in Derry. He ran this surgery for over sixty years and was a prominent member of the city’s branch of the British Medical Association as well as holding many public offices throughout his career.One such appointment was to examine the quality of water in the city for Londonderry Corporation at public facilities such as the Creggan reservoirs built in stages between -, and which supplied much of the city’s domestic and industrial water needs.His experience of the waterborne disease cholera in the Crimea made him an ideal candidate for this job.Dr Bernard also addressed the Medical Society of King and Queens College of Physicians on the issuer of diphtheria in April . He cautioned the assembled medics that there was a reason why the disease was largely absent from statistics sheets.He said: “There are few diseases about which so many mistakes in diagnosis are made.”He feared the misdiagnosis rate was so high that it was almost impossible to ensure that ‘true diphtheria’ was as common in a town as reported.Dr Bernard added: “Diphtheria occurs in Londonderry, I have no doubt whatever…in my practice it has been my lot to treat many cases of this disease.”At some point in , Dr Bernard paid a visit to Grianan of Aileach and many years later in , he said of the experience: “Seventeen years ago, when this traditional and historical place was first visited by me, I found it in a very ruinous condition, and from that time I commenced to take an interest in its associations.“Year after year I witnessed further advance of its ruin, and I clearly saw thatsomething were not soon done to arrest the progress of its destruction, it would be in a few years a thing of the past.”Grianan of Aileach is a hilltop fort that sits on top of Greenan Mountain in Inishowen just over  feet above ground level.The ringfort was thought to have been built in the sixth or seventh century, although there is some evidence to suggest that the site had been in use before that.Greek astronomer and cartographer Ptolemy penned a remarkably accurate map of Ireland in  A.D. from which maps were later created in the th and th centuries. He called the land ‘Iouernia’, thought to mean ‘abundant land’ from which the Irish names Eriu and Eire are derived. Amongst two sites identied as ‘regia’ or royal places in Ireland by the Greek map maker, one of them is believed by some historians to be the Grianan of Aileach.Whether Ptolemy pinpointed it or not, the Kingdom of Aileach was indeed one of Ireland’s royal sites of the Gaelic order. The fort was thought to have been constructed originally by the northern section of the Ui Neill clan, but between  A.D. and the thirteen centuries, over  kings from ious clans, some also High Kings of Ireland, held the throne of Aileach. The last man to be known as the King of Aileach was Aed Buide Ua Neill who died in .Despite ious interpretations, it is generally agreed that Aileach means ‘stony place’ and the word Grianan means ‘sunny place’ so that Grianan of Aileach broadly translates as ‘The Stone Palace of the Sunny View’.Whatever the actual meaning of its name, it is evident that it was an extremely important place. Aileach’s political and strategic importance was such that the annals of Irish history record that it was attacked at least three times. In , Finsnechta Fledach, King of Ireland, destroyed the fort.Again, in , when Muirchertach MacNeill was king, Viking raiders sacked the site when they settled at Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. It’s also thought that King Brian Boru came to Aileach in , but it was destroyed once more in , when another King of Munster, Muirchertach Ua Briaincame to Inishowen and plundered the region and razed the fort. The fort was laid to waste by O’Brien in revenge for O’Neill’s destruction of his royal seat at Kincora and he reportedly told his soldiers to each take a stone from the Donegal hillside so the place would be reduced to rubble.The fort itself could have served two main s both as a defensive and a ceremonial one and moreover as a settlement that was surrounded by ringforts of lesser importance. Whatever its actual , it is known that buildings of this nature were very rare in North West Ulster and its presence signies that its inhabitants were regarded as being very important.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe linking of St Patrick to the site is seen as attempt by Christian converts to place it firmly in that tradition whilst acknowledging its pagan history and the naming of a holy well right outside the ringfort in honour of Ireland’s patron saint seems to confirm that.There is also a mythological and folklore version of the founding of Grianan of Aileach which says the ringfort was built by Dagda , a god and the king of the Tuatha De Danann-the supposed ‘Tribe of the Gods’-a supernatural race in Irish mythology. The Tuatha De Danann are said to have invaded Ireland before the Celts and built strategic stone forts on the tops of hills.Dagda was said to have fought the Second Battle of Moytirra against the Fomorians and the fort at Aileach was built over the grave of his son Aedh who had been murdered.In , a Derry based group called the Irish Irelanders, enthusiastic Gaelic revivalists travelled to the site on Sunday afternoons and carried out some repairs. But, the splendour and historical intrigue of Grianan of Aileach had largely been ignored for many years until in , Dr Walter Bernard decided to begin its restoration in earnest.In the s, painter, musician, antiquarian and archaeologist George Petrie examined Grianan of Aileach when he was head of the Royal Irish Academy’s antiquities committee which was linked to the Irish Ordnance Survey.Petrie’s findings suggested that the hill many have been enclosed by many other ramparts and a line of stones leading up to the entrance which were all gone by then.But, despite his efforts, the expert’s findings remained confined to the records of the Royal Irish Academy, there were no efforts by the organisation to attempt any restoration of the ancient site.It was Dr Bernard who took practical action beyond the analysis of the site. He paid for the entire project that took place between - and recruited his crew of labourers from the farms surrounding Burt. They ferried the materials needed for the restoration on the back up small carts up supplied by the local landowners up the incredibly steep hill.What the doctor found at the site was a disorganised mess of which he said it was: “An immense circular heap of stones, with its grey fallen masonry scattered over the interior-no vestige of a wall, entrance passage, or central building.”Remembering that Walter Bernard was a medical doctor with no detailed description of what an ancient ringfort truly looked like and that there weren’t enough stones on site to complete the job, makes this story even more remarkable.Dr Bernard discovered many animal bones on the site including sheep, cows and goats and items like sling stones and warrior’s clubs. The most interesting stone object discovered was a ‘slab of sandstone, chequered into thirty-six squares’, believed to be a games board of some type.The doctor and his crew of labourers used the measurements of other Irish forts such as Staigue Fort in Co Kerry as the comparative basis for the restoration project at Grianan of Aileach. The finished product is a fort that stands . metres in diameter and more than five metres tall with walls that are almost four metres thick.Dr Bernard later described a part of the building project by saying: “To bind our work into a complete unity we had to gather around the hill about  or  loose stones-certainly not more,so many-and to split from the adjoining rocks, cropping up through the heather,  coping stones. These are supposed to serve instead of those removed by King Murdock O’Brien in .”Only speculation can be used to assessthe interior of today’s fort accurately resembles its ancient predecessor, but when the alternative was the complete disappearance of the Iron Age construction, then surely Bernard’s efforts become even more admirable.The fort has stood for centuries as a silent witness to major events of Irish history. From the top of Grianan fort you can just make out the location of the Co Donegal village of Rathmullen on the western bank of Lough Swilly.It was from Rathmullen in  that the chieftains Hugh O’Neill and Rory O’Donnell sailed with their families after the final defeat by the English taking with them the last symbols of the old Gaelic order once enshrined in its pomp by places such as Grianan of Aileach. Behind them in the distance the old fort sat on its hilltop as a fading reminder of a society and its traditions that would never .A legend says that in a secret cave on a hill beneath Grianan O’Neill’s warriors rest in a bewitched sleep in full armour and sitting on their horses ready for the next fight. The spell, says the legend, will only be broken when the next destined leader of Ulster arrives to lead them to victory.It is a myth that would have no visible attachmentit had not been for the passion of Dr Walter Bernard in the late th century in restoring Grianan of Aileach to something approaching its former glory.A tourist road to the fort was opened on September ,  by President of Ireland Eamon De Valera who was accompanied by Fine Gael TD for Donegal West, Pat O’Donnell, then Minister for Local Government. In the early s the Office of Public Works in the Republic of Ireland carried out further repairs to Grianan of Aileacgh after a wall collapsed. But as late as October  the Irish Government was being severely criticised by political representatives in Donegal for still failing to establish tour guides and other facilities at the ancient site.In his obituary contained in the Universities and Colleges magazine of December , , it was reported that Dr Bernard died suddenly at his residence in Buncrana on eight days previously on December . He was -years-old and was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Dr Bernard’s obituary ended: “He leaves a widow.

It is completely apparent that the public here want action from the governments on a new university, now, as a matter of urgent priority.”“The North West, despite the political uncertainty, is in a prime position to establish a new cultural and educational institution, which could act as a catalyst for the economic regeneration of the region and reverse the damage already being done by Brexit on the Derry and Donegal communities.“The Derry University Group is willing to advise and assist Council and others in developing and delivering a new university, as we have always done in the past. Of course we also need a Medical School for the North West as part of any new university, but it is only a very small part of a much bigger picture.“We need a minimum of , additional students in this city.

This impact was particularly felt in areas like here in Strabane where pride in the hunger strikers, their courage and sacrice still remains undiminished almost  years on.”The roots of what took place in  began several years earlier, when in  Belfast republican Kieran Nugent became the first man to refuse to wear a prison unorm. In , republicans had been accorded what the British termed Special Category Status recognising the political nature of their offences.By the mid-s however, political status had been withdrawn and as the cages of Long Kesh were replaced by the concrete H Blocks, the new British policy of ‘normalisation’ was wholly designed to strike any notion of political credence away from the IRA campaign.When he entered the H Blocks, Kieran Nugent was instructed to put a prison unorm on by the authorities. He answered, ‘you’ll have to nail it to my back.’ This began five years of protest inside the prison and heightened violence outside it which resulted in dozens of deaths.The blanket and no wash protests of the first four years of the prison conflict yielded no concessions on the issue of political status.The years of isolation and living in dire conditions eventually brought the situation to a head. The choice was plain and stark. The protesting republican prisoners could either concede and serve out jail sentences classed as ‘ordinary criminals’ or escalate the protest to the last ‘weapon’ available to them inside a prison-the hunger strike.It was not a new tactic for the republican movement, and it drew its inspiration from stories from the old Gaelic order.It’s recorded in the annals of Irish history that when a citizen felt slighted by the ruling order, it was not uncommon for them to lie outside their dwelling and refuse food in the hope of publicly shaming the guilty party into reparation and or an apology.In , Thomas Ashe died in Mountjoy prison in Dublin after being force fed whilst on hunger strike demanding political status. Then, in , the Lord Mayor of Cork Terence McSwiney died after  days whilst on hunger strike in Brixton jail. And, next year in  to mark the centenary of the death of McSwiney, the National Hunger Strike Commemoration will take place in Cork city.Back in , Michael Gaughan died in Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight after  days on hunger strike, and shortly before the beginning of the prison blanket and no wash protests in Long Kesh, in February , another Mayo man, Frank Stagg died at Wakefield jail in Yorkshire after  days without food.The first Long Kesh hunger strike began on October , . The protestors set out a list of five demands: -The right not to wear a prison unorm -The right not to do prison work -The right of free association with other prisoners -The right to organise their own educational and recreational facilities and -The right to one visit, one letter and one parcel a week.Seven men, including Sinn Fein MLA Raymond McCartney said they would fast to the death in the pursuit of the re-establishment of political status. Simultaneously, three female republican prisoners also embarked on a strike in Armagh jail.As Christmas  approached, the British offered a deal which appeared to agree to the central demand of the right not to wear a prison unorm. One of the hunger strikers, Sean McKenna was close to death at this stage and the strike was called off. It later emerged that was really being offered was a deal to allow prisoners to wear ‘civilian type clothing’ supplied by the prison regime. The scene was therefore already set for a second strike.It began on March ,  when Bobby Sands refused to eat. Raymond McCartney said: “Obviously everybody’s memory of  is the fact that ten people died on hunger strike.“On March ,  the British Government removed political status. I think most people thought that this was a half-hearted attempt and they’d roll over within a short period of time.“But, clearly what was emerging was a complete change in policy by the British Government who were intent on the idea of ‘normalisation’, ‘criminalisation’ and ‘Ulsterisation’.“Instinctively, any of us who found ourselves in prison at that time, knew we were political prisoners and any attempt to criminalise us just wasn’t going to work. It became a battle of wills.“But, I think by the end of the hunger strike in October, , most people looking on were saying that whatever was going on in the North that nobody in their wildest notion thought it was a criminal conspiracy. They certainly saw it as a political conflict. They may not have agreed with the armed actions of the IRA, but they certainly viewed it as a political situation.“So, for us by that stage, the process of criminalisation was in tatters. But, there was a very high price paid because  people had died in prison and  or  people had died on the streets.“Within the prisons we knew that we still had work to do because what we had to do was turn that acceptance of political imprisonment into every day conditions. By the end of the hunger strike I suppose there was a big recognition of the dference between the criminal’s unorm and our own clothes was one manestation of it. And, over the years we continued to ensure the conditions in Long Kesh reflected that.“By the late s and early s, journalists were frequent visitors to the prison and left with the overwhelming impression that we were a ‘dferent type’ of prisoner. They may have gone out and had questions about who you were and what you were about but they were in doubt that we were political prisoners. That was a big source of validation.”The intensity of the events and scale of death and destruction between  and  in retrospect now seems enormous, but Raymond McCartney maintains that it paved the way for future political developments.“It was only five years, but it was a very intense five years. It is only when you get a bit older you realise just how short a time span it was, because when you roll onto  and the Good Friday Agreement there was an acceptance of the framework that there was a political conflict which had to be resolved by political means-the recognition of political mandates, the political framework to address all these issues, but at the core of that was the acceptance of political prisoners.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“There is no doubt there is evidence that there were elements within the British Government were determined that political status should not be granted for whatever reason.“Even in , when there was internment without trial and up to , people were held in conditions where they wore their own clothes. There was a recognition of the political conflict of one nature or another.“How that was defined by dferent people is a dferent matter. I know that other people have made the observation that for too long the British tried to deal with the North as a security issue. therefore, when you have a security mentality or emergency laws, emergency courts, emergency interrogation centres, everything is changed and turned upside down.“If you follow their logic from that point of view and they say ‘you cannot now say you are political prisoners’ whilst trying to pretend that everything  about the situation isn’t political too then the penny drops in a whole lot of ways.”The almost  years since  have provoked much debate within wider nationalism about whether or not the hunger strike was harnessed as a catalyst for the republican movement to embark on the path to politics.The election of Bobby Sands to Westminster and Kieran Doherty to the Dail was followed quickly by a debate within Sinn Fein about ending their policy of abstentionism from political institutions that would lead to a split in the republican movement in . The Derry News asked Raymond McCartney for his view on this.He said: “It is interesting now, because everyone has their story about what the origins of the peace process was. But, there is absolutely no doubt that when you look back as far as  that Gerry Adams that there needed to be a political way of resolving the conflict, because military stalemate was exactly that.“The famous Glover Report from the British Army accepted that there was not going to be a military defeat, was them in their own way, saying the IRA was a political force and that the guys in Long Kesh were political prisoners. They job they were sent to do, they couldn’t do and that was to impose a military defeat and by extension their laws of oppression were not going to work either.“It made the situation painful and made the conflict last longer. Then, whenever the formula for the Good Friday Agreement was put forward, some former prisoners will tell you that it was too high a price to pay, but the core accepted it was a political problem and without political solutions it was never going to be resolved.”When the first hunger strike ended in October of , Raymond McCartney had gone without food for  days. So, what are his own personal recollections of the physical effects of what took place “I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.“In a very strange way hunger strike affects dferent people in dferent ways. Even the day the hunger strike ended in , I was still walking about, I was out of bed. But, there is no doubt that your body slows down.“My ability to see was greatly affected. But, the body is a remarkable piece of equipment and resilience is obviously built in. As you get older you reflect on it and it is dficult to work out in your head that you could sustain doing without food for  days and others for  days.“I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.

My ability to see was greatly affected.“As you get older you reflect on it and it is dficult to work out in your head that you could sustain doing without food for  days and others for  days.”Undoubtedly, it was Margaret Thatcher more than anyone  within the British establishment at the time who demonstrated complete determination to use the protests in Long Kesh to ide and break the republican movement.Many commentators have pointed to the INLA assassination of her colleague Airey Neave in  as one reason why the British Prime Minister embarked on a path of total intransigence towards the IRA. However, Raymond McCartney believes that her thinking was a lot wider than that.“Whatever her antipathy towards Ireland was and what came with that, she was setting out a broader political stall. Look at how she treated the miner’s later on.“Reading state papers now, years after these events, her take on the miner’s strike wasn’t just a battle about conditions in the mines, it was about strategically tackling trade unions. It was a case of her saying who is the strongest union-who is the spine of the working class and acting on that.“I always remember that being in jail gives you the time to reflect and read and think and I also always remember that Bobby Sands out of all the people who had been in jail was very clear about what he was there for because he wrote it all down. Some of the things he wrote captures the way a writer works-it’s all encompassing and puts it out there in a very vivid way.“I had previously been interned, I had an understanding about what being a political prisoner was. You had your own clothes and a bit of freedom to associate with other prisoners and you didn’t feel that sense of captivity although you were locked up. Bobby Sands caught on very early that the British were trying to defeat us in the prisons. It wasn’t just about trying to give you a hard time or denying you your own clothes, it was that they had a core idea to break us.“One of the rewarding things for me personally was that the system we had in the end in jail was one based on equality. That we treated people as equals. If you couldn’t treat the person beside you as a comrade and an equal that you couldn’t expect anyone  to believe that you’d treat all people as equals as you went on through le.”Those wishing to attend the th National Hunger Strike Commemoration are asked to assemble on Sunday, August  at .pm at the Diamond in Lford before marching across the border into Strabane where Martina Anderson MEP will deliver this year’s main oration.CAPTION: Raymond McCartney spent  days on hunger strike in ."},{"url":null,"title":"studio2 summer dance","story":"Greater Shantallow Community Arts are seeking participants for their annual Summer Dance Camp.If you are between --years-old this is a fantastic opportunity to take part in an two-week long exciting event.

No details were provided on how existing vegetation will be retained and no bioersity checklist was provided.”The residents also employed planning consultant Lee Kennedy, who told the Council of his concerns that some demolition work to existing buildings on the proposed development site had already taken place, prior to planning approval and that trees had been felled along the rear boundary of the site close to the homes of the objectors.A spokesperson for the Waterfoot residents said: “Mr Kennedy went onto state that residents have expressed genuine fears about a threat to the remaining vegetation on the application site.“He reminded Council that they hold a duty of care to work in the public interest and offer protection to the remaining mature trees, by the serving of a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderunder the  Planning Act.”Mr Kennedy confirmed to the Derry News that he had submitted a request for a TPO from the Council, but “no action had been taken.”However, the Waterfoot Park residents say their fears were heightened again earlier this month when a team of workers appeared on the proposed development site and began to cut down more trees.A spokesperson for the residents told the Derry News: “On Friday, July  at .am the neighbours were woken with the sound of several power saws and saw a full team of tree cutters on site behind them.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Within an hour they had created absolute mayhem on the site, with trees felled all around and they were left when they fell. The ground and houses nearby vibrated and caused house alarms to go off.“Some neighbours felt very intimidated, shocked and panicked with the suddenness, noise level and by the time of the morning it happened. The residents are up in arms. It should never have been allowed to happen as Council was made aware last year about their responsibility of a duty of care to work in the public interest. The residents feel unsupported to date in their endeavours to the Council.”Addressing the residents’ concerns, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said that: “During the processing of the application,  objections have been received to the proposed development.“Correspondence to the Planning Department from Planning Consultant, Mr Lee Kennedy acting on behalf of the objectors, was received on August ,  and raised concerns regarding the trees on the site, and a request for a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderto be served on the site.“These concerns were raised with the Planning Department’s Tree Preservation Officer on September ,  who advised on September , that in his professional opinion, a TPO was not appropriate for this site given the nature, type and scale of trees.”On April  this year, Planning Department officials met with objectors at the city’s Council offices, where again, the Tree Preservation Officer advised that a TPO was considered but was unnecessary when assessed against the criteria required for a TPO.The Council spokesperson continued: “The site was further inspected by planning officers on June ,  and officers met with objectors on site.“More recently, the case officer wrote to the agent and the applicant on June ,  to advise that further information was required. Amongst other things requested, the case officer advised that a tree survey of the site was required, a landscaping plan to show existing trees and vegetation to be retained and additional planting to be shown and a bioersity checklist was to be submitted to advise on any existing ecology on the site.“The agent confirmed in correspondence dated, July  that a Phase  habitat survey was instructed to be carried out as well as a tree survey and would be submitted in due course.”However, the Council spokesperson added: “The Planning Department were made aware by an objector by email on July ,  that eight trees along the boundary of the site adjacent to properties in Waterfoot Park had been felled on July  at .am.“Council takes its obligations in respect of these matters seriously and has undertaken an appropriate course of action to ensure that the opinions of residents are and will be fully considered in the processing of the planning application.”CAPTION: Residents of Waterfoot Park have accused the Council of failing to provide a duty of care in relation to a proposed building development."},{"url":null,"title":"prime minister s powys visit","story":"Prime minister Boris Johnson visitedBVG Retail Group in Brecon last Tuesday ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtth July ..Picturltspan classtruncate-full-screengted is Boris Johnson talking to County Times Chief Reporter Rory Sheehan..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Prime Minister’s Powys visitPrime minister Boris Johnson visitedBVG Retail Group in Brecon last Tuesday ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtth July ..Picturltspan classtruncate-full-screengted is Boris Johnson and Chris Davies talking to County Times Chief Reporter Rory Sheehan..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Prime Minister’s Powys visitPrime minister Boris Johnson visitedBVG Retail Group in Brecon last Tuesday ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtth July ..Picturltspan classtruncate-full-screengted is Boris Johnson, Iain Burgessand Chris Davies..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Prime Minister’s Powys visitPrime minister Boris Johnson visitedBVG Retail Group in Brecon last Tuesday ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtth July ..Picturltspan classtruncate-full-screengte by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Prime Minister’s Powys visitPrime minister Boris Johnson visitedBVG Retail Group in Brecon last Tuesday ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtth July ..Picturltspan classtruncate-full-screengted is Boris Johnson meeting members of staff..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"machynlleth carnival 2019 event celebrates","story":"Moon landers : Olivia Garrod , Harry Smithand Izzy Owen ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt drop in on Machynllltspan classtruncate-full-screengteth Carnival.

If we all do a little bit, wersquoll ensure the service is maintained for today, tomorrow and future generations.Earlier this year, local politicians agreed to take the lead in securing financial support for the air ambulance service and also make a monetary contribution to help meet the servicersquos poundm annual running costs.The Department of Health allocates around poundm in annual funding to help keep the helicopter service in the air with money used to finance the air ambulance crew, medicines and medical equipment. Charity funds, including public donations, sustains the aviation side of the operation.It was announced recently that as part of the ongoing consultation on reshaping stroke services, the Department has made a commitment to extend the partnership with Air Ambulance Northern Irelandto enable the helicopter emergency medical service to provide a secondary response to incidents, including strokes, by .Health officials have also confirmed that any changes to the existing arrangement would be subject to the completion of an appropriate business case and agreement with the air ambulance with regard to any funding implications..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charity Beer and Bubbles 5k run in Finnebrogue  ","story":"M B McGRADY  Co Chartered Accountants is setting the pace this September with the launch of the Beer and Bubbles k run in a bid to raise money for Air Ambulance NI.Open to competitors of all ages and experiences, the race will take place on Thursday, September , at Finnebrogue Woods, nestled on the outskirts of Downpatrick.This is the first k race to take place at the idyllic venue, with the route mapped out so runners take in the stunning woodland and finish close to the lakeside, where they will be able to soak up the atmosphere while enjoying a glass of local beer or prosecco.The event follows on from last yearrsquos successful M B Grady  Co Ultimate Aqua Challenge,.Conaill McGrady, director of M B McGrady  Co, said: ldquoWe are delighted to be supporting Air Ambulance NI for a second year and helping to contribute to maintaining the vital work that they do.

They opened the scoring through Gareth George and he added a free to give the visitors an early cushion.Indeed, Bright had plenty more chances to add to this score, but were wasteful in their shot selection. The Holywood men finally woke up and a tidy score from Connor McAnespie after  minutes opened their account.Bright again replied with a fine score from Marc Burke before Martin Cox opened his account for Holywood with a point after  minutes. Barry Kilkey levelled the contest three minutes later from close range and Freddie OrsquoConnor scored for Bright to edge them ahead again.Foolish tackling and unnecessary frees were costing St Paulrsquos in the game and helped Bright dominate the play In the first half.The gamersquos opening goal, however, swung the play towards the Holywood men again. Fantastic work from Seaacuten Tucker around the middle of the park and his long ball into the danger area found Marty Cox in space.Cox caught the ball in mid-air, landed and turned in one motion before smashing the ball past Michael Ferrand, who had no chance. The sizable crowd roared with delight and momentum was now with St Paulrsquos as Tucker added another score from play.Once again, however, ill discipline and poor tackling would cost St Paulrsquos. Paddy Falls high tackle left George with a handy free to cut the deficit before Tucker added a free from m out on the left.George added the final score of the half for Bright leaving St Paulrsquos two points clear at the half-time whistle - to -.Bright again took the early initiative at the start of the second half and a point by Rian Tempany set the early tone. A big talking point came at six minutes into the second half when referee John McMullan sent off two players, one from each team after an altercation at a break downThe next few scores were to and fro with Tucker scoring three points and George replying in kind, aided by Tempany. The game was tied at - to - drawing at  when St Paulrsquosadded their second goal in the th minute.Fine work from Daniel Eastwood and Cox set up Tucker who danced around two Bright defenders before slotting the ball home from  metres. The home crowd were again in raptures, expecting St Paulrsquos to see the game out.However, game management has been a big problem this season for the Holywood men, given the average age of the team is  it is perhaps understandable that experience to see games out is just not there yet.St Paulrsquos tried to slow the game down, but with about  minutes still to be played, it was far too early for that. Bright caught St Paulrsquos in possession on numerous occasionsand turned the ball over for score after score.George was a constant threat and punished each mistake by the Holywood men with a score.

He did, however, admit that the itinerary has been sent to Rome.Venues for the Popersquos visit are pure speculation and certainly newspapers are free to speculate, he added.It is understood that Downpatrick was one of the three venues north of the border suggested by the committee of  bishops, headed by Cardinal OrsquoFiaich, when they met last week.The decision on whether the Pope will include Northern Ireland in his tour will be taken in Rome, but it is believed that alternative venues in the Republic have been suggestedthe Pope decides not to cross the border.The choice of Downpatrick mdash with its strong historical links with Christianity and St Patrick mdash is understood to have been a move to give the Pope the opportunity to see as many people as possible.It is also thought that Armagh mdash the ecclesiastical headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland mdash and Londonderry were studied as possible venues for a visit.Until the programme is finalised, the only places certain to be included in the itinerary are Dublin and the Marian Shrine at Knock, County Mayo.Dr Joseph Maguire, Parish Priest of Downpatrick, said that he personally had not been contacted about any visit from Pope John Paul II, but he admitted that Downpatrick would have been one of the first places to think of.ldquoWe would be delighted to be so honoured with a visit from the Holy Father and he would be most welcome he said.KILLYLEAGH mdash A one-day token strike by production workers closed the Killyleagh Mill yesterday.Around  workers walked out, seeking a wages increase.

Two special zones will be developed for car parking on either side of the beach and a park for upwards of  cars will be provided in the centre, off the beach area.Under no circumstances, however, will cars be allowed to drive up and down the beach area and the council is expected to appoint full-time beach inspectors to supervise parking during the summer season.The private entrances presently used by beach-goers will be blocked off and two new public driveways will be constructed.

The good weather encouraged a large attendance for both the contest and the traditional parade through the narrow streets as bands and drum majors were able to show off their trophies to the enthusiastic crowds. The only Grade  band attending was the PSNI and they saw off a challenge from Closkelt. Indeed it was not Closkelt’s day as they lost out to Raa in Grade , who also took the drumming prize. There were new winners in Grade A as the Quinn Memorial lted top spot from Thiepval Memorial and Clogher  District. McNeillstown managed a fourth place in this grade to which they are almost certain to be promoted to next year on the back of a succession of victories in Grade B to which they added to on the day. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Tullylagan continued their good form taking second place and winning the drumming. Augharan from Co Tyrone continue to dominate in A although Cloughfin who have been steadily improving with a youthful band were placed second and had two firsts for piping. Finally in Grade B the William Kerr Memorial took top spot from Mountjoy with Syerla winning the drum corps prize. Competition within the drum majors remained keen in all sections as it has all season. Lauren Hanna, after a second place at the Scottish Championships last week, took top spot in Portrush with former world champion Jason Price the runner up. Jamie Cupples lted his third local title of the year in the Juvenile section while Junior section winner Leanne Crooks managed to put at least a temporary halt to Louis Anderson and Benjamin Walker’s domination of the section. There is certainly no stopping Carys Graham in the Novice Section as she secured her fth local title in a row.RESULTSGrade : st PSNI [also Best Pipes, Drums, Bass Section and MD], nd Closkelt, rd Colmcille.Grade : st Raa [also Best Pipes [joint], Drums  MD], nd Closkelt [also Best Pipes [joint] and Bass Section], rd Colmcille, th Matt Boyd Memorial.

And Irsquove also been talking about sport ndash this time football and ensuring young people can get involved in teams, but also have opportunities to progress within their chosen sport as well.In Westminster Irsquove been talking about serious violence and ensuring we get police on our streets to deal with kne crime and other violence, which sadly wersquove seen on the rise in some parts of the UK.Irsquove also been talking about the steel industry.

My own view on moving forward is that a final say Peoplersquos Vote on any Brexit deal is the best option.It was a really positive event, and thank you to all constituents who attended. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

My own view on moving forward is that a final say Peoplersquos Vote on any Brexit deal is the best option.It was a really positive event, and thank you to all constituents who attended. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners.

He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people.

Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking.

Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

The pension applies to both Vale and Cardf council workers.Friends of the Earth Cymru congratulated the council.Spokeswoman Bleddyn Lake said: ldquoAfter years of lobbying by Friends of the Earth, itrsquos fantastic to see Cardf councillors taking the historic decision to stop supporting the fossil fuel companies that are fuelling the climate crisis.ldquoNow itrsquos time for all the local authority pension funds in Wales to follow Cardfrsquos lead.ldquoToo many have been hiding away from taking meaningful action, but a climate emergency means we cannot afford to be investing money in the very companies driving climate change.ldquoResearch has shown esting from fossil fuel companies is better financially and will minimise future financial risks for those with pensions in these funds.ldquoClimate change is the challenge of our age. We canrsquot afford to push action further down the road all the time or expect others to be the ones to sort out this mess.ldquoWe want to see the Wales Pension Partnership, the Welsh Assembly, the Welsh Government and all other public body pension funds ditch fossil fuel investments and we will be keeping the pressure up until they do the right thing, both for the planet and for future generations here in Wales and around the world.Previous research by Friends of the Earth found that the eight local authority pension funds in Wales invested over poundbn between them in fossil fuel companies.Last year Monmouthshire Council was the first in Wales to vote to est its pension fund from fossil fuel companies. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
