Tom Jenkins has been taking an enforced break from action photography and pursuing a different kind of vision in his gardenI have never appreciated my back garden so much.At this time of year, I’m usually caught up with all the to-ings and fro-ings of the sporting world: taking photos of traditional spring events like the Boat Race and Grand National, or key matches as the football season builds to a crescendo. Normally I’m away a lot, not really passing an eye over developments in my garden. But this is not a normal year.It was mid-March, and I was sitting despondently in my tiny postage stamp of a garden. The previous week I had photographed the Cheltenham festival, an event I associate with the end of winter, spring coming, the light getting better. A chance to look ahead to a summer of sport, going to events that I love. But this year, the festival had felt all wrong – more like a dangerous party on the eve of war. It seemed all around me the news was harrowing, and sport was getting hammered as event after event was cancelled. My world had suddenly been turned upside-down.I realised then that I had to reframe and refocus. With all my normal avenues for taking pictures closed off, I needed to find something else. I recalled the words of Ed Jackson, a former professional rugby player whose portrait I had taken exactly a year earlier. After suffering an awful accident that had left him partially paralysed, he had developed a mental process to cope with his new situation: focus on what’s in front of you, focus on things you can affect, and try to forget what’s out of your control.Remembering this, I looked round the edge of the tiny piece of lawn and noticed some tulip bulbs that my wife had planted in terracotta pots. Lush green leaves with buds full of promise had emerged from the soil, ready to bloom. In these plants, I saw hope. I saw normality.It occurred to me then that this process of growth and positivity deserved to be documented. Despite the global madness, nature was thriving – and these tulips seemed to be begging me to tell their story. To me, photography is more than just a career: it is my passion, and in these flowers I found the perfect opportunity to take pictures without leaving my home.To test myself, I decided not to use any of my main professional cameras. These are more used to the hurly-burly of sport, all fast focusing and speedy motor-drive. Instead, I turned to what I call my “holiday camera”, an upmarket point-and-shoot that I take away on trips with the family (the last thing I want on holiday is to be surrounded by items associated with work, many of which are heavy). Light, easy to manoeuvre around the plants, and – most crucially – able to focus close-up, this small camera actually turned out to be perfect for this project.As the sun moved round the garden during the day, backgrounds became dark and shadows on the flowers created gorgeous patterns. I would note which times were best to photograph certain plants, and would periodically drop whichever household task I was doing (much to the irritation of my family) to race to the garden and catch the flowers in the perfect light.Like all photographers, I look to light as another tool in the box, an opportunity to create something different. By varying angles, I could make petals look like paper, tightly bunched flower heads look like lips. Going in tight, I attempted to show the beauty of the flowers in a surreal way. The warm spring sunshine of the last few weeks had not only ushered the tulips into full bloom but enhanced their colour and vibrancy, so some of my photographs gained an almost unearthly quality.I’ve never felt so lucky to have my garden, this tiny oasis in densely crowded north London. In the land of quarantine, my house has never felt more like a castle, defending me from the warzone outside the front gate. In that castle, my garden is the green inner sanctum, a place of peace and tranquillity.As I sit here now, in the sunshine, I hear birdsong and the rustling of leaves, with the chirruping of children playing wafting in on the breeze. The sky above my head is free from planes and pollution and a brilliant blue. The sun, bright and sharp at this time of year, makes everything look crisp. In times like these, we remember that nature truly is life-affirming, and the simple act of flowers growing means so much. It shows that in an abnormal world, normality is king."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/953d48320dd40a92866ef0c96112f44567140c65/0_190_3622_2173/master/3622.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8c0405609ad1c5d47d05ec126146a0a","title":"coronavirus uk banks put aside 5bn pounds cover losses first quarter","story":"Major lenders to reveal how pandemic and lockdowns have hit their balance sheetsBritain’s largest banks could have to put aside nearly £5bn to help cover potential loan losses in the first quarter, amid fears that the economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 outbreak will make it harder for borrowers to repay their debts.This week HSBC, Lloyds, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered will reveal how the pandemic and resulting lockdowns hurt their balance sheets during the first three months of the year.HSBC is expected to report the largest provision among its peers when it releases first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, with consensus estimates pointing to a $1.8bn (£1.4bn) charge.That is nearly three times the $600m that HSBC said it may have to put aside in February, when the disease was still largely contained in Asia and hitting the bank’s largest market in Hong Kong. Analysts are now expecting HSBC’s first-quarter profits to more than halve, from $6.2bn to $2.9bn.The London-headquartered lender Standard Chartered is expected to take a smaller hit as its customer base is primarily based in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Consensus estimates suggest it will put aside $622m (£502m) in the first quarter, having already warned that it would miss financial targets for 2020. Pre-tax profits are forecast to fall by a third, to $796m.Domestic banks in the UK have been scrambling to grant mortgage and credit card repayment holidays to retail customers and dole out government-backed loans for small businesses hit by the outbreak. While the measures will provide temporary relief, there are questions over whether borrowers will be able to afford repayments once the holidays expire.While some analysts expect the bulk of UK bank provisions will be put aside for business loans, Barclays may end up having to put more aside for its credit card ision, which is exposed to both the UK and US markets. Barclays is one of the top-10 credit card issuers in the US, where more than 26 million workers have lost their job in the last month.Jason Napier, a banks analyst at UBS, said investors were still shooting in the dark as they try to predict the full fallout of the Covid-19 crisis. “Though Covid-19 infection curves seem to have peaked in a number of countries, investors have no hard data to gauge the damage this shock will do to the banks,” he said.New accounting models being phased in across UK banks mean they are likely to take more of their charges upfront, but not to the same extent as US banks, which operate on a different standard. “There’s potential for very significant charges to be taken in a short space of time,” Napier warned.This month JP Morgan set aside $8.3bn (£6.6bn) to cover potential loan losses, saying it expected a “fairly severe recession” due to the outbreak. That was followed by a £1bn charge by Goldman Sachs, which nearly halved its first-quarter profits.However, Napier said UK banks were much better placed to weather a downturn than they were at the start of the 2008 financial crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba511d651cfce37da0ef40141dc6d2a445467c98/0_15_4928_2959/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1011daf851464053d4649a45792193a0","title":"coronavirus close borders pandemic","story":"Clampdowns on refugees and the rhetoric of ‘We look after our own’ are no substitute for protection from the pandemicFor almost six years now, a network of volunteers in Europe and Africa have been providing a service that some of the world’s wealthiest countries have chosen not to. When migrants get into distress in the Mediterranean, they can call Alarm Phone’s emergency number the call is relayed by a team of people spread across France, Tunisia, Italy, Germany, the UK, Morocco and elsewhere to the coastguard service nearest the boat.On the night of 10 April, Alarm Phone received a call from one of 63 people on board a rubber boat drifting between Libya, Italy and Malta that was slowly filling up with water. According to Alarm Phone, the EU was aware of the boat but Malta, the country that should have been responsible for rescuing it, held off until the migrants could be returned to Libya, where torture and other forms of mistreatment are well documented. The boat drifted for five days, during which time five people died of thirst, according to survivors, and another seven people went missing, presumed drowned.Malta’s prime minister, Robert Abela, is now under police investigation for the incident but remains defiant: “My conscience is clear because we have done everything in our power to protect our people and all those who live in this country,” he said, explaining that Malta’s ports were closed during the coronavirus pandemic. “In a health emergency, this country is not a safe port for migrants.”To many people, this logic – we must look after our own – will seem unassailable, despite the costs. Malta is not the only country to shut off help to vulnerable migrants during the pandemic: Italy has also closed its ports, while the UK declines to evacuate refugee children with relatives in Britain from unsanitary Greek camps, and the US has quietly suspended its entire asylum system. Earlier this month, nearly 400 Rohingya refugees were found starving on a boat near Malaysia, which had reportedly cited the pandemic as a reason not to take them in.Temporary limits on movement – within countries and cities, as well as internationally – are regarded by most public health experts as an essential part of the fight against the coronavirus. But the overriding message from leading scientists has been that this needs to be based on a system of testing and contact tracing that tracks the spread of the virus, rather than blanket assumptions about foreigners and other outsiders. If clampdowns on national borders are offered as a substitute for more meaningful forms of protection then everybody loses.In recent years, as rightwing populism has become a defining political force in many parts of the world, the demand for tougher border control has come to stand in for a range of wider anxieties about identity, culture and economic security. The political theorist Wendy Brown links this to decades of neoliberal policies that have allowed finance-driven global capitalism to undermine wages, infrastructure and social security in wealthy countries her book Walled States, Waning Sovereignty suggests that the politically potent image of the border wall has come to stand in for security that the state no longer provides.Nowhere does this seem more apt today than the US. Universal healthcare and comprehensive unemployment support is anathema to much of the political elite what they have instead is a president who grandstands about flight bans and protecting Americans from being “replaced” in their jobs by immigrants even as he actively undermines domestic social distancing policies and efforts to source vital medical equipment. But the impulse is present in Europe too: as the coronavirus arrived on the continent the first response of many rightwing populists was to attack refugee policy and the EU’s internal free movement rules. Some of these voices have, for the moment, been dimmed as many citizens prioritise the advice of scientific experts in a time of medical emergency.If the border is a dominant symbol of national welfare, it is not the only one. In the UK, while a vocal minority on the right continues to play on this theme in order to attack domestic lockdown measures, it has been eclipsed by the call to rally around the NHS. There is no more powerful symbol of collective good in the British political lexicon not even politicians who oppose the principle of socialised medicine dare say so openly. It sits at the heart of the government’s call to action: stay home, protect the NHS, save lives.The solidarity expressed by millions of people at a moment of crisis is an amazing thing. As in other afflicted countries, the vast majority of the UK’s population have made huge, largely voluntary changes to their lives for collective benefit. But our desire for security can nonetheless be pushed in an exclusionary direction. “It’s the national health service, not the international health service,” wrote the health secretary Matt Hancock during last year’s general election campaign, promising to extend the health surcharge to non-resident EU citizens after Brexit.Over the past decade, as the strength of the NHS has been depleted by austerity economics, along with other public services, the right has pushed the claim that foreigners are an unacceptable drain on the state, accompanied by a host of bureaucratic measures – charges, restrictions, surveillance, punishment – to police their activities even as the rest of society benefits from their labour. It is no small irony that as Britain expresses a newfound gratitude to the immigrants that help keep the NHS and other key services running, the Home Office is fighting to maintain many of its notorious hostile environment policies.Once the pandemic subsides, and we are left to deal with the social and economic upheaval in its wake, nationalist demands for wealthy countries to turn inwards are likely to intensify. These may well start with demands to exclude outsiders but they are likely to turn on “undeserving” citizens too. Events in the Mediterranean may seem distant from many everyday concerns right now, but the way our governments treat people in need is the defining question of our time. If you want to see what happens when death and suffering are swept under the carpet and rendered acceptable by political euphemism and omission, then the frontiers of the rich world are a useful place to start. This is a planetary crisis, not a national one, and it is vital that we do not allow our respect for human life to end at the border.• Daniel Trilling is the author of Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the Borders of Europe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/830fad89a0ce080d24a1891f286fab69ecaa8efd/0_4_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14ac08a89db72a64b6133dcf27522eb1","title":"every day ambitious new lockdown project","story":"From teaching the children about the joys of knitting to exploring the intricacies of financial policy, the greatest plans just seem to slip awayI had big plans for the day.

I was going to have an hour’s session entitled Beach Boys Appreciation, in which everyone would listen to the Beach Boys and appreciate them. And I was only going to drink beer after all those things were done.I do not have high hopes or unrealistic expectations I am not asking anyone to lose a stone or learn a new language.

It was a difficult and impossibly moving conversation, made all the more affecting by the fact that the previous night he had forwarded me photographs and videos of her that went back nearly 30 years.On Easter Saturday, she died, aged 86, in the care home where she had lived since late last year. For 20 years she had suffered from an increasingly debilitating immune condition – but after she moved in, her health had taken a noticeable upswing. Then, for the three weeks prior to her death, lockdown meant that she could not see any visitors and remained confined to her room. Despite these precautions, her family were then told that a case of Covid-19 had possibly “impacted” the care home. Not much more than a week later, Sheila’s apparent infection with Covid-19 was confirmed by a “virtual” diagnosis from the home’s GP she spent her dying moments deprived of the love and attention of her closest relatives. As her son understood it, what her story seemed to come down to was the lack of both testing for care workers and personal protective equipment. “Covid walked into her room,” he told me. “Because she couldn’t, and didn’t, walk out of it.”What he told me highlighted something that has now become a central part of the UK’s experience of the virus, and a growing sense of collective shame: the neglect of the 400,000 older people who live in British care homes and the people who devote themselves to their wellbeing, something made even clearer by the fact that the level of deaths in these settings – estimated to be at least 7,500 – seems to have been woefully underrepresented in official statistics. Along with the fact that the pored-over daily figure for Covid-19 deaths omits care homes, this compounds a sense that such fatalities do not quite count.This aspect of the UK’s Covid-19 story blurs into things that long predate this crisis. Some of them highlight the fact that care for older people is still based around an archipelago of homes and so-called “providers”, and the continuing absence of any solution to the issues collectively grouped under the heading of social care. But there is something else at the heart of how badly many older people have been treated – and, indeed, the discomfiting sense that some see the deaths from Covid-19 of people over 70 and those with “underlying health conditions” as the natural order of things. Perhaps the latter is part of our collective coping mechanism. But it also highlights a set of prejudices about older people that have sat in the culture for far too long.Up until a month ago, residential settings for older people rarely figured in the national conversation, and too few of us thought about the vital work so many dedicated people do in them. By way of grim symbolism, the archetypal care home existed in our shared imagination as somewhere distant from everyday life, and somehow still and silent. People in power seemed content for such places to remain a byword for low-paid work. Earlier this month, the TV journalist Robert Peston called people who live in some care homes “inmates”, which is quite a Freudian slip.Not much more than a month ago, a charity called the Centre for Ageing Better published a report called Doddery But Dear?, full of grimly familiar cultural observations. “Metaphors such as ‘grey tsunami’, ‘demographic cliff’ and ‘demographic timebomb’ present old age in terms of crisis,” it said, “reflecting a perception of old age and the ‘baby boomer’ generation as a societal burden.” Two years ago, research published by the Royal Society for Public Health found that a quarter of people aged 18-34 believed it was normal for older people to be unhappy and depressed – and across all age groups, nearly a third of people surveyed agreed with the statement “being lonely is just something that happens when people get old”. Strikingly, two-thirds of the respondents said they had no friends with an age gap of 30 years or more.There are plenty of other manifestations of these generational estrangements and the prejudices they incubate. Whatever the substance of the debate about assisted dying, its most unthinking supporters sometimes risk reducing frailty to a pretext for euthanasia, as if the future will make care for people approaching the end of their lives unthinkable. And what of Brexit? Far too many people have fallen into the habit of using the generational split in views about the EU as an excuse for thinking of older people as impossibly reactionary and therefore worthy of sneering contempt. To make things even worse, the insecure realities of 21st-century life for younger people have fostered the idea that if older people have been lucky enough to buy their home and receive a half-decent pension, that somehow characterises them as the recipients of unjust luxury. These things have fed into a dysfunctional mess of stuff that resonates with where we have ended up: the key issue right now may be the rank incompetence of people in government, but our attitudes to older people are relevant, at least.We should worry about age-based isions getting worse. It seems that sooner or later, as the terms of the current lockdown are changed, millions of people will be encouraged to tentatively go back into the world. But there is also talk of those aged over 70 – millions of whom are fit, active and as involved in their communities as anyone else – being instructed to carry on living under lockdown. The result will be the strange spectacle of a society seemingly devoid of older people, with their friends and relatives still instructed to keep them at a distance: the reverse, in fact, of what an age-segregated society like ours demands.That is yet another example of the cruelties of this virus, and how much it cuts across some of the most basic aspects of our common humanity. As an increasing number of people are pointing out, the coronavirus period will soon demand some kind of reparations to the young people whose lives have been so upturned by lockdown and its economic and social consequences. But contrary to the eitheror nature of too many modern arguments, that should not preclude an equal focus on our neglect and stereotyping of older people, and the extent to which those things are also part of this unfolding disaster.Before we get to thorny questions of policy, the first thing we need is a shift in attitudes, something we can learn from others. Five days ago, for example, I spoke to Javed Iqbal, a community worker who lives in Alum Rock, in the east of Birmingham – an area badly affected by the virus. As he talked about a huge community effort emanating from local mosques, he explained that he had lost 11 older relatives to Covid-19, a loss not just to him and his family, but wider society. “These are the pillars of our community: our elders,” he said. The words stuck in my mind for days afterwards – a stark reminder of what the secularised, ided part of the UK’s demographic map lacks, and which we urgently need to recover, as these horrific times push us even further apart."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94c4b78af6460783fe1158139ab62dc95565d84e/0_0_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c81b653f5f11e760cd91fad6c5917d7","title":"the guardian view on dominic cummings is he able to give sage advice","story":" With the prime minister’s chief adviser attending the scientific advisory panel during this crisis, it is right to ask whether ministers are guided only by the science they want to hear The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies is a body of experts convened to counsel ministers on how to handle specific crises. When dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, the government likes to say it is “guided by the science”, but what is that advice and who gives it? Sage’s meetings are closed affairs, its recommendations private and its minutes, if they are ever published, turn up weeks late. Until last Friday, the group’s members were unknown. When the  revealed who was attending Sage, a possible reason for the secrecy emerged.It was the presence of Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s chief adviser, at the meetings rather than the scientists that made the headlines. This might explain how Britain stumbled into the crisis. Sage was meant to offer a clearer separation between scientific truths and political values. It has allowed ministers to claim that they are being guided by objective reasons rather than ideology. But having a political adviser of Mr Cummings’ importance, and a data analyst who worked with him on the leave campaign, at Sage pierces that argument.It also makes it harder to claim there was not a political cost to ministerial judgment calls based on evidence tainted by ideological influence. Sage recommended less stringent social distancing measures when other European capitals implemented tough policies. Its experts underestimated the percentage of people who would have to be hospitalised. The conventional response of lockdown, mass testing and tracing was snubbed initially in favour of “herd immunity”. This was a costly mistake – making it harder to source chemicals, and personal protective equipment. What was Mr Cummings’ role in discussions about these decisions? The public ought to know.Mr Cummings, with his admiration of computer modelling to “war game epidemics”, is unlikely to be interested in the tried-and-tested preventative measures advocated by the World Health Organization as early as January. In its bulletins the WHO advocated the “test, trace and isolate” regime that Britain only woke up to after allowing the virus to spread unimpeded through the population. Sage’s lack of any public health experts would seem a mistake in the light of the government’s current strategy.Mr Cummings’ presence will distort a discussion about differences, which are meant to be narrowed through debate. The ability to speak up without the perceived fear of sanction is necessary for a healthy exchange of views. He is known for being disagreeable about disagreement. Scientists on Sage would not dissent perhaps in the way that you might expect them to. It is plausible that Mr Cummings may single out a troublesome academic who questioned whether it was right, for example, for Boris Johnson to announce he had shaken the hands of people infected with coronavirus. (It wasn’t.)Falling out of favour might cost scientists not just a gong but also lucrative government funding streams. Mr Cummings increases the chances that dissident views on Sage remain just that. What is to stop him usurping the role of the chief scientific adviser who is meant to be the source of advice to Mr Johnson but doesn’t share a personal chemistry with him?There is no reason why the membership of Sage should be kept secret. Declarations of interest ought to be published. Minutes of meetings should be made available promptly. Who can be relied upon for giving advice in a time of crisis is a matter of national importance. It is obvious that it is best to involve those who are expert in the area. Mr Cummings is not one of them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78db43380ce80eccbe79aa9853f9e42c1a6867bb/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78ccacfa9aedc4c9d8e13205eb5d6e23","title":"virtual parliament commons lockdown remote working diverse mps","story":"Remote working would open up politics to a more erse cohort of MPs, who could be more embedded in their communitiesÉmile Durkheim argued that traditions, along with other social institutions, exist because they do some kind of job for society as a whole. Accordingly, in parliament, the dress codes for MPs, the ermine, the gilded this and that, the bobbing and the bowing, are all said to encourage both lawmakers and citizens to take what happens in Westminster seriously.If you watch a standard prime minister’s questions, which for centuries has been dominated by a baying mob of former public school boys, you might get the feeling that traditions aren’t always collectively beneficial. But our new and decidedly untraditional “Zoom parliament” has transformed the Commons. While MPs are still required to wear appropriate clothing and some politicians have decorated their webcam backdrops with their own fancy accessories, remote working has largely stripped parliament of its customs and costumes. We have been confronted with the bare bones of our representative system, and the result has been overwhelmingly positive.Wednesday’s PMQs was like never before. No facile insults were screamed. There was no sonic wall of jeering. There were only a handful of MPs in the chamber, and those joining online were muted by the clerks until it was their turn to ask a question. Consequently, with the exception of some quiet “Hear hears”, almost no one spoke until they were invited to by the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle. This week our semi-digital Commons looked, for the first time in a long while, like the epicentre of a grownup democracy, sensible and pleasingly boring.As for the rest of parliamentary business: select committees, ministerial statements, debates and questions from MPs are now all taking place online. Votes have been postponed for the moment, and plans for a digital system are being developed, so that the whips won’t have to force hundreds of MPs and peers, some of them potentially infectious with Covid-19, into the lobbies.Parliament’s old guard aren’t wrong to worry that a working-from-home parliament will lack some creative spontaneity as MPs are unable to take ministers to task with off-the-cuff questions. But look at these reforms from the perspective of people for whom evenings and days spent away from home are unrealistic. The ability to work remotely may open up a career in politics to a more erse cohort of MPs. We’ll need more reform than this – allowing MPs to take parental leave is particularly key – but more remote working is a start.We want MPs to be able to see their families, sending a signal that a better worklife balance is key to a happier society. And we want MPs to spend time in their communities, because we need them to represent the interests of people who have too often been ignored by politics. In that case, the benefits of making parliament accessible surely outweigh the costs.These changes have civilised the Commons and have the potential to make British politics more democratic and representative. But if all this is not to be swept away when lockdown eventually ends, then modernising MPs and Hoyle must make many aspects of the “Zoom parliament” permanent. We’ll be waiting a long time for some reforms, like an elected second chamber and a more egalitarian party system that suppresses Westminster’s bullying culture. But there’s plenty to do in the meantime.Durkheim was wrong. Traditions exist not because they benefit society, but because they benefit those who hold power.

The performer Dynamo says we need it now more than everMidnight in Tokyo. I’m standing in a narrow alleyway behind one of the hostess clubs in the capital’s red-light district. A large screen displays live updates of the gender balance inside, currently: ladies 113, men 87. Just around the corner is a famous hangout of the yakuza gangs, where a few months earlier there was a bloody shootout and a Korean crime boss was killed.Dynamo, one of the world’s most successful magicians, is used to performing in edgy atmospheres: he’s done street magic for gang members in LA’s Compton, and illicit tricks in Saudi Arabia where magic and the supernatural are banned and punishable by 40 lashes. But Tokyo is the one he’s always dreamed of, especially after he saw Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift in his 20s – a film that includes the immortal line: “The first drifters invented drifting out here in the mountains by feeling it. So feel it!”We’re not really in any danger. These days the area is frequented by tourists searching for a sanitised version of seedy and, besides, we’re with a crowd of people 15 deep. But magic has always thrived on the impression of peril. The most popular early illusions involved sawing women in half or being shackled while submerged in water. More recently magicians, such as David Blaine, have tried to push the human body to its limit. Derren Brown has managed to raise the stakes further not just by appearing to endanger his own life, as he did when he played Russian roulette on live TV, but those of his subjects. In his 2016 Netflix special Pushed to the Edge he appears to coerce a member of the public, who doesn’t know he’s being manipulated or filmed, into pushing someone off a roof to their apparent death.But, increasingly, the idea of making a spectacle out of death and misery seems out of step with our post-truth world. What does it mean, for example, to be able to guess what someone is thinking when Cambridge Analytica was able to make seemingly astonishing guesses about people’s political persuasion, and facial recognition software can link millions of people to their private information? British science fiction writer Arthur C Clarke famously wrote that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”, a statement normally considered to be about the wonder of scientific advancement – but it could also be about the redundancy of magicians.Some of the answers to this potentially existential crisis for magic have been less than satisfactory. Techno-illusionist Marco Tempest, a director’s fellow at MIT’s Media Lab, gives magic demonstrations to rapturous audiences of billionaires at places like Davos, using augmented reality and interactive projections in a bid to outpace technology. But the problem is that Tempest’s demonstrations from even five years ago, when he made drones react to his movements or a robot perform simple sleight of hand, now look entirely unremarkable – already superseded by the automotive dystopias on the Boston Dynamics YouTube channel.“The technology that comes out is so fascinating and moving at such a rapid pace that it’s so hard to comprehend what is going to be out in the future,” says Dynamo when I ask whether people are more amazed by human magicians or virtual achievements. “But I don’t think there’s any piece of technology out there that is more advanced and can grow more than the human mind. The technology that’s getting developed, it starts off as an idea in someone’s head. And that’s what magic is. It’s taking something that just starts in your mind and bringing it to life.”Indeed, the magicians that seem to be doing best are those who have moved beyond the idea of illusion in these untrustworthy times. On Magic for Humans with Justin Willman, a big Netflix show, one of the most interesting tricks is explained in its entirety before it begins. Willman explains that he has hired an audience of stooges for a magic show in a park and then waits for one unsuspecting man to join them, who he picks “randomly” as a volunteer and says he’s going to make him disappear. He doesn’t do anything, just chucks a blanket over his head and pulls it off again, but the fake audience reacts as if he’s gone, so he believes he has. The magic comes in watching a person – waving in people’s faces and getting no reaction – believe they have truly become invisible.Even those that once made a living out of can-you-believe-it stunts are moving away from illusion. Brown’s most recent Netflix special was all about teaching a man who harboured racist views enough empathy to take a bullet for someone of Mexican descent, with Brown relying more on a combination of psychological techniques than showpiece stunts. The final five minutes involved no magic at all, instead letting a moral argument play out between two of his advisers about whether they had a responsibility to resign from the programme if Brown refused to take his own safety seriously. The question of these shows becomes not “How did he do it?” but “Should he do it?”Gustav Kuhn, a former magician turned psychology professor, has spearheaded examination of magic as a field of science. He’s interested in the places magic, clinical psychology and the modern world overlap. In one recent study, for example, he got a “medium” to claim they were talking to the dead relatives of an audience of undergraduate students. Using magical trickery, he was able to guess correctly some of the things the students were thinking.“The sheer number of people, and these are Goldsmiths undergraduates, who believe what they’re seeing is true really shocked me. What’s even more frightening is that even if you tell someone what they’re seeing is a magician who is using deception, they still believe what they are seeing is true. It’s alarming how easily people are led to believe things that are impossible.”This, he says, has a big impact on the way we think about fake news. It’s not merely enough to tell people it isn’t real, to factcheck – people ignore that information. Only when we are told how a trick is done do we stop believing in it, as the Goldsmiths students eventually were.For Dynamo, the distorted dangers of magic and the jeopardy of real life have become inexorably linked. Just a few years ago it seemed he might never make it to Japan. Having suffered with Crohn’s disease his whole life, in 2014 a complication caused by a bout of food poisoning meant he was hospitalised for months with chronic pain and a series of worsening symptoms, including arthritis that affected every joint in his body and meant even some basic tasks, never mind sleight of hand, were impossible.While we’re waiting for shooting to reset, he tells me that although he experienced “the worst pain ever” during those months, he never lost focus on magic – coming up with more than 250 tricks and even learning Japanese from his hospital bed. When he was eventually discharged, he was followed home by paparazzi. He didn’t want photos of him appearing unexplained, so he posted a video outlining his condition. In it he looked unrecognisable, his face and body bloated and swollen, a result of the medication. But with the help of rehabilitation he was able to relearn the fundamentals of his craft. Now, at 37, he’s finally made it to Japan. When he arrived a few days earlier, he was met by hundreds of screaming fans at the airport, a sign of his global appeal (he’d just come off a 145-date live tour, selling out arenas from Cardiff to Cape Town). Now he says he worries less about the damage trickery can do and thinks more about the hope it can inspire.He was raised in what he describes as “quite a broken home”. His father was in jail for most of his young life. He was close to his mother, but she was only 16 when she had him and was also trying to sort her own life out. He was raised by his grandparents and great- grandparents, but says he mostly spent a lot of time alone, on his Bradford council estate. Once he got to school, he was bullied relentlessly, in part because of his size, but also his father’s Pakistani heritage. “I was beaten up quite a bit, because I went to quite a racist school – being of mixed background, you know. My mum’s English so a lot of people now wouldn’t necessarily know, but it is kind of obvious. I got a real rough time.”His grandfather’s magic manuals and the comic books he used to collect provided an escape route, and he was drawn by the super-powers he found in them. At that age, the magic of fantasy fiction and the trickery of illusion were hard to distinguish. “We didn’t have a TV licence, but the local video store gave me a VHS player. So I used to watch everything. Back then I didn’t comprehend the difference between a documentary and a movie. So I was watching these superhero movies, believing it was a real-life story. That gave me belief in myself, that I wanted to grow up and be like that when I was older. Before magic, I didn’t know who I needed to be, who society wanted me to be as a person. I didn’t totally feel comfortable being myself, because I didn’t feel that I belonged into any particular group. I felt like an outsider.”Dynamo agrees with Kuhn that magic can be powerful, and that power has to be wielded responsibly. But he sees his own belief in superhero-like powers changed his life, and he wants to create the same effect, especially for young working-class Brits who had an upbringing like his.“It’s hard to know what to believe, in this day and age. And whether people want to believe what I’m doing is real magic or skill, it’s totally up to them. But I want to inspire the kid who’s living in Bradford now on a council estate and who feels there’s no opportunity for him. He doesn’t know if the country is going to be in a position to provide for him in the future.”Kuhn is not anti-magic, far from it, but he says we need to understand its power. “There’s an evolutionary drive for us to explore things we don’t understand. A magician like Dynamo has universal appeal because he’s dealing with these raw psychological experiences.”The following day, we head out of the city to a car show in an old racetrack deep in the suburbs. A huge typhoon hit this area a few days earlier, and the whole event was almost cancelled, but instead they’ve made it free to all, so throughout the day families wander around as very rich Japanese men in their early 20s arrive in souped-up muscle cars, find a spot and pop their bonnets to show their engines and the boots to show their sound systems. You can see why Dynamo chose to film here, it’s real-life Tokyo Drift.As night falls, Dynamo gets ready for the big stunt. First, he gets four of the boy racers to line up and try to push him over – the four of them should easily be able to topple him, but as hard as they push, Dynamo is able to hold steady. Then he ups the ante and gets one of the guys, who can’t be older than 20, to get in his sports car and floor it with Dynamo standing right in front. The guy starts revving, first a little, then a lot. Dynamo is holding the car back with his bare hands. The wheels are spinning, the air filling with exhaust, but the car isn’t moving. I can feel my heart racing, too. There are little kids everywhere, if it went wrong it would be a disaster. Suddenly, Dynamo jumps out the way and the car zooms to the other end of the lot within seconds.In the past when I’ve watched these shows, I’ve felt uncomfortable – a good magician is a confidence trickster, someone who makes you believe the impossible. I wonder if there’s really more that differentiates David Blaine and David Icke than the calibre of the company they keep. Kuhn’s research suggests there might not be.Dynamo has tried to change my mind about that. In his vision, the magician is a leveller whose modus operandi is not to take advantage of their audience, but to bring something seemingly impossible into a world that can often feel mundane. Talking to him about his motivation, seeing his big tricks up close, has certainly nudged me towards this lighter view of the dark arts.But it’s after the trick is over, when Dynamo has left and the cameras are packed away, that I become a true convert. I spot the guy whose car it was. He’s still agog, bent over staring at his own tyres, trying to work out what just happened. At one point he just looks up at the sky, as if the answer might be in the stars. I start to believe in the magic of magic.All episodes of Dynamo: Beyond Belief are available on Sky and Now TV"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30ca9263d41ca7eeb561b7dd82ac9e2417a682a4/0_291_3847_2310/master/3847.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1959281d0e3a263fd69e2d587dac867e","title":"uk first wild stork chicks hatch centuries","story":"More than 100 birds have been living wild in England as part of conservation scheme The first wild stork chicks to hatch in Britain for centuries are expected to emerge next month after three pairs of the huge white birds built nests in West Sussex.Disdaining platforms constructed especially for them, the storks have created their stick nests in the heights of oak trees on the Knepp estate, the centre for a reintroduction project.White storks are traditionally thought to bring fertility and good luck but have been extinct as breeding birds in Britain since 1416, or possibly during the English civil war.More than 100 birds have been bred in captivity and released at three locations in West Sussex and Surrey, including Knepp, a 3,500-acre former dairy farm that was rewilded at the turn of the century.Knepp is close to the West Sussex village of Storrington, known as Estorchestone or “homestead of the white storks” in the Domesday Book.Storks are monogamous and last year a young pair laid three eggs in a treetop nest at Knepp but the eggs did not hatch. This year, cameras were rigged up beside this old nest but the couple constructed a new nest instead, in which they have laid five eggs.With four other birds having paired up and made nests, conservationists have high hopes that the first wild-born storks – which eat insects, earthworms and small mammals – will hatch and fledge this summer.Lucy Groves, the white stork project officer for Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, one of the partners in the reintroduction scheme, said: “The female was just coming up to four years old last spring and was a little bit too young to breed but they obviously know what they are doing this year and were ahead of the game. It’s really exciting. It’s going to be a fantastic year.”The Greeks created the myth that storks deliver newborn babies and nesting pairs herald good luck in numerous European cultures. Reintroduction programmes have successfully returned storks to France, the Netherlands and Poland where wild populations build their towering stick nests in villages and towns.Isabella Tree, the co-owner of Knepp with Charlie Burrell, said: “It’s so funny. We thought we needed to ‘manage’ them and put up nest platforms and so we did and they’ve turned their beaks up at all of this – where they want to nest is in the tops of oaks. That’s where they would’ve nested when they were here centuries ago.“I love the storks’ association with rebirth and bringing new life. They are such a hopeful symbol for rewilding.”White storks migrate south in the winter and some conservationists initially feared that captive-bred birds released in Britain would be unable to cross the Channel.But 22 of the 24 birds bred in captivity by the Cotswold Wildlife Park and released into West Sussex last summer have migrated south to the Mediterranean and north Africa. Storks are faithful to where they are raised and these birds are expected to return to England when they are ready to breed.More than 100 birds are now living wild and in fenced pens at Knepp and nearby sites in a reintroduction scheme masterminded by Burrell and Tree, who have seen wildlife roar back onto their rewilded farm.Knepp is now a hot spot for endangered species including nightingales, turtle doves and purple emperor butterflies. Beavers have been reintroduced in the fenced part of the farm, alongside free-roaming cattle and horses that mimic the grazing of extinct herbivores.Some of the storks are fenced in open-top pens to protect them from predators and ensure they bond with their “home” range. The birds can fly out when they are ready and also draw in passing wild birds. The male in Knepp’s first pair is an un-ringed wild bird from continental Europe.The chicks are expected to hatch in mid-May, and take 60 days to grow large enough to fly. The British-born wild storks are likely to fly south for three years or more before returning to England when they are ready to breed.The project aims to have 30 wild pairs of storks by 2030 and can take heart from the successful return of another large white bird – the crane.Britain’s crane population has reached its highest level for more than 400 years with 56 breeding pairs last summer. Natural recolonisation saw cranes return to east Norfolk in 1979 and reintroduction and conservation efforts led by the RSPB, the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust and Pensthorpe Conservation Trust have now returned them to the Somerset Levels, Wales, Scotland and the Humberhead Peatlands."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1bda6b79570ff7cf669a782cb0046e4c40a4f6e/0_0_3148_2099/master/3148.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e99c3fbacee1bfe56c6d92e3fe8d4ddd 700w","title":"nigel slaters recipes for split pea soup and pea and mushroom cakes","story":"If you have dried or frozen peas, you’re well on your way to a super-scrum store cupboard supperThe yellow split peas were probably wondering if they would ever see the light of day.

Over the past week he has taken joy in the things that, for an Ivorian footballer living on the opposite side of the world, would usually serve as basic punctuation points in the day. Sleeping in his own bed, cooking his own food, watching his own television the happiness in recovering these simple freedoms has been profound, even if he cannot stop his mind drifting to an experience that will never leave him. “This is a year I’ll never forget,” he tells the . “A very, very strange moment. Many things have happened to me that I will never forget in my life.”It is hard to know where to start given that, until 18 April, Kouassi and his teammates had spent 104 days away from Wuhan. The end of their involuntary exile was facilitated after the city’s Covid-19 lockdown was lifted on 8 April, and they eventually returned to a rapturous welcome from several hundred supporters at the local railway station. “At this moment, I felt as if I was in the stadium again,” says Kouassi. Flickers of light appeared behind the eyes of a squad whose morale had long since hollowed.Wuhan Zall had been in pre‑season training 520 miles away in Guangzhou when their home city, by then established as the origin of the Covid-19 outbreak, was put under quarantine on 23 January. It meant none of their players could return to visit family or friends before flying to Málaga and beginning a pre-season camp in the Costa del Sol six days later. They had been expected to travel back from Spain in mid-February – in time for the new Chinese Super League campaign – but that was postponed and, with nowhere to go, their stay was extended by a month.The problem was that, as fears took hold in Europe, the name of Wuhan carried an inescapable stigma upon arrival. Their original hotel booking was cancelled and interaction with those outside the complex into which they eventually settled was, on a personal or professional level, sometimes impossible. “It was difficult in Spain, very difficult,” Kouassi says. “We had to wear club uniform when we went out, so it was obvious who we were and people looked at us very differently. Particularly the Chinese players, who had some bad experiences in supermarkets.“It was hard for the coaching staff too. We trained, but nobody would play friendly games with us. Every week we wanted to play against someone, but couldn’t find an opponent. It meant the coach’s plans kept changing and he constantly had to think differently. And it affected the team because we were just training, one day, two days, three days. Everyone needs a bit of variety but instead it was all the same.”If it was a test of strength for Zall’s five foreign players and their Spanish coach, José González, the weight upon the majority of the side was almost impossible to bear. Most of their Chinese players came from the Wuhan area and, in any case, the virus was spreading in other areas of the country too. The worry was too much and meant training sessions, conducted under a cloud nobody could shift, were often truncated.“The atmosphere was very, very bad,” he says. “When we were training you could see the Chinese players didn’t want to be out there. They were very nervous and everything felt really strange. Every day news would come through from Wuhan and it was often bad maybe someone would hear one of their relatives was sick. It was hard to play football so the coach tried to make the sessions shorter. We tried to keep ourselves happy, and every week we’d get a day off for some free time outside. But it was very tough, and especially for the Chinese guys.”Kouassi describes how happy he felt for his teammates, much more than for himself, when their high-speed train pulled into Wuhan. Many were met by their families and that could not have seemed a more remote prospect when they were told to bed down for a longer spell in Europe. Kouassi was able to briefly visit family in Ivory Coast as training fizzled to a halt, but he was called back on 14 March. Spain was by now also in the grip of coronavirus and, to considerable relief, a return to China was deemed the safest course of action.Yet there were still hurdles to confront and, for Kouassi, what followed was the bleakest period of all. The Zall squad flew to Shenzhen, adjacent to Hong Kong, and were immediately quarantined for a fortnight. Over that period he saw nothing but the bare walls of a hotel room. “Ahhhh … I call it a jail,” he says, gasping as he recalls the stifling boredom. “It was like being in jail. The quarantine was very difficult one of those moments that will always stay with me. We could not go out for 14 days and it was so hard.”He would do push‑ups and abdominal exercises but that, he admits, was about it in terms of physical activity or entertainment. It seemed to drag on forever, but the quarantine had its desired effect and Zall were cleared to recommence their pre-season campaign with a further camp near Guangzhou. They were then finally allowed to return home and, on Wednesday, trained in Wuhan for the first time since December.“We’re given a blood test before training every day,” Kouassi says. “It’s very fast and everything is OK. I don’t feel Covid-19 affects our daily lives as footballers at the moment. If we respect the things we are asked to do, like wearing a mask when we go out and just travelling between home and training, everything can be all right.”He describes a city that, in his words, is “not like before” but shows signs of returning to normality. Shops and restaurants are opening again the streets are hardly teeming but, while the long-term ramifications remain uncertain, he sees more residents going about their normal business with each passing day. Like others in Wuhan, Kouassi has downloaded an app that scans a “green code” when entering a premises or using public transport, only allowing entry if the user is free of Covid-19 symptoms or recent contact with an infected person. “When we were away we heard a lot of things. But now we can see life is starting to be OK.”It may only seem complete to Kouassi, a 25-year-old winger who has scored 34 goals in 72 appearances since joining the club in 2017, when he can play football again. Nobody knows when that will be, although a resumption has been mooted for June or July.“First I just hope everything becomes normal in the world, not only in China.” He has seen, across three continents, how 2020 has been anything but ordinary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a81011901d2f7a0374718f847296279553a638f9/240_645_3107_1864/master/3107.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdf881283afd18b974ff004c7542273a","title":"everton appalled moise kean hosts coronavirus lockdown party","story":"Everton are set to fine Moise Kean two weeks’ salary – around £160,000 – with senior executives at the club “appalled” that the Italian forward held a party at his house in direct defiance of coronavirus lockdown restrictions.Kean was filmed enjoying himself at the gathering despite the government guidance that people should stay at home and not meet friends or family beyond those in their own household.It is understood Everton will seek to take the strongest possible action against Kean once a club investigation is completed. The maximum sanction available is the deduction of a fortnight’s wages. Everton may also ask him to issue an apology in addition to any further potential action.Kean’s behaviour is particularly disquieting for the club given the goodwill for their longstanding Everton in the Community initiative which helps vulnerable people in the area.In 2015 Evertonians also launched a joint initiative with Liverpool supporters, under the Fans Supporting Foodbanks umbrella, with the banner “Hunger Doesn’t Wear Club Colours”. Contributions from both clubs have helped to raise £50,000 towards food banks in the area following the start of government restrictions.In a statement condemning Kean’s actions the club stressed the need to respect NHS staff due to their “hard work and sacrifice”.

Such a condition would amount to coercion, Liberty claims.The academic developing the app has said that tens of millions of people would need to sign up to the app to make it effective.Clare Collier, the advocacy director at Liberty, said: “By presenting surveillance tools as a solution to lockdown, the government is drawing on the willingness we have all shown to make sacrifices in the face of this crisis while refusing to show it is taking seriously the enormous risks presented by invasive technology.”She added: “Contact-tracing technology may require us to sacrifice deeply sensitive personal information and there can be no question of state bodies or private companies sharing our personal data other than what is absolutely necessary. It is vital no one is coerced into having the app installed, and using it as a condition for returning to work or everyday life will inevitably lead to discrimination.“The opportunities presented by technology should be fully investigated, but seeking quick solutions in surveillance tools that rely on our personal data creates serious long-term threats to our rights and ways of life.Prof Christophe Fraser, of the University of Oxford, who is leading a team developing the app, said it would a require a very high take-up to be effective.He that if a person became infected, the app would send warning messages to anyone who had come within Bluetooth range of their phone. He said: “You’ll either get a message which says you’ve been in contact with a suspected case of Covid-19. Or you may later get a message and you’ve been a contact of a confirmed case. At that point, we would recommend quarantine of 14 days after the contact has taken place.”He added: “When you install the app, this is an opt-in system so it will work in the background. Your phone builds up a memory of the sort of anonymous IDs of the other phones you come into contact with. It needs to be a contact long enough that there’s a risk of transmission.”Asked about privacy concerns he said: “The NHS records patient data already and we trust the NHS to look after private data. This is being developed with a minimal amount of data – enough to make it work. It’s a public health intervention with data collected within a health system.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b561f19e0d03b0d3998005c9b920f34e2b6cbde1/0_2027_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0506513ba8a9311b5257f1ce78bd3612","title":"my dad said i wasnt black enough at last i know what he meant","story":"I’m mixed race and ‘culturally white’, and seemed to be a disappointment to my father – but we just weren’t closeMy dad said it to me when I was seven years old and it stung like vinegar on a paper cut. Of all the things you throw at kids you never know which ones will stick. This one accidentally stuck. I’m not black enough. The phrase, the unblackness, was planted, and developed like an irksome bruise I only feel when I bend a certain way. It’s a scar tissue formed from acid poured into my wound after I was hit by the paternal truck of not-black-enoughness. An unexploded bomb that’s leaking mustard gas into my blood.I’m fully grown now, but the comment still tinkles lightly on the piano of my mind. Whiteness is in my blood. Well, half of it. My mum’s never done an ancestry DNA test, but as a woman from north London who regularly burns in the British sun, it’s safe to assume she’s majority Caucasian. I’m mixed-raced and grew up in multicultural Brighton. When my parents split up, my dad stayed in Brixton and I was occasionally evacuated to him on school holidays. As a single parent, aware of her son’s racial identity, my mum rallied, and founded Mosaic, a support group for mixed-parentage families. Brighton is inherently liberal, but “How come your mum’s white, but you’re not?” was the power ballad of my childhood.Luckily, each peer-to-peer micro-aggression that questioned my identity actually fortified my sense of self. Sorry to go a tad Oprah, but they were all learning experiences en route to the slightly too self-assured man I’ve become. I call it public school confidence, but without the fees. Of all the things I am – tall, loud, almost aggressively expressive – black is the one people see first. But I’ve never felt defined purely by my race. That might be what my dad was getting at.I can’t truly shake the reality that I have lived a predominantly white life, with a white mother and stepdad and – in the past 20 years – a four-bedroom home in the countryside, a boat and a house in France. These shiny new things don’t tally with my mum getting chased down the street with me in a buggy as people screamed the N-word at her. I’m not steeped in the residue of my 1980s Brixton youth, nor is this quite the rags-to-riches My Fair Lady story.As I gaze around me at the white middle-class paraphernalia, my amassed signifiers of success, I know I am culturally white. It’s a sticky, uncomfortable feeling, like the fur on unbrushed teeth, or a door that doesn’t close completely flush. That’s not to say there are no successful black people on the same page as me, but I haven’t lived out the reductive story of blocked opportunity so often associated with inner-city black men.I wish there was a turning point, some clear moment I assimilated, but the whiteness and privilege were my climate and I just changed. Like any human, I adopted the values of the lives immediately adjacent to mine.I’ve both succeeded and failed as a black person, and that’s a tricky thing to fully express without falling into tired stereotypes. I sometimes feel like a kind of poster boy for liberals, because I’m an ethnic some way up the ladder of successful capitalism. Ironically, my biggest fear is that my blackness has opened more doors than it has closed. That rankles me more than the missed opportunities. I joked in my teens that I’m catnip for middle-class women, and that’s somehow still a constant nag. Have I been championed by people who quietly knew they were doing something wholesome by supporting me? Not charitable exactly, just good.Positive discrimination should be invisible to the naked eye, but racism in the UK has followed a similar path, evolving alongside endeavours for equality. People aren’t noticeably discriminatory the least accepting people take the most umbrage to being called racist. But racism is thriving, invisible like carbon monoxide, inhaled through Brexit and exhaled in a constant hammering criticism that sees a duchess and her husband relinquish their titles.We all want to be liberal. To love thy neighbours, even the ones we are only connected to by follows and likes. But we’re right-on splodges on a massively biased canvas. The system is skewed. Sometimes I feel as if I’m compensating or I’ve diluted my blackness like vodka in a cheap club.I’m paranoid I’m the palatable black man, the kind of guy you party with, the kind who won’t kick up a fuss unless you make an explicitly racist joke (the London bubble keeps me pretty sheltered from those, to be honest). Have I gradually made myself more digestible, WD40ing myself for social lubrication because I don’t want to be the guy with a chip on his shoulder bringing everyone down? Is this a form of social survival, or just the self-levelling screed of living in a community? I guess it’s the same palatability that’s expected of women the world over, so I’ll put my tiny violin away for now.In my book I explore the idea of not being a specific type of gay – not an otter, or a bear, or a daddy – in the same way David Hockney isn’t a painter associated with a specific movement. As the Hockney of gays, I wonder if there’s also any mileage in the type of black person I can be? Not explicitly my father’s type, but one of my own.I’m Jamaican pigmentally, but too anxious about the island’s approach to homosexuality to get on a flight to Kingston. I’m sure I’d be safe as houses at a luxury resort, but that doesn’t scream finding yourself, does it? It’s hard to connect with your roots while sipping Mount Gay from a coconut by the pool. I’m Rastafarian in name (my initials deliberately spell RAS), but not versed in the religion at all. I love reggae, but is there anything whiter than reggae?My personality is always on my sleeve, my emotions written all over my face. My eyebrows will tell you when I’m ecstatic. And it’s crystal clear when I’m displeased. I’m easy to read, like a Mills \u0026amp Boon or the Sun. I’m, what you might call, a lot. I always want another bite of the cherry. Enough cherries to get diabetes. My dad is pure charisma, too. Very, very dryly funny and thoughtful. But even at five or six, I manufactured a lessness to appease him. Medical grade introversion. Less keen to dance. Less gobby. Less Raven Smith. Visiting my dad in London always came with a side order of a slight suppression of the self. A quieter, more subdued boy would return with his mother on the train.Speaking of which, my dad once dreaded my hair and my mum spent the entire train journey back home painfully combing the wax out.Suddenly feeling the low-level hum that he should dutifully be included in my nuptials, I went to see my dad just before I got married, after a five-year break. I could still feel the sting of his words as I entered the flat. Not black enough. His questioning of my blackness wasn’t strictly about race, it was a questioning of my relationship with him. He was the source of blackness in my life and he could feel me slipping away at seven. A great man, Windrushed here at 14. But his fathering style wasn’t the type that celebrated a high-spirited child who needed channelling rather than being dammed up. I was coursing away from him and he couldn’t stop the flow.My father and I were, and still are, two circles of a Venn diagram that couldn’t work out how to overlap. I always felt like this man never really “got me”, that by some splice of DNA I came out of the womb attached umbilically to his sense of disappointment. I was never tough enough. I was never straight enough. I was never black enough. But the truth is, I was never close enough either. Circumstances separated us and misfired attempts at communication, with a focus on racial identity, kept us apart. You’re not black enough should have really been you’re not here enough. Or, you are enough. Or just, I love you.Raven Smith’s Trivial Pursuits by Raven Smith is published by 4th Estate at £10.99.

Demand for content via piracy has grown exponentially.”As the nation stays home, viewing levels are soaring, with households watching an average of five hours more TV each week than before lockdown, according to the TV marketing body Thinkbox.“TV is again uniting Britain,” said Ben Page, the chief executive of Ipsos Mori, which conducted the research for Thinkbox. “New routines and habits are emerging, with TV bringing households together to seek comfort in shared experiences.”Accessing apps such as Netflix and YouTube via Sky is also booming, up by a third over the same period with more than 50m requests by viewers.“Interestingly, we’re not just seeing viewers watch comedies or old classics to escape these uncertain times,” said Zai Bennett, managing director of content at Sky. “We’re seeing that people are looking for variety in lockdown, from premium dramas and cinematic comedy as well as more escapist TV.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d8e9c4683830c7d30b840c08126e17daee180b4/0_201_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c893b43ca22b4398f4658465102e326","title":"alone and disconnected the woman left unable to call her dying partner","story":"Problems with internet and phone service were once just an inconvenience. Now they can prove to be catastrophicCut off by telecoms company, pensioner missed call as partner died of Covid-19Barbara Parry* arranged to switch her phone and broadband account from Sky to Now TV in March, a week before lockdown. Instead, she was left incommunicado as her line was cancelled and her phone number reallocated.During the following four weeks, as she pleaded in vain to be reconnected, her partner contracted Covid-19. He died four days later in hospital. Due to the blunders by Now TV, he was unable to call Parry from his deathbed and she was unable to say goodbye. The news was broken by a relative as the hospital could not get through on her cancelled number.“Now TV’s failed promises have left a 79-year-old woman, grieving for a lost loved one, completely on her own, with friends and family unable to contact her,” says her son-in-law, Anthony. “The day after her partner died, the company reneged on a promise to retrieve her old number and said it was not possible. Instead of promised call backs, we’ve had auto-generated emails asking why we cancelled the contract and I’ve spent over seven fruitless hours on the phone explaining it was a life-and-death situation and trying to get her connected.”Ofcom, which regulates the industry, has eased some of the obligations of telecoms firms to reflect the challenges. They are absolved from having to fix problems within the usual 30-day window for customers receiving less than their guaranteed broadband speed and automatic compensation, introduced last year for each day of delay to a repair or installation. Companies are expected to explain to customers why they will not receive a payout and to stop charging those without a service.“Broadband and mobile firms are focusing their efforts on keeping their customers connected, particularly those who are vulnerable and depend on their services the most,” Ofcom says. “We think this is absolutely the right approach. And we recognise this might affect the companies’ ability to comply with some of our rules. We have written to the providers explaining that we will take account of the unique circumstances when enforcing our rules.”The problem is that customers with mental or physical impairments had to be registered as vulnerable with their service providers in order to be prioritised before the pandemic. Now anyone self-isolating due to age or a medical condition falls into that category, but may not be flagged up on their provider’s database.Pensioners Colin and Anne Noddings* found that their landline had been disconnected after Vodafone installed a broadband service. They were told it would take 10 days to restore and Colin had to borrow mobile phones from neighbours to call for updates.Three days later, the couple was informed that their contract had been cancelled for reasons unknown and the phone number they’d had for 30 years, withdrawn. It would take an estimated 15 days to reconnect them.“My 73-year-old wife is classed as disabled as her mobility is extremely limited and I have a heart condition, diabetes and have recently been diagnosed with asthma and COPD,” says Colin. “In the current climate we are both classed as extremely vulnerable but in an emergency have no means of contacting anyone.”Ofcom says it expects companies to provide self-isolating customers alternative means of communication if their issue can’t be prioritised. However, Vodafone only acted when the Observer intervened. It reinstated the line and the original number 13 days after the couple were disconnected and has given them £50 and two months free line rental.Charlotte Hughes* lost her internet connection in January after a cable to her flat was severed. Virgin Media claimed it was unable to reconnect her because of scaffolding on the council block where she lives. The inconvenience for the first two months, when lack of wifi impeded her search for a job, turned to hardship when lockdown began a week after she underwent surgery for cancer. She was unable to order food online and had to risk trips to the supermarket, despite an NHS letter requiring her to shield, and she was unable to seek comfort from friends and family.“Skype is the main way I connect, and I simply cannot say what it meant not to have a reliable enough connection to talk to people,” she says. “This was especially difficult at a time of diagnosis and pre- and post-operative treatment for cancer. I was told that the cable had been severed by a Virgin Media technician connecting a neighbouring flat, but the company displays no sense of urgency or responsibility and clearly has no reliable mechanism for communicating between departments or flagging up unresolved problems.”Virgin Media says that it believed the cable was severed by builders, and that health and safety risks prevented it reinstating the line while scaffolding was in place. After involvement from the Observer, however, it dispatched a “specialist crew” and completed the repair. It has credited Hughes’ account for the 11 weeks she was without service and given her an extra two months free.The online resolution service Resolver reports a doubling of complaints about telecoms service issues since lockdown. “Most people are pragmatic enough to expect service disruptions and slow speeds, but they weren’t expecting poor customer service,” says spokesperson Martyn James. “We’ve never been more reliant on broadband and mobile phone networks, but our data suggests some firms are falling short.”Customers who are self-isolating or in financial straits are advised to contact their provider to receive priority status. If that fails, they can still complain to whichever of the two dispute resolution schemes it’s signed up to – CISAS or Ombudsman Services. These are prioritising those who are left without a connection because of delayed installation, a faulty line or inability to pay their bill. Other complaints will be parked until there is a degree of normality.Parry’s ordeal was caused by disjointed customer service and a failure to escalate the problem. When the Observer alerted the management of Now TV, part of Sky Group, the response was immediate and remorseful. The director of operations called her to apologise, her old phone number was retrieved and her line connected.Managing Director, Marina Storti, says: “We take our responsibility to keep customers informed and connected very seriously, especially in these challenging times, and we know we’ve let the customer and her family down. We’ve spoken to the family and while we know that no amount of money can make things right, we have met the request of compensation and offered to match it with a donation to a charity of their choice.”The company’s contrition is some mollification, but the anguish of losing a loved-one without a farewell will never heal. “It’s hard to put into words how much greater the misery has been because of the mistakes,” Parry says.“They let me down in the first place and they let me down again when we tried to sort it out. I’m a Christian and I believe in forgiveness but this is very tough for me.”* Names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76236404fbeff21e43a9208519f4f5a8fc34eb1b/0_53_3220_1931/master/3220.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7b0e391bdb606f1c36f4959131d4c83","title":"hamilton bohannon accidental disco king who laid foundations of house","story":"The drummer, who has died aged 78, pushed a relentless beat loved by dance floors and hip-hop samplers alikeIn 1973, Hamilton Bohannon, who died on Friday aged 78, released his debut album, Stop \u0026amp Go. It was a solid set of tough, largely instrumental funk tracks, the kind of album that was destined to get lost amid the glut of incredible soul music pouring out of American studios – 1973 was the year of Funkadelic’s Cosmic Slop, Sly and the Family Stone’s Fresh, Stevie Wonder’s Innervisions and Marvin Gaye’s Let’s Get it On – and to be rediscovered years later by crate-diggers and sample hunters, which it duly was: plundered for tracks by Jay-Z, Mary J Blige, Public Enemy, the Ultramagnetic MCs and Pete Rock.You might say it sounded like the work of a musical journeyman, which pretty much describes Hamilton Bohannon in 1973. He’d spent the 1960s drumming for Stevie Wonder before putting together the Motown Sound – a kind of touring equivalent of the label’s legendary sessioneers the Funk Brothers – who played gigs with Marvin Gaye, the Four Tops and Martha and the Vandellas, and then leading the house bands at a variety of Detroit nightclubs. But on its title track, Stop \u0026amp Go contained the germ of an idea: Bohannon’s drumming stripped away the syncopated style that was standard on funk tracks in favour of a simple, driving rhythm, the bass drum playing four beats to the bar, or four-to-the-floor.You could see where he’d got it from – it was like a more muscular version of the beat he’d played backing Stevie Wonder on I Was Made to Love Her, or Wonder’s cover of We Can Work It Out – and, in fairness, Bohannon wasn’t the only musician stripping funk’s rhythm down. Over in Philadelphia, Earl Young was doing something similar, although Young’s take was more subtle and delicate, more reliant on shifting hi-hat patterns, as evidenced by his playing on Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes’ The Love I Lost, as strong a candidate as any for the title of first disco record. A session man rather than a star, despite his day job as a member of The Trammps, Young always played in service to the song.Bohannon, however, played aggressively, as if he’d unilaterally decided that the drums were a lead instrument, which suited his sound. Philly soul was lush and sophisticated Bohannon’s music was raw, the drums pushed to the forefront of the mix.He gave his style a name, Bohannon’s Beat, as the title of a 1975 album track put it, and set about refining it over the following years. Dance Your Ass Off (1976), its title appended with a message from the devoutly Christian Bohannon that it was “not used in the sense of profanity”, is a masterpiece of pumped-up relentlessness with tracks that seem to meld into one continuous pulse.He authored a succession of New York club anthems, but, curiously, Bohannon’s early singles were always more successful in the UK than in America. Perhaps they fitted more readily with the sound of contemporary British pop. He kept using the word “stomp” in his song titles, and there was a lot of, well, stompy-sounding music on Top of the Pops in 1974 and 1975: the last burst of drum-heavy glam rock the 60s soul tracks revived by the Northern Soul scene and the modern singles made in their image, including Maxine Nightingale’s Right Back Where We Started From. But it was disco that made Bohannon a star. He finally hit paydirt on 1978’s Summertime Groove, home to Let’s Start the Dance, not so much a song as a string of irresistible hooks strung together, timeless enough for him to rework in 1981 as Let’s Start II Dance Again, adding something approaching a rap vocal by Dr Perri Johnson and enjoying a hit all over again.It was his biggest hit by some distance, although his albums were usually of a high quality, packed with compelling reasons to dance: Take The Country to New York City, Throw Down the Groove, The Hammer, a re-recording of Stop and Go from 1979’s Too Hot to Hold that showed how he’d honed his signature sound over the years into something unique, spurning disco’s lushness in favour of something that, as he put it, “came out hitting hard”. But it wasn’t until Bohannon’s moment had theoretically passed that it became apparent how influential he had been.If Earl Young was rightly heralded as the architect of the disco beat – it was his style that was endlessly copied, him who played on countless hits, both as a member of MFSB and the Salsoul Orchestra, disco’s twin answers to the Wreckin’ Cru – then the raw relentlessness of Bohannon’s approach turned out to presage a subsequent generation of less ornate, more rhythmic dance music. “His repetition, open grooves, sample-ready pockets, big kick drum and raw bass were the foundation of house music,” suggested US writer Ronnie Reese, not without evidence. Bohannon tracks were huge in the Chicago clubs that gave birth to house music: Frankie Knuckles played a re-edit of Let’s Start the Dance at the Warehouse – “a major, major piece for the dance music community in Chicago,” recalled DJ and producer Ron Trent – while Ron Hardy did the same with Caroline Crawford’s Bohannon-penned and produced Coming On Strong at the Music Box.The list of house and techno artists who have sampled his work is huge: DJ Pierre, Cajmere, Underground Resistance, Danny Tenaglia, Dimitri From Paris. And house music gave Bohannon his biggest hit of all: Paul Johnson’s Get Get Down, a top 10 hit in 1999, was based on Bohannon’s 1978 track Me and the Gang. Bohannon sued Johnson for using his work without credit, which even Johnson’s peers seemed to think was fair enough, given how obviously it resembled the original. And, for the most part, Bohannon remained philosophical about his impact on house and techno. “When the music changed like that, I didn’t have to try and record something to keep up with it,” he noted. “Because … my music was already doing it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38454dac1b14ffe60cba71baaf53bfe1abacb8fb/0_1947_2997_1797/master/2997.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=538118878b4dce8e9489b16428e1a6a1","title":"sea change festival review a swell of congregation in the new nowhere","story":"Totnes festival’s move online gives glimpses of what might have been but is also its own, triumphant entityThe relationship between the pandemic and the summer festival season has, unsurprisingly, proved far from harmonious. As the lockdown has rolled on, music events have fallen like dominoes – Glastonbury, Primavera, All Points East among them – the months to come now marked by an absence of revelry and also something of an economic void. Last year, more than a quarter of UK adults attended a festival, and the combined concert and festival industry was valued at more than £2.6bn.Touring musicians have proved remarkably enterprising during quarantine, streaming home performances, guitar tutorials and DJ sets, and launching various charity fundraising initiatives. But as the novelty wanes and a new normality settles, a question arises: is there a way that a real-life music festival can be replicated in the virtual world?In Totnes, Devon, Sea Change festival was launched five years ago by the owners of the town’s much-loved Drift record shop. It has been propelled by goodwill and great taste, consistently drawing an impressive and erse line-up (this year promising Aldous Harding, Squid and Shirley Collins over three days in May) and making great use of its location (events sprawling across the town’s civic hall, church, cinema, pubs, industrial units, and, more recently, the Dartington Hall estate).The decision not to postpone or cancel but instead reincarnate the festival online, sooner and for free, was bold but also canny, and perhaps indicative of the loyalty that has quickly grown between Sea Change and its audience.On Friday afternoon, the lineup was still a work in progress: even at that late hour artists were being added to the weekend’s bill, and there was the surprise announcement that Jon Savage was “going early” with a 4pm Twitter discussion of his new book, an oral history of Joy Division. Over the following two days there would be contributions from the Cool Greenhouse, the Orielles, a Gene Clark documentary and David Keenan’s tarot readings.Saturday evening belonged to the record label Erased Tapes, with an impeccably chosen taster menu of its roster, including a split-screen performance by the exquisitely voiced Douglas Dare and Manu Delgado, and the Pakistani-American composer Qasim Naqvi performing a modular synth set from his kitchen in New York. Sunday brought Tim’s Twitter Listening Party, in which the Charlatans’ Tim Burgess explored seminal albums with the musicians who made them – everything from Gwenno’s Le Kov to the Breeders’ Last Splash.Many of the sets proved brief affairs, reflective perhaps of our short online attention s but also echoing the festivalgoer’s tendency to meander from stage to stage, catch a song or two here, the tail-end of a reading there – Billy Bragg performing a timely rendition of No One Knows Nothing Anymore, followed by the poet Will Burns reading from his new collection Country Music. Some events were broadcast simultaneously but kept online so one could return, or hop between the two.It took a moment to adjust and to realise that one does not need to remain glued to one’s laptop but could instead enjoy Max Porter and Bonnie Prince Billy’s It’s Going to Be a Bright New Day, or the Hot Singles Club DJ set while doing a spot of yoga, taking a stroll or fixing a stiff gin and tonic.The key to the weekend’s success was that by moving across platforms — from video streaming to Soundcloud, Twitter to Spotify to Instagram live – and providing links to explore works further (or purchase online), it managed to create both texture and a sense of companionability. Not once did it feel a flat or lonely endeavour rather it found a great swell of congregation.This is not a format that will work for every festival, but for an event like Sea Change, marked in real life by its intimacy and warmth, it proved a triumph: glimpses of a festival that might have been, certainly, but also its own entity, particular to the strange new nowhere in which we now find ourselves.

Streamed on its website, the politan Opera’s At-Home Gala, featured more than 40 of the house’s regular singers, most of whom performed live via Skype live from their living rooms and studies, or indeed, in the case of Diana Damrau and her husband Nicolas Testé, from their kitchen. General manager Peter Gelb and music director Yannick Nézet-Séguin presided over proceedings from their apartments in New York and Montreal respectively, while prerecorded footage allowed us to see and hear the Met’s orchestra and chorus playing and singing in split-screen around Nézet-Séguin as he conducted.Technically, it was little short of remarkable as we glided almost seamlessly between continents, countries and time zones. Glitches were few and far between, though a faulty connection to Nicole Car and Étienne Dupuis’s home meant that we arrived ahead of schedule in the house of bass Günther Groissböck, who calmly finished his beer before singing the closing scene from Strauss’s Die Schweigsame Frau. Car and Dupuis were found a slot later in the evening for their performance of the duet at the oasis from Massenet’s Thaïs. Anna Netrebko and her husband Yusif Eyvazov, it was announced, were unable to sing live, so their contributions were prerecorded in what looked like a studio in Vienna.Outfits ranged from the everyday to the glamorous, with Jonas Kaufmann singing Halévy in a sweater and jeans, and Sonya Yoncheva giving us Dvořák’s Song to the Moon from Rusalka in an evening gown. And you couldn’t help but be sometimes drawn to details of the interiors on display: a placard reading “No autographs, please” on the side of Anita Rachvelishvili’s piano, a beautiful painting on the wall of Michael Fabiano’s living room, and Renée Fleming’s garden, glimpsed beyond her windows, linger particularly in the mind.There was some wonderful singing, from Fleming’s Ave Maria from Verdi’s Otello to Netrebko’s impassioned closing performance of Rachmaninov’s song about the old melodies of Georgia. Roberto Alagna and Aleksandra Kurzak camped it up something rotten in a scene from L’Elisir d’Amore. And there was a deeply touching performance of Ombra Mai Fu, from Handel’s Serse, given by Joyce DiDonato and the orchestra’s viola section in tribute to Vincent Lionti, a Met violist who tragically lost his life to Covid-19. The high point, though, for me, came from Lisette Oropesa, singing an aria from Meyerbeer’s Robert le Diable from her house in Baton Rouge: astonishing singing, her coloratura thrilling beyond belief.•The At-Home Gala is available on demand at metopera.org until 6.30pm EST (1.30am BST) Sunday 26 April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/258f532536c24bf03dfaac1bdd8416d1cca9d50e/0_190_5217_3128/master/5217.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9d31114eeaf9664704b775d828395fd","title":"babys guard of honour a special delivery and tour bus hotels","story":"A parcel reaches ‘somewhere in Sheffield’ and Captain Tom Moore reportedly makes honours shortlistAmid the coronavirus crisis, acts of kindness and amazing recoveries offer sparks of hope.

And of course, homeless people cannot simply stay home.”He highlighted how the most vulnerable populations had been neglected, which “forces them to continue working in unsafe conditions, putting everyone’s health at risk.” And he warned that, while some nations were seeing curves flattening, the virus was “poised to wreak havoc in poorer countries”.“As for the UK,” Alston told the , “my thoughts of course hark back to the sense of how utterly hypocritical it is now to abandon ‘austerity’ with such alacrity, after all the harm and misery caused to iniduals and the fatal weakening of the community’s capacity to cope and respond over the past 10 years.“And of course, many of the worst and most damaging aspects of ‘austerity’ cannot and will not be undone. The damage caused to community cohesion and to the social infrastructure are likely to prove permanent.”His comments are likely to anger ministers in the UK, who have said their strategy is to put their “arms around every single worker” while adopting an “everyone in” policy to tackle the risk to rough sleepers. They have sanctioned huge cash injections into wages and businesses to prevent economic collapse, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak announced £14bn for the NHS and local authorities fighting the virus.But other parts of the social fabric have been stretched. Food banks, which give out at least 1.6m parcels a year, have lacked supplies while care homes, where thousands are dying from Covid-19, have struggled for essentials including PPE and to maintain staffing levels. There have been real-terms cuts in public funding of social care in the UK, according to the King’s Fund thinktank, with a £700m reduction between 2011 and 2018.“This pandemic has exposed the bankruptcy of social support systems in many countries.” Alston said. “While some governments have embraced far-ranging measures previously dismissed as unrealistic, most programmes have been short-term, stop-gap measures that merely buy time rather than address the immense challenges that will continue well into the future. Now is the time for deep structural reforms that will protect populations as a whole and will build resilience in the face of an uncertain future.”A government spokesperson said: “We have a strong record on supporting hardworking people across the country as well as our most vulnerable, reaching record employment over the last ten years and with both income inequality and absolute poverty lower than in 2010.“These are unprecedented times and it’s right that we do everything we can to support people through this difficult period, including increasing Universal Credit by up to £1,040 over a year.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6520e87489ed917158f9d1316de3eef690deb3ad/0_224_4325_2596/master/4325.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06da79909958acb5ea346894b18edecf","title":"pompeii ruins show that the romans invented recycling","story":"Excavations reveal that rubbish left outside the city walls wasn’t just dumped. It was being collected, sorted and resoldThey were expert engineers, way ahead of the curve on underfloor heating, aqueducts and the use of concrete as a building material. Now it turns out that the Romans were also masters at recycling their rubbish.Researchers at Pompeii, the city buried under a thick carpet of volcanic ash when Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD, have found that huge mounds of refuse apparently dumped outside the city walls were in fact “staging grounds for cycles of use and reuse”.Professor Allison Emmerson, an American academic who is part of a large team working at Pompeii, said rubbish was piled up along almost the entire external wall on the city’s northern side, among other sites. Some of the mounds were several metres high and included bits of ceramic and plaster, which could be repurposed as construction materials.These mounds were previously thought to have been formed when an earthquake struck the city about 17 years before the volcano erupted, Emmerson said. Most were cleared in the mid-20th century, but some are still being discovered.Scientific analysis has now traced some of the refuse from city sites to suburban deposits equivalent to modern landfills, and back to the city, where the material was incorporated into buildings, such as earth floors.With fellow archaeologists Steven Ellis and Kevin Dicus, who worked on the University of Cincinnati’s excavations, Emmerson has studied how the ancient city was constructed. “We found that part of the city was built out of trash. The piles outside the walls weren’t material that’s been dumped to get rid of it. They’re outside the walls being collected and sorted to be resold inside the walls.”Pompeii was a city of elegant villas and handsome public buildings, open squares, artisan shops, taverns, brothels and bathhouses. It included an amphitheatre that hosted gladiatorial games for audiences of up to 20,000.When volcanic dust from Vesuvius “poured across the land” – as one witness wrote – enveloping the city in darkness, at least 2,000 people died. In 1748, a group of explorers discovered the almost perfectly preserved city under a hardened carpet of ash and pumice. Even a loaf of bread was found preserved by later archaeologists.Pompeii is now a Unesco world heritage site and – in normal times – attracts 2.5 million visitors each year.Emmerson and her colleagues used soil samples to trace the movement of rubish across the city. “The soil that we excavate differs based on where the garbage was left originally,” she said. “Garbage dumped in places like latrines or cesspits leaves behind a rich, organic soil. In contrast, waste that accumulated over time on the streets or in mounds outside the city results in a much sandier soil.“The difference in soil allows us to see whether the garbage had been generated in the place where it was found, or gathered from elsewhere to be reused and recycled.”Some walls, for example, included reused materials such as pieces of tile and broken amphorae, and lumps of mortar and plaster. “Almost all such walls received a final layer of plaster, hiding the mess of materials within,” she said.“The idea has been that all this garbage resulted from that earthquake – consisting of rubble that had been cleared out of the city and dumped outside the wall to remove it from daily life. As I was working outside Pompeii, I saw that the city extended into developed neighbourhoods outside the walls ... So it didn’t make sense to me that these suburbs were also being used as landfills.”Modern approaches to waste management focus on removing rubbish from our daily lives, she added. “For the most part, we don’t care what happens to our trash, as long as it’s taken away. What I’ve found in Pompeii is an entirely different priority, that waste was being collected and sorted for recycling.“The Pompeians lived much closer to their garbage than most of us would find acceptable, not because the city lacked infrastructure and they didn’t bother to manage trash but because their systems of urban management were organised around different principles.“This point has relevance for the modern garbage crisis. The countries that most effectively manage their waste have applied a version of the ancient model, prioritising commodification rather than simple removal.”Allison Emmerson, who teaches classical studies at Tulane University, New Orleans, is the author of Life and Death in the Roman Suburb to be published next month by Oxford University Press."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d5e3e989e93c19b7f48f03f255c29a0f27e6a53/0_36_1440_864/master/1440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26dfec83b1852fe57872f8f543800ef5","title":"show but dont tell why silent zooms are golden for focusing the mind","story":"As isolation stress sets in, many find that sharing quiet online spaces is the key to boosting brain powerThere are Zooms for pub quizzes, Zooms for dinner parties, Zooms for work meetings and now there is a Zoom for sitting together and not talking at all. Behold, the silent Zoom!On paper, the practice of logging on to a video-conferencing site to sit with strangers for an hour without communicating may hold limited appeal. In practice, silent Zooms have become a lifeline in lockdown for users trying to focus on writing, reading, meditation and more.Author Anne Penketh has been retreating to “a virtual monastic retreat” for an hour every day to work on her novel. Initially, she struggled to understand the concept: what would be the point of Zoom without conversation? Finding silence to write in was not a problem for her, so Penketh was sceptical about what would make silence so productive in a potentially awkward group setting. She became a convert from the very first session.Anecdotally, concentration seems more difficult to harness in corona times research shows that, during periods of stress, we see significant decline in our ability to hold information and focus. But having accountability partners is a proven way to boost success, be it in weight loss or curbing an alcohol addiction. The difference with silent Zooms is that the accountability partners are often strangers, and always silent.Penketh says: “As soon as I call up my Word document, it masks the other Zoomers, but I can look at them at any time, with their heads bowed over their laptops. Mercifully, there’s no sharing or reading aloud the results of our labour.”Silent Zooms have been booming with book-lovers for several weeks now: you join, say hello, mute yourself and get down to the business of quietly reading your books together, but alone.Njeri Damali Sojourner-Campbell, a Canadian YouTube bookworm, began hosting silent reading sessions on Zoom last month. She called the project Quarantined Pages and teamed up with six more BookTubers from the US, Trinidad, Nigeria and beyond, to make it a daily club they each host in turn.Sojourner-Campbell (@Onyxpages online) is a lawyer and self-confessed Afrofuturist literature nerd. The idea for Quarantined Pages came in response to the pandemic and her own inability to lose herself in books her attention  had fallen off a cliff. She knew she couldn’t be alone, and made a plan to support and encourage readers to get on the same page.“Reading has gotten many of us through some of the hardest and most uncertain times of our lives. This time will be no different,” she wrote. Now, once the trolls are booted out, up to 20 people regularly sign to join the group. Hosts, including Jessie (@Bowtiesandbooks) and Saajid (@Booksaremysociallife), are on hand to keep the session flowing. It’s a comforting support network, explains Sojourner-Campbell, particularly for those in isolation.Speaking to the Observer, she says: “After our silent reading hour is over, we check in with each other on how our reading is progressing. We share snapshots of each other’s lives.” The community behind the book club is a real motivator for her.“There is a simple pleasure in sitting down quietly and reading, knowing that a group of readers from around the world is doing exactly the same thing,” she says. “The simultaneity of it is magical and inspiring! And we need a little bit of that right now: magic and inspiration.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48d376ce594cecc23308ac1c63a80c2e66b77b6c/65_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90970b2887570c51898c3a4d481decb6","title":"tiktok house stars move in together","story":"Six of generation Z’s star performers are living under the the same roof to create content for their 15 million followersImagine a cross between Love Island and Big Brother and you would be part way to understanding the hype behind Britain’s first TikTok house.Launched online last week, Bytehouse has bundled six of the nation’s biggest TikTok stars to live together in a house in London where they are now creating and churning out viral content to a combined audience of 15 million followers. For context, Love Island peaked at six million viewers while Big Brother hit a high of eight million. Bytehouse videos can reach an astonishing 90 million views a week. Pranks, dancing and comedy skits – most lasting no longer than 15 seconds – are par for the course.The house features two couples and a pair of exes turned best friends. Monty Keates is the youngest at 17, while slow-motion specialist Jake Sweet (SurfaceLDN) is the oldest at 22. The concept has been masterminded by Fanbytes, a talent and production agency run by 25-year-old CEO Timothy Armoo.The blueprint for so-called content houses was established in the US. There, Bel Air mansions flooded with light, space and a collective of generation-Z stars provide an ideal backdrop to make collaborative and solo videos that go viral online. The setup in London is a touch less glamorous and a lot greyer in lockdown, but the ethos remains the same: create a mini content factory and watch viewing figures explode.A typical day in the Bytehouse will see the six wake up about 10am, then sketch out and film TikTok content until about 7pm before the house goes live to answer questions from fans. The most challenging aspect so far has been a “paralysis of creativity”. Armoo admits that when they’re together, each housemate can be prone to over-thinking and analysing what they did naturally before. “We have to remind them just to do what they’ve always done and not worry about numbers.”A manager from Fanbytes lives onsite to ensure the smooth running of the house.Armoo, a computer science graduate from Warwick who set up his first business online at 14, is in talks with production companies to potentially take the show on to TV. He declines to reveal the net worth of the Bytehouse collective and rejects the idea that the house could be exploitative. “This is something that each of them really wanted. It’s an opportunity for them, a stepping stone.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9268bbaf07368817b86df4c06e1ba2df4d045cd/1_0_2601_1562/master/2601..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e25184c2d9aaa983a5f5acd01cc4a4b8","title":"dont let a weak bladder stop you doing the things you love","story":"Avoiding playing vigorous sports? Sex life gone from G-spot to pee spot? The London Clinic’s Jane Simpson explains what we can do to tackle incontinence – including kegel exercises that you can do wherever you are As a continence nurse specialist, I’ve seen firsthand how overwhelming and upsetting incontinence can be. Patients visit me when things have gone too far – their behaviours change and they’re suddenly avoiding activities such as playing tennis, having sex or even going to the cinema because they’re worried about having to race to the toilet. When you start avoiding things you enjoy, it’s time to take action.Of course, leakage can be troubling at any moment, but during sex it’s particularly distressing (it tends to happen during an orgasm or because of the physical pressure). But the good news is, it doesn’t mean the end of your sex life. In fact, patients always say they wish they’d sought treatment sooner. Even if you don’t experience leakage, sexual sensation and satisfaction can be improved, too – and who wouldn’t want that? As well as increasing blood supply to the vagina and penis, pelvic floor muscle training (or “kegels”, as they’re also known), can improve muscle tone and maintain nerve activity, meaning better sex.When it comes to treatment for accidental leakage, it depends on the type of incontinence people are dealing with. “Stress incontinence” is when we suffer leakage while doing things such as sneezing, coughing or laughing, and it’s common for women to experience this after having a baby, when the pelvic floor is weakest. Leaking during sports or sex falls under this category, due to weakened pelvic floor muscles. The other common type is an overactive bladder, or “urge incontinence”, which feels like you have to urinate suddenly and often.Pelvic floor exercises can help in both instances, but it’s really important to make sure you’re doing them properly – speak to a women’s health physiotherapist or a continence specialist if unsure. They’re simple – just squeeze, lift and hold the anus and vagina, count to five and repeat five times. Improvement is fast – you’ll notice a change in six weeks if you do them regularly. There’s also a brilliant app called MyPFF, which reminds you to do your exercises.If an overactive bladder is the problem, lifestyle changes are key – symptoms can be worsened by too much caffeine, alcohol, fizzy drinks, spicy foods and stress, for example. Certain medications can also play a part, as well as conditions such as constipation, urinary tract infections and vaginal atrophy. Bladder retraining is great – when you have an urge to pee, you teach yourself to hang on, which slowly expands your bladder capacity. It might also be worth avoiding high-impact sports until your pelvic floor is stronger, since too much exercise can make things worse. Medication and surgery could be considered with a specialist, too.I definitely sense a change coming in the way we discuss women’s health issues and incontinence, and it’s great the conversation is becoming more open. There shouldn’t be any shame or stigma around it any more – this sort of condition affects so many of us. I hope people realise improvement is possible and that once the issue is tackled, it really can be life-changing. Recently, a woman visited me in my clinic and said that just having a treatment plan in place has made her feel better. It really is the very least we deserve.As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

It implies it’s a time of things “winding down”, “ending”, “drying up”.Well, most things. Because often, along with menopause, comes bladder weakness. And for many women that means that things get decidedly less dry.Unlike when a girl starts her period, which in many cultures is celebrated, and in the UK is now respected with a government campaign to provide sanitary products in schools, when a woman’s periods begin to end, it’s seen as a change towards old age, towards a body that’s “done”. And even for those going through menopause, it has often felt pretty taboo to talk about the daily problems – especially bladder weakness.“Don’t make me laugh, I’ll wet myself!” might seem like an age-old joke, but it’s one that’s true for menopausal women. And when it comes to our sex lives, it’s no laughing matter. There’s fear and shame and women shut down, choosing not to be intimate for fear of leaking urine during a passionate moment.After all, when do you slip “I’d love to have an early night but I’m worried I’ll wet the bed!” into the conversation, whether you’re with a long-term partner or someone new?The good news is this conversation is being reclaimed by women in the spotlight, who are starting to talk about the final menopause taboo of bladder weakness. Well, we talk so much about starting our periods – why would we not talk about stopping them, and how this affects your love life?It seems there has been a realisation that no matter whether you grace the red carpet and TV screens or you’re on the school run with grandchildren or off to the office, menopause will happen to every woman. Take Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, who released a video for her wellbeing site Goop, saying: “I think menopause gets a really bad rap, and needs a bit of rebranding.” Her video Madame Ovary spoke about mood swings and sweats, while British actress Emma Thompson has joked how hot sweats mean she’s not cold on the red carpet.OK, so the conversation is shifting – just like we can now see a tampon string in a TV ad (thanks to Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign), women are no longer sitting quietly while they deal with the side effects of menopause. But there is one subject that still has to work hard to find its way into our vocabulary – bladder weakness.We can talk hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings – all with increasing honesty. But then there’s Nadia Sawalha, who struggled with incontinence in silence. The usually outspoken TV presenter kept quiet about bladder weakness until she was forced to speak about it after having an accident on national TV.Why is it the one part of menopause women can’t talk about? Well, leaking during the day is one thing – the embarrassment of needing to find some alternative underwear, for example – but when it comes to sex, it’s a different matter altogether. Women who have bladder weakness and might have an accident during sex are likely to close off to their partner, so worried they’ll spoil the intimacy that they don’t have sex and even make up excuses, or “blame” menopause. Intimacy is not synonymous with leakage.After all, when you’re not sure whether you might lose control of your bladder, being intimate isn’t always top of the list. Talk about mixed messages! Women are encouraged to embrace their ageing, to love who they are and how they look – to go grey with glamour and grace, or to wear a bikini with pride. Just don’t mention the bladder weakness, right?!As periods end and change, we have to adjust. The problem is, the world doesn’t seem to adjust with us. And women are left in a strange quagmire of going through something so natural and even primal in silence and, often, shame.And with two-thirds of women over 40 affected with bladder weakness, and many revealing it has affected their mental health, it’s time we became more open and honest about how bladder weakness affects us.Meg Matthews, who has been campaigning about the menopause and runs megsmenopause, says: “Bladder weakness, also called bladder incontinence, is a very common consequence of menopause. It’s not easy to talk about this topic, and, because women don’t always feel confident talking about it, they can feel alone. We need to understand that having bladder weakness is OK. This is the message we need to spread.”But just like when we’re younger, confidence can come back when we use the right products. Once a girl knows she can use a tampon or pad, she’s less worried about her period affecting her day-to-day life. And for women with bladder issues, it’s about a pad that can help you forget there’s even a problem. Then you’ll feel freer to have those more difficult intimacy conversations that you’ve been putting off – and perhaps that early night …As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

The photographer, a Hungarian aristocrat who had given up a career as a diplomat to become a journalist, had based himself in the city after the war. Most often in this period – as a new book of his work, Paris, reveals – his camera dwelt on the lightness of the city as it reinvented itself: lovers dancing by the Seine, little visions of serendipitous comedy or grace in bars and cafes. The formal geometries of this photograph – which captures the Filles de la Charité of the order of St Vincent de Paul – is unusual in this work.Social distancing was, and is, a way of life for the nuns, popularly known as the “grey sisters”, who were required to take four annual vows of poverty, chastity and obedience in the service of the poor. The absence of shadow from the figures suggests that Almasy found his vantage to look into the courtyard at around noon, when the nuns were required to meditate and examine their consciences. The singular dress of the order, the white linen head-dress or cornette – prototype PPE – was established at the time of their foundation in the 17th century.In some ways, this photograph gave an indication of the future direction of Almasy’s work. Later that year, he became an official photographer for the United Nations, working in particular for the World Health Organization, for which over the following decades he produced hundreds of stories, capturing the success and failure of fighting disease across the globe. By the time of his death in 2003, aged 97, he had gathered an archive of 120,000 pictures, always using a diplomat’s discretion: “When I took photographs I never crouched down like a cat about to pounce on its prey,” he said. “I never attacked with my camera.” Paris by Paul Almasy is published in May (teNeues, £12.50)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8aa2d483b88d012cb741ec50b60ec8db989ca519/0_88_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa3ebad11486049f8f1f371b48bab5c5","title":"barefoot walking in canadian rockies banff national park","story":"On moving to the Canadian Rockies, the writer barely left home for fear of bears, but overcame it by feeling the Earth beneath her feetBefore I moved to Banff in 2014, I imagined life in the mountains of Banff national park would be idyllic. I’d work from home in the mornings and swim in icy lakes in the afternoons. Instead, I occupied the shadow side of mountain culture, one not portrayed in tourism brochures. What came next was internet addiction, isolation, social anxiety and insomnia, much of it fuelled by my crippling fear of bears.The one place where I felt safe to walk by myself was a small clearing in the woods on the edge of town. There were long sightlines between the conifers, so I could watch for approaching animals. Still, walking the same 500-metre route between a train track and a small cluster of hotels soon gets old. To mix things up – and because a glamorous early aviator named Beryl Markham used to do it – I began going barefoot.Of course, I felt like an idiot doing this. But I was far from bored. Not now I had to pay attention to rocks and roots. Now I could recognise the small joy of finding a dandelion stalk caught between the toes. It’s true I was missing out on epic things: on mountain climbs and swims. But as spring turned to summer, here were trees seeding clouds, a twig like a chicken foot, and birds singing “chubby cheeks” and “cheeseburger” as they flew away, startled. Here was more than enough.My fear of bear attacks has now faded, but I’ve continued with these barefoot walks, because now I think the joy of gripping rock and feeling sensation exists not just for skilled climbers picking their way through ice to a snowy summit. A softer version can occur while walking under a cleared line of pylons, on a short and familiar walk without needing to hit our body’s maximum rate of oxygen use during exercise, or VO2 max.If you read the hippie articles online, you’ll read that going barefoot is called “earthing” or “grounding.” You’ll read that negative ions from the Earth’s surface spill into a person’s feet as they come into contact with the ground’s electrical charge. These ions, apparently, can charge a person up like a depleted iPad. They can make a person feel happier, calmer, less anxious.Maybe this is true. But maybe scrambling at ground level, touching rocks and roots, just feels good. And we need all the help we can get to feel good right now.Ailsa Ross is the author of the illustrated children’s book The Woman Who Rode a Shark: And 50 More Wild Female Adventurers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e51a80b76ae03ada5291ed2128bc4e7b50b67f38/0_138_4285_2570/master/4285.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=bc909d95a1f00db70cc3cb58ae4219c7","title":"government state role pandemic coronavirus","story":"The state has been in retreat since the 80s heyday of Reagan and Thatcher but that could change as coronavirus delivers a shock to the system of historic proportionsRonald Reagan’s 1986 wisecrack – “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I’m from the government and I’m here to help” – would not get a lot of laughs today. In much of the world, people are desperate for the government to show up and rise to the challenge of the coronavirus pandemic.Reagan’s attitude to government solidified into orthodoxy for more than three decades, spreading abroad – particularly in the UK with the help of Margaret Thatcher – and captured the centre ground of politics in both countries.The antipathy to the state was selective: Reagan, like Donald Trump today, racked up huge deficits, spent heavily on defence and built up a system of corporate welfare through subsidies and tax breaks. But on both sides of the Atlantic, the prevailing wisdom was the state should wherever possible get out of the business of trying to control inequality and provide services to the less fortunate.There are already some signs that the Covid-19 shock may challenge those attitudes. Disease and mass unemployment have always been far better recruiting sergeants for the cause of big government than any party manifesto – and this crisis is unlikely to be an exception.Some social scientists and historians argue that this pandemic could become a turning point in social history – on a par with the New Deal in the US or the post-war Labour government in the UK.“We’ve been on this kind of trajectory for last 30-odd years where the inidual was taking priority over the collective. And now we’re actually back into the kind of spirit that our parents and grandparents lived through in which communities have to pull together,” Fiona Hill, a British-born historian who served on Trump’s national security council.Hill pointed to the UK, where 750,000 people signed up as volunteers for the National Health Service (NHS) and a wave of climate activism on both sides of the Atlantic.“I do think there is a huge appetite among younger people, trying to get more government action. I really do think we could start to see the tide turning here.”Some of the biggest swings in public opinion have been in countries where the state’s role in social welfare has been in most rapid retreat.The US and the UK stand out because the pandemic struck as their governments were seeking to roll back longstanding social welfare systems and are now scrambling to reassemble temporary versions of them on the run.What is not clear yet is whether these stopgap measures will evaporate as soon as Covid-19 is sufficiently contained for people to go back to work – or whether some of them will stick.The coronavirus pandemic could also boost statism of another kind – more Big Brother than Great Society – by providing cover for governments to restrict civil liberties and entrench themselves in power, as Viktor Orbán has done in Hungary. There are few signs yet that China’s leaders will be held accountable for their failure to contain the outbreak at its source, and their response to criticism has been further suppression of dissent and science.The outbreak has created a surge in digital monitoring of populations that many civil libertarians fear will harden afterwards into a permanently raised level of surveillance.The accretion of state power could accompany wider provision of public services, or take precedence over them. The less a government does for its people, the more it has to control them.In the US, the Trump administration is likely to face resistance if it seeks to withdraw forms of social support that have long been standard in most western democracies.“The whole pandemic, I think, has laid bare all of the inadequacies of the US social safety net,” John Schmitt, the vice-president of the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, said. “A very basic thing every other advanced economy in the world guarantees workers is at least a minimum amount of paid sick days. The US does not have at the national level any laws like that.“It’s hard for me to imagine that there won’t be significant support when the dust settles for state, local and federal legislation to address that incredibly longstanding policy failure,” he said.There are two other areas where Schmitt predicted there would be strong demand for lasting change. One is unemployment insurance, currently a meagre patchwork of different state systems subject to minimum national standards.The other is the healthcare system. As a far broader cross-section of Americans face medical bankruptcy because they have partial or no health insurance, it will be harder for Trump to pursue his effort to obliterate the Obama administration’s Affordable Care Act, which extended the scope of health insurance coverage, and could provide support for a more ambitious expansion of government-funded healthcare.For parallel reasons, it will be even harder politically for Boris Johnson to bargain away the fundamentals of the NHS at trade talks with Washington, after it saved his life.It is too early to predict how the coronavirus shock will affect the outcome of this year’s US elections. All other things being equal, greater popularity for a government-funded social safety net should translate into more votes for Democrats, who have traditionally championed such policies. But Trump will seek to take that ground, insisting, for example, that his name is on the $600 cheques the federal government is sending out each week to supplement unemployment benefit.And the elections could be as much about cultural and political loyalties as social policy.Arlie Hochschild, a sociologist who has written extensively about the American right, said she had been watching responses to the crisis in Kentucky.“Trump supporters are generally older people in poor health, and if they’re blue-collar, they’re actually less likely to have work that they can do from home,” Hochschild said. “What’s happened in this short period of time has challenged so much of what they believe in.”Despite that, she said, the crisis seemed to have had little effect on political identification and affiliation. “There is no immediate turnaround in attitude. I think they’re going to vote for Trump, pretty much at the same rate as they did in ’16.”If Trump is re-elected, few believe there will be much lasting change to the role of the state. His instincts have been to seek to hand leadership during the crisis to the CEOs of big corporations, lining them up in the Rose Garden when he declared a national emergency on 13 March. Opinions differ on whether a Democratic administration under Joe Biden would be a force for transformational change.‘You’re seeing a closer alliance between the left and the centre of the Democratic party” Theda Skocpol, a sociology professor at Harvard University, said. If Democrats also capture the Senate, she added: “I think it sets the stage for for a real change in direction – the first important one since Reagan.”Dean Baker, co-founder of the Centre for Economic and Policy Research in Washington – and one of the first economists to identify the US housing bubble that created the conditions for the global financial meltdown in 2008 – argues that that crisis demonstrated how impervious the economic system was to shocks, no matter who is in government.“The thought that we had this horrible experience and now everyone’s going to learn from it: it wasn’t true really in ’08-’09, and I don’t have a lot of confidence it’ll be true this time,” Baker said.Much may depend on the depth and duration of the coronavirus shock. A V-shaped, rapid bounceback is looking less likely with every passing week, and a gradual U-shaped recovery or even an extended depression become real possibilities. In such circumstances, formerly unthinkable solutions become more palatable.“People use the analogy of the financial crisis but I think it’s the wrong one. War is a much better one because it is both a supply and a demand shock,” said Branko Milanovic, an economist at the City University of New York, adding that a prolonged economic downturn would lead to “a reassessment of the role of the state”.Milanovic cautioned, however, that it was also quite possible that a groundswell of support for a universal healthcare system and a much more robust social safety net might not be reflected in the US political system. He said: “What we would actually face in the US is an ever-increasing discrepancy between the demand for change, and the total absence of change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c893a4163c53847ad9362754d38133804fac7777/0_72_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93ff1392808cb71f7d26e4383ea75b89","title":"tell us what are your experiences of private covid 19 testing centres coronavirus","story":"If you’ve used a private coronavirus testing centre, we’d like to find out what the service was like.

But is evidence-based reality going to make a comeback?The most prominent American anti-vaxxer, Robert Kennedy Jr, meanwhile, amplified an unhinged conspiracy that believes Bill Gates is using the virus as part of a supposed plot to control the world’s population through immunisation.All pandemics trail a ready market in superstition, quackery and prejudice – a sense of powerlessness generates in some the need for catch-all theories, however deranged. At the time of the great plague in London, the spread of miracle cures and scapegoating prophecy was almost harder to contain than the infection itself. As part of its strategy the government was moved, Daniel Defoe reported in his A Journal of the Plague Year, to “suppress the printing of such Books and Pamphlets as terrify the People”. The efforts to prevent the spread of damaging conspiracies across our own media have shared a similar profile – and often a similar success rate – to the efforts to curb the disease.In this respect, the pandemic is something of a test case for the social media monopolies of Silicon Valley to deliver on their widely trumpeted commitment to slow the spread of dangerously false information. After being confronted with the evidence of manipulation in the elections of 2016, and the spread of such vile conspiracies as that which argued that the Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax, Facebook and Google and the rest have been forced to step up efforts to monitor and block extreme misinformation campaigns on their various platforms. Arguably, that effort is finally starting to show some effect.Counterintuitively, some evidence for that might be found in the response to the most pernicious of the current conspiracies which has, entirely without scientific foundation, sought to link the spread of coronavirus with the rollout of the 5G data network. The real-world effects have been the acts of vandalism and arson against mobile phone masts in the past weeks. Up to 50 such attacks have been reported, mostly on Merseyside and in the West Midlands, including the burning of the 5G mast adjacent to the new Nightingale hospital outside Birmingham. Thinking about contagious ideas now, I recall interviewing Daniel Dennett, the philosopher of evolution, back in 2006, just before the launch of Twitter. Dennett was talking excitedly of a word that he and Richard Dawkins had coined to describe how Darwinist idea-germs could be sent into battle against the politicised viruses of creationism. He called these idea-germs “memes”. Nah, I thought at the time it will never catch on.In the 14 years since, it has become second nature to trace the originators of particularly incendiary memes. A story in Wired magazine located the origin of the 5G conspiracy in an interview of 22 January in a Belgian newspaper with Kris Van Kerckhoven, a general practitioner from Putte, near Antwerp. He was quoted as saying that “5G is life-threatening”, but then added a speculative comment (“I have not done a fact-check”) that linked that falsehood to the virus then confined to China. The “link” became an ill-advised clickbait headline. (The piece, in Het Laatste Nieuws, was subsequently withdrawn.)If these words marked the moment when the 5G conspiracy established its RNA, however, the “wet market” for those ideas to jump species and spread human to human was a conference given on 11 March at the Health and Human Rights Summit, in Tucson, Arizona. The headline act was the original anti-vaxxer Andrew Wakefield, the discredited English doctor, who was struck off by the GMC after being shown to have deliberately falsified evidence to make bogus claims of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Wakefield was in this case upstaged by a Californian, Thomas Cowan, author of Cancer and the New Biology of Water, who is serving a five-year suspension from medical practice for prescribing unlicensed drugs to cancer patients. Cowan claimed, entirely falsely, that Covid-19 was caused by electromagnetic waves and, also incorrectly, that Wuhan, where it originated, had been the guinea-pig city for 5G.Videos of this talk were viewed 1.8 million times on YouTube and widely shared on Facebook before the sites moved to take the posts down.In their book A Lot of People Are Saying, their study of conspiracism in the Trump era, Russell Muirhead and Nancy Rosenblum classify people such as Cowan as “conspiracy entrepreneurs”. Once he had seeded his conspiracy virus, multiple other wilder mutations followed, some linking it to an Illuminati plot, others to the “blood sacrifice” of Kobe Bryant in a helicopter crash.In Britain, some of those contagious fantasies found a population in which they could move as easily as coronavirus among Cheltenham Festival racegoers. Their combination with media attention around the decision to allow Huawei to supply some of the UK’s 5G infrastructure, and the fact that telecoms engineers were designated key workers, appears to have ignited dangerous lockdown fears. Challenges were laid down in Facebook groups and Reddit threads for “firestarters” to “take the 5G out”.Social media platforms, fearing sanction, took long overdue action. Facebook has accepted a responsibility to remove false claims that 5G technology causes Covid-19, while promising a modification that will direct people who look for such content toward accurate information from the NHS and the WHO.Some of the belated efforts to police “alt-right” conspiracy content in the past couple of years are also helping to contain the spread of the madness. There has been no more virulent “conspiracy entrepreneur” than Alex Jones and his web channel, InfoWars. Jones has predictably loud-hailered the 5G and anti-vaxx lines: “This is the plan, folks,” he grunted at his viewers. “They plan – if they’ve fluoridated you and vaccinated you and stunned you and mesmerized you with the TV and put you in a trance – on killing you.” Meanwhile, “they” were determined “to make sure you don’t learn about the known antivirals”. Prominent among these, apparently, were Jones’s own “wellness” products: SuperSilver Whitening Toothpaste and ABL Nano Silver Gargle which, he claimed, “kills the sars-corona family at point-blank range”. (The only scientifically proven effect of the active ingredient in these products, colloidal silver, is that it turns your skin blue.)Up until last year Jones’s vicious untruths would have been spread by millions of followers on YouTube and Facebook and Twitter. However, with trials pending involving the bereaved Sandy Hook parents he repeatedly called “actors”, his platforms were finally shut down for “hate speech”.Having curtailed some of the spread of the most noxious threads, social media platforms apparently hope to rely, at least a little, on herd immunity to contain the conspiracy. When celebrity “super-spreaders” of the 5G claims have emerged in recent weeks – including the actor Woody Harrelson, the boxer Amir Khan and the breakfast show host Eamonn Holmes – they have the experienced the chill of immediate social media isolation and distancing.It is still early days in this ongoing battle between fact and fantasy, but perhaps the general global compliance with lockdown measures, and the increasing appetite for verifiable facts and figures, indicates that rational voices might yet be in the ascendancy.Even those on the frontline of protest against distancing measures in the southern American states have looked conspicuously conflicted. Several have marched under “coronahoax” banners while wearing face masks, hedging bets. Perhaps they have listened to the snake-oil “hunches” and tantrums of their president while the bodies pile up, and wondered. Perhaps they fear, privately, the tragic irony in the story of John McDaniel, 60, of Ohio, who spent March posting conspiracy – “Does Anybody Have The Guts to Say This Covid-19 is a Political Ploy? Asking For A Friend. Prove Me Wrong” – before, last week, becoming the first person in his county to die from the disease.History shows that pandemics change things in surprising ways. Much has been made of the superstition that has attended other epidemics, but they have also generated great advances in public health, including vaccination even the wildest conspiracy entrepreneur probably knows deep down that the only way out of the current tragedy is careful application of the scientific method.In the past few weeks we have been exposed to a reality that all human generations before ours – and many millions in our own times in less advantaged parts of the planet – have known as a fact of life: that we exist in a precarious world of rapidly transmitted infectious diseases without an obvious cure. Though the sight of mass graves being dug and economies floundering has caused some to double-down on their pet grievances, to set fire to phone masts and indulge their fantasies about the Illuminati, it may yet cause more to think about getting back in touch with reality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59af64897155bda0c0453fe83df3e7c8d97483ed/0_0_3415_2050/master/3415.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c207e31cdfbe7d6f28b0b1021d052112","title":"attendees of sage coronavirus meetings worried by presence of dominic cummings","story":"Scientists on UK government’s coronavirus advisory group say Dominic Cummings was an active participantThe involvement of the prime minister’s chief political adviser, Dominic Cummings, in meetings of the scientific group advising the UK government’s response to the coronavirus has left other attendees shocked, concerned and worried for the impartiality of advice, the  can reveal.One attendee of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said they felt Cummings’ interventions had sometimes inappropriately influenced what is supposed to be an impartial scientific process.A second Sage attendee said they were shocked when Cummings first began participating in Sage discussions, in February, because they believed the group should be providing “unadulterated scientific data” without any political input.’s revelation on Friday that Sage attendees have included Cummings and Ben Warner, who worked together on the Vote Leave campaign for Brexit, caused a storm of controversy over the weekend.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.Downing Street is insisting there is nothing untoward about the pair’s attendance at Sage meetings, saying they are largely taking part as silent observers.“I have been concerned sometimes that Sage has become too operational, so we’ve ended up looking as though we are making decisions,” one of them said, making clear that Cummings had been involved on those occasions. “It contravenes previous guidelines about how you make sure you get impartial scientific advice going through to politicians, who make the decisions.”Referring to both Cummings and Warner, the Sage attendee added: “When a very senior civil servant or a very well-connected person interrupts, then I don’t think anyone in the room feels the power to stop it. When you get to discussing where advice might be going, there have been occasions where they have been involved, and a couple of times I’ve thought: that’s not what we are supposed to be doing.”A second Sage attendee said Cummings had played an active role meetings from February onwards. They said they were initially shocked to discover Cummings was taking part in a meeting of supposedly independent scientific experts.“He was not just an observer, he’s listed as an active participant,” the source said. “He was engaging in conversation and not sitting silently.” The second attendee said Cumming’s involvement was worrying because of his reputation in Whitehall and the questions his participation raises about Sage’s role as a neutral body of expert advisers.The reaction from the two Sage attendees contrasts with that of Prof Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College epidemiologist whose models have played a guiding role in the government’s response to Covid-19. He appeared unconcerned when asked, in a video interview, about Cummings attending Sage meetings. “There have been a number of observers at those meetings, who have not interfered with business at all,” he replied.Sage membership is not fixed, but changes according to the nature of the crisis being faced. Independent scientific experts on the group are supposed to assess evidence impartially and pass their advice to Cobra, the civil contingencies committee convened in the Cabinet Office.The advisory group is chaired by the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, who also decides which experts take part. Asked whether Vallance had also given his approval to Cummings and Warner coming to his meetings, a government spokesperson said Vallance “would not have to sign off” observers or representatives from government departments.The chief medical officers and chief scientific advisers from the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are classified as observers on Sage. However, unlike Cummings and Warner, they are unable to ask questions unless they are submitted in writing in advance.George Eustice, the environment secretary, was asked about the makeup of Sage during Sunday’s Downing Street press conference.He said it was “convened in response to specific emergencies, and the scientists that go on to that group will change, depending on the type of emergency.” He said minutes of its deliberations would eventually be published.Stephen Powis, the national medical director for England, appearing alongside Eustice, said he would have “no problem” with the names of those who attend being made public, provided their personal permission had been sought. Chief medical officer Chris Whitty has previously said the same thing.On Saturday, Labour urged the government to ban political advisers from attending Sage. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said there were significant questions for the government to answer over the credibility of its decision-making and how non-scientists have influenced policy.He said Cummings was “a political adviser, not a medical or scientific expert. If the public are to have confidence in Sage, the government must make clear Dominic Cummings can no longer participate or attend.”The Conservative former Brexit secretary, David Davis, also criticised the attendance of Cummings and Warner at the Sage meetings. “The whole point of having Sage is you’re getting scientific advice based on the data, based on the best theories, and the best models we have at the time,” he told Sky News. “You don’t want any outside influences, either direct or indirect, either deliberate or accidental.”However the former Conservative chancellor, Sajid Javid, argued it would be “worrying” if Cummings was not present at the Sage’s Covid-19 meetings, and criticised the ’s reporting. “Media have a hugely important role in holding government to account, but some are courting public mistrust with non-stories,” Javid tweeted. “Time to act more responsibly.”The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said the government does not release the membership of the Sage committee because of the risk of pressure on members: “Sage do release their advice subsequently, normally a couple of weeks down the track, so it is properly tested carefully before being put out. We don’t release, as a matter of practice, the names of all the members of Sage because the risk of them being subject to pressure, undue influence.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f99db55c4b8ef9922ec5aeb0e1c66e2c96aaf137/0_156_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f34e552678ec90728eb8a256b33be36e","title":"church of england launches free daily hope prayer hotline","story":"Service offering hymns and advice is aimed at worshippers with no access to internetThe archbishop of Canterbury has launched a 24-hour free phone line for Christian worship and prayer, aimed at those who have no or limited access to the internet.Justin Welby said Daily Hope, available from Sunday, would bring worship and prayer into people’s homes while church buildings are closed because of the coronavirus.“With many in our country on lockdown, it’s important that we support those who are feeling lonely and isolated, whatever age they are,” he said. “The Daily Hope service will allow people to hear hymns, prayers and words that offer comfort and hope, especially in this Easter season.”People calling the 0800 number will hear a greeting from the archbishop and can then choose from a range of options including hymns, prayers, reflections and advice on Covid-19.Carl Knightly, the chief executive of Faith in Later Life, an organisation serving older Christians, said: “We know as an organisation of the challenges for older people in our society in normal times and these are not those, so I want to … get people sharing this number with whoever they know who would most benefit.”Church leaders have reported much higher numbers of people accessing online services and prayer than attend church in normal times.

It advised having hand gel in all school lavatories, classrooms and entrances, with classrooms, canteens and common areas, particularly staircases and door handles, disinfected several times a day. The academy also advised that pupils should have their temperature taken before entering the school.Those living in cities who use public transport to reach work and schools are also worried about how social distancing measures will be maintained if they are expected back at their jobs.The note suggested there may be enough masks by 18 May, one week after the end of lockdown begins.Frédéric Dabi, Ifop’s director, said Macron’s national address on 13 April had brought a boost in popularity but since then “concern about the return to school and the summer holidays have worsened”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f6986018c5aa68d4124868f9d52492a17b13fef/0_232_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b622aef06d82b1000a35249cc0f6f036","title":"greece preparing new tourism rules in wake of coronavirus","story":"Packed pools, beaches and tour buses will not return immediately as country plans for scaled back 2020 seasonPacked pools, beaches and tour buses, as well as middle seats on planes, hotel minibars and scrums at airport check-ins, may all be a thing of the past as Europe’s tourism industry attempts to reimagine the holiday in the wake of the coronavirus.Travel will take place only under “specific new rules”, Greece’s tourism minister has said as he prepares to propose ways of salvaging the sector with his EU counterparts in the era of Covid-19 on Monday.“If we are to think of the possibility of travelling this year it has to be under specific new rules,” says Harry Theoharis, the country’s tourism minister , whose economy is especially dependent on the sector. “We have to have new rules for hotels, new rules for beaches, new rules for pools, new rules for breakfast buffets, new rules for tour buses.”How the regulations will work, and what they will look like, in Europe at least, will be the focus of talks between EU tourism ministers tomorrow. Health and safety measures, including Covid-19 immunity certificates, will be high on the agenda. The possibility of passengers being subject to temperature checks and pre-flight blood tests is also likely to be raised.Theoharis, who assumed the post last July when the centre-right government was catapulted into office, predicts the country could have “less than a third” of the tourists it hosted last year.In 2019, Greece attracted a record 33 million arrivals, more than three times its total population, and double the number it lured a decade ago. The boom brought in an unprecedented €18.2bn – revenue that played a crucial role in reviving an economy thrown into depression by a near-decade long public debt crisis that cut output by a quarter.But, like Theoharis, she is also persuaded that Athens’ handling of the pandemic will reap rewards.In contrast to other European countries, Greece, which is poised to ease lockdown measures with the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, addressing the nation on Monday, applied tough restrictions to contain coronavirus early on.“When health and security are so important for travellers worldwide, the way the government has managed to keep the numbers down does, I think, give us a competitive edge,” said Tetradis. “It’s going to be complicated especially for bigger hotels. There are so many questions, like how many people can you have in a pool, are buffets out and what if someone falls sick? But there is also a sense of safety regarding coronavirus that we can project too.”With 2,506 confirmed cases of the disease and a death toll of 130, Greece has to date fared far better on the Covid-19 battlefront than expected.Turkey to its east and Italy to its west have suffered hugely, by Sunday registering mortality rates of 2,706 and 26,386 respectively.Reimagining travel will be as paramount to tourism’s survival as the precautions needed to prevent possible infections, say officials. After the 911  terror attacks in 2001 the sector took three years to recover but rose dramatically when it rebounded.Theoharis acknowledges that the future is fraught with uncertainly. Already, fears abound of a second wave of the epidemic later this year and, ultimately, much will depend on the discovery of a vaccine.But if the warm weather brings a reprieve, as epidemiologists hope, Greece, he says, could open to holidaymakers in July – later than usual but in time for the peak summer months when most revenue is made.Selective tourism is not ruled out: traditional markets in the UK, Germany and France, may be replaced by tourists from eastern and central Europe used to accessing the country by car if air links continue to be suspended."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/256f1405fc26ff0c2cd90ca9a80e8a14726705aa/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=410e48da0bbea0ad1f49d840c89e746b","title":"hungary prepares to end legal recognition of trans people","story":"Trans people fear more discrimination as Orbán pushes through law defining gender based on ‘sex at birth’Hungary’s rightwing government looks likely to push through legislation that will end the legal recognition of trans people by defining gender as “biological sex based on primary sex characteristics and chromosomes” and thus making it impossible for people to legally change their gender.Trans people and rights activists say the law, which has been introduced into parliament as attention is focused on the coronavirus pandemic, will increase discrimination and intolerance towards trans people. Many will try to leave the country, while those who do not have that chance will face daily humiliations.“In Hungary, you need to show your ID to rent a bike, buy a bus pass or to pick up a package at the post office. It basically means coming out as trans to complete strangers, all the time. The good version is they are nice about it, but there are situations where people turn quite hostile,” said Ivett Ördög, a 39-year-old trans woman living in Budapest.Hungary’s anti-immigration prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has prompted a wave of international criticism during the coronavirus pandemic by adopting legislation that allows him to rule by decree indefinitely. Parliament is still sitting, but instead of focusing on fighting coronavirus, it is dealing with issues such as the new trans legislation.Bernadett Szél, an independent MP who has opposed the law in parliament’s judicial committee, described it as “evil” and “a step back in time”. During a hearing in the committee, she tried to read out a letter from trans people explaining how harmful the law would be for them, but was shut down by the committee’s chair, who described the letter as “not relevant”.Szél also criticised the timing of the bill. “We have a pandemic going on and all of us should be focusing on two things: healthcare issues and helping people financially to secure their wellbeing. What is happening in Hungary is a scandal,” she said. It is not clear when the bill will be put to a vote, but observers say its passage through committees suggests the government is pushing ahead with it.The law also opens up the possibility that it could target people who have already made a legal change and now live with a gender that does not match their “sex at birth”, the planned new gender category on official documents.“We think it’s likely that they don’t plan to go after people who already changed, but we just don’t know,” said Tamás Dombos, a board member of the Háttér Society, a Hungarian organisation focused on LGBTQI rights.Legal experts say the new law will be in violation of European human rights case law, leaving it open to challenge in both the Hungarian supreme court and the European court of human rights (ECHR).“There’s very clear case law on this in the ECHR, so it’s very likely it will be challenged soon after it’s implemented. But the court takes years, and the decisions are always inidual. People will probably get compensation but it won’t mean they get new documents,” said Dombos.Until 2016, the procedure for legally changing gender in Hungary was fairly straightforward, said Dombos, but for the past three years, authorities have been reluctant to implement the law, meaning there is a backlog of people waiting for decisions on their applications for gender changes. “My request has been sitting there for a year, and this new law will mean it will be fully rejected,” said Ördög.Orbán’s government has become more hostile towards the LGBTQ+ community in the past two years, moving from generic language about traditional values and the benefits of heterosexual marriage to openly discriminatory language, such as comparing homosexuality to paedophilia.“This kind of language was not present before, and now it is no longer just discourse, it’s going to become policy,” said Dombos.Although it will still be possible for people to change their names, in Hungary there is an official register of allowed names compiled by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and this list is gendered. There are no names approved for both genders. “I cannot change my legal name to anything that doesn’t give me away as a trans person,” said Ördög.Even without the new law, life for trans people in Hungary is filled with obstacles. Amanda Malovics, a 30-year-old trans woman, left Hungary in 2015 for London, with one suitcase and enough money to last a month, she said, as she felt uncomfortable starting her transition in Hungary.In Britain she has changed her name by deed poll, which means that bank accounts, bills and the rest of her life in London can be conducted under her new name. As soon as she needs to travel, however, she is faced with using her Hungarian passport with her old name and gender. She applied to change her gender in Hungary last year but, like others, has had the application stalled.“I live and breathe as a woman, I look like a woman, I am present in myself as a woman and I identify as a woman, but my ID says otherwise. I absolutely hate travelling, because of this. There’s massive fear and anxiety every time,” she said.Now, she says, she is waiting until she qualifies for UK citizenship to receive a passport in her new name, and at that point will consider making the difficult decision to revoke her Hungarian citizenship. She believes many other Hungarian trans people will also leave.“It’s pointless for me to belong somewhere where I’m not wanted or welcome,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7694dd29489c925e09005f0c295cacbe079ffeb/0_112_2786_1671/master/2786.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf1a217b979a2f437a4b488bc2d83f9f","title":"test test test can britain find a way out of lockdown","story":"As deaths pass 20,000, testing and tracing are finally back at the heart of government policy – but it’s taken too long and has been poorly planned. A series of delays and U-turns cost time – and the country could pay a price for months to come The pay-and-display sign still marks the entrance to the Milton Keynes coronavirus testing hub – a cluster of tents in a car park across from a shuttered Toys R Us shop – that is the heart of the UK’s drive to contain and control the disease.On Friday afternoon a queue of about 20 cars had formed up on the road outside, carrying key workers from schools, hospitals and care homes.Men in high-vis jackets working for the accountancy giant Deloitte, which runs the centre, patrolled the street and tried to clear it of anyone not coming to be tested, even though they admitted they had no legal authority to do so.Those who had arrived had been given the postcode to put into their satnavs but there were almost no signposts to the hub on nearby ring roads or streets, perhaps to keep it a secret from curious locals or passersby.Less than 24 hours earlier, the health secretary, Matt Hancock – desperate to “ramp up” testing (and then contact tracing) in the hope of getting somewhere near his target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April – had announced that all key workers with symptoms could apply to be checked for coronavirus.Huge pent-up demand from people would defeat the system within hours of it going live. On Friday morning the testing website could not cope and it told applicants that there were no more tests available, an administrative hitch for which the government swiftly apologised.Those in the queue on the outskirts of Milton Keynes had, however, logged on before the crash. Several told the Observer they wanted tests as much for their patients, or the people they worked and lived with, as for themselves. Many had signed up in the small hours, including a school key worker who had gone online at 2am to register.“I work around Covid patients, although we wear full PPE,” said one nurse who asked not to be named. “This is the first opportunity we’ve had to get tested. It’s for my patients as well as myself, so I don’t risk infecting them.” She had travelled with her sister who works in care, and her parents who are isolating with them. Their father’s diabetes makes him a high risk if he contracts Covid-19.Once inside the car park the symptom carriers were directed into one of five bays, and greeted by a worker in full protective equipment, holding up a mobile phone number to ring from inside the car. The person on the phone explained how to take the test, and then provided a kit.“You had to get a swab and rub it along the back of your throat and tonsils, and then use the same swab up your nose,” said Charlie Dawkins, a pre-school worker who signed up for a test after coming down with a fever and sore chest. “I’m quite glad we got to do it ourselves, I feel that if someone else did it I would have been sick. We had to keep stopping.”Dawkins had driven for around half an hour with her mother, a key worker in a school who received an email saying she was eligible for tests the previous day. She too registered in the middle of the night.Dawkins said she found the experience as smooth as testing for a terrifying disease could be ever be. “The people were really nice, everyone was so friendly.” She has been told to expect results by text or email within 48 hours, linked to a QR code she was given on registration, and scanned when collecting the test kits.Across the country key workers and their families and friends, some who had worried about their exposure and health for weeks, were going through this extraordinary, novel and anxiety-inducing procedure.Nic Mitchell, a property and financial services adviser, began developing symptoms a few days ago, which forced her partner, the head engineer at a food processing factory, to go into isolation with her. She has a complex underlying medical condition. “A test would help me manage my other underlying conditions better,” she said. “The symptoms may be related to something else – this would help me rule it in or rule it out.” Mitchell’s partner is considered to be an essential worker, so they managed to book a test online.The nearest centre for her was in Worcester, 22 miles from her home in Cheltenham. Before attending, she said it would be “very scary” because she hadn’t left the house since 4 January when she got back from holiday incredibly ill. “Actually, going into the outside world is something that gives me a high level of anxiety, so going 22 miles makes it worse,” she added.When Mitchell arrived at the testing site at Worcester Warriors rugby club just before 3pm on Saturday, she was told that there would be a two and a half hour wait – but the centre would shut at 5pm regardless. The only option was to attempt to rebook. “They told me they couldn’t cope,” she said. “It was very disappointing.”The tents of the Milton Keynes test centre are visible from nearby roads, normally busy with shoppers and office workers, and now emptied by coronavirus. The silent streets, with the test queue the only sign of life, were a reminder of the abrupt distortion of normality.The UK government has expanded the criteria for who qualifies for a free test for coronavirus to all essential workers and their families in England – up to 10 million people. The list of essential workers is the same as the one used to allow the children of key workers to carry on going to school during the lockdown:Health and social careFrontline health and social care staff such as doctors, nurses, midwives, paramedics, as well as support and specialist staff in the health and social care sector. In addition it includes those working in supply chains including producers and distributors of medicines and personal protective equipment.Education and childcareNursery, teaching staff and social workers.Key public servicesThose required to run the justice system, religious staff, as well as those responsible for managing the deceased, and journalists providing public service broadcasting.Local and national governmentAdministrative occupations essential to the effective delivery of the Covid-19 response or delivering essential public services.Food and other necessary goodsThose involved in the production, processing, distribution, sale and delivery of food.Public safety and national securityPolice, support staff, Ministry of Defence civilian staff and armed forces personnel, fire and rescue staff, and those responsible for border security, prisons and probation.TransportThose who will keep air, water, road and rail passenger and freight transport modes operating.Utilities, communication and financial servicesStaff required to keep oil, gas, electricity, water and sewerage operations running. Staff in the civil nuclear, chemical and telecommunications sectors. Those in postal services and those working to provide essential financial services.The swabs are not tested on site, because they need sophisticated laboratory processing. Milton Keynes has one of the biggest labs in the country, based at the UK Biocentre, just a few miles from the car park test centre, which handles swabs sent from at least 20 testing centres across the country.The labs are largely manned by scientists who volunteered to step away from their usual research to carry out testing, which is labour-intensive work.At Milton Keynes, the scientists operate in pairs working 12-hour shifts, and together can handle around 400 to 500 swabs a day. The lab’s daily capacity, at full stretch, is around 8,000 tests.Inside the lab there are three work stations, the first of which is protected by a biosecurity hood, where samples are treated with a solution to kill everything inside. In the second, the virus’s genetic material (or the material of anything picked up by the sample) is extracted. In the third, that genetic material is put through a machine that multiplies it, so that there is enough for the test to detect, then checked for coronavirus. The biggest challenge, experts say, is not the science but the logistics of getting the tests in, then scaling up and bringing in robots.The Milton Keynes lab is part of a centralised approach to testing in the UK that has puzzled many scientists and may have been a key contributor to the slowincrease of testing capacity.Other countries that have rolled out more rapid testing programmes have relied at least in part on letting existing labs become testing centres with their own teams and equipment, who are able to start testing almost immediately on site.In the UK, by contrast, authorities have chosen to bring equipment and scientists together in government-established centres, which are slower to get going because logistics and supply issues need to be worked out.Prof Allyson Pollock, of Newcastle University, says one of the many reasons the UK’s reaction has been late and, until now at least, fairly ineffective is that it can no longer respond to local need, because of endless reorganisations and years of austerity. She also says the government is treating this pandemic as a national one, when actually it is a series of local ones, requiring dedicated local responses.But what angers scientists, health workers, experts and others more is why it was left until so recently – when Hancock was already admitting the peak was near – for this mass process of testing and contact tracing to be ordered across the country. And why has it all seemed so chaotic and poorly planned?The criticism of ministers and their advisers is all the greater because they know the UK started on the right road only to halt, change course, then resume when the virus had spread and all that could be achieved was damage limitation.Governments that have contained larger scale outbreaks once they are under way, perhaps most notably South Korea, which at one point was the worst affected country outside China, have done it through large-scale testing and rigorous tracing of the contacts of infected people.“The fact is that the UK was not able to operate a testing and tracing campaign like the one used in South Korea,’ says Prof James Naismith, of Edinburgh University. “We, like many countries, did not have the infrastructure in place to maintain a testing programme in the first wave. South Korea - and Germany - did. However, as with being on the Titanic after it hit the iceberg, there is no time for recriminations, we need to act now to save lives. While we have lagged behind in testing and tracing, if we focus we can catch up.”After the UK stopped its testing and contact tracing, the World Health Organization ordered all countries to “test, test, test”. But in a vital period last month, the UK resisted. Only recently, as pressure to limit the lockdown has grown from businesses, Conservative MPs and a frustrated public, and as Hancock’s testing target looked in danger, has the government completely changed course.There is dismay among health workers who see daily the effects of Covid-19, that early efforts to “ramp up” testing (before key workers were included from last Thursday) were suboptimal to say the least.Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said: “There has been a lot of zig-zagging and veering on what is the policy, who is responsible for mobilising it, what is the plan.” When Hancock first announced his target of 100,000 tests a day she says no one really knew how it would work. “In our view it was not clear. It was just a number that was put out there.” Cordery says it is not clear who the 100,000 should be initially, nor who would be involved in the testing. Should those to be tested include NHS staff, patients, who? “Only the US has a greater capacity to do testing,” said ProfGerome Breen, of King’s College London. “But the NHS has refused to reply to many offers of help from research centres to supply tests.” One of these offers came from Breen, a geneticist whose department already carries out PCR testing on a large scale. “A month ago we offered to turn our laboratory over to Covid-19 work and test medical staff at King’s College Hospital to find out who might have been infected with the virus. We could have started within a fortnight and would have been doing thousands of tests a day by now. We had a couple of emails from the department but heard nothing from them after that. It was intensely frustrating.”Prof Martin Marshall, the chairman of the Royal College of GPs, suggested GPs should have been able to play a bigger role in referring patients for testing and helping the testing process. This admittedly would have required them to have the correct PPE, which has proved another challenge altogether.“Have they been a bit slow in getting to general practice, understanding the needs of general practice, understanding the PPE needs, for example, which took a time, understanding the role of general practice in identifying vulnerable patients understanding the testing needs for general practice? I think all of that has been slower than we would have liked to see.”Asked if the government knew who it ought to be testing, he said: “I think the testing programme has been influenced more by the politics of the availability of testing than it has by the epidemiology of what’s required.“You can have a good policy on testing, but you can only deliver it if you’ve actually got the kit.”This weekend, with the UK passing 20,000 hospital deaths from Covid-19 , and the WHO insisting that testing and contact tracing is essential before life can go back to normal, both are suddenly back at the heart of government policy.But have the U-turns and the delays cost? And what if the lockdown has to continue for months more because effective testing and contact tracing has not been put in place?Already business leaders and Conservative MPs are beginning to warn that without an easing of the lockdown based on testing and contact tracing, the economy faces ruin. Last week, the crisis facing small businesses and the need for a balance to be struck between saving lives and saving the economy was raised in a heated, virtual meeting of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers.The former cabinet minister, David Davis, said: “There is deep concern among backbenchers about the fate of the vast numbers of small businesses, which will determine how fast we come out of this economic slump. Unless we are very quick and very effective at bringing as many as possible back into work in a few weeks’ time, the scars of this problem will go on for a decade.”Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee, said: “All members of parliament must be receiving representations from businesses large and small needing further assistance or some sense of when they can start to plan for at least a partial release from these measures.”Charles Walker, the committee’s vice-chair, added: “Our inboxes are full of desperate people who own small businesses, some of which are their lives’ work, who now risk losing everything. We need to have a cabinet minister put in charge of small business.”World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on face masks has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.\u0026nbsp“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO has stated.There is no robust scientific evidence – in the form of trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.Also underlying the WHO’s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play if everyone wears them.-\u0026nbspHow to make a non-medical coronavirus face mask – no sewing requiredFor some patients – for instance, those with life-threatening cancers – this is a very serious issue. “Patients are avoiding going to their GPs and GPs are making fewer hospital referrals. There are also 200,000 fewer cancer screenings taking place each week in the UK, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. That, in turn, means there are approximately 2,000 to 2,500 cancer diagnoses being missed each week.”Many scientists now believe reliable testing on a large scale really does offer the UK a route out of its Covid-19 crisis. However, merely reaching a figure of 100,000 tests a day on its own is not enough, warned Naismith.“It won’t matter if we can test numbers of that order if we cannot then rapidly trace the contacts of those who are found to be positive and then isolate them. Once a person is found to be positive we will have to trace their contacts very, very quickly – within a day – and then test them.”Such tracing will inevitably require technological aids – mainly by using mobile phones to track a person’s movements, said Naismith. “Inevitably, that will have privacy issues,” he added. “However, these will have to be dealt with because testing and tracing offers us the best chance we have for dealing with Covid-19 at the moment.”• This article was amended on 26 April 2020 to correct a quote from James Naismith."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d345022ca803439712ae318d5e0271bfaa8677e5/138_0_3292_1977/master/3292.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2782c81f7075e38c9830d3852ae92af","title":"the key areas to look at in easing the uk coronavirus lockdown","story":"From schools to shops, with jobs at risk, the government must balance the interests of economy and public safetyAs the prime minister, Boris Johnson, heads back to Downing Street, he faces calls from Labour to be clearer about how Britain might start lifting the coronavirus lockdown, now entering its fifth week. On Sunday, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, warned the outbreak remained at a “delicate and dangerous” stage and said it was irresponsible to speculate about steps to modify the rules underpinning government’s “stay home, protect the NHS, save lives” strategy.More than 20,000 people have died from Covid-19 in NHS hospitals and thousands more in care homes. But there are growing concerns about the economic impact of lockdown. Gerard Lyons, Johnson’s economics adviser when he was London mayor, warned on Sunday the UK could be the hardest-hit western economy if it does not unlock soon. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, also called on ministers to start talking to teachers, businesses, trade unions and town hall leaders and open “honest conversations with the public about what new arrangements might look like”. Unions insist worker safety must not be compromised by any changes and questions remain about public appetite for risking a new peak of contagion, but plans to modify restrictions are starting to emerge.One-way systems and plastic till barriers are among strategies to be used by retailers to reopen non-food stores. The DIY retailer Homebase tested the waters by reopening 20 of its stores on Saturday while the electronics retailer Dixons Carphone said it will launch “zero-contact” stores. Its Norwegian shops have remained open using contactless ordering and payment, prepaid pickups and increased cleaning and hygiene. This could be replicated in the UK, the firm said.Clothes shops could reopen, but with changing rooms off limits, according to guidelines published on Sunday by the British Retail Consortium. It has recommended store managers designate different entrances and exits and send shoppers through aisles in a one-way system to limit contact. Shopper numbers should also be restricted, promotional displays pared back to give customers more space and product demonstrations avoided to deter clustering. Tills will be shielded with plastic screens, as seen in some supermarkets, and floor markings in payment queues will keep customers two metres apart.Raab confirmed on Sunday that people arriving at ports and airports could be quarantined for 14 days as part of emerging plans to lift Britain out of its lockdown. Officials at the Home Office, which is responsible for border security, and the Department for Transport are reported to have drafted plans for 14-day “stay at home” notices, similar to those currently issued to Singaporean citizens returning from abroad. Such a rule would apply to foreign arrivals as well as UK citizens, with fines for failure to remain at the address given for isolation. Raab told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show: “Whether it is a quarantine period, or testing or other measures that might be taken, it is possible.”Ibstock, one of Britain’s biggest brick-makers, will restart production on Monday, and ministers appear keen for builders to catch up on time lost during the lockdown. Construction sites have been kept open since the 23 March lockdown, with physical distancing rules in place. Due to sickness and self-isolation, however, many contracts are well behind. Two of the UK’s biggest housebuilders, Persimmon and Vistry (formerly Bovid) are due to reopen sites on Monday, with Persimmon’s chief executive, David Jenkinson, saying the firm has “new site protocols that incorporate the necessary social distancing and protective measures”.Builders could be allowed to work through evenings and weekends, in temporary lifting of noise abatement rules, it was reported at the weekend. Planning conditions currently limit how late builders can work and tend to prohibit Sunday working.The headteachers union ASCL has said it does not think schools could reopen until 1 June at the earliest. The home secretary, Priti Patel, said at the weekend the government would not put a date on it because it would be “irresponsible and get hopes up”. Raab, said it would be “inconceivable” to send children back to school without physical distancing. This all points to schools being one of the later steps in any lockdown lifting.Labour is applying pressure though, with shadow cabinet member Rachel Reeves warning “young people are missing out on vital days and weeks and months of their education”. The Sutton Trust has found that two-thirds of pupils have not taken part in any online learning while at home, with independent school pupils more likely to be keeping up remotely. Social workers are concerned that the most vulnerable children will suffer most as the schools remain closed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8974df9b047d6baa517f7a594a903a657e704b30/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb5c4091a80536cf32fe0361ed8216ad","title":"trust wanes in uk ministers handling of coronavirus pandemic poll","story":"Doubts focus on failures over testing and whether government acted quickly enough at outsetThe public’s confidence in the government’s ability to handle the coronavirus crisis has fallen sharply in the past fortnight, with less than half of voters now having faith in decisions made by ministers, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer.With more doubts raised over the past week about ministers’ handling of the crisis, particularly in the early stages when other countries were introducing contact tracing and lockdowns while the UK adopted other approaches, those leading the government’s drive to contain the virus – Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, and Matt Hancock, health secretary – have both seen falls in public trust.While people are increasingly critical of the handling of inidual policy areas such as testing, however, a majority still say they “approve” of the way the crisis is being handled, suggesting that they want the government to succeed, and realise that the answers are far from easy to find. Opinium believes there is also a “rally round the flag factor” at play, and the government’s reputation benefits from being shielded from the normal hostile political attacks of opponents.When asked whether they thought the UK had reacted better or worse than other countries, people tended to cite Germany, Australia and South Korea as countries that had performed better than the UK, and the United States as the key example of a country that had done worse.With pressure mounting for ministers to announce plans to ease the lockdown, people believe that offices, essential shops and schools should be allowed to reopen first, provided that the proper safeguards have been put in place. Pubs, stadiums, cinemas and nightclubs are seen as the lowest priorities.Adam Drummond of Opinium said: “Governments across the democratic world saw a big boost in their approval ratings as publics rallied behind efforts to combat a common, and non-political, foe. Similarly, responses to the government’s announcements of economic relief efforts were extremely popular and helped relieve people’s concerns at the time.“However, now that we have been in lockdown for a few weeks and people are less scared of catching the virus themselves – though still worried about the situation – the focus of the news has started to include more specific aspects of the response, such as testing, where government failings have been put in the spotlight. Overall approval has fluctuated and ticked downwards but is still stronger than before the lockdown came into effect.“People don’t want the government to fail, which is why we see this gap between overall approval of their handling of the situation, which is still strong, and much lower approval on specific aspects of it, like testing or whether the government acted quickly enough.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c3c3ecc7bc090ce60be5df12507c3e07c68b52c/0_87_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=873742a9430d7044569ce6954e3f8681","title":"virologist christian drosten germany coronavirus expert interview","story":"Germany’s leading coronavirus expert Christian Drosten on Merkel’s leadership, the UK response and the ‘prevention paradox’Christian Drosten, who directs the Institute of Virology at the Charité Hospital in Berlin, was one of those who identified the Sars virus in 2003. As the head of the German public health institute’s reference lab on coronaviruses, he has become the government’s go-to expert on the related virus causing the current pandemic.In an exclusive interview, Drosten admits he fears a second deadly wave of the virus. He explains why Angela Merkel has an advantage over other world leaders – and why the “prevention paradox” keeps him awake at night.Q: If the lockdown were kept in place longer, could the disease be eradicated?A: There is a group of modellers in Germany who suggest that by prolonging lockdown here for another few weeks, we could really suppress virus circulation to a considerable degree – bringing the reproduction number below 0.2. I tend to support them but I haven’t completely made up my mind. The reproduction number is just an average, an indication. It doesn’t tell you about pockets of high prevalence such as senior citizens’ homes, where it will take longer to eradicate the disease, and from where we could see a rapid resurgence even if lockdown were extended.Q: If there were such a resurgence, could it be contained?A: Yes, but it can’t happen based on human contact-tracing alone. We now have evidence that almost half of infection events happen before the person passing on the infection develops symptoms – and people are infectious starting two days prior to that. That means that human contact-tracers working with patients to identify those they’ve been exposed to are in a race against time. They need help to catch all those potentially exposed as quickly as possible – and that will require electronic contact-tracing.Q: What is known about the seasonality of the virus?A: Not a lot. The Harvard modelling group led by Marc Lipsitch has suggested that transmission might slow over the summer, but that it will be a small effect. I don’t have better data.Q: Can we say for sure that the pandemic started in China?I think so. On the other hand, I don’t assume that it started at the food market in Wuhan. It is more likely to have started where the animal – the intermediate host – was bred.Q: What do we know about that intermediate host – is it the “poor pangolin”, as it’s come to be known?A: I don’t see any reason to assume that the virus passed through pangolins on its way to humans. There is an interesting piece of information from the old Sars literature. That virus was found in civet cats, but also in raccoon dogs – something the media overlooked. Raccoon dogs are a massive industry in China, where they are bred on farms and caught in the wild for their fur. If somebody gave me a few hundred thousand bucks and free access to China to find the source of the virus, I would look in places where raccoon dogs are bred.Q: Will it be useful to identify patient zero – the first human to have been infected with this virus?A: No. Patient zero is almost certain to have acquired a virus that is very similar to some of the first sequenced viruses, so it wouldn’t help us solve our current problem. I don’t think you could even argue that it would help us prevent future coronavirus pandemics, because humanity will be immune to the next Sars-related coronavirus, having been exposed to this one. Other coronaviruses could pose a threat – a prime candidate is the Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) virus – but to understand that threat we have to study how Mers viruses are evolving in camels in the Middle East.Q: Are human activities responsible for the spillover of coronaviruses from animals into people?Coronaviruses are prone to switch hosts when there is opportunity, and we create such opportunities through our non-natural use of animals – livestock. Livestock animals are exposed to wildlife, they are kept in large groups that can amplify the virus, and humans have intense contact with them – for example through the consumption of meat – so they certainly represent a possible trajectory of emergence for coronaviruses. Camels count as livestock in the Middle East, and they are the host of the Mers virus as well as human coronavirus 229E – which is one cause of the common cold – while cattle were the original hosts for coronavirus OC43, which is another.Q: Flu has always been thought to pose the greatest pandemic risk. Is that still the case?A: Certainly, but we can’t rule out another coronavirus pandemic. After the first Ebola outbreak, in 1976, people thought it would never come back again, but it took less than 20 years to do so.Q: Angela Merkel has been praised for her leadership during this crisis. What makes her a good leader?She’s extremely well-informed. It helps that she’s a scientist and can handle numbers. But I think it mainly comes down to her character – her thoughtfulness and ability to reassure. Maybe one of the distinguishing features of a good leader is that they are not using this present situation as a political opportunity. They know how counterproductive that would be.Q: From where you stand, how is the UK handling the situation?A: It’s clear that testing was implemented a little bit too late in the UK. Public Health England was in a position to diagnose the disease very early on – we worked with them to make the diagnostic test – but rollout in Germany was driven in part by market forces, which made it fast, and that wasn’t the case in the UK. Now, though, I have the impression that the UK is really gaining momentum in this regard, and that it is coordinating testing efforts better than Germany.Q: What keeps you awake at night?A: In Germany, people see that the hospitals are not overwhelmed, and they don’t understand why their shops have to shut. They only look at what’s happening here, not at the situation in, say, New York or Spain. This is the prevention paradox, and for many Germans I’m the evil guy who is crippling the economy. I get death threats, which I pass on to the police. More worrying to me are the other emails, the ones from people who say they have three kids and they’re worried about the future. It’s not my fault, but those ones keep me awake at night."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a48b8a33de510704aaeda09311459a5096ca57e3/0_0_1400_840/master/1400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d347e3c63ffe08be706dcf6ec388422d","title":"covid 19 vaccines pressure is on to ensure they go to the most needy not the highest bidder","story":"Global coalition which aims to ensure vaccines are distributed fairly says there will be an ‘astronomical’ push to get access to successful onesAs the global race for a Covid-19 vaccine intensifies, there’s a question Jane Halton and her team come back to time and again: if and when successful vaccines emerge, what can be done to ensure they don’t simply go to those with the deepest pockets?If market power is allowed to dictate access, how can those most vulnerable to Covid-19 be assured of protection?“We are acutely aware of this and it is literally a topic that is being discussed on a daily basis,” she tells the . “Because to us it is just unacceptable that there is not fair access to a successful vaccine across the world’s population.“The notion that this would be a question of going to the highest bidder, to us is just totally unacceptable.”Halton, a former secretary of Australia’s health and finance departments, is chair of the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations, a global body playing a critical role in financing and coordinating Covid-19 vaccine development.One of its founding aims is to ensure that vaccines, once developed, are distributed fairly.The world has witnessed what happens when the market is left to dictate vaccine distribution. During the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, wealthy nations negotiated large advance orders of the vaccine, effectively crowding out poorer countries.The West African ebola crisis – an outbreak that killed 11,325 people – exposed its own galling market failure.Even as the death toll in West Africa grew and grew, big pharmaceuticals could not see a way to recoup the considerable losses they would face attempting to find a vaccine.The leader of Britain’s ebola response, Adrian Hill, said there was simply no “big market” to make it worthwhile for massive corporations.“There was no business case to make an ebola vaccine for the people who needed it most,” he said.It was out of that failure that the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations emerged.“The world’s response to this crisis fell tragically short,” it says in explaining its background. “A vaccine that had been under development for more than a decade was not deployed until over a year into the epidemic.“This risk is real,” the paper warned. “Such an outcome would result in a suboptimal allocation of an initially scarce resource.”Halton predicts the pressure to secure access to successful vaccines will be “astronomical”.“One of the things I’m worried about is vaccine nationalism and I’ve started to use that terminology when I talk to people,” she says.“We’ve been worrying about this issue now for months and months ... What is a mechanism to ensure equitable access?”An estimated minimum of 1 billion people across the globe are vulnerable to Covid-19. They fall into a number of categories: the immunocompromised, those with co-morbidities, the ageing, and frontline medical staff.“So that says to you you need a lot of vaccine to protect even the most vulnerable in our society,” Halton says.It’s a problem the World Health Organisation is also working urgently to solve. This week it announced it planned to design mechanisms to ensure equitable distribution.“While we’re looking for vaccines, unless we break the barriers to equitable distribution of the products, whether it’s vaccines or therapeutics, we will have a problem, so we need to address the problem ahead of time,” WHO’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said.“There should not be a ide between the haves and the have-nots.”For private companies, vaccine development is considered risky, protracted and hugely expensive.Companies are faced with the prospect of spending extraordinary amounts to develop vaccines, with a low likelihood of success.It believes it needs $US2bn to develop three vaccine candidates in the next 12 to 18 months. It has raised almost half of that.The $2bn does not include the costs of manufacture or delivery.The coalition’s work emphasises speed. Each stage of the vaccine development process is compressed. Halton says the speed at which Covid-19 vaccines are being developed is “unprecedented”.One of the projects the coalition is funding is at the University of Queensland, where researchers are testing a molecular clamp technology they hope can help neutralise the virus.The coalition asked UQ researchers to begin working on a Covid-19 vaccine in January. Within three weeks it had produced the candidate now being tested.“Like every researcher who’s looking at their baby, they are optimistic,” she says. “All I can say is I hope they’re right. I genuinely hope they’re right. It’s very hard for me to form a judgment about the likelihood of success.”More broadly, she remains optimistic.“I think when we look across all the work that’s going on globally on vaccines, I do have some hope that we will end up with not just one successful candidate – ideally we would have three,” she says.“I’ve said this now publicly several times: hope for the best but prepare for the worst. And if you hope for the best what you would do is hope to get three successful candidates.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4238401.1587918516!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"supermarket owner asks customers please do not be abusive","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe owner of a Co Kerry supermarket is appealing to customers not to be abusive. Photograph: Eric LukeThe The owner of a Co Cork supermarket is appealing to customers not to be abusive, after a number of clashes over distancing requirements in supermarkets in the last week. Supervalu Clonakilty owner Eugene Scally was moved to protect his staff, telling customers “unfortunately, some of you feel that it is acceptable to verbally abuse” staff when requested to observe the new guidelines. Mr Scally said the new guidelines included allowing just one shopper per family into the store as well as rules on the numbers of shoppers in the store and the distance they should keep apart at tills and in queues. But he said these appeared to spark tensions. Posting on the supermarket’s Twitter account he said “we have always welcomed our customers with open arms” but he was now asking the customers to, “to stand back, to be patient” and to shop alone. In a series of messages he said “our team are doing their best to control numbers in store and maintain social distancing while trying to go about their own daily activities”.He said: “It is unfair and unacceptable to take frustrations out on people who are doing their utmost to give you their time and serve you.“While this request will only apply to a small minority of people, we would like to thank all our customers for shopping with us and look forward to better days.”Mr Scally was not available on Sunday but store manager Pat Griffin said “95 percent of our customers appreciate the new rules. Unfortunately some do have a problem and have no problem in telling you they do”. He said many of the frontline store staff on checkouts had felt intimidated. The appeal to customers to show respect for staff comes as a survey of 7,000 retail workers in 300 separate businesses showed most retail workers were concerned about their personal protection during the coronavirus crisis. The survey was conducted by retail trade union Mandate, over a ten day period between 10th and 20th April with 6,942 respondents.- 46 percent said social distancing and crowd control measures were not being adhered to- 29 percent said they have insufficient Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)- 23 percent said shopping trolliesbaskets not regularly sanitised- 21 percent said they had insufficient hand sanitiser and- 18 percent said there were insufficient protective shieldsscreens.Mandate general secretary John Douglas said staff were doing their best to “flatten the curve” and protect the most vulnerable. But he said frontline workers were saying social distancing “needs to be stricter and the one personone trolley measure needs to be tightened up. “So many customers are coming in with three people in the one family. Also customers coming in telling us that they are in the store ‘just to get out of the house’. ”Mr Douglas added: “Many retail workers believe the hazard pay they are receiving, if any at all, is inadequate. The average retail worker believes a 20percent premium should apply as compensation for the risks they and their families are taking while they’re at work.”Mandate is currently running a Respect Retail Workers Campaign campaign to protect retail workers. The union said campaign came about as a result of an increase in complaints from workers regarding the amounts of both verbal and physical abuse from customers. The union said there was a “small number of people who tend to abuse retail workers” and Mandate was intent on securing “stronger health and safety protections in the workplace for vulnerable workers in Irish retail.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4238462.1587922492!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"teachers union distances itself from branch seeking cancellation of leaving cert","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe TUI’s Dublin City branch says there are mounting health and safety concerns over pressing ahead with the Leaving Cert exams.  Photograph: Frank MillerThe Teachers’ Union of Ireland has distanced itself from one of its branches which has callled for the Leaving Cert exam to be cancelled due to health and safety concerns.The TUI’s Dublin City branch says there are mounting concerns over issues such as the ventilation of exam halls, physical distancing and questions such as whether students will need to wear face masks.As part of its motion calling for the exams to be cancelled , it states that “there is a risk that if the exams were to go ahead it might reach more viral clusters and a possible second wave outbreak, placing our members and students and the broader community at risk.”The branch’s position conflicts with the official TUI position, endorsed by its executive committee, which has stated that the best option available is to proceed with the Leaving Certificate on 29th July, subject to the advice of the public health authorities at the time.SafetyIn a statement, a spokesman for the TUI distanced the union from the Dublin City branch’s position.“The matter of most paramount importance is and will remain the safety and welfare of students and their families, school staff and the general public,” the spokesman said.“ The union is also mindful of the need to provide students with the best opportunity to progress to the next step of their chosen paths, be it employment or further study.“It is obvious that any arrangement in the current circumstances will not be ideal, but it is incumbent on all stakeholders to do what is best in the interests of our students.“In formulating its policy, the TUI always takes account of the variety of views brought through the democratic structures of the union.’Some members of the TUI Dublin City branch are closely aligned with a more hardline faction within the union, which calls itself TUI Grassroots.It has found itself in conflict with the head office on numerous occasions in the past by seeking a tougher stance on issues such as two-tier pay and working additional “Croke Park” hours.In its statement, the TUI Dublin City branch said it acknowledges the efforts of teachers in delivering distance learning to students, but says this is no substitute for class teaching.Given that a final decision will not be made on holding the Leaving Cert until early June, the branch says it would be better to “cancel the exams and instead issue Leaving Certificates to all students stating the subjects and the level the student has studied.”The statement does not outline whether grades could be applied to students or whether this alternative is a workable solution for entry into further and higher education.Mental healthIt states that the long gap between school closures and the planned commencement date for the exams places an “unnecessary mental health burden on all students.”It also goes on to claim that health and safety rules will “compel students to wear face masks during the exam with a protective screen around their desk which will add to the stressdiscomfort.”Authorities, however, have indicated that no\u0026nbspdecisions have yet been made on what kind of physical or social distancing measures will apply during the exams."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4231405.1587117157!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"have howth s red squirrels succumbed to invasive greys","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe narrow entry corridor for grey squirrels at Sutton Cross offered hope for the reds at a crucial balance in their breeding.Where viruses came from, in all their erse billions in a teaspoonful of sea, a forkful of soil, is still mysterious, even to virologists.In one hypothesis, they mght have been archaic, free-living organisms that evolved into parasites in another, they started as fragmentary genetic elements that united to move between cells and invade them. Either way, they reproduce, spread, and evolve to do it more effectively.Why some viruses evolve to cause disease is another mystery. But infectious diseases can limit or reduce populations of humans or wildlife .Researching last week’s column, for example, innocently prompted by the chirping of sparrows, I was led to the latest scientific hypothesis on their modern city decline. It proposed infection by a parasite, found at high levels in the sparrows of suburban London and giving them avian malaria.Today’s column prompted by wondering about the last red squirrels of Dublin’s Howth Head. Have they finally succumbed, like so many in Leinster, to the advance of alien grey squirrels?Even a decade ago, the native reds had already disappeared from many Dublin parks. At the Phoenix Park, for example, the first grey was sighted in 1979 and the last red around 1987.On the Howth peninsula, the reds’ last stronghold in Dublin, the first greys were seen in 2007. In 2011, an assessment for Fingal County Council by ecologist Dr Wiliam Carr, estimated some 25 remaining in the woods.The narrow entry corridor for grey squirrels at Sutton Cross offered hope for the reds at a crucial balance in their breeding. Grey squirrels were regularly removed from the peninsula by Dr Carr, rising to 38 in a year. But his traps caught only two male reds. The Howth colony, he reported in 2017, “will not recover”.Grey squirrels have been commonly thought to oust the reds by competition for acorns and beech nuts. A more insidious reason, as seen in the UK, is cross-infection with the squirrel-pox virus, SPQV. The greys can carry this without much effect, but it’s fatal to the reds, afflicting them with something like the rabbit myxomatosis.Although the American greys were introduced to Ireland at Castleforbes, Co Longford, in 1911, SPQV was not discovered until 2011, found in two grey squirrel populations in Northern Ireland. At one location, 90 per cent of the reds were infected and lost.In 2012 came reports from Co Wicklow and Co Dublin. Testing levels of virus in greys from these areas, a team from UCD warned of “a wave-front of grey squirrel expansion from Wicklow” to threaten the surviving eastern reds.By 2012 just three reds – two males and one female – survived on south Dublin’s Killiney Hill. However, with greys removed by Dr Carr, that year saw reinforcement. Fifteen reds, brought from the Raven Point nature reserve in Wexford, were released in a move supported by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.Elsewhere in Ireland, and notably in the midlands, the resurgence of the pine marten, a native predator, has proved a potent ally in removing grey squirrels and allowing the smaller, more agile, reds to share the woods.But meanwhile, another wildlife virus has arrived in Ireland, threatening not only wild rabbits but also the Irish hare.This is RHDRHD2, joint acronyms for rabbit haemorrhagic disease, a horror like myxomatosis. The first form killed millions of farmed rabbits in China in 1984 and then spread globally. RHD2, a form killing rabbits even faster, emerged in France in 2010.RHD was found in domestic rabbits in Ireland in 2018 and in wild rabbits in July last year RHD2 killed a hare on the Wexford Slobs nature reserve in August and another 17 fatally infected hares were found in eight weeks after that. The disease has been confirmed from at least eight counties, from Cork to Leitrim.Apart from the trysts of mating, the Irish hares lead solitary lives. But rounded up in nets for coursing, contagion could be inevitable. The first deaths from RHD2 last summer brought an immediate ban on coursing from Minister for Heritage Josepha Madigan.By October, however, a deal was reached with the Irish Coursing Club. A ban remains on netting within a 25km radius of finding the disease in hares or rabbits. It was lifted for Kilkenny and for other clubs enlisted in a hare monitoring programme supervised by vets.Moving west 40-odd years ago brought me encounters with dying rabbits, blundering around my feet in the dunes. They were victims of myxomatosis, imported by Irish farming interests.

Their confinement exacerbates existing unresolved relationship issues and being compelled to remain at home all the time together except for essential journeys magnifies existing tensions and problems.People under stress at home can feel they are living in a pressure cooker environment and this can “induce a regression in their behaviour and human interaction suffers,” Accord counsellors have noted.“They can overreact to situations which in turn can cause the domestic atmosphere to deteriorate. This type of behaviour can present as either uncomfortable silences andor very loud, explosive and noisy verbal exchanges.”Young people and children exposed to aggressive behaviour, experience fear and distress which in turn affects their personal behaviour and relationships with physical isolation at home compounding the trauma.The agency says its counsellors are trained to identify and handle cases of domestic abuse and can support an inidual to develop a safety plan and can advise them of specialist crisis support contact numbers.Offering tips Accord advises couples to be conscious of how they raise issues with a partner. “Talk from your own feelings first and express what is difficult for you and what you feel you need rather than blaming and being critical of your partner. Criticism usually begets defensive, stonewalling or disproportionate responses.”Counsellors also suggest: “Be willing to look at yourself and your behaviour in addition to your partner’s shortcomings. ‘What is it like to be in relationship and to live with me?’ is a good question to ask ourselves.”They also suggest that “self-management” is a skill to hone. “It might be better to raise an issue at another time so that your partner can hear the cause of concern in a calmer context and to avoid an experience of perceived criticism or attack.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4238520.1587927660!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"french trawler detained for alleged breach of fishing regulations off irish coast","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Irish Naval Service has detained a French-registered vessel off the southwest coast on Sunday. Photograph: Andy BuchananGettyAFPThe Irish Naval Service has detained a French-registered vessel off the southwest coast on Sunday for an alleged breach of fishing regulations.The LE George Bernard Shaw detained the Miss Jacqueline II 180 miles west of the Mizen Head in Co Cork early on Sunday morning for alleged logbook offences.The trawler is being escorted by the LE George Bernard Shaw to Castletownbere in West Cork where she is expected to arrive at midday on Monday.It’s expected that the Irish authorities will make an application for a 48 hour detention order at a special court sitting in West Cork on Monday or Tuesday.The 32-metre long Miss Jacqueline is Spanish owned and fishes out of La Coruna in Northern Spain even though she is registered in Bayonne in France.The vessel was built in St Malo in Brittany in 1962 but was bought by Spanish owners in 1997, who converted her for use as a long liner to fish for hake.According to the Defence Forces Press Office, today’s detention of the French registered trawler is the fourth such detention by the Naval Service this year.The detention comes as the European Commission expressed “deep concern” about Ireland’s ability to monitor fishing activity during the Covid-19 pandemic.According to a report in The Sunday Times, Bernhard Friess, Acting director-general of the EU Maritime Directorate, has written to Ireland about the issue.Mr Friess has questioned how Ireland can meet its legal obligation to control and check landings of fish if physical inspections have to be reduced.Inspectors with the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) stopped checking landings in some ports after the Covid-19 guidelines were introduced in March.Some inspectors now fear the Department of the Marine will use the EU letter to pressure them into resuming inspections in wheelhouses and holds.Mr Friess said the EC “recognises the challenges presented” by Covid-19 but expects member states’ competent authorities to adapt to the new situation.He said the Commission expects member states “to introduce the necessary measures and resources to ensure control, inspection and enforcement.”“We note the Irish authority intends to continue administrative tasks, cross-checks and vessel monitoring as usual,” said Mr Friess in his letter.But he cautioned the Dept of Agriculture, Food and Marine that while such checks were important “they do not serve as a substitute for physical controls”.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4237577.1587759742!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"questions raised over transparency of public health team","story":"Chief Medical Officer, Dr Tony Holohan, has warned that failure to adhere to Covid-19 restrictions could see Ireland lose a lot of the progress that the country has made in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.

Photograph: Colin KeeganCollinsLabour Party leader Alan Kelly has written to the Department of the Taoiseach raising a series of questions about governance and transparency at the State’s public health team following a week in which similar issues were raised in the Dáil.The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) is the body of medical experts and health service chiefs which has been overseeing the response to Covid-19 and advising the Government on steps it should take to navigate through the current coronavirus pandemic. Its chairman is the State’s chief medical officer, Dr Tony Holohan.On the surface it may seem that all is seamless with the NPHET making recommendations which are then endorsed by Ministers and put into operation by line Government departments and agencies. However, in reality, there have been tensions in this relationship which have been building since the group’s inception in January.During a special sitting of the Dáil on Thursday, serious questions were raised about the transparency of the NPHET process and the subsequent political decision-making that has had profound effects on the lives of everyone in the country.Mr Kelly firstly asked why no notes or minutes of the team’s meetings had been published since the end of March. “Future generations will want to know, and deserve to know, where people stood on decisions, but this is not transparent.”“The group meets twice weekly, but there are no minutes. We cannot see how decisions are being taken. This is not acceptable,” he said, while also pointing out that there are no available minutes for the group’s 11 subcommittees. On testing, he asked if the Health Service Executive was in agreement with plans to ramp up testing to 100,000 swabs a week.Crucially, Mr Kelly also asked if the HSE or its board had communicated in any way with the Taoiseach, the Government, the Minister for Health or the Department of Health regarding its concerns about overall governance of decision-making in this crisis.The  understands that early this week concerns were raised at the top level in the HSE over the decision announced on Friday of last week to significantly expand testing for Covid-19.Highly-placed sources said the chairman of the HSE, Ciarán Devane, raised concerns in representations at the highest levels in the Department of Health about the process that had led to this announcement.A separate letter regarding the testing issue was sent by HSE chief executive Paul Reid to the department’s secretary-general, Jim Breslin.The  asked the department about such correspondence from the HSE, and if it would publish the information.In a statement late on Thursday, the department did not answer specifically whether it had received any correspondence from the HSE board or management.‘Ongoing communications’The department said there were “ongoing communications between the department and the HSE and between senior HSE leadership and the HSE board in relation to the management of the Covid-19 outbreak, including issues being considered by NPHET”.“A number of steps have been taken over the period to ensure very good two-way exchange of information with the HSE board. This includes regular briefing of the HSE board by a senior HSE representative on NPHET, direct briefing of the HSE board of HSE board members by relevant department officials on both particular NPHET guidance and the output of the modelling of Covid-19 by a NPHET subgroup.”Weekly meetings between the Minister and the HSE board chair have also been set up, supported by department and HSE officials.The HSE said in a statement on Friday that it “engages with the Department of Health on a regular basis and on a wide range of matters including matters relating to Covid 19 and NPHET”.In a tweet on Friday, Minister for Health Simon Harris praised NPHET, which he said was continuing to work to keep Ireland safe.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4231819.1587147602!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus brexit a key issue says us special envoy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS special envoy for Northern Ireland Mick Mulvaney: “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal.”  Photograph: Al DragoBloombergThe US special envoy for Northern Ireland, Mick Mulvaney, has said he intends to travel to Northern Ireland as soon as the coronavirus restrictions are lifted, as he prepares to assume his post.Mr Mulvaney said a key focus for him in the coming weeks is how the Covid-19 crisis will impact on Brexit. The British government’s plan to deal with legacy issues from the Troubles, announced on March 18th, also promises to be a focus when normal life resumes, he said. Mr Mulvaney, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in March, had been scheduled to make his first visit to Northern Ireland as US special envoy next month. But the coronavirus has put that plan on hold. “I have been using the time to familiarise myself with the issues. Obviously, Covid-19 is the focus of everyone’s attention right now. It’s a very fluid situation,” he said, speaking from his home in South Carolina, the state he represented in Congress before joining the Trump administration. Like millions of people across the United States, the former White House chief of staff has been working from home where he is based with his wife and three children, as states have imposed stay-at-home restrictions. He says he will visit Northern Ireland “as soon as the door opens”.Interest in positionThe Irish-American politician has been communicating with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, and Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis in the past few weeks.He has also spoken to previous holders of the post, such as Richard Haass, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was appointed by George W Bush. Mr Mulvaney (52), who reportedly had expressed a long-held interest in the position that had been vacant since the end of the Obama presidency, said his appointment was a measure of the Trump administration’s interest in Northern Ireland and Brexit in particular. He said Mr Trump views the post as akin to the role held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who he appointed to manage the White House strategy on the Middle East. “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal – it’s a big deal just generally, and in terms of North-South relations – so he said to me: ‘Jared is going to go and take care of the Palestinians and Israelis, you make sure things go smoothly over there,” says Mr Mulvaney. The husband of Mr Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, is widely viewed to have had minimal success with bringing peace to the Middle East. Trump and PompeoMr Mulvaney visited Northern Ireland in February ahead of his appointment, where he met with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and the new permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, Madeline Alessandri. He also met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and US ambassador Ed Crawford, a Trump appointee, at Farmleigh.The role of Northern Ireland envoy falls under the remit of the US state department, and Mr Mulvaney will report to Mr Trump and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Mr Mulvaney was replaced as Mr Trump’s chief of staff by congressman Mark Meadows last month. Like many in the administration, Mr Mulvaney played down the risk of coronavirus as recently as late February.Asked if he missed working at the White House, he replied: “I’m always happy to be home, but it’s kind of strange to be out of Washington at this time.” He says he still talks to the president and points out that Mr Meadows is a friend of his. Both were co-founders of the Freedom Caucus on Capitol Hill, a group of conservative, Republican lawmakers.

One of the largest rural organisations in the State has signed up with an opera and theatre costume designer to sew medical scrubs for nursing home and other care workers.More than 500 of the Irish Countrywomen’s Association’s 8,500 members have volunteered for the Sew Scrubs for Ireland project, the brainchild of former head of costume at the Gate Theatre Sinead Lawlor. “I have nurses in the family and I was shocked that even big hospitals didn’t have enough scrubs because people who didn’t normally necessarily wear them to work every day were now wearing them,” she says.“And they couldn’t be ordered for good money as well as people being faced with coming home and not having the time to get them washed and dried.”Ms Lawlor said she knows “so many brilliant makers and doers”, skilled in design, material cutting and making. They also started with a GoFundMe campaign and just over €8,000 has been raised in the three weeks since then which has provided enough for about 1,000 scrub sets which normally cost between €30 and €40.Scrubs are going to nursing homes in the local area of ICA members doing the sewing and the Dublin Capuchin Day Centre for the homeless is also among the recipients.Much of the cutting is done in Dublin but Macnas Theatre group in Galway are also involved, a tailor in Wexford is cutting along with costumers and fashion professionals in Cork. “Scrubs are really difficult to make, you need to be a highly proficient sewer and maker and a large number in the ICA would meet that requirement. So it seemed like a really good idea to reach out to ICA management because they’re in every community in the country, they have local knowledge and they are known for a high level of craftsmanship.” National President of the ICA Josephine Helly put the call out to members and the association contributed an additional €4,000 to the effort which secured 990 metres of polycotton in 30 metre rolls.“We should get 295 sets out of that and the people who make them are distributing them to nursing homes in their area,” with sewing underway in a number of counties.Not all of the volunteers have yet got fabric and Ms Ms Helly from Ardrahan, Co Galway says members “are crying out for more material”Fabric however is like gold dust Ms Lawlor says. “It’s a global crisis and there are serious stresses on the supply chain,” and major fabric hubs like Italy and France are off limits for now. In England many fabric suppliers have also closed.Such is the demand that it took two weeks for the fabric they had ordered to arrive. It came on Thursday and has now been cut and sent out to a national army of sewers.It takes about four metres per set of scrubs depending on the width of the fabric which needs to be washable at 60 degrees and must have minimum 35 per cent cotton content and polycotton is the standard fabric used.Ms Helly said a lot of the ICA’s members are cocooning and sewing scrubs would be something for them to do. Ms Lawlor said they wanted to empower people to help their community, “particularly people who are self-isolating and cocooned or otherwise disenfranchised from their normal routines”."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"While the number of new coronavirus cases has begun to fall, experts say the rate of change is not as fast as expectedIn recent years China has sought to expand its control over the region by building artificial islands around reefs and atollsSouth Korea reiterates that it has detected \u0026lsquonothing unusual\u0026rsquo in the NorthSecondary school students told to arrive early for temperature checksContribution comes days after Washington said the US would freeze funding to WHOHardline clerics calling the shots and urging devotees to ignore anti-pandemic measuresLatest cases raise concern about potential impact on Nagasaki residentsSouth Korea\u0026rsquos presidential Blue House says no unusual signs coming from neighbourLeatherbacks are world\u0026rsquos largest sea turtles and are endangered in ThailandFifteen activists arrested in biggest such crackdown since start of anti-government ralliesRevision after scepticism of official figures and claims in US virus may be sourced to labPresident\u0026rsquos ruling party projected to win election with highest turnout since 1992Health officials say 409 imported infections are Chinese citizens returning from RussiaWidespread reports that African nationals in Guangzhou are being targeted as potential \u0026lsquocarriers\u0026rsquoAmbassadors express concerns over claims of eviction and forced testingSouth Korean health officials said it remains unclear what is behind the trendMove is likely to be part of attempt to control the narrative surrounding the pandemicDelayed response to coronavirus outbreak had consequences for Chinese city and the worldChina\u0026rsquos appointment like making \u0026lsquopyromaniac the town fire chief\u0026rsquo, says watchdogVirus lockdown lifted on Wuhan but imposed on Suifenhe on Russian frontierStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4238286.1587895158!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"kim jong un s absence and north korea s silence keeps rumours churning","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA photo distributed on April 12th by the Korean Central News Agency shows North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspecting a pursuit assault plane group under. Photograph: Korean Central News Agency via The New York TimesNorth Korea is still sending letters and gifts to foreign leaders and domestic workers in the name of its leader, Kim Jong-un. Its news media brims, as usual, with panegyric propaganda extolling Kim’s leadership.South Korea reiterates that it has detected “nothing unusual” in the North. US president Donald Trump has called “incorrect” and “fake” a report that Kim was “in grave danger” after surgery.All this has done little to stop the rumour mill churning about Kim’s health and the fate of the nuclear state, for the simple reason that North Korea has not reported a public appearance by its leader for two weeks. Nor has it responded to lurid claims about his health.The lack of real information from the hermetic country is giving rise to rampant rumour mongering, leaving North Korean experts, foreign officials and intelligence agencies to parse through it all for signs of the truth.Depending on the news outlet or social media post, Kim, believed to be 36, is recuperating after a minor health issue like a sprained ankle, or he is “in grave danger” after a heart surgery. Or he has become “brain dead” or is in a “vegetative state” after a heart-valve surgery gone wrong at the hands of a nervous North Korean surgeon or one of the doctors China dispatched to treat him. Or Kim is grounded with Covid-19. Where did he get it? From one of those Chinese doctors.One rumour circulating in South Korean messaging apps claims that after French doctors could not wake Kim from his “coma,” Kim Pyong Il, a half brother of\u0026nbspKim’s late father, seized power with the help of pro-Chinese elites in Pyongyang, the North’s capital. It goes on to say that\u0026nbspKim’s powerful sister, Kim Yo-jong, has been detained while Beijing is secretly bargaining with Washington over the future of North Korea and its nuclear weapons.Seoul has questioned the accuracy of the unconfirmed reports, while the South Korean news media appears to dismiss most of them as rumours spreading through Chinese social media and beyond. But they cannot be completely ignored, since North Korea is so secretive that the world’s most powerful intelligence agencies have been unable to penetrate Kim’s inner circles.Public appearanceKim last appeared publicly April 11th, when he presided over a Politburo meeting. Speculations about his health began swirling after Kim missed state celebrations for his country’s biggest holiday, the April 14th birthday of his grandfather and founder of North Korea, Kim Il-sung.Rumours went into overdrive after Daily NK, a Seoul-based website relying on anonymous sources inside the North, reported Monday that Kim was recovering from heart surgery performed April 12th. The next day, CNN added to the frenzy, reporting that Washington was monitoring intelligence that\u0026nbspKim was “in grave danger”. On Saturday, TMZ, a celebrity-news website in the United States, blared: “N. Korea dictator Kim Jong-un reportedly dead after botched heart surgery.”More than once, Trump has wished Kim well if he indeed were ill.“North Korea’s secrecy and our lack of reliable information create a breeding ground for rumours,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. “But his continued absence would be destabilising as more people in and outside the country wonder if he is incapacitated or dead.”In recent days, the South Koreans and their allies in Washington have scoured North Korea with the help of spy satellites and other resources for signs of Kim and preparations for missile launches. Their efforts led them to Wonsan, an east-coast town where Kim’s family has a seaside compound complete with yachts, jet skis, a horse track and a private train station. A train “probably belonging to”\u0026nbspKim has been parked there since at least Tuesday, 38 North, a Washington-based website specialising in North Korea, reported on Saturday, citing commercial satellite imagery.Wonsan is one of Kim’s favourite sites for missile tests. A South Korean news report said on Saturday that the United States had detected preparations for a missile test in Sondeok, farther up the east coast, where North Korea launched missiles in August last year and again in March in\u0026nbspKim’s presence.South Korean officials privately say that\u0026nbspKim’s presence at a missile test could be a strategic way to quiet the speculation. But North Korea has also used such preparations to keep its external foes guessing. There is a deep geopolitical fascination with North Korea, the world’s most isolated police state.The country has detonated six nuclear bombs in underground tests and claims to have built missiles powerful enough to deliver them to the continental United States. It is also run by a man who was dismissed as a figurehead when he took power in 2011 in his twenties.Kim has since established firm control, proving brutal enough to execute his own uncle, a potential threat to his power, and once calling\u0026nbspTrump a “mentally deranged US dotard”.Power vacuumKim’s sudden demise could create a power vacuum with far-reaching implications. Over the decades, US and South Korean officials have discussed top-secret contingency plans, including how to prevent the North’s nuclear weapons from falling into wrong hands and what to do if Beijing sends troops into the North to stabilize its neighbour, which has long served as a buffer between China and US forces based in South Korea.In this secretive society, any likely successor to Kim amounts to a guessing game, even for outside analysts who have spent their academic careers parsing the North. Will it be his only sister, Kim Yo-jong, who has recently expanded her role in his government? What about Kim Pyong-il, who returned home last year after serving for decades as North Korea’s low-key ambassador to eastern European countries? Some predict a collective leadership to be led by Choe Ryong-hae, the No\u0026nbsp2 in the government hierarchy. What if a yet-unknown but ambitious general engineered a putsch? How would North Koreans, who have been trained to worship the Kim family, respond?BlundersOfficials are careful not to quash the rumours on Kim’s health outright, in part because their past predictions on the North have sometimes proved wrong. Reporting on North Korea, too, has been strewn with blunders. Top officials reported to have been executed have often resurfaced. Some of the defectors, who feed information to the news media, have been accused of, or admitted to, embellishing their accounts.In 1986, a South Korean newspaper reported a “world scoop” claiming that Kim’s grandfather, then-president Kim Il-sung, died in an armed attack. A smiling Kim Il-sung resurfaced two days later. In 2014, Kim Jong-un disappeared for more than a month, prompting rumours that he might have been deposed in a coup. North Korean media later showed him walking with a cane after what South Korean intelligence called an ankle surgery.In 2015, a North Korean defector claimed that Kim ordered his own aunt to be killed with poison. But the aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, re-emerged in Pyongyang in January.The rumours can also turn out to be true. In 2008, Kim’s father and predecessor, Kim Jong-il, was absent from view for months. South Korean analysts and the news media speculated, correctly, that he had had a stroke. He died three years later.Joo Sung -ha, a North Korean defector-turned-journalist for the South Korean newspaper Dong-A Ilbo, said in a Facebook post that it was reasonable to believe that Kim had health problems. But he had zero trust in news reports detailing whether and why the North Korean leader faced a grave medical emergency.Such details about “the health of the Kim family is the secret among secrets,” he said, calling the people who claim to know “novelists”. – New York\u0026nbspTimesStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4237432.1587747479!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barnier criticises uk over impasse in surreal brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels. An EU official said Mr Barnier was concerned about the prospect of not reaching agreement ahead of June extension deadline. Photograph: Olivier MatthysPoolAFP via Getty ImagesNo progress has been made in the areas of starkest disagreement between the European Union and the UK in week-long talks on the post-Brexit relationship, held over video conference due to the coronavirus pandemic.Lead EU negotiator Michel Barnier accused the British side of failing to engage seriously on some aspects, and said never before had such high-stakes talks had to take place under such time pressure, which was all the more difficult given the need to battle the pandemic and its severe economic fallout.“In this context, the negotiation that has occupied us this week may appear out of touch. It has even been qualified as surreal,” Mr Barnier said following the talks on Friday.Both EU and British sources said progress would have to seriously speed up in order for sufficient progress to be made, and an EU official said Mr Barnier was seriously worried about the prospect of not reaching an agreement.“They listen politely to us presenting our text, but they don’t engage in some of the areas where they don’t have an interest to reach an agreement,” a senior EU official said.“We don’t have much time, and we see that in some of the aspects that the British authorities know for us, the EU side, are indispensable to have an agreement in the end, they don’t want to move. This is why Michel Barnier is concerned.”It was the first of three rounds of talks scheduled to be held before June, when Britain will have its final chance to opt for more time to negotiate its future relationship with its biggest trading partner.British sources insisted that under no circumstances would they accept an extension of the transition period, which expires at the end of this year.If no deal can be agreed between the UK and the EU by then, they will automatically begin trading on default World Trade Organisation terms, which is forecast to deliver a deep blow to the British economy and to its nearest neighbours, particularly Ireland. Even if a deal is agreed, British negotiators say they are perusing an arrangement like those the EU has with Canada or Japan, which would entail significant barriers to trade.‘Level playing field’The four areas of greatest contention are on the so-called “level playing field”, on the governance of the deal, on police and judicial co-operation, and on fishing rights, an area on which Britain has yet to submit a legal text of its position for negotiation.The EU has said it will not grant tariff-free access to its single market unless Britain maintains labour and environmental standards and guarantees it will not intervene to give companies an unfair advantage. Britain has dismissed this as unacceptable.On governance, the EU wants a single overarching framework while the UK wants a series of separate arrangements. The EU insists that Britain should guarantee continued adherence to the European Convention on Human Rights, and that the European Court of Justice should be the final arbiter on disputes that touch on EU law. Britain rejects the jurisdiction of the ECJ entirely.“We will not make progress on the so called level playing field and the governance provisions until the EU drops its insistence on imposing conditions on the UK which are not found in the EU’s other trade agreements and which do not take account of the fact that we have left the EU as an independent state,” a British government spokesperson said.British sources said they had used the latest round of talks to challenge the EU’s argument that Britain’s size and proximity to the EU made level playing field commitments essential, and they defended British labour and environmental standards.They said there was no question of Britain continuing fishing quota agreements with other EU countries, which Brussels has proposed.The two sides meet for further rounds of talks starting on May 11th and June 1st ahead of a high-level meeting before the end of June which will make the final decision on extending the transition.Separately, the Specialised Committee on the Protocol on IrelandNorthern Ireland will meet next Thursday.

Italy is capable of miracles. The sad thing is, to make those miracles you often need a tragedy or an emergency first.”The 3,878 ft-long bridge collapsed during a thunderstorm in August 2018, sending cars and trucks plummeting to the valley below amid a tangle of smashed concrete pillars and twisted steel beams.More than 500 people were made homeless because the bridge collapsed in an urban valley packed with apartment blocks as well as a railway line and warehouses.Government promises to quickly rebuild the bridge were met with scepticism in a country in which infrastructure projects often drag on for decades, dogged by red tape and corruption.But Italy has this time confounded the naysayers - the bridge has been rebuilt in around 12 months. Once the surface is laid with asphalt, it will open to traffic.“Normally, building a bridge takes three or four years,” said Mr Piano, one of the world’s most renowned architects. “This bridge took one year. The secret lies in the fact that we started making the horizontal s at the same time as we were building the foundations. And we worked in three shifts, round-the-clock.”Famous in the UK for designing The Shard in London, Piano is a native of Genoa so the project has emotional significance for him. He designed the bridge to resemble a ship, in tribute to Genoa’s seafaring and boat-building heritage.It should last for a millennium or more, he said. “Europe is full of Roman bridges that were built 2,000 years ago. There is no reason why this one should not last as long – on one condition, that it is maintained well,” said Mr Piano, who lives in Paris.Even during the darkest days of the coronavirus crisis, which led to a national lockdown being imposed on March 9, the project did not stop, with 1,000 workers toiling around the clock.Construction teams had to follow strict health protocols, wearing masks, eating in canteens in staggered shifts and maintaining social distancing.One worker became infected with Covid-19, but he was quarantined and recovered.Before the virus struck, workers battled dreadful weather.“In the autumn it rained for 40 days and in mid-November the building site was flooded,” Siro Dal Zotto, project director for the construction company Fincantieri, said earlier this month.The bridge should be seen as “a symbol of how one can emerge from a terrible situation,” he said.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/04/05/TELEMMGLPICT000229094849_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqOj5_Rmr3MNcQcsRkzAbTbSpPmN5eNR6pQVArxqnJGCI.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"dreary modern culture great british eccentric vanishing breed","story":" Society must treasure its eccentrics like the late Marquis of Bath. We may not see their like again.The Reverend David Johnson, who died last week, was a member of a vanishingly rare breed, the English eccentric. I met the Vicar at university, and have many vivid recollections of him, most unrepeatable. Johnson, a parish priest, became the unofficial chaplain to the Oxford Union and Conservative association, attending our events and making raucous speeches.He offered glimpses of a louche, bohemian world – one of wild pranks and madcap schemes – aeons away from the worthy conformity pervading modern student life. Though an exceptional speaker and fearsome wit, the Vicar’s vices prevented him from realising his potential as a clergyman. Often roaring drunk throughout the day, he once began a funeral he was officiating with the opening lines of the wedding service. He possessed a unique gift for rubbing people up the wrong way. Yet his life was tinged with brilliance.Johnson was serving as Cambridge Union president when Benazir Bhutto, his opposite number at Oxford, challenged him to a cricket match. Having coaxed a cadre of blues onside, Bhutto felt assured of victory, until it became clear that Johnson had persuaded half the Australian cricket team, then on a winter tour of England, to play.He and a friend once shot out the windows of a love rival’s rooms, only to find they had the wrong man. Friendly with Princess Margaret, he claimed the pair had been enjoying a crafty indoor cigarette at Buckingham Palace one Christmas, when the Queen walked in. Margaret quickly threw her cigarette into a nearby nativity scene, where her sister found it, smouldering in the crib.The Vicar was best known as co-author of a series of hoax letters, written under the nom-de-plume Francis Wagstaffe, purely for the fun of teasing Church of England bishops and other Establishment figures. (One begins: “Dear Bishop, Like you, I am a man of little education.”) He later documented his correspondence, including their earnest and sometimes furious replies, in a book. As an Oxford tour guide, he enjoyed fabricating stories for American visitors, explaining that a statue of Queen Caroline of Ansbach was actually Margaret Thatcher.Eccentrics may lead more erratic lives than most, but they add greatly to the gaiety of nations. Yet our culture provides terrible conditions for these qualities to thrive. True, money is often an ingredient hence the tradition of quirky aristocrats such as the Duke of Portland, a Victorian recluse who built a network of subterranean mazes under his estate to avoid human contact, or the delightfully dotty late Marquis of Bath. (The Vicar himself lived in a rough part of Oxford, in a terraced house he nicknamed “Seaview Cottage”).But what really drives eccentricity is not wealth, but disdain for public opinion. Today’s dreary PC culture, and the self-obsessions induced by social media, have left this devil-may-care attitude a depressing rarity.When we come to commemorate Johnson in proper style, it will feel as if we’re burying not just a friend, but one of a dying breed. Society must treasure its eccentrics. We may not see their like again.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Gloucestershire police had to turn back daytrippers from five different counties, including some who’d travelled more than 100 miles, while in Wiltshire police stopped an already disqualified driver doing 110mph on the M5 with five children on board. A party of 10 in two cars travelled more than 200 miles for a walk in Snowdonia, before being turned back by police. Gwent Police released a list of the best excuses they had received for flouting, including the foolhardy response to an officer of: I\u0027m taking my mate into Newport to buy drugs. No, it was more subtle and widespread than that: the feeling that wherever you looked, particularly in cities, people were thronging into public spaces without bothering too much about social distancing. Bournemouth esplanade was packed, while on Wimbledon Common plainclothes police appeared to step in to enforce government regulations after sunseekers brought out camping chairs. Stern words were also had in Greenwich Park, where scantily clad sunbathers were asked to put their trousers back on and make an exit. Police and the coastguard had to speak to a man in a similar state of undress who took a dip at Langland Bay in Swansea, and paddlers also ventured onto Warleigh Weir near Bath. One east London resident said a local park looked like ‘a Spanish beach resort’, complete with ice-cream van outside the gates. More than half of B\u0026ampQ’s 300 stores were open. So why the unravelling? There are five main reasons.Second, the great British weather has, with magnificent perversity, decided to shine bright and warm on us. You wait years for a pandemic and some sunshine, and they both come along at once. Small wonder that Andy Cooke, chief constable of Merseyside police, uttered a sentence rarely heard in this country: ‘We could do with some rain, really.’ Third, other countries are beginning to ease their rules. Germany has reopened bookshops and car dealerships. Children have returned to nurseries in Norway and some schools in Denmark. Swiss hair salons are open again. And of course Donald Trump has repeatedly stated his desire to have the United States back up and running as soon as possible. That these countries have different demographics, healthcare provision and infection rates than we do can appear less relevant than the simple iconography of the images: the virus is the same all over the world, so if they’re opening up then why can’t we?Fourth, every flouting of the rules, no matter how minor and apparently harmless, acts as the thin end of the wedge. You go for a bike ride with a friend and you’re both at pains to observe the two-metre rule, but next time someone else comes along and you have to squeeze closer to allow other people past, and it doesn’t seem the end of the world. Or you see other people disobeying the rules and think ‘well, if they’re not going to bother then why should I?’ Once these outer threads begin to unravel, it’s very hard to sew them up again.And finally, the political smoke signals are suggesting some alteration sooner or later, no matter how much the government protests otherwise. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps may say that ‘it isn’t over, we’re riding perhaps, we hope, a downward trend but it is by no means established yet’, but the authority of that message is undermined by the fact that the First Ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have already hinted at possible easing in their own areas, or by isions in the Cabinet over how to proceed, with Health Secretary Matt Hancock reportedly keen to keep strict measures in place while Chancellor Rishi Sunak is mindful of the need to get the economy moving again.But arguably the biggest political signifier is Boris Johnson’s return to work on Monday. The very personal nature of his leadership style means that there has been a definite sense of marking time while he’s been recovering from the virus: but now he’s back, and will this week face not just the biggest question of his premiership – when, where and how to ease the lockdown – but one with no right answer. A libertarian by instinct, he was reluctant to impose stringent restrictions in the first place, fearing that the public would only obey them for so long: and, though people have in general been more law-abiding than many in government expected, it seems that we’re finally beginning to prove him right after all.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/26/12/piers-morgan-alan-sugar.jpg","title":"alan sugar piers morgan coronavirus good morning britain","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.‘Good Morning Britain’ host has previously criticised Lord Sugar for his attitude towards the government’s handling of the pandemicAlan Sugar has lashed out at his former friend and now frequent sparring partner Piers Morgan, accusing the Good Morning Britain host of “irresponsible” coronavirus coverage.“Whatever the government is trying to do, they are working their hardest,” Lord Sugar said in response to Morgan’s criticism at the government’s failures over providing protective gear for health workers.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“They’re not deliberately not getting equipment to the NHS, there is a problem with the supply chain.

The firm should work with the customer to resolve these difficulties in advance of payments being missed, the FCA said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the company has now paused the availability of that and some other categories as it deals with false stories around the pandemic.Other topics including conspiracy theory appear to have disappeared from the list, and a Facebook spokesperson confirmed to Reuters that other categories were being hidden as it evaluates the different audience categories.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe removal came after a report that demonstrated it was possible to pick people interested in pseudoscience for targeting with particular posts, presumably allowing them to be targeted with false or misleading information.Such people would not necessarily know they were thought to be interested in such a topic, and would not have given any explicit indication that they were. Instead, the tag was probably added by automated systems based on the kinds of content they engage with.The Markup demonstrated that Facebook was allowing such ads after saying it would police COVID-19 misinformation on its platform. More than 78 million Facebook users were interested in pseudoscience, it said, citing Facebook\u0027s ad portal.Misinformation about the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, from bogus cures to wide-ranging conspiracy theories, has also spread on rival social media platforms such Twitter Inc and YouTube, the video service of Alphabet Inc\u0027s Google.Advocacy group Avaaz reported last week that a sample of 104 coronavirus-related pieces of misinformation content on Facebook analyzed by the group had reached over 117 million estimated views.Data gathered by ProPublica in 2016 shows that Facebook assigned pseudoscience to users at that time, suggesting the category has been available for several years.The Facebook spokeswoman said in her email that the pseudoscience category should have been removed in a previous review.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

The firm should work with the customer to resolve these difficulties in advance of payments being missed, the FCA said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

New applicants are required to\u0026nbspwait about\u0026nbspfive weeks\u0026nbspfor the funds to start being paid.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile claimants can apply for an advance loan to help them through this period with no income, many choose not to do this because it places them in debt to the government and means money will be deducted off future payments – and instead need to appeal to food banks for support.How to support our campaignThe Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign has been highlighting how you can help the vulnerable who are struggling to get food by volunteering, giving cash or buying produce.Robin Burgess, who runs the Hope Centre in Northampton, told The independent that where previously the charity was seeing about 150-160 people per week, the figure now stood at around 420.“The numbers have tripled.\u0026nbspA good chunk of these are people who have been laid off because their work has collapsed, and a lot of them are awaiting their universal credit payments. They’re the new poor,” he said.Mr Burgess explained\u0026nbspthat while people have the option to apply for advance loans from the\u0026nbspDepartment for Work and Pensions (DWP), many refrain from doing so because they want to avoid getting into debt.\u0026nbsp“If you’re on a low income you don’t want a debt built into that,” he said.He warned that even when new claimants do eventually receive their universal credit payment, it may not be enough to meet their needs.“The fact is that universal credit doesn’t pay sufficiently to cope\u0026nbspwith\u0026nbsppeople’s needs financially. It’s never been enough. That’s why food banks exist.\u0026nbspWe’ve been saying this for years and nothing’s changed, and now the number of people on benefits has suddenly massively increased because of this,” he said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“The government\u0026nbspjust assumes that food banks can pick it up, because that’s been built into its policy. Food banks are now part of the welfare state. We’re being abandoned to do this as a sector.”Daphine Aikens, founder and chief executive of the Trussell Trust-affiliated Hammersmith and Fulham Foodbank, said that while the charity had previously provided food to around 250 people per week, now it was distributing more than 350\u0026nbspeach day – and that demand was continuing to rise.Food banks begin home deliveries amid struggle to keep doors openFood banks in crisis as coronvirus panic buying leaves families hungryFears of universal credit delays and mistakes as claims spikeShe said most of the new beneficiaries were people who had lost their jobs and didn’t benefit from any of the government schemes, with many waiting on universal credit payments.“It’s making it very real for people who didn’t know about universal credit and how long the waiting time is,” Ms Aikens\u0026nbspadded.Sabine Goodwin, coordinator for the Independent Food Aid Network, said food banks in the network were reporting as much as a 300 per cent increase in need\u0026nbspcompared with last year.She added: “Predominantly our members are supporting newly unemployed people waiting for universal credit, people who were already living in poverty before coronavirus, families affected by school closures and unable to access vouchers, and people with no recourse to public funds.“While the government seems to think that relying on charitable food aid providers is a workable option, the poverty behind food bank use is spiralling out of control.”It comes after analysis by Action for Children revealed more than 8.5 million children live in households with savings valued at less than the average monthly income before the crisis hit.Frank Field, former chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, cautioned\u0026nbsplast week that many of those who have claimed universal credit during the coronavirus pandemic were likely to face delays in their first payment.He said existing problems with the flagship benefit –\u0026nbspsuch as delays in payment\u0026nbspand cuts to support –\u0026nbspwould become acutely apparent during the pandemic as many\u0026nbspmore people are forced to apply.A DWP spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“Universal credit is providing a vital safety net to those affected by the pandemic and we’ve taken action by injecting over £6.5bn to support people on the welfare system.“No one has to wait five weeks for their money as urgent advances are available – and more than half a million people have requested and received one since 16 March.“Advance repayments are made gradually over 12 months, and deductions are capped at 30 per cent\u0026nbspof claimants’ standard allowance.

But a drop-off in older volunteers meant the food aid operation had to switch gears.“We adjusted so we can still make a difference to people going through a tough time,” said trustee Mansukh Morjaria. “We want to help as many as we possibly can. Our ethos is to feed people from all backgrounds –\u0026nbspand it means people of all backgrounds working together for the greater good.”How to support our campaignMr Morjaria, who picks up around 50 crates of produce from the food surplus charity twice a week, added: “We’re so grateful to The Felix Project – we depend up on them, and the supply of food has been a lifesaver for a lot of people.”The Harvest Church in Wembley is another of almost 300 charities, food banks and local projects across London that The Felix Project is currently supplying with fresh fruit, vegetables and non-perishable produce it rescues from restaurants, retailers and wholesalers.The evangelical church was forced to close its food bank because of an initial drop-off in older volunteers. The remaining team adapted by dropping off food packages at the homes of dozens of people in the local area, and putting together meals for around 100 people at a south London homeless shelter in need of regular food.“The deliveries have been really important to people,” said coordinator Hilda Darko. “We have been in touch with families struggling to get to supermarkets because they’re self-isolating or having serious money problems.”She added: “The extra need will be there for a while to come so we’ll trying to help everyone we can. The idea of helping your neighbour is part of our mission.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The group of Muslim volunteers feeds between 50 and 60 people at the “soup and smiles” project on a Wednesday evening – while carefully observing social distancing rules.“We decided to carry on doing the work because there are people still sleeping rough,” said project leader Adeel Mahmood. “Some others are still struggling to get food, even if they’re in hostels or put up in hotels temporarily. These are some of the most vulnerable in society, so it’s important to carry on meeting the need.”The Myriad Foundation has also responded to the crisis by getting food packages out to around 170 vulnerable people on a near-daily basis – including many in dire financial hardship because of job losses and struggles to access universal credit quickly.“We had an inidual contact us who hadn’t eaten for two days,” said Mr Mahmood. “Things can get desperate quite quickly. From an Islamic perspective, there’s a big emphasis on giving to the whole community. So anyone who gets in touch, we will try to help them.”Olivia Colman joins our Help The Hungry campaignThe Midland\u0026nbspLangar\u0026nbspSeva\u0026nbspSociety, a Birmingham-based Sikh charity, has been delivering food packages filled with £30 worth of groceries to hundreds of people each week\u0026nbspwho are self-isolating or struggling financially.It has also been delivering lunches to several hospitals across the Midlands three or four times a week, and offering hot meals to around 200 people in central Birmingham every evening, seven days a week.“The reaction from local restaurants and supermarkets and members of the public helping supply us with food has been amazing,” said coordinator\u0026nbspRandhir\u0026nbspSingh\u0026nbspHeer.“Our principle is to serve the whole community with compassion.

Indeed, they have become four times as frequent\u0026nbspin the past half-century.Since the 1970s, it is\u0026nbspestimated at least three dozen infectious diseases have emerged from human interference with animals, including Sars, Mers, Ebola, bird flu, swine flu and the Zika virus. As far back as 2007 the World Health Organisation warned that infectious diseases were emerging at a rate that had not been seen before.The spread of the viruses is put down to a deadly combination of wildlife trafficking and consumption, increasing human encroachment into wildlife habitats as more people live in densely populated areas – and air travel, which enables pathogens to take hold globally.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThree years ago, an article\u0026nbsppublished by the US National Centre for Biotechnology Information stated, presciently: “The Aids and influenza pandemics have claimed and will continue to claim millions of lives. The recent Sars and Ebola epidemics have threatened populations across borders. The emergence of Mers may well be warning signals of a nascent pandemic threat.”Zoonotic diseases are complex, and it’s sometimes impossible to say a virus has disappeared, because it might have many different strains, and might mutate and lie dormant. This is a timeline of the main zoonotic diseases to have hit us since the start of the 20th century:How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe 1918 flu pandemic: This was the most severe pandemic in modern times, killing at least 50 million people in two years. It is widely believed that the virus originated in birds because it shared genetic mutations with the bird flu virus later found in Asia, and could have transferred to horses in the trenches of the first world war before spreading to humans. This is disputed, with one study suggesting it came from mammals.Asian flu, 1957:\u0026nbspIn February 1957, a new influenza virus, known as H2N2 emerged in east Asia, which spread into a pandemic. It originated from an avian influenza virus, causing an estimated 1.1 million deaths worldwide.HIV: First identified in 1981, the disease is thought to have been acquired by people in central Africa hunting chimpanzees and coming into contact with their infected blood. However, studies show that HIV may have jumped from apes to humans as far back as the late 1800s, and it has existed in the West since at least the mid to late 1970s. HIV has killed about 35 million people to date, according to the World Health Organisation.Wildlife trade continues in Asia amid calls for restrictions China tries to shut down wildlife trade but markets remain openBlack-market trade ‘may undermine Vietnam ban on disease-rife markets’Stray dogs eating bat meat ‘could have sparked coronavirus pandemic’Sars:\u0026nbspSevere acute respiratory syndrome is another type of coronavirus, which killed at least 770 people globally in an epidemic in 2002-3. Most victims were in southern China, Vietnam and Singapore. Scientists are not certain of its origins but like Covid-19 it’s thought it could have come from bats and spread to other animals such as civet cats, which are commonly sold in squalid conditions in street markets. The epidemic resulted in more than 8,000 cases, in 26 countries. Of those, 774 died.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The H1N1 virus killed nearly tens of thousands of people in a global pandemic that spread to 214 countries in less than a year. However, overall the outbreak was not as serious as originally predicted, largely because many older people were already immune to it. And the NHS says it now circulates each year and is considered a normal seasonal flu strain, which is covered by the annual seasonal flu vaccine. A study in 2013 suggested between 123,000 and 200,000 people globally may have died as a result of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.Mers:\u0026nbspFirst identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome is also a coronavirus whose symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. With an estimated death rate of 35 per cent, the disease has killed 858 people, according to the WHO. Again, scientists think it spread to humans from bats, this time via camels.Exterminating bats blamed for Covid-19 ‘would increase disease risk’Ebola: A 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976, killing 11,300 people. Scientists say it began with a child in Guinea who came into contact with infected bats, but it has since been widely linked to the killing and butchering of bush meat, including monkeys, chimps, antelopes, fruit bats, porcupines and rats.Zika: First identified in Uganda in 1947 in monkeys, the mosquito-borne virus caused alarm in 2015, when it was thought to be the cause of thousands of cases of microcephaly – a shorter-than-normal head – in babies in Brazil. Outbreaks soon appeared throughout the Americas, Africa and other regions. It was thought to have killed 29 babies.Bird flu: Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, has many different strains but one of those, H7N9, has caused 1,568 cases in humans and 616 deaths worldwide since 2013, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.Another strain of the virus, H5N1, first identified in 1997, spread across east and southeast Asia, killing six people in Hong Kong and leading to vast swathes of chickens and turkeys – from Hong Kong to Britain – having to be culled early after contracting the disease. To date 861 cases of human H5N1 infection and 455 deaths have been reported.\u0026nbspThe highest number of infections and deaths were in Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand. The H5N1 virus, which has a 60 per cent mortality rate among infected humans, according to WHO, has not gone away, but is thought to have mutated.Bird flu has been linked to rapid intensification of the poultry industry, with thousands of birds crowded together indoors and with compromised immune systems.The Independent is campaigning against the wildlife trade at the core of the Covid-19 pandemic.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A new study finds that it may, although not enough to wipe out the pathogen or keep the pandemic from resurging in autumn.The study, done by ecological modellers at the University of Connecticut, understands the main natural weapon against the novel germ to be ultraviolet light — an invisible but energetic part of the sun’s electromagnetic spectrum that’s well-known for damaging DNA, killing viruses and turning healthy human skin cells into cancerous ones.“We found that ultraviolet light was most strongly associated with lower Covid-19 growth rates,” the scientists wrote in a publication that has not yet been peer-reviewed and that went online late Wednesday. Projections of the overall effects, they continued, suggest that the disease “will decrease temporarily during summer, rebound by autumn, and peak next winter”. But they cautioned that uncertainty about the study’s projected outcomes “remains high”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIndeed, though the pandemic’s spread has varied widely among countries, it was spreading swiftly in some experiencing hot weather, including Australia and parts of Iran.The new ecological analysis suggests that balmy days might aid — though not by themselves accomplish — the goal of social-distancing measures advised by public health officials.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastOther groups have sought to see if seasonal change would affect the virus that has spawned a pandemic, infecting more than 2 million people worldwide. Early this month, a committee of the National Academy of Sciences looked exclusively at humidity and temperature and found that they would have a minimal impact on the virus. The panel’s assessment contradicted popular accounts.At the White House coronavirus task force briefing Thursday evening, President Donald Trump highlighted research at the Department of Homeland Security that found that sunlight and disinfectants — including bleach and alcohol — can kill the coronavirus on surfaces in as little as 30 seconds.“Supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light,” Trump said, speculating on a possible means to fight the virus.While such an idea is currently far from the realm of a safe treatment, life scientists have long been aware that the sun threatens the viability of many microorganisms.“Sunlight kills most pathogenic microbes quite rapidly,” John Postgate, a British microbiologist, wrote two decades ago in the popular book Microbes and Man, published by Cambridge University Press. The lethality, he continued, is principally the result of “the ultraviolet component of solar radiation. Ultraviolet lamps can be used indoors to sterilise the air in operating theatres and pharmaceutical and microbiological laboratories. Even in diffuse daylight there is an appreciable amount of light of the effective wavelength”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailDuring the pandemic, because of the shortage of protective equipment, some medical centres have been using ultraviolet light to decontaminate masks so they could be reused. A small industry that sells ultraviolet lamps as a germicide has arisen, but experts warn of their potential dangers for humans.Many nonscientists — including Trump — have noted the seasonality of colds and flu and hoped the novel coronavirus would act likewise. Dr\u0026nbspRobert R\u0026nbspRedfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told National Public Radio last month that he, too, expected an ebb and flow of disease.“Most respiratory viruses have a seasonality to them,” he said. “It’s reasonable to hypothesise — we’ll have to wait and see — but I think many of us believe as we’re moving into the late spring, early summer season, you’re going to see the transmission decrease.”But he also pointed to the likelihood that the coronavirus would continue to be a problem in the fall, when it would coincide with the start of a new flu season.Comparative studies of viruses suggest that, as a class, coronaviruses are especially vulnerable to ultraviolet light because of their relatively large genetic codes.“The more target molecules,” one study noted, “the more likely the genome will be damaged.”Even so, other aspects of sunlight’s effects may also play important roles in whether viruses can easily infect humans — a main one being its promotion of the synthesis of vitamin D, a nutrient that can strengthen the immune system and lower the risk of certain illnesses.The Connecticut scientists, Cory Merow and Mark C. Urban,\u0026nbsptitled their paper “Seasonality and Uncertainty in Covid-19 Growth Rates”. It was posted on Wednesday on medRxiv, a preprint website for health scientists run by Yale University, the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, and the company that publishes the British Medical Journal. The site notes that its preprints have not undergone peer review for accuracy and thus “should not be used to guide clinical practice.”Mr Merow said that although the lethal effects of ultraviolet light on viruses are well known, he and his colleague were surprised to find a seasonal drop evident on a global scale.Mr Merow said he and his colleague had mined existing studies on how environmental and ecological factors correlate with virus infection rates and used them in ecological modelling of the global repercussions. Global data on temperatures, humidity, the penetration through the atmosphere of sunlight’s ultraviolet rays, population ages and densities, and Covid-19 infection counts were combined into a computer model that mapped out the seasonal trends, he said.Spacecraft to examine the Sun sends back its first findingsMr Merow noted that the study’s range of uncertainty was considerable, such that, depending on the location within the United States, the chance of seeing no viral slowdown in the summer ranged from 20\u0026nbspto 40 per cent.“There’s a lot of uncertainty,” he said of the reported seasonality.Even if coronavirus cases decline in the summer as his model projects, Mr Merow said, social distancing and other health public measures would still be necessary.In some circumstances, Mr Merow noted, summer days would offer no protection at all. For instance, window glass blocks ultraviolet rays.“If everybody sits next to one another on the bus and coughs,” he said, “ultraviolet light is not going to protect you.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The government will continue to challenge these views and to help communities unite.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It is a charity that has adapted with incredible speed to the crisis to help the most vulnerable in our community. In just five weeks, they have responded to the increased demand for food by quadrupling their output. We hope that our donation, coupled with the campaigning power of The Independent, will help the project grow and reach as many as possible of the one in five Londoners at risk of food poverty.”Another substantial contribution came in yesterday from the Julia and Hans Rausing Trust, which has assigned £16.5m\u0026nbspto charities at the forefront of the coronavirus pandemic and has donated £50,000 to our appeal.How to support our campaignJulia and Hans Rausing,\u0026nbspheirs of food packing giant Tetra Pak, said: “We have been impressed not only by the speed of The Felix Project’s response to the crisis, but the way in which they have managed to get a number of organisations working together to help people across the capital. Efforts like this support communities across London at this time of need, and we are glad to support their inspiring work.”We launched our appeal, in association with the Evening Standard, on Friday 27 March\u0026nbspand have reached £3m\u0026nbspthanks to the generous backing of dozens of London foundations, philanthropists and corporations, including Garfield Weston Foundation, Lansdowne Partners, the Westminster Foundation, Sir Peter Blake, Burberry, Eranda Rothschild Foundation, Citibank and investment holding company Temasek.More than 1,170 members of the public have contributed, donating £103,837 on our Virgin Money Giving page.But there is a sense that we are still in the foothills of the economic crisis, with experts warning the government that food poverty is about to get far worse. The Food Foundation has reported that eight million people in Britain face food insecurity and that three million have been missing meals since lockdown. The Institute for Social and Economic Research at University of Essex estimates that 6.5 million jobs could be lost in the coming months, causing a huge rise in demand for free food.As the biggest supplier of free food in London, The Felix Project has been operating 12 hours a day, six days a week, distributing surplus food to giant community hubs, including Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in Haringey, as well as to 80 charities and schools across the capital.The Independent\u0026nbspis encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

But as the country fights its greatest health crisis in a century, it also has an estimated three million people going hungry during the lockdown. The coronavirus pandemic has shown why the National Health Service is of such immense importance. What if there could be a National Food Service too?There is in fact a project bearing that very name. The National Food Service is a network of initiatives committed to tackling food insecurity, social isolation and food waste. It is currently made up of 13 branches stretching from Glasgow to Falmouth and over the last few weeks it has begun to forge new links all over the country. It will not stop there. “We think there should be a National Food Service in every city of the country. That’s the aim,” says Selina Treuherz, one of the activists behind the service.That may sound incredibly ambitious but Treuherz argues that the foundations of what the NFS is attempting to create already exist. Thousands of local groups have led the fight against hunger in their communities for the best part of a decade or more. “What we’re saying is we don’t need the state to come in and build a National Food Service,” she explains. “It’s just about working together to make it stronger and to strengthen the communities in the areas that need it most.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn practice, that means social eating spaces where those in need can come and enjoy a meal with others. “I feel like we are proving it can be done now,” Treuherz adds. “Our founding branch, Food Hall in Sheffield\u0026nbspwhere I volunteer, has been running for five years. We’ve been serving the community on a contribute-what-you-can basis. It might seem like a radical idea but it’s not at all. It’s just people helping each other with the means that they can.”A fully realised NFS would not be government-run like its health equivalent. Each existing branch in the network is autonomous. They share values, resources and the same overarching goal – to ensure that nobody goes hungry – but they operate independently and in different ways to each other. This means there is “not a single point of weakness”, Treuherz says, such as an over-reliance on central funding. The NFS is only beholden to the people it helps feed. “We’re built by each community for the community.”But the pandemic presents new challenges. An organisation designed to bring people together through food is now having to focus on merely feeding them and support is needed. NFS branches are still operating, making around 3,000 meals since the lockdown began and delivering food parcels to communities in need, but they have found that they are often required to step in where the response from local government is falling short.“If I’m honest, I’ve been on the helpline quite a lot and the government response is pretty shocking,” says Treuherz. “We’re getting a lot of people ringing up saying they’ve had one parcel and been told that’s their lot, and they’re on their own in the house.” The parcels supplied by councils have often been low on food. Even when the boxes are full, they can be of little nutritional value.Food waste has also increased following the wave of stockpiling at the beginning of the crisis. The branch at which Treuherz volunteers in Sheffield used surplus stock from supermarkets to help feed those in need but they are currently struggling to meet demand.\u0026nbsp“We actually can’t get enough food to feed enough people,” she says. “It’s really sad. You run out of food at the end of the day and you just can’t help everyone.”How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsTo help voluntary groups provide emergency food for those in need during the crisis, the NFS has petitioned the government with three demands: to offer more support for organisations tackling food insecurity to reduce barriers to immediate food access to protect community spaces and increase access to kitchen facilities. “It’s given about £3.25m to food waste groups which just is not nearly enough for a national effort,” explains Treuherz.But even in a pandemic, there are positives to be found. “Community groups are coming together, there’s this whole idea of mutual aid and food is playing an essential role in that,” she adds. “It’s really important that we build on this for the future and this doesn’t end at the end of Covid-19 because this is such an opportunity for change both within our food system and the rest of society,” she adds.Britain will look radically different after this crisis has passed. A national food service may need to be part of its landscape.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The city lived a normal life. People were sunbathing on the beach.”But the warning signs were there.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSoviet Union officials were driving the streets, hiding their monitors as they gauged the levels of radiation washing over the pedestrians they passed. Traders had been warned not to sell fresh greens and cabbages at the local market, and street sweepers were washing the streets with foam.But this had happened during a previous accident at the plant, of which there had been dozens in the past decade, and everything appeared to have been fine.Created with Sketch.Illegal tour of Chernobyl visits forgotten sites Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Evening in the ghost town of PripyatA gas mask hangs in a building inside the Chernobyl Exclusion ZoneRemains of Soviet propaganda in one of the barracks of the abandoned anti-aircraft base Volkhov near the Chernobyl NPPThe shell of a television stands inside a building in the Chernobyl exclusion zoneA children\u0027s play area inside the Chernobyl exclusion zoneA Soviet-era classroom in the Chernobyl exclusion zoneTourists inside the Chernobyl exclusion zoneDuga was a Soviet over-the-horizon (OTH) radar system used as part of the Soviet missile defense early-warning radar networkIn the Pripyat abandoned apartments you can still see the abandoned belongings of evacuated residents of the cityAmbulance car model RAF-2203 Latvija (nickname Rafik) on the background of the Medical Sanitary Unit 126 in Pripyat.

Rather than the collapse of the Berlin Wall, Chernobyl was “perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union”, he would later lament.But, as with the disaster itself, the true starting point of such catastrophe is hard to pinpoint.In the simplest sense, it began with a disastrous experiment during routine tests of reactor four. Technicians wished to see whether an emergency water-cooling system would work during a power outage and, shutting down the reactor’s emergency safety system, withdrew most of the control rods from its core while keeping the reactor running.Moments after their re-insertion, at 1.23am, the resulting reaction caused a partial meltdown in the core, summoning a large fireball that blew the 1,200-tonne concrete and steel lid from the reactor, which would spew roughly 400 times more radioactive material into the atmosphere than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.Two workers were immediately killed in the blast, which bent the plant’s thick concrete walls “like rubber”. Another plant worker, Sasha Yuvchenko,\u0026nbspwould later recall standing to watch as a pillar of blue ionising radiation ascended into the sky, “flooding up into infinity from the reactor”, reflecting:\u0026nbsp“I remember thinking how beautiful it was”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

According to Andreyev, who was working that night, their dosimeters were taken away and they were told told to wash their shoes in manganese solution before entering, suggesting the radiation on the streets of Pripyat was feared to be worse than inside the incinerated plant.The number of fatalities from this initial effort is still unknown, with the larger estimates suggesting 50 Soviet citizens lost their lives and scores more were hospitalised with gruesome and permanent injuries\u0026nbspas a result of their efforts to protect their community.\u0026nbspUntil late 1986, the official death toll would recognise only the two who died in the immediate blast.In those months, hundreds of thousands of emergency workers, troops, cleaners and miners were sent into the area during attempts to control the core meltdown and halt the spread of radioactive material, which\u0026nbspwould reach the US, China and northern Africa.Dubbed “liquidators”, some 600,000 workers seeking to contain the spread were given special status that provided compensation in the form of fiscal benefits and additional health care.While these liquidators\u0026nbspwere offered some compensation for their sacrifice, it appeared that Soviet authorities had known all along that there could be “accidents” at the nuclear plant.Documents published decades later by the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU), initially sent to the KGB in Moscow, suggested Chernobyl was subject to significant flaws throughout its construction, as early as its design stage, indicating materials used were sub-standard and that technicians often ignored safety regulations.In January 1979, a KGB report on the plant said: “According to operational data, there were deviations from design and violations of technology procedures during building and assembling works. It may lead to accidents”.The documents, released by the SBU in 2003, revealed that between 1977 and 1981\u0026nbspthere were 29 accidents at the nuclear plant.In 1982, another incident releasing what the documents described as “significant quantities of radiation” would lead officials to engage in a significant cover-up effort, but this relatively minor event\u0026nbspmerely foreshadowed the scale of the deception that would come four years later.While engineers and firefighters toiled to extinguish the blaze in the days following 26 April, officials sought to bury the true scale of the disaster from the outside world, and to uncover suspected foul play — interrogating first responders such as Yuvchenko\u0026nbspas they lay in hospital watching their bodies decay.The more immediate response was guided by a litany of deadly miscalculations from officials, whose dosimeters were unable to process the vast amounts of radiation, allowing them to believe the reactor remained intact.Some workers would defy orders, with Andreyev recalling how he and other colleagues, none of them wearing protective gear, shut off the other nuclear reactors in what he described as a lifesaving measure.Approximately 36 hours later, as officials began to acknowledge the huge scale of the problem, the order was given for Pripyat to be evacuated for three days. Most\u0026nbspresidents would never return.Efforts to downplay the scale of the disaster began within government itself — infamously exemplified by the Soviet\u0026nbspforeign affairs minister’s attempt\u0026nbspto allay a\u0026nbspmore senior official’s concern for residents’ health with the assertion that they were celebrating weddings, gardening, and “fishing in the Pripyat River”.Three days later, the alarm was raised by Sweden, where the radiation was picked up at a nuclear plant.The Soviet Union denied that an incident had occurred, but with\u0026nbspDenmark, Finland\u0026nbspand Norway also voicing concerns shortly afterwards, it eventually became impossible to hide the accident from the international community.However, Moscow continued to downplay the true scale of the catastrophe, failing to tell even its own citizens to stay indoors and allowing the capital’s May Day parade to go ahead a week later. The ensuing secrecy surrounding the handling of the disaster in the years that followed, and the reluctance to warn citizens of the scale of the danger they continued to face, means the true toll is continually being revised.The resulting suspicions\u0026nbspthat Moscow could not be trusted to tell the\u0026nbsptruth had directly devastating effects.It is believed that up to 200,000 women across western Europe chose to end wanted pregnancies on the mistaken advice of doctors who were mistrusting of the Soviet Union’s official line on radiation levels and who feared a possible rise in birth defects. There was no such increase in babies born with congenital defects, the World Health Organisation would conclude in 2005.One estimate by Kiev’s National Research Centre for Radiation Medicine suggests that in the former Soviet Union alone, five million people have suffered as a result of Chernobyl.More than 5,000 people who were children at the time\u0026nbspliving in the affected areas in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus, have since developed thyroid cancers, which the UN attributes to radiation exposure.While 330,000 people were moved out of the area, which now suffers far higher levels of poverty than other parts of the former Soviet Union, the upheaval proved “deeply traumatic” for many, according to the Chernobyl Forum.A 2005 report by the UN group found: “Even when resettlers were compensated and offered free houses, many retained a deep sense of injustice. Many are still unemployed, without a place in society and have little control over their lives. Some older resettlers may never adjust.”Amid decades\u0026nbspof concern of a predicted rise in cancers, clear scientific evidence of which is hard to ascertain, the psychological toll upon those still living in the affected zones is clear, with residents tending to be more likely to suffer with their mental health or alcohol abuse.Meanwhile, first responders are often forced to contend\u0026nbspnot only with the trauma of the event, but also a lingering stigma that has sometimes seen them shunned by peers fearful of a false radiation risk.“I try not to talk about it. I don’t want people to know about it,” Yuvchenko told the\u0026nbspNew Scientist\u0026nbspin 2004, at which point he still had to receive “constant” skin grafts.“I have been given two medals, an order of honour for my actions that night and a medal 10 years afterwards, but everybody got one of those.

There is a stigma attached to it.”In 2007,\u0026nbspa study of nearly 5,000 men involved in the cleanup effort between 1986 and 1991 found they suffered an increased risk of suicide, describing their findings as “concrete evidence that psychological consequences represent the largest public health problem caused by the accident to date”.It may have also proved fatal for the Soviet Union itself, which collapsed fewer than six years later — with the intermediate\u0026nbspperiod defined by public calls for greater transparency amid suspicions and anger over a perceived lack of public safety.Gorbachev, the last leader of the USSR, would define Chernobyl as a “turning point”, which “opened the possibility of much greater freedom of expression, to the point that the system as we knew it could no longer continue”. It would strengthen\u0026nbsphis conviction in pursuing his perestroika\u0026nbsp(”reformation”) and\u0026nbspglasnost\u0026nbsppolicies, which celebrated\u0026nbspthe openness of ideas after years of a USSR famed for its “culture of secrecy”.As these policies invited increasing criticism of the USSR, the apparent secrecy with which the Chernobyl disaster was handled gradually eviscerated people’s trust of their government, which eventually lost control to a public fraught with concern over radiation levels.While Chernobyl remains\u0026nbspa cautionary tale to governments the world over —\u0026nbspmany of whom financed a £1.5bn sarcophagus\u0026nbspto confine the reactor for another century, completed in 2019\u0026nbsp—\u0026nbspthe area itself is effectively a ghost town.Save for a few residents who refused to leave their homes, the 18-mile exclusion zone has gradually been repopulated by wildlife, including boars, wolves, beavers and bison.Despite the dangers posed by the area — which is expected to be contaminated\u0026nbspfor another 24,000 years — researchers have suggested the animals are flourishing because the radiation poses less risk than the presence of humans.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Tobacco kills,” Mr\u0026nbspVeran said, adding that more than 70,000 people die each year in France from smoking-related illnesses.The study also suggested that nicotine could prevent the virus from entering cells. The theory is that it could adhere to cell receptors, therefore blocking the virus and preventing it spreading in the body, according to Jean-Pierre Changeux from France’s Pasteur Institut, who also co-authored the study.The researchers are awaiting approval from health authorities to carry out further clinical trials.They plan to use nicotine patches on health workers at the hospital as a test.The sales restrictions are due to last until 11 May, when France is to begin easing lockdown measures and reopening schools.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At its best, the monarchy shines light on dark places, telling stories that would otherwise go untold and standing up for what’s right.It has been said that the Royal Family’s first obligation is to give back to the British people who fund them. I agree wholeheartedly. It is gravely concerning that these former royals, over many years, have sought to insulate themselves from taking accountability for what they say or do — even when they know it to be distorted,  and completely tone-deaf.When power is enjoyed without responsibility, the trust we all place in these very privileged people is degraded.It is a really hypocritical way of doing business and, quite frankly, it bores every corner of society.I have watched the Duke and Duchess of Sussex ditch crown and country at a time of need, by private jet, to make millions in Hollywood — for no good reason other than the fact they simply cannot bear the fair and honest reporting a free Press brings.With that said, please note I will not be engaging with Harry and Meghan’s PR spin. There will be no corroboration and zero engagement.This policy is also being instated for their long-suffering communications team. My heart truly goes out to their lone UK staffer James Holt, although I have far less sympathy for the dodgy practices offered by Hollywood PR company Sunshine Sachs— a side of the industry relating to celebrities readers never see.This policy is not about avoiding criticising Harry and Meghan.I’ll always be honest. It’s not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting.The media have every right to report on — and indeed, have an opinion on — the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad. But it can’t be based on their lies.I also want to be very clear: This is not in any way a blanket policy for all royals .I’m looking forward to working with other dukes and duchesses all over the country, engaging with members of the Royal Family senior and junior and young up-and-coming royalsto spotlight issues and causes that desperately need acknowledging.And I look forward to doing whatever I can to help further opportunities for more under-represented royals, who are needed now more than ever .What I won’t do is offer myself up to the constant spin, fact-twisting and putdowns of their family members I’ve had to put up with from Harry and Meghan’s long-suffering staff for the past two years.I’m that encouraged this new approach will be heard and respected.Sun readers deserve to know what’s REALLY going on.NETFLIX managed to achieve the impossible this week with sex-obsessed new reality show Too Hot To Handle.They found a cast of millennials more backstabbing, vain, stupid and horny than ITV have ever managed with Love Island, which looks totally tame in comparison.It’s the biggest mind-numbing abomination I’ve seen on television in a very long time.But can I be totally honest with you – I absolutely loved every minute. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The new forecasts are cataclysmically worse than anything yet predicted.Despite the best efforts of Chancellor Rishi Sunak and his bailouts, the collapse in our growth and the scale of job losses are starting to look apocalyptic.Previous talk of a speedy recovery once the lockdown lts has been worryingly complacent.For many it will come too late.The damage will be permanent.One top economist says it “has pushed the economy into a recession of unprecedented speed and depth”.Another says business activity has collapsed “at a rate vastly exceeding the global financial crisis, confirming fears that GDP will slump to a degree thought unimaginable”.Remember where Britain was three months ago before Covid blindsided us.We were a powerhouse with minimal unemployment, jobs at historic highs, inflation low and pay rising healthily.We are now in deep trouble, like never before,we cannot get back to work.The Sun still backs the lockdown, while there remain so many deaths and the risk of a second, bigger wave of infections which could yet overwhelm the NHS.But it is vital the Government, despite its admirable determination to save lives, maintains focus on the immense harm being done to the country’s future.It needs an urgent strategy to mitigate that, alongside one to emerge from the lockdown as fast and safely as possible.Neither HS, at £billion, or our £billion foreign aid budget can surely now be sustainable.Tax cuts look crucial to fuel a spending and jobs revival.Meanwhile the public, admirably doing its bit by staying home, must also be alive to this economic meltdown.We must follow the social-distancing rules and wear masks where needed.But we should also be clamouring to get back to our jobs before they cease to exist.CAN you imagine what we’ll look like after six months without a decent haircut When the salons reopen there will be a stampede. Hairdressers will be instantly elevated to key worker status.We’ll bang pots and pans for them in the street every Thursday at pm.Before that we’re all going to have to learn to use scissors and clippers fast.If it goes wrong at least we’ll have masks to hide behind.IT’S not often we congratulate employment tribunals for their common sense.But one saw right through tech exec Rachel Power’s claim that she was sexually discriminated against by a boss who told her: “You got balls.”Everyone  knows it’s harmless slang for having guts.As for bringing a case over it . . . that really is a load of balls.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.

At the age of , I don’t want to be dragged around the dancefloor by the long-suffering Anton du Beck, showing off my knickers like Ann Widdecombe.I reckon the idea I might be involved in Strictly all started because of the ­glorious pro dancer Luba Mushtuk, who was paired with Olympic rower James Cracknell, last year and exited far too soon.We met each other at the Jason Vale health retreat, below, in February, where people go to recharge their batteries.It feels like a letime ago that we were all enjoying long walks, yoga and exercise classes, making new friends along the way.Luba very kindly gave us all a Strictly masterclass. I’ll never forget the hilarious lessons out in the sunshine – with a view of the lakes and hearing everyone’s laughter.Although I really enjoyed myself, it made me realise I could never, ever be a contestant on Strictly.My role is to watch the show from the comfort of my sofa with a large glass of wine and a jumbo bag of Revels.It is easy to criticise the ministers and health experts fighting Covid-.They must make le-or-death decisions with the information available and haven’t always got it right.But they are also human beings.This week England’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Dr Jenny Harries, told me she had been struck down by the virus, probably the day after Prime Minister Boris Johnson tested positive, and it left her feeling frail.With classic understatement, she called it an “unpleasant” experience.She was looked after by her children, one of whom is a junior doctor, and had to stay off work for ten days.This will have given her even greater insight into the disease and empathy with patients and their families.But it also makes us realise that behind the daily pm briefings are real people just trying to do their best.I’M still baffled by what to do when it comes to wearing a face mask.EvenI could get one, I don’t want to deprive a worker in the NHS, a care home or public transport, as these grafters are the priorities.We are told by some thatwe stay at home, and social-distance when we go out to the shops or for a bit of exercise, we don’t need to wear a mask.But that can feel problematicyou’re out shopping or on a bus or train.I will be making my own mask from the simple DIY instructions printed in The Sun earlier this week – it will be much better than nothing.But right now, there’s confusion and doubt, and it must be cleared up fast.NO ONE wants to put extra pressure on the NHS, and figures show we haven’t been going to AE or phoning ambulances unless we’re severely ill, which is laudable.But you can go too far.I would urge anyone who happens upon a lump or something suspicious to get help right away.Cancer specialists report a drastic fall in the number of people seeking help and fear a huge increase in cancer cases.So don’t think you are being a nuisance.A drastic, unexplained weight loss, a lump or change in a breast, or anything amiss with the testicles, must NEVER be ignored.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In Sweden, they say that everyone should rub up against one another when shopping, while in France they are ­ordering everyone to stay inside for another three weeks. Some boffins say that testing is the answer to Covid-. Some say it isn’t.Some say  is the age where you most need to worry. Some say it’s .Some say the virus will be wiped out by summer weather. Others say it won’t.And meanwhile, everyone is sitting at home thinking, “Can you lot make up your bloody minds.”But that’s the point of science. There should never be a ­consensus.Everything should constantly move as new discoveries are made. Emc until someone proves that it doesn’t.My colleague Rod Liddle explained last weekend that when the first atom bomb was about to be tested, none of the utterly brilliant men who’d designed it could agree on what would happen.Some said the explosion would be small. Some said it would be massive.One thought it might set the ­atmosphere on fire. One said it wouldn’t work at all.Today, we are told that all of science is agreed on global warming.We hear it IS happening and it IS our fault. No argument is allowed.History has taught us that this is ­dangerous.A hundred years ago, someone came up with a new idea called eugenics.The idea was that the human race was doomed because too many black and ­stupid people were having babies.We can see now that this is lazy, racist nonsense but back then it was a ­dferent story.Boffins at all the most prestigious ­institutions in America were captivated by it.They worked on it at Yale and ­Hard. Millions was spent on research.The greatest minds were taken in, Nobel Prize winners among them.HG Wells supported it and so did George Bernard Shaw and Alexander ­Graham Bell.Legislation was passed to promote it.Winston Churchill believed in it, as did US presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow ­Wilson.So just like global warming, we had an idea backed by leading politicians and many top celebrities.And anyone who said it was stupid was told to shut up.“We have science on our side” they screamed.Yeah, but they also had Hitler on their side.He believed so ­passionately in eugenics, he came up with the Aryan Nation, built concentration camps and murdered six ­million Jews.Be glad then that scientists can’t agree on what to do about Covid-.It shows they are ­thinking. When they say they all agree, it shows they’re not.EVERY European country has dferent ideas about which businesses can re-open next week and which ones cannot.But they’d all really like to give the green light to one thing: Hairdressers.I realise, of course, that everyone has now reverted to their original hair colour and that in Scotland it’s easy to spot the ginger roots of recession.But I just can’t see why this matters so much. And then I saw that picture of Pierce Brosnan . . .TO mark something called Earth Day , Prince Charles has said that in future we should put the “people and the planet” first.Hmmm. Not sure that’s going to work. Because what the planet wants and what people want are two very dferent things.What people want is to be warm and comfortable. We also want to be happy, which means we want a new sofa from DFS, a nice car, a couple of holidays every year and a fridge full of ice-cold beer.Charles would probably argue that the “people” he’s talking about are those who live in mud huts in Africa and Asia and bits of South America.Right. So what do they want  Well, I’m fairly sure thatyou asked them, they’d say they’d like a new sofa, a nice car, a holiday or two and a fridge full of ice-cool beer.That means we must build power stations and roads for them.We must dam their rivers and pull down their jungles to make way for sewerage and water pipes and factories and hospitals and shopping centres.I’m fairly confident then thatwe put people first, the planet is going to feel like we’ve trodden on its toe.I WAS out on my tractor this week, doing a safe and steady mph on a narrow country lane, when I noticed in one of the seven rear view mirrors that behind me, there was a small army of cyclists who couldn’t get past.Ooh, I was happy.I was so happy in fact, that when I got home, I drove right past the drive so that I could keep them all behind me a little bit longer.Payback.It’s so, so sweet.COUNCIL chiefs in Manchester say that the city has been so lovely and quiet these past few weeks that they are thinking of banning cars for ever.Really  You want to stop all those Cheshire boys coming into the city centre on a Friday night with their Ferraris and Bentleys Good luck with that.THIS week, we read about a builder who’d kept his we happy by turning his dumper truck into a luxury bath.He’d even used a drill attachment to create bubbles.Very clever but I knew a man in Doncaster back in the day who made his kids a swimming pool out of a skip.He tilted it so there was a deep end and even put a brazier underneath, so it was fully heated.WHETHER you’re doing a house-party or video conferencing with colleagues, it’s critically important you get the background correct.Tory MPs using Skype to do interviews on the evening news usually put themselves in front of a book case.This tells us they are wise and well read.Celebrities usually make sure there’s a bit of zebra skin in the shot and a pickled shark or two on the wall.This week, my friend Trinny Woodall hosted a live online make-up tutorial from her bathroom.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Doubtless she made sure the background was spick and span. And it was. Right up to the moment when her partner, Charles, , walked into the back of shot. Naked. Stuff like that can happen to anyone who’s not careful.Last week, I hosted an online general knowledge quiz. No one got any of the questions right. They were all too busy staring at the mountain of champagne over my shoulder.Tragically, I’d bought it for the guests at my th birthday party a couple of weeks ago.

It is simply ludicrous to have a ­London test centre not working to capacity and tests potentially being delayed because they are being sent to Belfast.“This is symptomatic of the ­Government’s slow and chaotic response.“The public deserve answers, not least why testing in the UK is so low compared to some countries.“These revelations strengthen the case for an independent inquiry, once we are through this crisis, to officially review the Government’s actions.”Health Secretary Matt Hancock has admitted hitting his target of , tests a day by Thursday will be challenging.Soon after he set it, pictures appeared from around the country of near-empty test centres, including stadium sites in Twickenham, Coventry and Brighton.To add to the problems, until last week, key workers who wanted to be tested had to approach their employers.They then arranged the test through crisis planning bodies called local resilience forums — set up in  to help co-ordinate responses to emergencies such as pandemics, flooding and terrorism.The Government published a list of the forums but there is no ­mention of Covid- on many of the forums’ web pages.And last week, it emerged that consultants Deloitte — who played a key role in setting up the drive-through centres — were being criticised after test results of NHS staff were lost or sent to the wrong people.Frontline NHS staff showing symptoms were first tested at the end of last month, followed by other healthcare workers including GPs and paramedics.Those that tested negative were allowed toto work.Last week, the programme was widened to allow all key workers who suspect they or their families may have Covid- to be tested. Under the new system, employers and staff can apply online for a test directly.However, Downing Street has admitted that there is no way of checking whether those applying for a test are genuinely eligible.Yesterday, long queues built up at some drive-through sites after , people tried to book tests.Home-testing kits became unavailable yesterday, with , allocated within two minutes.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Dr Simon Eccles, the Chief Clinical Information Officer for Health and Care and the Deputy CEO of NHSX, tweeted: “Home kits all booked by :!“I know it’s frustrating but we’re developing more lab, supply and logistics capacity every day.“If we’d waited until we had the full k, to launch, no one would have had a test today.“More home kits again tomorrow, even more next week.”Figures from the Department of Health showed there were , daily tests carried out for coronavirus on , people. However, the figures only go up to am on Friday so do not cover the new regime. The full impact of the new system is expected to take a few days to filter through.The network of  drive-through centres is soon to rise to  and so-called Lighthouse Labs will start work in Milton Keynes, Glasgow and Alderley Park in Cheshire.An ,-strong force to trace the contacts of those infected is also being trained.A Department of Health spokesman said: “Testing sites across the country have capacity for hundreds of tests a day and the North Greenwich site has exceeded  tests a day more than once this week.”Currently in Salisbury, Southport and Teesside, they take just  minutes to set up and can do hundreds of tests a day. Results take  hours.Testing Minister Lord Bethell said: “Everyone who needs a coronavirus test should be able to have access to one.“We now have the ability to provide more people with the certainty they need to get back to the front line when it is safe to do so.”The Royal Mail said transporting tests was done after consultation with chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty.It added: “All Royal Mail Group networks are being used to get testing kits back to Northern Ireland, either via ferry or flight.“The testing kits are packaged safely for the appropriate classication. The health of our colleagues is our first priority.”We are backing a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.” SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Is raising taxes the wrong approach or the Governments only option One surprise of this crisis has been how easily Britons have accepted the lockdown . Some people seem to positively enjoy it.To some it brings back the spirit of the Blitz a feeling of solidarity. To others fewer cars and planes are an indication of the more green lestyle we ought to be living.Its good that people have managed to cope with these restrictions. But when polls indicate that many people would be prepared to put up with a y extension of the lockdown I begin to worry.An economic interruption of this kind carries massive costs and can only be borne for a limited period. Any extension will become extremely dficult for the economy to bear.The OBR, the Governments independent forecaster, floated the possibility of a fall in output of the economy of  per cent for the period April to June.That is beyond anything that has previously been imagined. It wasn’t a definite forecast butit happened the effects on jobs and living standards would be more than devastating.Some describe this economic crisis as the worst in modern times. It may be the worst ever. That doesn’t mean we cant recover. We can and we certainly will.But its important to be patient. Commentators talk about the economy bouncing back, a so called V shaped recovery.This seems unlikely The economy may bounce back but only up to a certain point not necessarily the same point as before. Some firms will have gone out of business, others will have run up debts, some have missed orders that aren’t repeated.How long all these problems last depends on the lockdown. The longer the lockdown, the deeper the downturn. So it is vitally urgent that the Government relax the lockdown as soon as the scientists feel that the peak of the epidemic has been flattened and that it is appropriate.This isn’t about choosing the economy or lives. A flattened economy costs lives too. Even when we relax the lockdown many will still be nervous and may not want to go out to spend money.The continuing need for social distancing will pose problems for hospitality and other businesses and hold back a full recovery. Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor has been bold, promising to do “whatever it takes” to steer the economy through these perilous waters.His scheme for furloughing jobs with the Government paying up to £ a month of peoples wages has helped to prevent firms getting rid of people that they could not afford But it is eye wateringly expensive with costs estimated at up to £billion.Clearly it cannot continue indefinitely. Ironically the generosity of the scheme may have anaesthetised the public to the scale of the crisis we are facing.Butthe Government lts some of the restrictions soon and the economy starts to recover , what should the Chancellor do in his Budget in November  Of course we don’t know exactly what the figures will look like and we must wait to see before final judgements.Almost certainly he will be confronting a massively reduced economy, groaning under skyscraping debt, higher unemployment and only a gradual recovery.Horric as the borrowing figures will be it would be a mistake to move quickly to reduce the debt before the recovery is firmly established.He should let borrowing take the strain in the short term. Any measures to rein in the deficit should be for later. In order to boost jobs he might cut National Insurance or make a temporary cut in VAT designed to bring forward spending.Keir Starmer gave a menacing hint of his approach when he said there would have to be “a day of reckoning” and hinted at tax increases on the better off as though they were to blame.That would be precisely the wrong approach. As the economy gets back to maybe  per cent of where it was before the Chancellor needs to do all he can to support business.He has recently given some generous help to new high tech start ups. Well and good, but it will be important to continue to support existing businesses.It should never be forgotten that firms that have failed in this crisis have not failed though any fault of their own. This down turn is not a normal recession caused by market forces, a rise in interest rates or overheating.No this recession and the bankruptcies have been caused by the Government’s measures rightly introduced to contain the virus. So the Government should not feel embarrassed about continuing some of their schemes to support inidual businesses and indeed they have a duty to do so.The Chancellor sets the framework but ultimately growth does not come from Governments, it comes from iniduals and firms. The way to growth and recovery is to give them the freedom and the incentives and the rest will follow.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers. The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM. No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here: www.thesun whocareswinsappeal.Raising taxes in the current climate is not something the Government is likely to want to do.But the scale of the economic crisis now gripping the UK means they may end up feeling they have little option.So far the Chancellor has done what he had to do to protect businesses and workers from enforced shutdowns. The cost will have to come from somewhere.It is estimated the furloughing scheme alone will cost at least £billion. At the same time, tax receipts have noseed as earnings have decreased and fewer people are spending in the shops.As a result, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that public- sector borrowing will increase by an eye-watering £billion above the earlier forecast.The black hole in the country’s finances left by Covid- means that at some point, the Chancellor is going to have to face the uncomfortable issue of whether taxes will go up.Any rises must be set against the need to ensure nothing chokes the ­economic recovery, which will be vital.We must also guard against hitting the most hard-up in society. And ­crucially, we need to ensure we don’t make it unprofitable for dynamic small companies to operate.One option for the Chancellor is to target the big multi-nationals and billionaires who use tax havens to avoid paying their fair share.Yet we will also need to have big business on our side as we try to recover, so it is a delicate balancing act.Our priority right now still has to be protecting the vulnerable and health workers from another Covid- outbreak.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.But it is time too for the Government to think seriously about how to restart the economy as quickly as possible.Two days ago came news that Jaguar and Aston Martin will restart production in May. The Chancellor needs to help other companies follow suit.The more successful he is, the likelier he will be able to limit the number of extra taxes he has to raise in the months ahead.We are backing a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.” SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He accused UK ministers of being nervous about being drawn into a similar conversation for fear of undermining the message to stay at home. Mr Drakeford said: The UK Governmentaposs position does seem to be that having announced a further three weeks of lockdown then the public wonapost be hearing from them again until very close to the end of that time period. Now I understand that they are nervous to be entering into this conversation publicly in case it dilutes the core message that we are still in lockdown, and they are nervous of moving into a dferent situation in case it undercuts that message. But in Wales, which is a much smaller place, we are always in conversations with one another, I have taken the view that it is more important to share our thinking with the Welsh public and for them to be part of that conversation.” Insisting Cardf had “worked closely with the rest of the UK throughout the pandemic”, he said: “Publishing the framework is part of our contribution to that work.” It came  hours after Scottish counterpart Nicola Sturgeon said lting restrictions north of the border would be phased.

In her first major intervention since being appointed to party leader Keir Starmeraposs top team, Jo Stevens called for the Government to honour a  manesto pledge to fund the vital leline for over-s.Writing exclusively for the Mirror, she said: “ Labour are pushing for the licence fee to be protected indefinitely.“The Government should do the right thing – step in and guarantee free licences for over-s for good.” Ms Stevens, who previously sat on the Commons Culture Select Committee, became Labouraposs third Shadow Culture Secretary in six months when she was handed the role.She called on Boris Johnson to take back control of funding the £.-a-year TV licence for millions of OAPs who face being stripped of the benefit on August . The Conservatives pledged at the  election to protect free licences for the rest of that Parliament, which was due to run until . But the BBC had already been handed responsibility for funding the leline from June , under a deal stitched up in .

Age UK charity director Caroline Abrahams said: “We are really pleased that the first act of new Shadow Culture Secretary Jo Stevens is to support the important cause of keeping TV licences free for our over-s.  “The BBC Board’s decision to delay rollout of their planned scheme until August was very welcome but this needs to be extended to the end of  – and sooner rather than later. “This would put older people’s minds at rest and makes good sense from a practical perspective too. “Older people have more than enough to worry about at the moment without having to get to grips with a new approach to TV licences and finding the cash to pay another big annual bill many can ill-afford.” Welcoming Ms Stevensapos intervention, head of the Bectu broadcasting union Philippa Childs said: “During the Covid- crisis the BBC has more than proved its value to the nation and has fulfilled its public service duty to inform, educate and entertain to an exemplary standard. “It has been a leline to the over-s who, due to increased vulnerability, have had to undergo strict isolation to protect themselves from the virus and will likely have to still do so for the foreseeable future.  “For many, the voice of the BBC will be the only one they hear for days on end. “The Government must accept that the BBC has played its part in supporting the over-s by continuing to fund free licences during the lockdown at a cost of around £million a month. “It’s now time for the Government to commit to taking back the responsibility and the cost of funding this welfare benefit that is crucial to so many over-s on our society.” Dennis Reed, director of the Silver Voices campaign group, said: “It is fantastic news that the new Shadow Secretary is supporting the free TV licence campaign as her first act in office.

The tests come following a breakthrough by scientists at the University of Oxford, who are working for the Government-backed Rapid Testing Consortium and believe the test is % effective, Mail Online reports. However, the World Health Organisation warned only yesterday that there is no evidence people who develop antibodies after recovering from Covid- are immune to a second infection, casting doubts over a lockdown exit strategy which relies on the tests. The pinprick tests are expected to cost £ and could be rolled out as soon as June. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here They work by taking a small sample of blood for analysis and can provide results in as soon as  minutes. Similarly to a pregnancy test,two lines appear, users will know they have antibodies which may be able to help to fight off the killer bug. If one line appears, it means a person either does not have antibodies produced in response to coronavirus or that the test has not worked. Speaking to Mail Online, a Government source said: This could be the game changer – a breakthrough moment to help us turn the tide on the virus. The lateral flow test has been designed by analysing the blood of patients who have been infected with Covid- but have displayed few or no symptoms. The Rapid Testing Consortium believes it could deliver up to  million tests a week by the summer, meaning a total of  million by next year. Its leader, Jonathan Allis, said: We are close to picking up % of all cases where people have antibodies. Now it is just a question of scaling up the manufacturing process. Health Minister Lord Bethell said: This is a great story of how our manufacturers are stepping up to the challenge of Covid, and I am hopeful that their product will make an impact in our battle against this terrible disease.  It is understood that key workers would be first in line to be eligible for the new tests. However, WHO has warned governments against issuing immunity passports or risk-free certicates to people who have survived Covid- as their accuracy cannot be guaranteed. The UN body says the practice could actually increase the risks of continued spread, as people who have recovered may ignore advice about taking standard precautions against the virus.

My sister and I have loved everything about theatre for as long as we can remember. We were around three when we pointed at the TV and said, ‘We want to be in there!’ Both sets of grandparents had danced, and our mother was an actress. Our dad also did all sorts of dferent sketches, so we were immersed in performing from a young age. We were able to attend a local dance school in Yorkshire and from there we worked on ious ITV dramas. Emily was in Annie on tour when she was six, and we worked on Chitty Chitty Bang Bang together. Mum would take us on the train to London, but in terms of stage schools, there wasn’t anything outside of London for us. Even when my sister and I played the Dolly sisters in Mr Selfridge as teenagers – our last acting job – we went back and forth all the time from Yorkshire to London. We both ended up going to uni, but decided to run a drama workshop for kids during the summer holidays while back home with mum. We put a call out for children aged -, sayingthey wanted the opportunity to work with people in the industry they could come along, and we got an overwhelming response.  It was a one-off workshop that covered all theatre skills and both us and the kids loved it. That got us thinking. There were stage schools that had opened up north, but we wanted to do something unique, inclusive and affordable. We decided to try and get our idea, Stagebox, started once we’d finished university. We literally put our own money into a small studio. It was important to us that we were self-starters. Our dad, who passed away last year, was a businessman, and he taught us to have a strong work ethic, so we were inspired to do it all ourselves. We wanted to run short, intensive courses and to create the industry experience that we knew kids got in London. Entry into Stagebox is by audition-only as opposed to paid-for enrolment. It’s what sets us apart. That’s really just to assess their love for it. We saw , children last year, and we have  places per ision, so it’s competitive.  This year we have some exciting celebrity guests, but at first we had local theatre show directors to help us out. We’re looking for potential. Some children have never done a class in their le, but they may have natural star quality. I can spot it by the way some kids act in the queue. It’s just a sparkle that lights up a room. The audition day mirrors our curriculum. If they’re offered a place, the four weeks is a mixture of musical theatre, television and film training, with some video shoots and audition preparation weeks. A lot of people associate child stars with pushy parents, but this isn’t the case. Both the parents and children need to be resilient, and as the industry can seem quite closed, we’re conscious to make it all feel friendly and relaxed. Our experience of being child actors obviously helps us. We definitely had nerves at auditions when we were growing up, but it’s the people in the room who put you at ease.  We always say to the kids to be their best, because their best is good enough for us. They will probably remember their first audition for the rest of their lives, so we have to make it positive. For many, it has been. We’re so proud of our success stories and love seeing our kids do well. When we met Matthew Illesley, now , he had come along from Gloucester with his siblings, who were actually the ones auditioning. But we saw him in the queue and said he had that natural star quality. Two years later he landed Rocket Man, where he played a young Elton John. One of our girls, Isobel Khan, gave us such a proud moment with her role as Annie in the West End. She came to Stagebox with no previous experience, very young, and she had an amazing voice, but again she took many years to achieve what she did. She ended up going to Toronto on tour with the show, and was the first mixed race Annie. To have ersity on stage is so important. At one point we had all three Annies in the West End, sharing the leading role at the same time.  One of our students, Millie Kiss, has a story that’s without doubt the saddest moment for Stagebox. She lost her mum in the Manchester bomb attacks. We all knew and loved Michelle, and I think she would be so proud of what Millie has achieved, and her resilience. She went to France, out of that tragedy, and she’s now shooting a feature film, and she’s away, independent and hard-working. That is what makes her a true star, she hasn’t let what happened define her. We’re so passionate about children from all backgrounds being able to access training and opportunities. We’re actually just about to launch a government-funded scheme to help with this. To add to that, we do a monthly membership plan, which meanspeople can’t afford it, we break down the costs. It depends on the location, but we have an extensive scheme of scholarships and bursaries. We fund them ourselves from our savings, so where children are on scholarships from low-income backgrounds, we also pay for their travel, their lunch and unorm and other things, to make sure everyone is treated the same.  The children are all professionally chaperoned to auditions, and sometimes the parents are allowed to go with them when they film. They’re looked after very well by the production teams. In the last five years, we’ve been doing such extensive casting processes that we were approached to cast children ourselves, which is where our second company, Keston  Keston, was formed.

In the UK, one high-population part of the countrycontributed to the early increase whereas the whole country is contributing to this later phase in death rates. #xCIf we assume that the risk of death is similar across the country , then non-London deaths will have been increasing whilst London-ones were starting to decline. #xCAt last we are starting to see declines in deaths outside Londonso the decline in death rate may accelerate, but never at a rate to match the initial rate of increase. The same will be true for Italy where the north contributed to the rapid increase but the whole country is contributing to the slower decline in deaths.#xD :Rob Burrow continues fight against Motor Neurone Disease in coronavirus lockdownRob Burrow wants to play his part in the battle against Motor Neurone Disease after revealing the impact the coronavirus pandemic is having on research into the condition.The former Leeds scrum-half, , was diagnosed with MND in December, before playing in an emotional final fund-raising game for the Rhinos just weeks later.Now he is getting behind a push for the Government to accelerate approval for a new treatment for the disease, NurOwn, that has passed the first two phases of three stage trials in America.An online petition has racked up over , signatures in a matter of days, with the target being , so that it will be considered for debate in Parliament.Click here to .Rob Burrow hopes a new drug in America could help people with Motor Neurone Disease : families take part in socially distanced mass danceAround  families have taken part in a socially-distanced mass dance in Dublin.Spaces were marked out eight feet apart, the organiser said.

More than  people have been recruited for the trial which would break recordsclaims it could deliver a marketable by September are met. Dr Granato told the BBC after being injected on her nd birthday: Iaposm a scientist, so I wanted to try to support the scientic process wherever I can. Since I don’t study viruses, I felt a bit useless these days, so I felt like this is a very easy way for me to support the cause. Cancer researcher Edward OaposNeill was also injected on Thursday. But rumours began circulating earlier today that efforts had been hit by a tragic set back. An online article, soon debunked as fake news, claimed the zoology expert had died hours after having the injection after experiencing complications. It ly claimed she had pre-existing medical conditions that had not been disclosed to doctors carrying out the tests and that four others were battling complications.  The spread of the article forced Dr Granato to take to Twitter to inform her , followers she was very much alive. She said: Nothing like waking up to a fake article on your death... Iaposm doing fine everyone. Please donapost share the article in question, we donapost want to give them attention   clicks. Have a cute cat instead!has approached Dr Granato for a comment.  A spokesperson for the Department of Heath and Social Care later tweeted: News circulating on social media that the first volunteer in a UK  coronavirus vaccine trial has died is completely untrue. Of those chosen for the Oxford trial half will receive the Covid- vaccine, and half will receive a control vaccine that protects against  meningitis  - but not coronavirus. The design of the trial means patients will not know which vaccine they have received, but medics will. Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the Jenner Institute, led the pre-trial research and said she was % confident the vaccine would be effective. She said: Personally I have a high degree of confidence in this vaccine. Of course, we have to test it and get data from humans. We have to demonstrate it actually works and stops people getting infected with coronavirus before using the vaccine in the wider population. The vaccine is made from a weakened version of the common cold virus taken from chimpanzees and has been adapted so it cannot grow in humans.  After being injected into the patient, it enters the cells which start to produce coronavirus proteins. This them kick-starts the immune system, prompting it to produce antibodies to activate killer T-cells that destroy the infection. If a patient goes to encounter coronavirus again, the same antibodies and T-cells are triggered to target and stamp out the virus. In the coming months the two groups will be compared to seethe trial has been successful.

As the death toll among NHS staff and private care employees soared to  tonight, it brought home the appalling dangers these heroes face daily. And that is why today the Sunday Mirror is launching a campaign for a scheme to be launched to reward them now – the same way in which our brave troops are paid more for risking death in combat. We are calling for a special daily allowance to be paid immediately to nurses, doctors, support staff and care workers who are putting their lives on the line to get us through the coronavirus crisis. Our campaign will be taken up in Parliament on Monday in a Commons motion tabled by senior Labour MP Jon Trickett. He said: “Health workers are our first defence in the fight against this disease. They need better help now.” Mr Trickett, a former Shadow Cabinet minister, said: “Next week is May Day. “What better way to celebrate the new month and the internationally recognised workers’ day than by supporting this excellent initiative by the Sunday Mirror ” And Fire Brigades Union leader Matt Wrack added: “Clapping is great, but clapping is not enough.” Delivering the special supplement would be based on the extra tax-free daily operational allowance given to our Armed Forces in war zones. Acting Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said: “I fully support the Sunday Mirror’s campaign to recognise the bravery of ­Britain’s health and care workers. “ The GMB union, which represents more than , workers in the NHS and care sector, also backed us. National Secretary Rehana Azam said: “If we are really serious about valuing these workers they absolutely need a service allowance now.”The calls for more cash came as tributes were paid to two of the latest health heroes to give their lives. Married dad Larni Zuniga, , who was a senior nurse at a care home, died at St Thomas’ Hospital in London, where PM Boris Johnson was treated. Larni, of Godalming, Surrey, was hailed by his NHS theatre nurse cousin Christian as “a true professional who touched the lives of many”.His we Edith said he was now “enjoying Heaven” while daughter Mutya said: “I can’t stop crying. It’s too painful.” Meanwhile it emerged that the most recent victims had included a nurse who had kept bravely working at . Mahadaye Jagroop, who was known as Mary, died at Birmingham’s Heartlands Hospital, where she had cared “relentlessly” for corona patients. Former colleague Thalia Zong wrote in a tribute to her: “The memory of you and your beautul smile, which has always inspired me, will continue to do so through these tough times.”While it is now widely acknowledged that all frontline workers deserve a better deal pay reviews would take time to be introduced. This way those most at risk in caring for corona victims would get extra cash in their pockets now. There is precedent for finding money immediately. When banks faced collapse during the financial crash of October  they got an instant £billion in bailouts.And with , nursing jobs unfilled, frontline medical staff were already overstretched even before the corona crisis began. Our nurses on £. an hour get less than in other countries. In Germany, for example, they get £. an hour. Australia pays nurses £. an hour, Italy £., Norway £. and Sweden £. – almost twice what ours get. Hospital support staff are on pitully poor earnings with porters, healthcare assistants and cleaners getting around just £, a year. Living Wage Foundation director Katherine Chapman said: “Care work is a huge industry with around a million workers supporting some of the most vulnerable people in society, often for incredibly low pay. Now there is a real opportunity to create lasting change in the sector.” Many carers are paid what the Government calls its National Living Wage – the legal minimum for workers aged  and over – of £. an hour.

Trudi Stonard,  from Walsall, West Midlands, was “lucky to survive” after she was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, a condition which causes inflammation of the colon and rectum. In just  weeks, her condition escalated to “le-threatening” and surgeons spent six hours removing her bowel which was so inflamed it was like “it was on fire”. The mum-of-two started experiencing extreme stomach pain in December . She was even in agony when she ate a packet of crisps.She was misdiagnosed with irritable bowel syndromebut Trudi feared it was more serious when she started passing blood after eating “one bite of KFC”.Trudi dropped from st lb to st lb and her son Leonard, now seven, refused to go near her because she looked “unrecognisable”. She underwent surgery to remove her part of her colon and replace it with a stoma bag at New Cross Hospital, Wolverhampton, in February . Despite the damage to her insides, Trudi managed to “miraculously” fall pregnant with her son Bobby-Jo, now four, and has learnt to embrace her stoma. Trudi said: “In the space of  weeks I went from a normal person, to someone with a stoma bag. “The surgeon met me after my surgery and said he’d never seen a colon that bad. “In fact, it look so inflamed, it he said it looked like it was on ‘fire’. “He said: ‘I just wanted to stamp on it and put it out.’ While I was suffering from colitis, I lost around five stone. I lost so much weight people thought I was anorexic.  Itaposs been a dficult adjustment but Iaposve learnt to love my stoma bag. If someone offered to reverse it tomorrow Iaposd so no - itaposs part of who I am now. In December , Trudi started getting stomach pain and going to the loo more frequently. Things escalated in a matter of weeks until everything she ate was leaving her in agony and was rapidly losing weight. Trudi was diagnosed with IBS but she knew suspected it was more serious after she tucked into a takeaway. After ‘one bite’ she rushed to the toilet where she saw blood ‘flowingapos from her behind. Trudi said: “I never had any problems with my stomach until February. “Anything I ate, from a small snack to a meal, was leaving me in agony. Even a packet of crisps caused this crushing pain that felt like I was going to be sick.  “I went to my GP but said it was just IBS and gave me buscopan but nothing helped. “One night I tried to eat some KFC, I had one bite of chicken and I had to dash to the toilet where I saw blood literally flowing from my behind. Trudi went to New Cross Hospital, Wolverhampton, West Midlands, where doctors suspected she had food poisoning and sent home. Two days later she collapsed and her mum Jill Stonard, , rushed her to AE while she was ‘screaming’ in pain. Trudi said: When doctors said it was food poisoning and I thought: ‘That makes sense.’ “I thought that would explain why my stomach had been so bad. But when my mum found me screaming in pain, she took me straight back to hospital. Trudi continued to lose weight and was going to the loo over  times a day. In the space of  weeks she gone from st lb to st lb. She said: I kept losing weight and couldnapost keep anything down. One day I went to the loo around  times in one day.  The doctors tried to take a stool sample but the bed pan looked like someone had poured a pint of blood in it. “I felt awful and was barely able to get out of bed. My brought my little boy up to visit but he wouldnapost go anywhere near me. “He said: ‘You’re not my mummy’. That was devastating. Trudi was sent for more tests over two weeks including a colposcopy – which involved sending a camera through her colon. She said doctors found the lining of bowel ‘covered in ulcers’ and she was finally diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. Doctors tried every medication but nothing was working. In February , Trudiaposs last resort was to undergo surgery called a colostomy.  It involved removing the affected bowel and erting the end through opening in the tummy called a aposstomaapos. The stoma would then be fitted with a stoma bag to collect the waste. She said: “When they did the colposcopy they said my bowel was literally covered in ulcers. We tried every medication and steroid but I was throwing it all up. In the end, it was an operation or Iaposd lose my le. Surgery should only take a couple of hours but my bowel was so bad, it took them six hours. Trudi was told it would be dficult to conceive because of the damage to her insides. She was shocked to discover she had fallen pregnant three months after her op in June . Despite the odds against her, Trudi continued with her pregnancy and found out it was a little boy. “He was a total surprise – I was told it would be impossible to have a baby with condition,apos she said. Things started well but once the bump appeared, it put a lot of pressure of my stoma. I was told that I wouldnapost carry to full term but Bobby-Jo was a little fighter. The real problem was going into labour. I hadnapost been to the loo for ages, Iaposd forgotten how to push! Giving birth was the hardest thing in the world – luckily, he arrived safe and sound.

Keen for its members to welcome customers as soon as possible, the British Retail Consortiumhas published a number of measures ahead of a possible easing of lockdown. But at the moment there is no indication of when non-essential businesses will be able to get going again. The retail lobby says shops therefore need to be prepared and has provided advice on how to minimise risks. The BRC has worked with the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers to produce guidance on social distancing for non-food retail stores, drawing on Government advice as well as lessons learned from supermarkets in recent weeks. The recommended measures include limiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed. The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores. BRC chief Helen Dickinson said the measures would serve to ensure the safety and wellbeing of both customers and staff. Since the lockdown, many retailers have proved how shops can be run safely and effectively in line with the Governmentaposs social distancing advice, she said.  Continued close collaboration with Government, including public support for the steps retailers are taking and adequate notice to get supply chains up and running, will mean that retail businesses can start trading again slowly and safely, and customers can feel confident that they are safe toto shops.Some stores, including hardware giants Homebase and BQ, have already reopened in the UK with social distancing measures like two-metre floor markers and perspex screens. While McDonaldaposs, which closed all its outlets a month ago, is planning to reopen its drive-thrus and delivery services next month. Other European countries, such as Austria, the Czech Republic and former epicentre Italy, have eased their own measures but also imposed them before the UK.In Austria small shops have started to reopen but customers are required to wear masks, with plans for a gradual lting of restrictions on large businesses and eventually gathering in June.

Lucy Jackson-Stanese, , met “charming” Ben Robertson on Tinder - and within a few weeks they were living together.Three months later, he hit her for the first of many times, but Lucy was in denial and stayed with Ben, the Daily Star reports.However, when she used Clareaposs Law - a scheme to let people find out from policetheir partner has a history of domestic violence - a police officer warned her, saying: “Leave now or you will die.” Lucy, a PE and swimming teacher, said: “Ben seemed to be everything I ever wanted. I was smitten and soon afterwards we moved in together. “It was small changes at first. He’d tell me not to wear make-up. Soon, the emotional abuse turned physical. Lucy, from Essex, said: “After one argument the neighbours heard the shouting and saw him being violent to me and rang the police. He had dragged me out of bed naked and put me on the balcony.” On Lucy’s st birthday last July, Ben set a dog on her. She said: “It was a Staffordshire bull terrier he’d brought home to look after.  “We argued as I wanted to go to see my family, and he ordered the dog: ‘Go for her!’ “I needed over  stitches to my face and arm, a blood transfusion and plastic surgery.” Lucy said she still stayed with Ben, until she was told he had abused four other women and had even been sent to prison twice. She said: “The police officer said Ben had locked one woman inside a house and hit another repeatedly with a bottle. But I didn’t want to believe any of it.  “The police officer replied, ‘I’m promising you, Lucy. If you don’t leave him now, you’ll end up dead’.” Lucy pressed charges, with a court hearing fixed for January  – but in December last year Ben took his own le, aged . Lucy is now urging any women who suspect their partner is mistreating them to contact police.  She said: “If you have any doubt whatsoever about the person you’re with, get them checked out under Clare’s Law. It could save your le.” Clareaposs Law allows police to disclose information about a partner’s previous history of domestic violence or violent acts. It was introduced in  after a campaign by Michael Brown, the father of murdered Clare Woods, . The mum of one was strangled and set on fire at her home in Salford, Lancashire, in February  by boyfriend George Appleton.He had a record of violence against women. Michael argued that her death could have been prevented had she known her partner’s history. Theresa May, who was Home Secretary when the law was introduced, said: Domestic abuse shatters lives – Clare’s Law provides people with the information they need to escape an abusive situation before it ends in tragedy."},{"url":null,"title":"too early say uk winning","story":"NewsToo early to sayUK winning coronavirus fight but fewer people in hospitalProfessor Stephen Powis, of NHS England, says the coronavirus lockdown has \"begun to pay off\" but experts cannot guarantee that cases of Covid- in the UK wont rise againShareCommentsByChris Kitching:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video stephen-powistoo-early-say-uk-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news too-early-say-uk-winning-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

He credited Britons obeying the lockdown and social distancing measures for the apparent decline in new cases and a plateauing in deaths. However, Professor Powis said the lockdown has begun to pay off but warned cases could soar and there could be a second waveBritons begin become complacent. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. Speaking at Sundayaposs briefing at Downing Street, he told reporters the benefit of social distancing was beginning to be felt in the stabilisation of the number of new cases. He said: You can see we now have a very definite trend of a reduced number of people in hospitals - that is most marked in London. But there is the beginnings of that in the Midlands and other areas of the UK. That is definitely showing that our compliance with social distancing is proving to be beneficial, it is reducing the transmission and spread of the virus. Professor Powis noted there had been a decline in the number of critical care beds used for Covid- patients. He added: Those benefits have occurred not by luck, but because people have complied with the instructions that we have all been given and they have followed the science. The science of this is quite straight forward,we reduce the number of people that can be infected from an inidual person who has the virus to below on average one, then the virus starts to go into decline and the number of infections starts to fall. The NHS boss said the lockdown efforts have begun to pay off, but warned they would only continue to pay offBritons continue to comply with social distancing measures.\u2028  He added: My fear, as the fear of all of us, is that those curves wonapost continue to be on a down trend but will start to go in an upward trend.\u2028 We are not at a point where any of us can be absolutely confident that that is not going to be the case - we want to avoid a second peak, we want to avoid a rise. I canapost emphasise enough that this is not the time to say weaposve done a good job. Speaking alongside Professor Powis, Environment Secretary George Eustice said , Covid- tests had been carried out in the UK - including , on Saturday. He told a Downing Street briefing that some , people have tested positive - an increase of , cases since the day before. He added: , people are currently in hospital with the coronavirus in the UK, down from , on April . And sadly, of those hospitalised with the virus, , have now died, and that is an increase of  fatalities since yesterday. We express our deepest condolences to the families and friends of these victims.Asked why the Government did not record coronavirus-related deaths in care homes in the same way it has done for hospitals, Professor Powis said there was a dference in the way data is collected. He said: In the NHS we work with several hundred hospitals to collect that data on a daily basis. We are collecting the data for people who have died in hospital who we know have tested positive. All those organisations are within the NHS family who are used to putting in daily reports to NHS England. The coronavirus lockdown is a worrying time for millions across the UK. But itaposs also bringing out the best in people who are selflessly giving their time each day to help those most in need. Our Mirror Coronavirus Heroes series wants to recognise all of those helping the most vulnerable during the crisis. Whether itaposs a local business going the extra mile for the community or a teenager helping an elderly neighbour, we want to hear about it. You can email your stories of Mirror Coronavirus Heroes to webnews@mirror. In the care home sector, there are many, many thousands of care homes operated by many, many independent organisations, so that sort of daily rhythm of reporting in is just not something that occurs in care homes in the same way. Schools will have to adhere to social distancing measures should they reopen during the pandemic, the Environment Secretary said.Mr Eustice added: Dominic Raab addressed this earlier this morning. And stressed the importance, that even as you start to consider steps such as that , it would still be important in such a setting to have social distancing measures.Asked about tests for care home residents and staff, he said: We have been ramping up capacity to do those test.  It currently stands at over , a day. We have started to invite large numbers of people working in the care sector and care homes to undertake those tests and signicant numbers have. Mr Eustice dismissed media reports that all travellers ing to the UK from abroad will have to be quarantined on arrival for  days as speculation. He said: As we move to a new phase at some point in the future - we are not there yet - international travel could become a more signicant part of the risk to manage. At the moment, all of the evidence suggests it is only a tiny proportion of the cause of the coronavirus outbreak -we got to that point, a number of measures would be considered but no decisions have been taken in this phase yet.

With our backs to the walls, the Few – the Spitfire and Hurricane pilots of the RAF – then kept the mighty Luftwaffe at bay, Blitz spirit kept us going through the dark days of enemy bombing and, although we stood alone, David held back Goliath until the Americans finally joined in with their enormous material might. It was all a bit amateurish and Captain Mainwaring, but we stuck it out to the bitter end, although we’ve been paying for it pretty much ever since. Lend lease repayments finished only during Gordon Brown’s time as Prime Minister. It might surprise a few to know that almost every bit of what is written above is wrong. Rather, we British played a far more dominant and skillful role in the war than we often give ourselves credit and with a pragmatic ruthlessness that is rarely appreciated. Anniversaries are useful because they give us time to pause and reflect, and in this th anniversary year it’s no bad thing to look afresh at Britain’s really very impressive part in the eventual victories of . For the next three days, we are going to be offering a brief outline of Britain’s war, and today will be looking at the opening year up to the end of the Battle of Britain. It’s worth pointing out that no matter how diminished we might have become since, on September , , when PM Neville Chamberlain announced war with Germany, Britain was the biggest global superpower. We had the largest empire the world has ever known, and even greater extra-imperial assets. Britain owned huge stakes in Argentina, for example, with many farms, ports and railways run by British firms. London was also the centre of the greatest global trading network ever witnessed. We had the world’s largest navy, largest merchant navy – some , ships – and access to around % of the world’s merchant fleet.These were huge assets. Germany had almost no merchant marine, a very small navy and was virtually land-locked within Europe because the moment war was declared, the Royal Navy imposed a very tight naval blockade.  The shortage of supplies, and especially food and oil, dominated Germany’s war strategy from the outset.  Britain had a small army because we had a very large navy and rapidly growing RAF, and because its ally France had a massive army that was better equipped than any other in the world, including that of Germany. The trouble was, France was politically fractured with a coalition government of many parties and was unable to ever agree anything themselves, let alone much with their British ally. The lack of political direction had, in turn, a deep effect on the military leadership. So, it was not until April  that Britain and France finally agreed to mine the shipping routes in northern Norway to stop Swedish iron ore reaching Germany.  By that time, Germany had decided to invade Norway and Denmark and did so with clinical efficiency. After all, their lines of supply were much shorter and most of Britain’s army was in France awaiting a German attack there.  Denmark was conquered in a day. Norway took until June, but although the British and small French contingency were beaten on land, the Royal Navy hammered the German Kriegsmarine, whose surface fleet was half destroyed and which never recovered. Then, on May , the Germans attacked in the west, pouring into France and the Low Countries with two massive thrusts. That same day, Winston Churchill became Prime Minister after Chamberlain resigned over Norway, so Britain was politically in crisis at the very moment the biggest clash of the war to date was beginning. Britain had sent  isions to France, compared with  French and  Belgian, so their contribution was very small. Nonetheless, Britain had the world’s first fully mechanised army.  In contrast, of the  isions the Germans used, only  were mechanised. The other  used what armies always had – horses and their soldiers’ own two feet. Only % of the German Army was fully trained. But those  German mechanised isions did for the French. France had plenty of tanks, guns and soldiers, but very few radios and, with telephone lines cut and refugees clogging roads, its commanders struggled to communicate with one another.  But the Germans had plenty of radios and their infantry, artillery and tanks were able to co-ordinate attacks, while above, the Luftwaffe marauded freely because the French had no air defence system. This meant the Germans were able to pick off the superior numbers of French in penny packets. And when the French and Belgians started to fall back, the British Expeditionary Force had to do the same and ended up at Dunkirk.  When they had fought, the British had fought very well and effectively. Their counter-attack at Arras on May , , gave the Germans a real scare. It was the Royal Navy and the RAF – along with the superb defence of the Dunkirk perimeter – that ensured the bulk of the British Army got back home.Little Ships accounted for perhaps % of those lted and most were taken not from the beaches but from the East Mole – a wooden pier that extended from the harbour and which was untouched by bombs.  The RAF of Fighter Command shot down large numbers of Stuka e-bombers and so it could be argued that the Battle of Britain began then. At any rate, once France fell in the third week of June , Britain was far from alone. The Dominions and Empire backed Britain, while the world’s resources were readily accessible. Although U-boats started making a menace of themselves, there were never more than  operating at one time in the Atlantic – and that was not enough to bring Britain to her knees.  We also had the world’s first fully co-ordinated air defence system, the entire Home Fleet ready and waiting to intercept any invasion attempt, and also “Harry Tate’s Navy” – the Royal Navy Patrol Service – which were fishing boats and crews converted to minelayers and sweepers, armed and also acting as an anti-invasion watch. There was also the Home Guard – more than two million strong by August , and not all Dad’s Army by any means. Nor was Britain defended only by the Few in Fighter Command.  Coastal and Bomber Commands were attacking enemy targets every day, including four raids on Berlin before the first deliberate Luftwaffe raid on London on September .Aircraft production was more than double that of Germany in , intelligence was vastly superior and the Luftwaffe were hammered in the battle. The Spitfires and Hurricanes were not the last line of defence, but the first, and nor were they always outnumbered.  On Sunday, September , , what became known as Battle of Britain Day,  enemy aircraft attacked London in the largest raid of the day, but were attacked in turn by  Spitfires and Hurricanes. Germany had planned to fight a short, sharp war, but failure to defeat Britain in  meant it needed resources from where, and realistically, they could only come from the Soviet Union.

The North Korea leader, who has not been seen since he presided over a meeting on April , is said to have an aposextraordinaryapos appetite. Pictures show that Kim, who is ft ins, has ballooned in size since he first appeared on the global stage in  with his father Kim Jong-il. He is said to weigh  stone and have a BMI of ., classying him as morbidly obese. And it is claimed the -year-oldaposs love of food could be one of the reasons why he went under the kne on April  for rumoured heart surgery. There are now conflicting reports over his health and whereabouts. Rumours have been swirling that he may be dead.Nothing about his current condition has been confirmed, but a South Korean official today claimed he is alive and well. While officials are staying silent, evidence shows that excessive eating signicantly increases chances of heart failure. John Hopkins Medicine in America found that anyone who is severely obese is four times more likely to have heart failure.And evidence shows Kim most definitely enjoys the finer foods in le. Former chef Kenji Fujimoto said he watched Kimaposs eating habits develop.  Back in , it was reported, according to Fujimoto, that the leader drinks two bottles of £ Cristal champagne and gorges himself on expensive Kobe steak and Emmental cheese. Kim’s diet habits have been criticised, especially when much of North Korea’s population is actually undernourished. The leader, who has a team of personal chefs, is also said to enjoy a host of other high calorie and luxurious foods such as foie grass and Wagyu beef that can cost up to £. Kim is also a fan of the delicacy shark fin soup, according to Mr Fujimoto Meanwhile, the world will have to continue waiting to find out the truth about Kim. A vice director of HKSTV Hong Kong Satellite Television said the North Korean leader was dead and cited a “very solid source,” according to the New York Post.

The -year-old from Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA, thought his hair had gotten rather wild and his partner seemed really confident about giving him a haircut - despite never having done it before in her le. Josh, a truck driver, tried to prepare by buying a proper hair cutting kit online but they had sold out - so instead, they decided to use a beard trimmer and kitchen scissors.  Rachel started by shaving the side of his head and then cut the top - but he knew things werenapost going too well when she began laughing out loud as she worked. The -year-old proceeded to start watching a YouTube video about how to fix bad haircuts. But despite Rachelaposs efforts to reverse what she had done, it was too late - with Josh ending up sporting a hilarious aposdumb and dumberapos type of haircut.He said: My usual local barber has been closed due to the coronavirus lockdown, so my hair had been getting a bit long. My we Rachel was actually the one to mention it and she suggested that she have a go at cutting it for me. I knew the barber wouldnapost be opening anytime soon, so I figured Iaposd let her take a whack at it. She seemed really confident about it. She went in by shaving the side of my head and started cutting the top with the scissors. But midway, she started giggling to herself and then began laughing so hard she couldnapost talk.Then I realised something was really wrong. He continued: I burst into laughter when I looked into the mirror. I couldnapost believe it.

He was born in Ceres Hospital, around  miles northwest of the city of Santa Fe in central-eastern Argentina on Wednesday. The move has upset workers at the Ceres Hospital, who originally thought it was a joke. One worker told local paper El Litoral: “I’m saddened this has happened, especially at our hospital. “I think it’s a total lack of respect for the people who have died from this virus. “At first I thought it was a joke but when I saw it had been certied by the hospital I realised it was true. “It’s pretty off. Sadly this is going to be world news and the Ceres Hospital stamp is going to be on it.” But hospital director Silvana Torres said the name was the parents’ decision and not something she was questioning. The baby’s grandmother Alicia Jauregui said the name came out of a conversation between his parents saying their child was going to be famous because he arrived at a dficult time and that was going to make him a “strong little man.” The baby was born by C-section weighing just over lbs. Alicia told a local journalist: “I’m so happy, he’s my th grandchild. “It was beautul to see him for the first time. He’s just like his dad when he was born.” The killer virus also inspired a couple in India who gave birth to twins. The children were named Covid and Corona and were born at a hospital in Raipur on March .

The unproven claims were made by Professor Isaac Ben-Israel, who is the head of the security studies programme at Tel Aviv University. He said that all efforts to stop the spread will lead to the same result because the virus is “self-limiting”, and peaks at  days before rapidly declining. His calculations claim to show the pattern of daily new infections as a percentage of accumulated number of infections. They start at around  per cent, but decrease to  per cent after six weeks, and ultimately reached a level of less than five per cent a week later. In his own article he wrote: “Our analysis shows that this is a constant pattern across countries. Surprisingly, this pattern is common to countries that have taken a severe lockdown, including the paralysis of the economy, as well as to countries that implemented a far more lenient policy and have continued in ordinary le. However no countries have implemented exactly the same social distancing measures against the virus so it is dficult to compare them. There is also no country which can used as a baseline.For example, even though Sweden has imposed the fewest restrictions it has still implemented some measures against the virus. When The Times of Israel asked him how the virus would die without any intervention, he said: I have no explanation. There are all kinds of speculations. Maybe it’s related to climate, or the virus has a le-span of its own. In a television debate on Monday, Professor Gabi Barbash, a hospital director and the former Health Ministry director general, said that death tolls would have been far higherIsrael and other countries had not taken the steps against the virus.  The Daily aposs own analysis across  countries found the peak appeared to be closer to  days instead of . In response to the claims, Professor Babak Javid, a consultant in infectious diseases at Cambridge University Hospitals told the publication: To suggest that mitigation measures are irrelevant to the trajectory of the spread of the virus doesnapost take into account the fundamental concept of the dynamics of transmission of an infectious disease within infectious, susceptible and immune iniduals in a population.” He saidexponential growth is unchecked it will decline but that is only the casea majority of the population are infected. He added: “It is not truemitigation efforts have reduced the base number of people infected.”  Britain’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Witty said the only “exit” from lockdown will be a vaccine.

The disaster is directly responsible for  people but many hundreds,not thousands, more became seriously ill and lost their lives in the aftermath. The explosion was caused by what should have been a routine test - but its impact was immediate and the aftermath has stretched over the following decades. The  disaster saw huge plumes of radiative smoke threaten to cover the whole of Europe and beyond. The impact of those coming into direct contact with the radiation was instant and horric. People living in Pripyat were initially kept in the dark about what had happened - but when they started falling ill with severe headaches, vomiting and uncontrollable fits of coughing, the authorities finally took action. A day after the explosion the first buses arrived to get people to safety. Lives are still being lost due to the devastating effects of that day on April , . Dozens of heroic men and women sacriced their own lives in a desperate bid to make the ruin reactor safe and put out the flames following the explosion. Tonne up tonne of sand was dumped on the structure and courageous staff worked around the clock to make the site as safe as possible. Coal miners were drafted in from across the Soviet Union to dig under the reactoraposs core to creat a huge pool of liquid nitrogen to cool the nuclear fuel within. Finally, when the fires were out of the radiative contained as well as it could be, a huge concrete structure was built over the site. It took  days to build the first sarcophagus, using , cubic metres of concrete and , tonnes of metal framework. Yaroslav Melnik, the leader of a group of firefighters brought in from the town of Ivano Frankivsk, remembered: “We worked in three shts, but only for five to seven minutes at a time because of the danger. “After finishing, weaposd throw our clothes in the garbage.” Later named the aposliquidatorsapos, thousands of these men and women are reported to have died during their work, or suffered long-term illnesses from acute radiation exposure. It had been hoped it would contain the deadly radiation leaking from the nuclear plant - but dangerous levels were still escaping every day. And this huge structure was only designed to be temporary -  years after the explosion, things had become critical once again. Now, after the best minds in the world came up with a solution a huge steel sarcophagus covers the ruined reactor, which itaposs hoped will keep it safe for decades to come. However, the surrounding area is still unihabitable, with those who had called Pripyat their home before the disaster now relocated. It was  hours after the disaster before the evacuation started and many of those who were livng in Pripyat have suffered devastating consequences. Whataposs left behind is an eerie and abandoned ghost town with chillig reminders of the ordinary, family le that one existed there the only things left behind. TVs stand unwatched, cots lie empty and kitchens and living rooms that were once filled with love and laughter are now silent and have been reclaimed by nature. Classrooms where pupils used to sit at the rows of desks are covered in cobweb and dust as sunlight streams in through the broken windows. Pripyat had been a busy and bustling town, built in the shadow of the Chernobyl nuclear power station. With work for thousands of people it was prosperous and fairgrounds, shopping malls, restaurants and bars all sprung up to provide those living there with entertainment. These now lie abandoned with trees, vines and creepers sprawling across rollercoasters. Apartment blocks are now scarred by the weather after remaining unlived in for the last  years. Photojournalist and tourist guide Anton Petrus has visited Pripyat several times in recent years. He said: Pripyat is the worst place Iaposve ever been. I first visited five years ago and the first thing I thought was aposthis place looks like our planet after humanity disappearsapos. Hospital are especially haunting in the town which was once home to , people.

His parents showered him with gts and toys while normal North Korean children had nothing, adult servants were forced to tend to his every need, and he was shipped off to an exclusive school in Switzerland to study. Very little changed when he became an adult and later succeeded his father in , and now there are unveried claims that the dictatoraposs reign has come to an end. Speculation over Kimaposs health has been re since he missed a celebration of the birthday of his late grandfather - North Koreaaposs founder Kim Il-sung - on April .Seoul-based website DailyNK, run mostly by North Korean defectors, then reported that Kim had undergone heart surgery, citing an unnamed source inside the country.Since then, reports about Kimaposs health have ied widely and each one is incredibly dficult to very given North Koreaaposs secrecy and isolation. There have been claims that Kim is dead, in a vegetative state or coma, is gravely ill, or is stable and recovering at a countryside villa. The Hong Kong TV network HKSTV has claimed he has died, according to a very solid source, while a Japanese magazine reports that he is in a vegetative state after undergoing heart surgery. It was also revealed yesterday that China, the countryaposs chief ally, deployed medics to North Korea to advise on the ruler.Three anonymous sources told Reuters that a team of doctors and officials left Beijing on Thursday, although the agency was unable to very what the mission signals in terms of Kimaposs health.North Korea is one of the world’s most secretive countries, and the health of its leaders is a matter of state security.  According to The Great Successor, a book chronicling Kimaposs le by Washington Post journalist Anna Field, his every move is calculated to ensure he stays in power. Under his rule, the country carried out its first successful hydrogen bomb test in , and has developed a new generation of cyber hackers. Field believes that Kim is very consciously trying to look like his grandfather, who is still revered in North Korea. Kimaposs ruthlessness has not seen members of his immediate family spared.  Half-brother Kim Jong-nam died after being attacked with a nerve agent at Kuala Lumpar International Airport in Malasia in . While his death is regarded officially as an assassination, it is thought of by many as a public execution. Although it has never been proved, Kim is believed to have ordered the killing, believing his half-brother was a threat. Four North Korean suspects left the airport shortly after the assassination and left Korea without being arrested.  And his uncle Jang Song Thaek - described in North Korean media as despicable human scum, worse than a dog - was reportedly fed to  hungry dogs in . As a child, the gardens of his home were filled with cages containing monkeys and bears for his entertainment. Huge playrooms boasted more toys than any European store and the gardens inside the walled compounds where he was raised were so large that many called theme parks. A personal chef was hired to be the future North Korean dictatoraposs friend - and the young Kim would don military gear to boss adults around. Contact with other children was scarce, Field writes, with his eighth birthday party attended by high-ranking adults instead of other children. Even when North Koreans were plunged into famine, Kim was probably unaware of the horric conditions they were enduring, she believes.In an interview with Vox, Field said: He was brought up to believe that he was a demigod from the age of three or four, probably as long as he can remember. The author said he was close to his mother, Ko Yong Hui, from who he got the belief that he was a military genius, as well as a love of basketball. Her influence was seen everywhere from the cartoons of her that suddenly started appearing on TV to the way her sons were promoted and moved up the ranks, Field says. In the s Kim was sent to live and study at the International School of Bern in Switzerland under a  identity. This was done in the hope that exposure to the West would turn him into a reformer - but the author said the opposite was true.

Lindsey Graham made the comments after rumours that the North Korean leader was in critical condition or dead spread around the world this week. The US senator said yesterday evening that he did not have any direct knowledge about Kimaposs condition, but that the extended silence from North Korea is very telling. The South Carolina Republican told Fox News: Itaposs a closed society. I havenapost heard anything directly, but Iaposll be shockedheaposs not dead or in some incapacitated state because you donapost let rumors like this go forever or go unanswered in a closed society which is really a cult, not a country, called north Korea.

Sothis guy is dead, I hope the guy who takes over will work with President Trump to make North Korea a better place for everybody.Trump said on Thursday that he believes reports about Kimaposs condition were incorrect, The Washington Examiner reports. The vice director of Hong Kong Satellite TelevisionShijian Xingzou says a very solid source has told her Kim Jong Un is already dead, according to Mail Online.Separately, a Japanese media outlet has claimed Kim is in a vegetative state after he underwent heart surgery earlier in the month. However, images released by  North, a Washington-based project monitoring North Korea, seemed to show what is believed to be Kimaposs train in Wonsan, a port town in the east, on April  and .According to reports, the station is reserved for the sole use of the Kim family. The trainaposs presence does not prove the whereabouts of the North Korean leader or indicate anything about his health but it does lend weight to reports that Kim is staying at an elite area on the countryaposs eastern coast, the  North report said.  On April , a South Korean source told Reuters their intelligence was that Kim was alive and would likely make an appearance soon. The person said he did not have any comment on Kimaposs current condition or any Chinese involvement. The -year-old North Korean leader was already said to be in general poor health condition, being a heavy smoker and morbidly obese - which makes him more susceptible to major health issues.

We felt very hard done by.“The boys who were kept on were feeling really fortunate because they were still getting paid.“I don’t knowit was the plan from the bosses to pick a team that could compete but we ended up with a really good team with some good youngsters left behind.“There was real quality and we said ‘let’s have a go’.”Despite being left with a threadbare squad, former club skipper Smith had some real talent to choose from that season with a good mix of youth and experience.The older heads included former Scotland internationals Rab Douglas and Neil McCann as well as experienced campaigners like Rhys Weston and Matt Lockwood while the younger ones included future Scotland star Leigh Grfiths, Dens hero Gary Harkins and defender Craig Forsyth among others.Called up from the youth team was also striker McIntosh, who hit a purple patch of goals at a critical point in the season – an equaliser against Stirling Albion followed by a double at Morton # before the Dark Blues went north to Dingwall.The match that clinched their unlikely survival turned out to be his final one of the season, however.McIntosh said: “When the match started I actually felt my hamstring go because of the demand of all the games before Ross County.“I think I actually tore the muscle and it was only about  minutes in. I knew the gaffer could tell something was wrong but, being young and naïve, I played through it.“It got worse and worse but it got to the point where I forgot all about it and then got the goal after half-time.“I was always motivated to chase down long balls and this time the goalkeeper took his time.“I nicked it from him and I don’t think I even considered anything about what to do next, it was natural. It was a great feeling despite the pain in my hamstring.“It was a really nice day up there I remember and the supporters were there in their numbers, it was an electric atmosphere.“I scored right in front of them and it was like an explosion.“There won’t be any other games with that kind of circumstance I don’t think, it was unique.“I remember the celebrations on the pitch – it was like we’d won the league. Everyone was ecstatic and it was just pure relief.“I don’t think I realised at the time how signicant it was. My focus was only on playing well and trying to make it as a first-team player.“It was a massive game looking back.“I still get Dundee fans coming up to me in the street to say they were there.”On the game itself, McIntosh’s then team-mate Irvine admits it was all a bit of a blur looking back.He added: “I remember Leighton’s goal, he was one of the really good young boys who did just as much as the older experienced lads.“It was the only goal of the game and, at the end, it felt like we had won the league. The feeling and the celebrations afterwards for what we achieved were amazing.“I’ve always said nothing comes close to that season. I’ve won three league titles and won Challenge Cups where you get a medal at the end for your hard work – there was no medal at the end of that one but I still class saving Dundee and keeping them in the league as my best achievement.”Irvine went on to spend six years at Dens Park as a player before ing as a coach where he took the U  side before the coronavirus shutdown.McIntosh, meanwhile, has had spells at Montrose, Peterhead, Icelandic side UMF Selfoss, Arbroath and Airdrie before signing for National League side Wrexham.Following the departure of manager Bryan Hughes, the now--year-old joined Lee Clark’s Blyth Spartans on loan until the pandemic hit.Despite his contract in Wales running down this summer, McIntosh is sanguine about his future.He added: “I took the opportunity to go down south and I’ve enjoyed it. It’s very competitive and the full-time setup was a big plus for me, too.“Everything is up in the air right now and I’ll have to wait and see what pre-season brings, whenever it starts.“I am out of contract this summer but I understand the furlough scheme will cover out-of-contract players for a time so I’m not overly concerned.“It is what it is, everyone is in the same boat.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

I wasn’t there at the time but nobody really remembers the Roma European Cup semi-final too fondly but they’ll always recall Barcelona and Monchengladbach.“Getting into the final was a massive thing for the city and the club but at the time, as players, nothing was really a surprise for us.“We were expecting to get there so when we did it was great to do, don’t get me wrong, but it wasn’t as much of a surprise to us as it was outsiders.“At that time there was the European Cup, Cup Winners’ Cup and the other teams went into the Uefa Cup.“When you think about that in recent terms, Liverpool didn’t win the league last season but they won the Champions League.“That was the sort of level we were up against. It was a huge achievement.”Bowman recalls United going into the second leg riled up after witnessing some premature celebrations from the Monchengladbach players after a stalemate in Dundee.The -year-old also remembers a rare occasion where legendary boss Jim McLean inidually congratulated his players after the final whistle.Bowman, who made  appearances in tangerine, added: “Under wee Jim we were always taught, unless it was the second leg and you had to win at home, as long as you didn’t lose a goal it was OK.“That was the biggest thing, from our point of view, we didn’t get beat and we weren’t up against it.“I remember they were celebrating after the first leg and that probably gave us a bit of impetus to go on and beat them.“They were high-fiving each other because they got a - and thought the tie was over so that annoyed us a bit.“It made such a dference for us going there at - and Iain getting the goal just before half time.“They had to really come at us because they needed to score two.“Going into half time it was a massive advantage but I can’t really remember us being under that much pressure.“We knew they had to score two which was a tough ask against our defence. It was quite comfortable.“They didn’t have a lot of chances. Big Thommohad some great games and made some big saves that season but I can’t really remember him having to be brilliant.“Heggiesaid to me after it, ‘You should take this all in,’ and I was probably very naïve and just thought this happens every year, we’ll do it again next year.“I probably didn’t appreciate it as much as what I probably should have. It’s only when you look back.“It’s probably one of the only times I can recall Jim coming round and shaking everybody’s hand in the dressing-room after the game.“He really pushed us to our limits and got the best out of everybody. If he could see you had something he would get it out of you, how he did it was irrelevant.“He was very guarded towards us but he went round and congratulated everyone inidually.”United went on to lose the final - over two legs against IFK Gothenburg, with a - Scottish Cup Final defeat to St Mirren sandwiched in between.Bowman believes had they beaten the Buddies they might’ve gone on to secure the Uefa Cup, too.He continued: “It shows how much the SFA helped us at the time! We played the Scottish Cup Final on the Saturday and the second leg of the Uefa Cup Final on the Wednesday.“It was for the good of Scottish football we were trying to win it as well. I thinkwe’d beaten St Mirren, we would’ve had a lot better chance.“There’s no way of saying we’d have definitely beat Gothenburg because they were a decent team but the St Mirren loss was the first down we’d had that season.“Everything was on the up all the time, even with the amount of games we’d played that year.“It was the first time the press had questioned our fitness because we’d played that many games.“You’re never tired when you’re winning but as soon as you get beat that can quickly change.“Personally, all the finals don’t mean anythingyou don’t win. You want to have success by winning and savouring that.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

The burst of le and colour with the longevenings resurrects my mood, enlivens my nature-loving soul. It makes our days feel longer while also giving us the extra energy to enjoy them.How can we not be uplted by the sight of a tree in full blossom bathed in sparkling sunshine, or a carpet of wild flowers especially after months of winter when the land sleeps, and the sun seems to have forgotten us But these are not normal times of course and the ability to roam in nature and soak in its wonder has been temporarily restricted. In fact for many of us our normal le routine has been totally suspended.While we are in lockdown, nature is enjoying the opposite itrsquos flourishing with new le and beauty. And while itrsquos frustrating that we cannot venture out in ways we might be used to, I have been able to listen more closely to the stories that nature is telling on my doorstep.Over the last few years I have deliberately lsquore-wildedrsquo my small garden which I am so lucky to have. By that I mean I have allowed nature to do its thing, and nature has accepted the invitation. Elder, rowan, silver birch and cherry trees now enclose my wee patch of the world. Wild flowers such as dandelion and forget-me-nots have sprung up and last year I had foxglove, so Irsquom waiting to see what this summer will bring.A strange effect of all this has been the enlarging of my garden. Not literally, but in the power of its presence. Irsquove noticed how a space full of nature feels bigger than one thatrsquos bare, lsquoneatrsquo and manicured.I like to call it the forest horizon effect. Compare standing in the middle of a wide open treeless park with standing in the middle of a wood surrounded by trees and humming le. The area of the wood may be much smaller than the park, but its impact on our senses is much greater. We are embraced by nature, not just physically but also,we feel the connection, emotionally and spiritually. The space actually feels larger than it is because there is more in it.I am missing this embrace so much right now because of the inability to visit my favourite woods. But the lockdown has compelled me to spend more time in the natural world on my back doorstep.And within the embrace of my gardenrsquos re-wilded forest horizon, although only a space of around  metres by , I have discovered the truth contained in the wonderful book by Scott Sampson How to Raise a Wild Child.In his book, Scott states: ldquoWhen I began on this book, I had a certain sense of self-satisfaction, convinced that a letime of outdoor play, hiking and campinghellip had forged within me a deep bond with naturehellip Instead, I found that, like most of us, I was oblivious to most of the natural goings-on around me.He explains how he then spent time with his daughter absorbing the sounds and sights of nature on his doorstep, which fostered their lsquointernal wildnessrsquo more than any trip to a remote wilderness. They listened to birdsong and sat quietly as small creatures played out their lersquos dramas under the shadow of their house. ldquoWildness just outside the front door, Scott writes, ldquowas helping us deepen our bond with nature. Such interactions, I have come to realise, are essential to nature connection.Reading this has given new meaning to the confinement imposed by the lockdown. Never before have I had such time to simply sit and absorb the tiny goings on in the garden, embraced by my own mini forest horizon.A garden is a privilege, of course, and I understand many donrsquot have one. But wildness can also be found on our walk to the shops, on verges and public green spaces, with trees, bushes and wild flowers that grow in our urban spaces. The trick is to pause and absorb the wonder of it, listen and look for the wee miracles that we usually donrsquot notice and walk by. Itrsquos easier now, even on a normally busy street, with so much reduced traffic noise and absence of bustle.On my exercise walk yesterday I did just this and was overwhelmed by the beauty of renewed le. It occurred to me that this precious one-walk-a-day has intensied the connection it gives me to local nature.And never have I enjoyed the privilege of having a re-wilded garden so much. On Easter Monday I sat in it with my five-year-old son. His attention span can be short but I explained what we were doing and he stayed with me for  minutes. The first thing I noticed was the absence of normal background noise, which heightened the volume of naturersquos spring melody.Our garden attracts many birds which sit on the branches and sing their hearts out. I know they donrsquot sing for us, but my young son thought they were doing just that. In just  minutes we heard or saw coal tits, wrens, wood pigeons, willow warblers, magpies and a robin. Irsquod never have previously known what some of these birds were, but now we are in a mindset to get to know who is inhabiting our lsquodoorstep wildnessrsquo.We also watched a peacock butterfly explore our garden as it fluttered and paused in equal measure. The sound of bumblebees arrived and we saw them hover over the dandelions. Then a small honey bee made an entrance, likewise visiting the dandelions. As we sat quietly, the sound of honking above us raised our heads and we saw two V formations of geese heading north.When my boy got restless, I suggested we crawl like explorers in the grass to see what we could find. We spotted an incredible sight: young garden spiders emerging from their egg sack which was half hidden under a curve in a plant pot. My sonrsquos fascination at this was matched by my own! It was early for this to happen, and we found many other egg sacks where still unhatched.Within these  minutes there was so much le and wonder so many stories to discover. Where did the small birds come from, where were the geese going, why do bees suddenly appear and what did they do during the winter  Why are dandelions so popular with the bees, what is so special about them  Why do the birds sing dferently, are they speaking to each otherso, what are they saying How did the peacock butterfly get its name and where did it hibernate, was it in our garden shed  What was it looking for  Were the hatching spiders emerging early because their mother deliberately chose a warm corner in the garden to lay her eggs  Why do some spiders live in the garden, while others like hiding under your bed  Do you know how to spot the dference, and do they spin their webs dferently These were just some of the stories my son and I wondered about after our  minutes together in our garden wilderness. But such drama happens all around us. Little patches of mini wilderness are everywhere,we hone our senses to notice and appreciate them.I realise now the lockdown, although stressful, has created the conditions for the discovery of so many new things, with so many new nature stories to learn tales of survival and adventure, of lersquos drama happening on our doorstep and in our street.And the biggest story of all is that everything around us is ultimately related. We are part of naturersquos story because we are part of nature.

into it.I found a little information about it.It was located in Dam Brae and was said to contain water with special qualities that helped make a perfect pot of tea.There is little explanation as to what exactly these qualities were, but it seems to have been widely believed and accepted in the past.Tea, of course, became popular in Scotland, and by the th century it had become an important accompaniment to the often mundane diet of working class people, providing a refreshing non-alcoholic alternative to beer.For the poor, tea drinking wasnrsquot linked to formal social rituals as it was with the upper classes.Tea was the drink of the working class as they worked.So, a well in the heart of the town which was believed to supply good tea making water will have been a busy and popular place.Many people, likely mostly women, would have congregated around the well.In the OS name book from the s, it was clearly recorded that the well was listed as the ldquoVickerrsquos Well, but then goes on to state that ldquono person in the locality knows it by that name.Everyone called it ldquothe bickers well.Perhaps this was a result of local dialect changing the name over time.But Paul Bennet, in his interesting website ldquoThe Northern Antiquarian says ldquothere is the obvious possibility that the ldquobickers ndash as in chit-chat and gossip ndash related to it being where local folk simply met and chatted.Perhaps the reputation of the wellrsquos water for making quality tea also meant people from further afield considered it worthwhile to detour here, in order to make that extra special ldquoBickerrsquos Brew.One account says it was once surrounded by old trees.All of this conjures an image of an important social meeting place, with people meeting under the shade of old trees, exchanging views and information and having a good blether while they wait their turn to draw water from the celebrated well.Was the belief in the goodness of the water rooted in some older tradition Perhaps it was a revered holy well, as some have suggested It seems to have been associated with the vicarage of St Michaels nearby, which roots the well in Musselburghrsquos ancient past, and gives a reason for the name Vicarrsquos Well.The well was replaced by a pump sometime in the nineteenth century, and then was blocked up, and became forgotten.When Irsquod discovered all this I set out to find the location of the well to seethere was still any evidence of it.Dam Brae is now named Kilwinning Place and I studied a nineteenth century map which marked the exact location of the well, then compared it to a modern one and set out on my quest.I found the location. Irsquom sure of it, and took a photo.But there wasnrsquot really anything of much interest to see other than a slab on the ground where I believe the well once stood.It seemed so forgotten, and put me in a melancholy mood for a moment.I reflected on the way something that had been a tradition for so long, and such a part of many peoplersquos lives can just vanish, and be utterly forgotten.I know it was just a well and so might not seem important.But it was a meeting place for ordinary people for generations.The simple shared routines and places in our lives are often the ones we remember with nostalgia.We donrsquot think of them as history or worthy of recording until all memory has gone, and itrsquos too late.I thought about this as we were going on our local family walk this week.I suppose we all know we are living through a time that will be recorded by history.But when all this is over, and things are back to ldquonormal what simple things will you, and your family, remember from this time and what will you want remembered For me, this includes seeing the Greenhills carpeted with wildflowers for the first time that I can remember, watching children cycle on empty streets and deserted car parks, and queuing in shops, keeping our physical distance while also trying to stay social.For sure the toilet roll panic will be part of history.But all of us will have special moments and places that connect to the emotions of this time.There will be stories of peoplersquos wonderful community spirit, what it felt like to be confined in the house for weeks, and how we entertained ourselves.We are all historians of our own time, and we should find ways to record and remember the simple, but important, things we have felt and encountered during this time of crisis.Because memory fades, and as the fate of the Bickers Well shows,memories are not recorded or stories of them not told, they will be forgotten.And so this was why I decided to re-visit the story of the Bickers Well for my column this week.It may have originally seemed there was not much to tell about it.Yet once there was.But the memories and the stories connected to it seemed so simple and obvious at the time that nobody really thought them important enough to record or keep treasured.Now all that remains of those stories is a slab on the pavement.The technology we have makes it easier now to share and record our lives.So letrsquos use it to consciously be historians and storytellers of this dficult time to capture images and feelings, the happenings that may today seem too simple and commonplace to record, but in future will be a fascinating insight to our lives in this historic event.For me, that is the lesson of the Bickers Well."},{"url":null,"title":"winton-brewery-takes-countys-micropub","story":"Steve Holligan and David Mackinnon, from Winton Brewery, stepped behind the bar at Dunbarrsquos Station Yard Micropub at the beginning of the month.Currently, the duo are only allowed to sell off-sales, due to the coronavirus lockdown preventing customers from entering the pub, but they were looking forward to once again welcoming people inside as soon as possible.Steve said: ldquoWersquove been looking for a while to find something like this.ldquoThe Station Yard is unbelievable.ldquoWe looked in Haddington, we looked in Gullane and we wanted to stay in East Lothian, where we are from and where the brewery is based.ldquoIt was one of those things where you were scrolling through Facebook and this popped up.ldquoIt was too good an opportunity and we got in touch with Gerard McPhillips [who had created the pub alongside his late business partner David McGee] and had a really good meeting with him.

planned for the pub, which will feature beers from Winton Breweryrsquos range.It was while sampling a home brew in Steversquos kitchen in Pencaitland that the friends decided to form their own brewery six years ago.Now, they have four distinct beers: Peelywally, a zesty and citrusy IPA Barry Swally, a hoppy and aromatic APA Oh Ya Bassa, a peach and raspberry sour beer and Stooty Fruit, a raspberry oatmeal stout.Forty-one-year-old Steve felt the Micropub site was a fitting bookend, given the breweryrsquos base in West Barns, alongside the hugely successful Thistly Cross Cider.Originally, the Station Yard, which is owned by Network Rail, was the stationmasterrsquos house, which he shared with his we and seven children.Between  and  the building and yard were used by T.Foggo  Son coal

Taking the best from history and finding a way to interpret it thatrsquos interesting or unexpected.All their spirits are made by hand in small batches of less than  bottles, with a direct-fired copper pot still, and aged on-site.Since launching in , they have released three distinctive gins starting with their London Dry. Believing that classics shouldnrsquot be messed with, they have stayed true to style by creating a punchy juniper-led spirit, easing into warming spices on the palate and a bone-dry finish.This was followed by their New Tom - a modern take on the ldquoOld Tom style favoured by Illicit distillers prior to London Dry. New Tom is sweeter in character: distilled with pink peppercorns, rosehips, and tonka beans, and sweetened post-distillation with bee pollen and honey.Finally, in late , Blacklist gin was released. Setting out to create a gin with the rich smouldering character of some of their favourite whiskies - bringing together Scotlands two great spirits - they smoked juniper berries over Scottish peat to impart a deep smoky flavour to the spirit.Complimented by the addition of black cardamom, lapsang souchong tea, black peppercorns, and finally infused with activated charcoal to anchor and enhance the flavour, the result is an unconventional gin - jet black in colour - and with a heady undercurrent of smouldering peat and warming spices.All three products are currently available to via their websitewith free UK delivery during the lockdown period.See illicitspirits shop------------------------------------------------------NUDIE SNACKSNudie Snacks are a local based healthy Snacking Company headquartered in Ayrshire.

In the case of CGI members, it provides the opportunity for parents to teach their children about the industries that CGI operate in.The programme has been born from the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathscamps that CGI has been running for the past year in UK schools and communities to encourage students to think about a STEM career. These have been so well received that when the coronavirus lockdown was announced, Kittow had a packed diary of events which had to be postponed.It was then decided to try and recreate the camps online and, incredibly, the technological experts at CGI managed to have STEM from Home up and running within two days.It was trialled internally but went down so well that, after just the first week, staff asked to share it with family, friends and clients.As the demand was there, CGI decided to make it accessible online for anyone to use, with new content released every Wednesday to keep youngsters engaged.ldquoThe STEM camps are the flagship programme of the CGI corporate social responsibility programme and we thought it was important to continue to inspire the next generation, said Kittow.ldquoThe key aspect of the online programme is that the activities can all be completed from home, everyone can get involved and parents donrsquot have to go out and buy resources. It aims to spark interest in the topics for children, allowing them to realise the effects on their own lives and maybe consider careers in the respective industries.Topics covered so far include robotics, coding, helping the environment, sport and healthy living, with engineering, space and more still to come.The programme will remain on the CGI website post lockdown, allowing parents to continue to help build the next generation of STEM talent from home.CGIrsquos Philippa Green said the online programme was reaching a wider and more ied audience than the companyrsquos STEM camps.ldquoWith the camps we are trying to target iniduals that are under-represented in the industry like females and people from disadvantaged areas but this is reaching further and anyone can be involved, she said.ldquoAlthough it is aimed at six to -year-olds, all students can take activities as far as they like. Wersquove had competition entries from four-year-olds up to -year-olds so we are engaging most age groups.Green added: ldquoThe camps came to a prompt halt because of Covid- but we did not want to disappoint people and wanted to continue the momentum we had started so it made sense to take it online. We also wanted to support our members with children who are working at home and give them something dferent to do.She said they had been ldquopleasantly surprised at the reaction to the programme which has now been picked up by CGIrsquos offices in Australia, India, Canada and Belgium.ldquoPeople just wondered what on earth they were going to do with their children and this is a simple way to keep them occupied, said Green.TASK THREE: ENVIRONMENTTIME:Each activity should take approx one hourResources required:PC with internetPens and paperRecycled items for craft and physical activities. All items can be found in the home.THE third pack in the series focuses on the environment, looking at the key issues facing the planet and ways in which people can help to secure a sustainable future for the next generations.It points out that some of the most signicant environmental issues today include pollution, climate change and natural resources running low.The first activity is to design an Eco School for the future. Children are asked to consider their own schools and whether they would keep any of the existing facilities or whether it should be a completely new creation, bearing in mind it has to benefit the environment as much as possible.The bonus activity is to create an environment magazine. In this project, the students learn how to use HTML and CSS to create a multi-page magazine website with a two page layout, revisiting HTML and CSS techniques from the previous weekrsquos activities in the process.The magazine should give the general public tips and advice on how they can help to save the environment and the children are asked to include at least five top tips and graphics where possible.The physical activity involves incorporating a nature hunt into the childrenrsquos daily exercise routine, searching for nominated items such as trees and birds as they keep active whilst exploring their local environment.The activity can be completed in the garden or on a short walk under the Governmentrsquos lockdown guidelines.There is a checklist provided so that items can be marked off as they are spotted.----------------------------------------------------------TASK FOUR: HEALTH AND FITNESSTIME:Each activity should take approx one hourResources required:PC with internetPens and paperRecycled items for craft and physical activities. All items can be found in the home.THE fourth pack in the series focuses on sport and healthy living and aims to encourage everyone to enjoy sport and live a healthy lestyle, especially during these challenging times.Children are asked to code their own sports games, create a healthy living poster for children and develop their own home exercise routine.The first activity involves creating a skiing game in which the player has to avoid randomly appearing obstacles to scorepoints.In this activity, the children learn how to control sprites using a keyboard, how to draw a background and how to animate a sprite.They are also asked to create a healthy living poster for children, giving information on how to live a healthy lestyle. It can be drawn by hand or produced digitally.The physical activity focuses on exercise, with children challenged to create an exercise routine for them and their families that can be completed either indoors or in the garden.They are asked to include a iety of exercises that will increase the heart rate and include as many dferent body parts as possible, with stretches before and afterwards to avoid any injuries.Bonus activities in the pack include learning how to use App Inventor to make a quiz app, making a game in which players have to save the earth from space monsters, creating an animated sunrise, creating a webpage to tell a story, joke or poem and making a paint programme."},{"url":null,"title":"comfort-food-cravings-stuck-1980s","story":"Lately, Ive found myself daydreaming about iced party ring biscuits, sherbet-filled flying saucers, Viennetta ice cream, Angel Delight and Fine Fare own-brand crisps.Thats the thing about lockdown. Physically we may be safe in our homes, but emotionally and psychologically the brain is seeking some intangible respite.My minds eye conjures an orange sliced in two, each half wrapped neatly in tinfoil and bedecked with cocktail sticks bearing pineapple chunks, cubes of cheese and vinegar-laden picked onions.Its a warming gulp of soup at my grans house on a Friday, arriving fresh off the bus after school. Feeling the heat seep back into my fingers while cradling one of the familiar red mugs she always used, the pair of us huddled either side of her three-bar electric fire.: Susan Swarbrick: I havenrsquot visited a hairdresser since December.

Meat and potatoes. Caullower cheese. Stovies. For pudding, Im drizzling the technological marvel that was Birds Ice Magic over an Arctic roll. I could probably do a TEDx Talk on the subject.There was the time I lobbied to have spaghetti bolognese for dinner rather than \"boring\" mince and tatties. I can still see myself proudly carrying it aloft from the kitchen, the sophisticated aroma wafting beneath my nostrils ndash only to trip over the dog and upend my bowl on to the living room carpet, leaving a glowing stain that no amount of scrubbing would sht.And, ah yes, Findus Crispy Pancakes, an experience I once heard likened to eating baby food out of a searing hot slipper. If I could devour any classic filling it would be chicken curry. Minced beef comes a close second. Im so certain about this choice, I would happily laminate that statement.: Susan Swarbrick: I havenrsquot visited a hairdresser since December. I resemble a badgerI realise, though, that all of this reminiscing is less about the food itself than what it represents: precious time spent with those long gone and desperately missing everyone we cant see through our current necessary estrangement.I look forward to when we will all sit round a table again. Until then, I will feast on memories.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

With lockdown people are finding themselves in the unusual position of being at home for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and it could be a time to experiment and push the boat out.\"I think people have a new appreciation of the craft of making things like a loaf of bread. It can take  hours to make a loaf and a couple of days to make a sourdough,\" said Giovanna. \"I tried to buy yeast in the shop this week and they had run out so it shows more people are maybe making their own.\"This week has been a special celebration in the Eusebi household as her daughter Sophia turned  and Giovanna has been providing meals for Glasgow Kindness charity which is helping to feed homeless people on the street.Her mouthwatering recipes exclusively revealed for the first time today, with stunning photos by Gerardo Jaconelli, could be the perfect treat for the family and encourage people to try something new.Giovanna added: \"Now that people are time-rich I think the focus falls on our homes. We are all eating together and it is a chance to try something new.\"I have created a fresh burrata salad this week as a special starter. And for a showstopper I have created a salt-baked fish. It is something that looks really good and is a bit of a spectacle when you crack into it.\"You cant really go wrong with it or overcook it as the salt protects it. I think people should give these things a go as they have nothing to lose.\"For a little sweet treat, Giovanna has created an Italian favourite ndash tiramisu.She added: \"I thought this menu was something that people could try at home and was maybe a special Friday night dress up meal.\"With the good weather this week Giovannas bin barbecue has been put to good use, but it was a marshmallow treat that went down well with the family.BURRATA : Fennel and anchovy saladThis is a very quick and easy starter to put together. Donrsquot be afraid to substitute any ingredients. Its important to cut the creaminess of the cheese with acidity form the orange. Salmoriglio is an easy dressing that is great for using up herbs past their best. It is also excellent on steamed greens or to marinade fish. The colours are striking and flavours inspired by Sicily.Serves Ingredients burrata or buffalo mozzarellafrac bulb of fennel or celery, sliced finely blood orange, segmented anchovy filletsMixed salad leavesCrushed pistachio to garnishSalmoriglio dressingg of fresh herbs Clove of garlicZest and juice of  lemonml of the best olive oil you haveMake the dressing: Blend all the ingredients in a food processor.To assemble: Place all ingredients except the burrata in a bowl. Season to taste. Add two-thirds of dressing. Arrange on a plate. Partially tear the burrata and place on top. Scatter over pistachios and remainder of dressing. Serve.Salt Baked FishThis is a simple, stress free way to cook fish which is a showstopper. The crust acts like an oven, sealing in the moisture, allowing the fish to cook in its on juices. Evenyou overcook it by  mins it would still be moist. This will be the tastiest fish you have ever eaten.Serves Cooking time guide: min per g whole fish approx g ndash Bass, bream, trout, turbot Salt CrustApprox - kilo of coarse saltWaterAromatics to stuff fish thick slices lemon, whole herbs Preheat oven to C F gas .Trim off fins, remove any guts of fish, you can leave scales, tail and head on.Line a baking tray with parchment.In a large bowl mix salt with water. There are no exact quantities. You are looking for a coarse wet sand texture. Imagine you are on the sea shore making sand castles!Stuff the cavity of the fish. Overlap lemon slices and pack with herbs. Experiment with herbs, its just important to fill it with something to maintain its shape and perfume the fish flesh.Use one third of the mixture for the base. Pat out into an even half inch layer. Place the fish on the bed of salt. Cover it with the remaining salt. Pat gently down until it covers the fish, like an envelope. Make sure there are no cracks.Bake for approx mins. If you have a thermometer insert it into the thickest part, it should be C, or a kne inserted into the thickest part should come away easily. Another way to test is is to remove the first spine closest to the head. If it comes out with ease then itrsquos ready. Let the fish rest for  mins. Cut round the circumference of the salt casing. You should be able to lt it off. Discard. Brush away any excess salt.To serve run your kne down the spine of the fish between the two fillets and gently lt off. Serve with wedge of lemon and drizzle over your best olive oil.Tip: If the fish is slightly undercooked, donrsquot worry just pop it back into the oven for a few more minutes .Eusebi TiramisuAn iconic, classic Italian dessert to \"pick us up\" in lockdown. This can be made in inidual glasses too.Serves Ingredients eggs separatedg caster sugarg mascarponeg Savoiardi biscuitsml Strong coffee ml Marsala, brandy, Kahlua or Amaretto liqueur Cacoa powder to garnishMethodbull Whisk egg whites to soft peaks slowly adding in half the sugar.bull In another bowl cream together remainder of sugar and egg yolks.bull Fold in mascarpone to the creamed mixture a little at a time.

Instead, the site suggests mixing it with green tea as a natural toner.Should you be missing the skin-smoothing effect of an eye-watering beauty salon chemical peel, you may want to follow the online sitersquos alternative: granulated sugar, mixed with olive oil then a right good rub.For those who can spare some beer, its yeast content will help fight excessive sebum production and the bacteria that causes acne.Mix with egg whites and mashed strawberries then use as a face pack ndash or just pretend itrsquos a beery kind of meringue and eat it.While the websitersquos store cupboard treatments may seem a shade desperate, according to Claire Gray of Glasgow-based skincare specialist Ermana, there is real merit in seeking out a more natural approach to our skincare regimes.ldquoAt the moment, most of us are focused on shopping for essentials such as food and medicine, and skincare is often viewed as a luxury product, she says.ldquoBut all this time indoors and washing our hands is having an impact on our skin.For eyes strained from peering too long at Tiger King on Netflix, she has an age-old remedy: ldquoThe tannins in tea can help reduce puffiness and get rid of dark circles. Simply soak a tea bag in warm water and place on your eyes for  minutes.ldquoFor an astringent or toner, wipe a teabag over your face to tighten skin and then blot with a towel.With coffee shops closed and our espresso fix now confined to home, there is a use for all those spent coffee grounds. ldquoSimply add some coffee grounds to coconut oil to make your own at-home scrub, she says.ldquoThe coffee grains help remove dirt and dead skin cells and promote overall skin health, and the scrubbing action stimulates blood flow and can help to reduce cellulite.ldquoThe caffeine in coffee grounds has potent antioxidant properties that can help protect the skin from sun damage.While honeyrsquos antibacterial, anti-fungal and antiseptic properties mean it makes a handy face mask, so too do the fats, minerals and vitamins in mashed avocado.Pineapple is almost a skincare superfood: vitamin C, bromelain and antioxidants can help prevent and treat acne, fine lines, sun damage and uneven tone.

There is no other artist who documented Glasgow so extraordinarily during that period. Itrsquos not enough for Scottish art and big institutions like Kelvingrove to be limited to the most popular names like the Glasgow Boys, Jack Vettriano or Charles Rennie Mackintosh.ldquoPeople are very familiar with the work of the Glasgow Boys. But Glasgow has other painters. Therersquos a Glasgow Girl. Shersquos not even Scottish but came here and fell in love with the city to such an extent that she painted it throughout her short le. Eardley is a hugely important British artist and she should have a major exhibition in a British institution of note, like the Tate.Eardley was born on May , , on a dairy farm in Warnham, Sussex. Her family later moved to London and then, in , amid the growing threat of war, to Bearsden.The following year, she began her studies at Glasgow School of Art and proved fearless in her pursuit of subjects to paint. Her wanderings brought her to impoverished Townhead in the northeast of the city, where she established a studio. The paintings Eardley did there ndash particularly her famous portraits of the Samson children ndash are considered landmarks of th-century art.For her niece Anne Morrison, a Bearsden-based ceramicist, Eardleyrsquos relationship with an urban district which was facing the demolition ball is an example of just how daring and exceptional she was.ldquoTownhead was just not the area that you would go to ndash I was kept well away from it, she said. ldquoEven my brother, who was a couple of years older, said he had never been up there either. It was not the place to be. It was just the poverty and seeing what that part of Glasgow looked like. Middle-class kids just did not get taken there.ldquoShe actually caught something that was disappearing at the time, as the buildings were getting knocked down and people were getting moved where. It captured something of the city and the children there. Itrsquos not glorying it but itrsquos capturing it in a very human way.Morrison suggested that the lack of a major event to mark the centenary of Eardleyrsquos birth could have something to do with the Scottishness of her work.ldquoIt does seem right to have a celebration of her work but it does not seem to be happening, she added. ldquoHer name gets forgotten. She has not had the recognition at a UK level that she should. Thatrsquos the trouble. Shersquos a Scottish artist and she gets put aside because her subjects were Scottish as well.Laura Cumming, art critic for The Observer, described Eardley as ldquoone of the deepest landscape artists who ever lived, and among the most humanitarian painters of men, women and especially children.She added: ldquoEvery opportunity to see her work is precious ndash anywhere at all.ldquoThere have been shows in Scotland, the last that I remember was in . She deserves many more, and so the ideal would be a touring show that took in London, presenting her work throughout the United Kingdom to a new generation. Next year must not be allowed to slip by without a full-scale retrospective of her powerfully stirring and beautul work.Arts journalist Jan Patience said: ldquoThe National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh has done a power of work to cement her reputation with two major shows in the last  years, but there has been no major Eardley show for years in Glasgow, the city she called home. I believe the last one was in what was then called The Third Eye Centre in the s.ldquoAn Eardley show in Glasgow would attract visitors in their thousands and a no-show in her centenary year shows a real lack of vision.Local authorities in Scotlandrsquos largest cities said events were being organised or considered to mark the anniversary.A spokeswoman for Glasgow Le said: ldquoAs one of Scotlandrsquos most popular th-century artists we anticipate a small programme of events to mark Joan Eardleyrsquos centenary.ldquoWe are pleased to have a small number of her drawings and paintings in our collection, which includes the much-loved oil Glasgow Kids, a Saturday Matineacutee Picture Queue, on show in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. However, we do not hold the breadth of works required to stage a standalone exhibition.An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: ldquoEardleyrsquos work is showcased as one of the Our Collection highlights in Gallery  ndash Collecting Art and her work can be seen throughout the collections galleries. A number of the oils we own are on display, including a powerful seascape painted at Catterline.ldquoThe  centenary of Joan Eardleyrsquos birth presents a welcome opportunity for us to celebrate the artistrsquos strong connection with the northeast of Scotland in a number of ways.A spokesman for Leisure and Culture Dundee, which runs the McManus Gallery and Museum, said: ldquoWe have no current plans to mark the Joan Eardley centenary next year.A spokesman for the National Galleries of Scotland said: ldquoThe National Galleries celebrated the le and work of Joan Eardley in a comprehensive exhibition just three years ago, and the exhibitionrsquos curator Patrick Elliott, a leading expert on Eardley, is writing a book on Eardley and Catterline as part of the centenary celebrations. All future plans, including publication of this book and our exhibition schedule, are subject to review due to the ongoing health crisis. However, we do intend on marking Eardleyrsquos centenary next summer, in one form or another.The Tate galleries declined to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"picts-really-mythical-ancestors","story":"WE think of the Picts as an almost mythological people ndash mystical, mysterious, barbarian and pagan ndash lost to us in the mists of time.But nothing could be further from the truth. Before the coronavirus lockdown began, archaeologists were making rapid advances in our understanding of these ancient ancestors. A standing stone carved by Pictish hands some , years ago was recently discovered near Dingwall, shedding new light on their art and culture. A ,-year-old Pictish cemetery was located on the Black Isle, giving us an insight into their religious beliefs and social rituals.In recent years, scholars have been revolutionising how history views the Picts ndash a people who, until the s, were seen as a subject too fancul for serious academic study.So who really were the Picts  The broad answer is that they were the inhabitants of Scotland long before the idea of Scotland even existed. They withstood the Roman occupation of Britain, maintaining their own distinct culture while other cultures were subsumed by the Empire. By the Dark Ages, the Picts emerged as a culture just as sophisticated as any other on the British isles at the time. The Picts helped shape modern Britain ndash and without them Scotland wouldnrsquot exist. Nor were they stubbornly pagan ndash they embraced Christianity.The recent th anniversary of the Declaration of Arbroath should have been a time for Scotland to reassess our understanding of the Picts. The  document, written by Scottish nobles asserting the nationrsquos independence from England, states, in one digression, that ancient Scots ldquocompletely destroyed the Picts.That claim is historical nonsense ndash therersquos not a word of truth in it ndash but itrsquos set the tone for much of the publicrsquos understanding, or rather misunderstanding, of the Picts ever since. That erroneous, and ghoulishly gloating, claim is just one of the myriad myths that have grown up around the Pictish past. Addressing the hoods perpetuated in the Declaration of Arbroath would have been a perfect way to start a new national conversation about these most misunderstood, and intriguing, ancestors of ours.So what do we know about them Origin storyThe ancestors of the Picts were the tribes who lived in the north of Scotland, beyond the River Tay. In the first century AD, the Romans called these people Britanni, today we think of them as the Caledonii or Caledonians. These Caledonians defended their land with guerrilla attacks against the legions of Rome. Roman chroniclers such as Tacitus tell us that these tribes forged alliances against Rome ndash and finally took on the might of the Empire in a huge set piece battle at Mons Graupius in AD. The exact location of the battle is unknown but it was probably in Aberdeenshire and gave rise to the name of the Grampian Mountains.The battle was a defeat for the Caledonians but at least two-thirds of their army survived. Resistance, weather, and landscape all made it impossible for Rome to complete its conquest of the entire island of Britain. The north remained free, and the Caledonian ancestors of the Picts continued their hit-and-run campaign against Roman forces.As the writer Tim Clarkson notes in his seminal book The Picts: ldquoThe early years of the second century saw the northern barbarians launch a series of attacks on Roman Britain hellip The situation became so serious that the emperor Hadrian ordered his soldiers to build a mighty wall of stone along the Tyne-Solway frontier.Clarkson explains how the Caledonians morphed into the Picts: ldquoCaledonians of the second and third centuries were an amalgamation of tribes, each of whom joined ndash or were forced to join ndash a larger political entity or confederacy ... By the end of the third century these confederates had acquired or adopted a new name for themselves, of which the Latin term Picti was a Roman iant or equivalent.The word \"Pict\" first appears in Roman writings in  when the Hiberni ndash or Irish ndash are noted along with the \"Picti\" as enemies of Rome. Therersquos long been speculation that the name \"Pict\" is derived from Roman military slang \"Picti\" for Painted People ndash a reference to the tattoos on the bodies of Pictish fighters. Or the word Pict could be a corruption of Pritani, a term used to describe the inhabitants of these islands, and perhaps the source of the word Britain itself.One of the greatest mysteries of history, though, is what the Picts of this time called themselves. That knowledge is lost to us forever. However, places in Scotland today which begin with \"Pit\" are almost certainly the sites of ancient Pictish settlements ndash Pittodrie, Pitlochry, Pittenweem. ldquoFrom Fe to the Isle of Skye, and from Shetland to the Tay, the native inhabitants were almost certainly part of the Pictish nation, says Clarkson.Linguistically, itrsquos thought that the Picts spoke a Celtic language ndash but one that is closer to todayrsquos Breton, Welsh and Cornish than Irish or Scots Gaelic.The Picts were mysterious even in their own era. Chroniclers believed they originated in Scythia ndash an ancient land that was part of whatrsquos now the Russian steppe. Legend had it that exploring Picts were blown off course, arrived in Ireland and were assisted by Irish princes. The princes gave the Picts wives ndash infor a promise that any kings would come from the female line of a royal family ndash and told them to settle across the sea in Scotland.The legend could have its roots in the fact that the Picts are believed to have practised matrilineal succession to the throne ndash in other words a man became kingthrough his motherrsquos bloodline not his fathers. This made the Picts almost unique among all the civilisations of Europe at the time.The Picts were also connected to the wider world, and making treaties and pacts with other tribes across Europe. In , Picts were an integral part of the so-called Barbarian Conspiracy when the Hibernians, Saxons, Franks and Picts launched a coordinated attack on Roman Britain. Although the assault failed, the audacity of the strike signalled Romersquos decline. Finally, in , Roman rule in Britain ended as the empire began to implode. It was now that the Picts could come into their own.The Dark AgesAfter the end of Roman occupation, the Picts found themselves facing British tribes to the south in the Lothians and Clyde Valley ndash the kingdoms of Alt Clut and Gododdin ndash and a powerful Irish nation across the sea. Pictland or Pictavia was in the process of becoming a patchwork of mini-kingdoms ruled by an overking.In terms of how the Picts lived, Clarkson says that society in ldquoearly historic Europe had long since discarded any lingering egalitarian traits and was heavily stratied in terms of wealth and status, with the bulk of the population living as peasants on agricultural land ruled by lords who in turn constituted a sophisticated aristocracy.Although St Patrick viewed the Picts as savages, other early Christian missionaries saw them as worthy of salvation. It was an Irish abbess, Darlugdach, who was one of the first to preach to the pagan Picts, and built a church in Abernethy. She died around . Fillan, an Irish monk, also helped bring Christianity to the Picts. Hersquos likely to have stayed at a hillfort near St Fillans, which may have been home to Pictish aristocrats. It was the Briton St Ninian and Irelandrsquos St Columba, however, who led the most successful missionary work among the Picts, and brought the wholesale adoption of Christianity among the Pictish population.Columba became the stuff of legend ndash battling wizards, performing miracles which cowed the heathens, and even having a brush with the Loch Ness Monster. However, Columbarsquos work may not have been all that dficult in reality.ldquoIn every corner of the British isles, says Clarkson, ldquopaganism was retreating in the face of a sophisticated international religion whose leaders were rapidly gaining influence at the centre of political power hellip To a wise and ambitious [Pictish] king hellip the eventual triumph of Christianity may have seemed inevitable.Around the time of Columba, the Picts went to war with the Scots. Confusingly, these Scots ndash or Scotti ndash seem to have been originally from Ireland. They had colonised Argyll, eventually setting up the kingdom known as Dalriada which would stretch from northern Ireland to the Hebrides. This ancient ancestral quirk probably explains why Scottish and Irish Gaelic are so similar.Clarkson says: ldquoThe harsh geography of the highlands lay between [the Picts and the Scots] to keep them apart, ensuring that they shared few cultural traits and did not even speak the same language.Dalriadarsquos rulers were in an expansionist frame of mind by the mid-s but were put in their place by a show of force from the Picts known as \"The Flight of the Scots\".The history of the Picts now descends into a series of battles and diplomatic alliances. Sometimes the battles were between Pictish warlords for the overkingship of the realm, at other times the fight was with enemies to the south, mostly the Anglo-Saxons in the area which became Northumbria. Sometimes the Picts were defeated, sometimes their opponents. This was a time of almost permanent conflict, and peace was fleeting.Glory daysThe last half of the s saw Northumbrian Anglo-Saxons hold dominance over the Picts, Dalriada and the Britons of southern and central Scotland. Picts began to rebel, though, as Northumbrian rule weakened thanks to feuds with their Anglo-Saxon rivals further south in England. The Picts, led by King Brude , eventually crushed the Northumbrians at the Battle of Dunnichen in , killing their king Ecgfrith and most of his army.As the Anglo-Saxon writer Bede said: ldquoFrom this time, the hopes and strength of the English kingdom began to ebb and fall away. The Picts were free again. With no more tributes being paid to Northumbria, the foundations were laid, says Clarkson, for ldquothe great kingdom that would eventually rise to power the following century.After a mini version of the War of the Roses among Pictish aristocrats, one contender emerged victorious. Oengus became the new overking in  and stepped forward as one of the greatest rulers in Pictish history.Oengus took on the Scots of Dalriada and beat them ndash but his son was taken hostage in revenge. As a result, Oengus, to put it mildly, went crazy. He invaded Dalriada, ritually drowned a prince and eventually, as Clarkson says, put the Scots of Dalriada ldquounder a yoke of subjection. His campaign became known as the Percutio Dalriatai ndash \"The Smiting of Dalriada\".Thanks to war, trade, Christianity and treaties, both Anglo-Saxon and Gaelic culture were already influencing and enriching Pictish le considerably. However, after Oengusrsquos death in , the Picts descended once again into dynastic in-fighting. Soon, though, there were bigger threats to worry about: the Vikings were about to arrive and change everything.Dalriada was the site of the some of the worst Viking atrocities ndash acts which would start to bring the Scots and Picts together in self-defence. Eventually Constantine, king of the Picts, installed his son Domnall as king of the Scots in Dalriada. Clarkson says this ldquowas a big step towards unying the two peoples as a single nation.Gaelic influence from the Scots of Dalriada on Pictish culture was much stronger, however, than Pictish influence on Gaelic culture, probably due to the strength of the Irish church. Clarkson says this ldquoled to the slow erosion of Pictish culture and its replacement by a Gaelic counterpart.In , the united Picts and Scots faced down the Vikings ndash but were annihilated. Some call it \"The Disaster of \". From the chaos, however, emerged one of the Scotlandrsquos most renowned figures, Cinaed mac Ailpin ndash Kenneth MacAlpin.The twilight of the PictsItrsquos unclear whether MacAlpin was a Pict or a Scot ndash perhaps he was both, a Picto-Scot. Either way, hersquos the king credited with turning Scotland into a unied nation. He was king in Dalriada for two years before becoming king of the Picts in . His reign began the process of \"language death\" which saw the Pictish tongue disappear and be replaced by Gaelic.One legend associated with MacAlpin is \"The Treachery of Scone\" where the Scots, led by McAlpine, invited Pictish nobles to a feast at Scone and murdered them. The story was the inspiration for the \"Red Wedding\" in Game Of Thrones. In reality, however, MacAlpin, says Clarkson, embarked ldquoon a process of political change that would eventually turn his kingdom into Alba, the precursor of medieval Scotland.Clarkson deems this period \"the twilight of the Picts\". The last mention of the Picts came in , when they are referred to as part of an army battling Vikings at Strathern under the leadership of Constantine II, MacAlpins grandson.Soon Alba would become known as Scotia, and the Picts would fade into myth. Though, as Clarkson says: ldquoThe Picts did not vanish in any literal or physical sense. Their disappearance was entirely political ndash they merged with the Scots to eventually become the lsquoScottishrsquo nation.To assuage any doubt that the Picts are still very much with us in modern Scotland, just check your DNA. Testing in the heartland of what was once Pictavia ndash Tayside, Perthshire, Fe and Angus ndash shows that around one-fth of us still carry the genes of our Pictish ancestors."},{"url":null,"title":"ally-mclaws-lockdown-diary-religion-not-yet---chemo-immunotherapy-trust","story":"Yet, even as I prepared to go on to the surgical table to have my left lung removed along with the malignant tumour growing inside it, I didnrsquot think to say a prayer.The operation didnrsquot prove as successful as my surgeon and oncologist had hoped and the cancer remains.

Rats have taken the blame for spreading it, but just as Jimmy Cagney never actually said ldquoyou dirty rat, it may be that the rodent has been given a bad rep and it was more likely passed on by travellers like Hodgson.In disease-ravaged Britain, there are accounts of parents who abandoned their children once they realised they were ill. The tell-tale sign was the appearance on the skin of ldquoGodrsquos tokens ndash the red rings which were a sign that the blood vessels were leaking blood into tissue.In Italy, in The Decameron, Giovanni Boccaccio wrote of Florence at the time: ldquoMany died by day or by night in the public streets the departure of many others, who died at home, was hardly observed by their neighbours until the stench of their putrefying bodies carried the tidings and what with their corpses and the corpses of others who died on every hand, the whole place was a sepulchre.rsquoThe way to have stopped the spread would have been what we are doing today, or trying to, had they then known, although that is not to say it would have been successful ndash a long quarantine, wearing of masks and contact tracing, which we may even get round to shortly. Instead there was what amounted to medieval herd immunity. It took its course to exhaustion.The weak and frail may have perished through natural selection but for the survivors the plague modied their genes and made them more resistant to disease, so that this generation and succeeding ones lived longer.There were several by-products. The perfume industry was created because, while doctors then believed the plane was caused by poisonous vapours, aromatic herbs were used to pury the air, and to cover body odour. Hospitals became, not places for the doomed, stricken, it was believed, because they had sinned, but places where doctors and nurses, rather than monks and nuns, tried to heal people.And, of course, sex comedies emerged, like The Decameron, together with the rise of English as the predominant language, as well as the end of feudalism, because there were simply so few left to till and labour that they could demand, and receive, higher wages and fairer conditions.When David Home was born on this day, April , , in a tenement in Edinburghrsquos Lawnmarket, Scotland was in an abject state. The Darien Disaster, less than two decades previously, had effectively beggared the country, with approximately % of all the money circulating in Scotland lost. It bequeathed what Burns called the parcel of rogues, who forged the Act of Union and which dissolved a Scottish Parliament for three centuries.Home changed his name to Hume when he was  because his surname, pronounced Hume in Scotland, was understood as the place where you lived, or as the prefix to counties.By then he had gone to the University of Edinburgh at , or possibly , failing to graduate because he had no respect for his professors and believed that all he needed to learn he could acquire from books.From the age of  and for more than  years he did just that, read, until he became so ill and depressed his doctors prescribed ldquoa course of bitters and anti-hysteric pills, whatever they were. And a pint of claret each day, so it had its compensations.At the age of , his literary debut, the seminal A Treatise Of Human Nature, was published and Hume was on his way. A job as a librarian at Edinburgh University provided access to research material and to The History Of England, which was published in six volumes between  and .England at the time had around five times the population and almost  times the wealth, but Scotland had a network of parish schools and four universities to Englandrsquos two.Hume, the philosopher, joined with a wealth of other eminent scholars, mathematicians, scientists, thinkers and poets in what has become known as the Scottish Enlightenment. In , Adam Smith published The Wealth Of Nations, the bedrock of modern economics.Pandemics are dotted throughout our history. In , what is now called the Spanish Flu infected around  million worldwide, killing upwards of  million, although the exact figure is something of a guesstimate as proper medical records were not kept.One thing we do know is the flu did not originate in Spain, although coverage of it did. Spain had been neutral in the Great War whereas bad news, like this outbreak, was covered up by the allies to preserve morale. It spread fast because there were no effective vaccines or antivirals, like today with Covid-, and the first effective one wasnrsquot produced until the s.By summer , the flu pandemic came to an end, the unwitting herd approach had triumphed, as those who were infected either died or developed immunity. It was almost  years later, in , that researchers discovered what made the  flu so deadly ndash a group of three genes enabled the virus to weaken a victimrsquos bronchial tubes and lungs and clear the way for bacterial pneumonia. Not a lot dferent to coronavirus.Its long-term effects were brutal. Children born or conceived then achieved lower educational attainment, experienced increased rates of physical disability, enjoyed lower letime income and a lower socioeconomic status than those born immediately before and after it. A decade later, after the economic carnage of the war and the pandemic, the Great Depression ravaged Western economies.Another, and even more serious, effect of the First World War, the harsh measures imposed on Germany, incubated widespread grievance and hostility, breeding the conditions for Hitler and the Nazi party which led to the Second World War. Around  million people died,  million of them combatants, more than  million more soldiers and civilians in the Soviet Union, the remainder the collateral damage through genocide, bombings, massacres, disease and starvation.The most positive outcome, for this country at least, was the creation of the welfare state and the National Health Service we honour, and not just once a week on our doorsteps. It was the cornerstone of Clement Attleersquos policy which saw Labour defeat the Conservatives under the wartime leader Winston Churchill in . It was launched in the form we know today in  by Health Secretary Aneurin Bevan.

What do we value in the communities that we live in, and what kind of country, and what kind of society do we really want to be  We have talked about the importance of promoting wellbeing. Those considerations seem ever more important now.We must focus on how we support our people to adapt to this new world. We will have to be honest about the traumatic effect this pandemic has had on our society, and how we must all confront its impact, the anguish and loss it has caused.Our support must also be practical, such as giving people the skills to respond to the inevitable changes in the labour market.It means helping businesses deal with the transition out of this crisis by aiding their efforts to change their business models and practices, with an eye to the markets that will grow in the future.Our public services will also have to change.They will need to help families and communities recover from the disorientating shock of these times, as well as harnessing the kindness and compassion that has poured from people up and down the country.Even as Scotland begins to plan a managed transition away from current restrictions, we must still adhere to the advice ndash stay at homeyou have the symptoms, keep physically distanced, and maintain hand and cough hygiene.As and when we lt restrictions, we will need to put in place public health measures to stop an uncontrolled peak of cases that would require ato lockdown.We must also still protect the most vulnerable sections of society. Perhaps we can look at how some people could meet in small groups, in defined lsquobubblesrsquo of contact.We can also consider how we can re-open schools, most likely in a very gradual and phased way we will need to consider how we can do this while maintaining physical distancing.While we think about these ideas, our plans to recover must take account of the possibility of re-imposing restrictions, and recognise the possibility that they could be re-imposed quickly.The pandemic has changed the way societies and economies across the world operate, and Scotland is no dferent.I am confident we can start to begin considering our futures with optimism because this crisis has taught us how we can achieve rapid results under the most demanding circumstances. We have seen our NHS respond with radical action, and a new medical facility built in Glasgow with speed, skill and expertise.This crisis has also prompted us to drive change that otherwise may not have been so urgent ndash such as the increased use of online tools to reduce travel and work from home.We have also seen the great capacity of our society to work together in a common purpose.We must now take these lessons into the planning of how we recover from this crisis, and how we will live our lives in the \"new normal\" that awaits us all."},{"url":null,"title":"can-build-bridge-ireland-firms-plan-eco-link-across-irish-sea","story":"In September last year, it was revealed that Boris Johnson asked his officials to draw up costings of building a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland.This led to Scottish Secretary Alister Jack stating he backed a link between the two countries, saying he was ldquoon exactly the same page as the Prime Minister, despite favouring a tunnel.Jack claimed the connection could be built by  and would boost the economy of both Scotland and Northern Ireland.The pound billion project would need to be at least  miles into connect the two countries between Portpatrick and Larne in Northern Ireland.Transport is devolved to both the Scottish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive.The speculation has led a Swedish firm, which claims it is ldquoknown for its innovative solutions to erse tasks in infrastructure, to submit its eco-friendly plans to the First Minister.In the letter, sent directly to Nicola Sturgeon, the firm whose name has been redacted by Scottish Government officials, submitted its proposals for ldquothe exciting power bridge.It adds: ldquoOur concept is to combine a complete transportation infrastructure with a wind turbine farm.ldquoThe foundations of the bridge are extended upwards into pylons each supporting a .MW wind turbine. One hundred and  of these pylons placed along theof the bridge will carry an equal amount of turbines producing ,kWh of electricity, about , million kW per year.ldquoThe estimated yearly electric energy consumption of a UK citizen is on average ,kWh, this means that the power bridge would be able to supply energy to , inhabitants in the near region.The Stockholm-based architect also proposed that the structure cater for both road traffic and trains.The letter adds: ldquoRegarding transportation, the bridge will boast four car lanes on the upper level separated by a service lane dedicated to the wind turbinesrsquo maintenance as well as two train lanes on the lower level.:Plan for Boris Bridge or tunnel linking Scotland and N Ireland rubbished by opponentsldquoThis innovative work defines an ecological and sustainable design for future bridges and should the UK go ahead with this idea, it could become the number one instigator in this field.ldquoWe would be delighted to provide more information on the subject should you wish to develop this project further.Such a power bridge does not yet exist. Some suspension bridges across the globe are powered by nearby wind farms, while proposals in Spain and Italy involve placing wind turbines underneath the arches of bridges and viaducts. Germany and Sweden have proposals to link up the two countiesrsquo power grids with a connection.Earlier this year, it was revealed that almost  million trees have been chopped down across Scotland for wind turbines to be built.The Scottish Government aims to generate % of its electricity from renewable sources this year. Half of all energy produced, including heating, is set to be provided from renewable energy by . As of the end of , the total capacity of all renewable electricity in Scotland, including wind and solar, was .GW.A letter, now made public, was sent to Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson last year by North Down Borough Council in Northern Ireland. In it, the local authority claims that it was told by Scottish Government officials in  that a connection was ldquoan important element of your ongoing review into transport infrastructure.:Link between Scotland and Ireland would be a bridge too far, say engineersThe letter adds: ldquoWith regard to the possibility of a bridge, you advised that this would be a complex task and that it would be premature to speculate on options, but that Transport Scotland officials had been instructed to initiate discussions around exploring connectivity issues between Scotland and Northern Ireland.But Matheson and his Northern Ireland counterpart Nichola Mallon have written to the UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, telling him the link is not a priority ldquofor either government and stressed that the UKrsquos lack of dialogue with the Scottish and Northern Irish administrations over the project ldquodoes not respect devolution.In his letter to Shapps, Matheson blamed ldquobudget constraints from successive UK Governments for a lack of transport investment having ldquoheld back progress for our communities.Matheson bluntly said he ldquolooks forward to hearing from you in the availability of the pound billion to us rather than ldquowaste signicant money and resource that could be put to better use on practical, deliverable projects.He added: ldquoI strongly believe thatpound billion is available for investment in infrastructure in Scotland and Northern Ireland that rather than indulging the Prime Minister with this vanity project, such funding should be made available to our respective governments so it could be better spent on meeting the priorities of the people we represent.The bridge proposals hit a major stumbling block when bomb-disposal experts warned it would be too dangerous to build a bridge due to more than one million tonnes of unexploded munitions thought to be stashed in the -mile-long Beaufortrsquos Dyke ndash which lies on the most direct route for a connection.The plans were subject to a scathing assessment by leading economic think tank, the Fraser of Allander Institute . The FAI said the concept would clash with climate emergency aims and suggested the money could be spent on better things.In a resounding opposition to the plan, the FAI said: ldquoIt wonrsquot deliver the economic boost some claim, it isnrsquot a priority, it would go to the wrong location, it wouldnrsquot be consistent with climate change objectives, and the money could be better spent on other things.ldquoApart from that, itrsquos a cracking idea.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoThe Scottish Government has not investigated or undertaken any feasibility for a fixed link between Scotland and Northern Ireland and has no current plans to do so.ldquoInfrastructure investment should focus on projects that improve lives, support communities boost, our economy and work towards net zero. That is how we are planning Scotlandrsquos future infrastructure investment.Westminster is standing by its ambition for the connection.A UK Government spokesperson said: ldquoWe are committed to ambitious improvements to infrastructure.ldquoWe are looking at a wide range of schemes to improve connectivity and drive economic growth for all parts of the UK, using the power of the union."},{"url":null,"title":"new-normal-first-minister-calls-united-effort-build-better-scotland","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has called on the people of Scotland to work together to create a new, better nation our of the devastation caused by the coronavirus.The First Minister said the virus had shaken Scots lives to their core but that \"there is an opportunity to see them put back together dferently, and see a new way of doing things\".But rather than just restoring what had been wrecked, Sturgeon said the crisis had presented the chance to \"think together, and work together, to decide the kind of Scotland we want\".Writing exclusively in The Herald on Sunday, she said: \"We can go further than rebuilding, and look seriously at social and economic reform.\"Before this crisis, we were focused on our mission of making Scotland a greener, fairer and more prosperous country.

We have seen the great capacity of our society to work together in a common purpose.\"Sturgeon this week became the first UK leader to discuss how le will look after the crisis has passed.UK Ministers have been reluctant to talk publicly about an exit strategy, arguing that it risks undermining the message that people should stay at home in order to curb the spread of the disease.However, there are signs that they are now looking at ways in which restrictions could be eased without risking another flare-up of the virus.One option could see people allowed to socialise with up to  of their closest family and friends, with small groups of households allowed to \"cluster\" together.This could enable family members to meet for meals or friends to share childcare. It could also allow couples who do not live together to see each other.Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunak is drawing up measures to enable businesses to reopen in a \"safe and practical way\".Provisions are said to include putting up signs telling workers to stay two metres apart and to go homethey have coronavirus symptoms.Communal areas such as canteens would be closed unless people could maintain social distancing, and firms would have to ensure there are widespread hand-washing facilities and hand gel.Former chancellor Philip Hammond said it is essential that businesses are told now what requirements they will have to fulfil when the time comes to reopen so they can begin preparing.\"If we are all going to have to wear face masks travelling on public transport, businesses need to know that now so that businesses that have the capacity to manufacture products like that can start planning to do so,\" he said.\"If restaurants, when they eventually reopen, are going to have to operate with many fewer tables, they need to start thinking about how they adapt their business model to be able to do that.\"At the moment, for too many businesses, they just dont know what the requirements imposed on them are going to look like and therefore what kind of preparations they need to make.\"Hospitals, businesses and schools in Scotland are all expecting a dferent landscape under the \"new normal\", post-lockdown le.Simon Barker, a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon in Aberdeen and former chair of BMA Scolands consultants committee, said there are still a lot of unknowns about how and when normality will be restored to services.Barker stressed that some delayed patients would have to wait until  for surgery.\"Its very heartening to have people clapping for the NHS on a Thursday but were going to need those same people to have a measure of understanding when this ends and they want their hip replacement done, and unfortunately we do not have the capacity to do everybody within a week. Its going to take months to catch up.\"New guidance unveiled from the British Retail Consortium suggests non-food retailers could introduce similar measures to supermarkets to enable shoppers toto safely browsing stores for clothes, household furnishings and beauty items, and garden centres for plants.Like supermarkets, the strategy ndash which is supported by the consortiumrsquos Scottish counterpart ndash would see only limited numbers of shoppers allowed inside shops at any one time.There will also be flexi-plastic barriers at till points, floor markings to keep shoppers separated by two metres and changing rooms and in-store cafes almost certainly closed.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, said: ldquoOur members in pharmacy, grocery and the retailing of pet food have shown during this crisis that it is possible to operate safely and responsibly in this new environment.\"With any reopening of shops in Scotland likely to be undertaken on a phased basis, once government permits trading, this new guide will assist retailers to operate safely and help get the economy moving again.ldquoIt will help customers understand changes to their usual shopping routine and indeed what is expected of them too.Pubs and restaurants are expected to be among the last businesses allowed to re-open and they will have drastically fewer customers when they do trade again.Paul Waterson, spokesman for the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, said: ldquoSocial distancing will probably mean tables being spread out, some places may have bar service only with people queuing responsibly to be served, or waiter service only.ldquoIt will be very dficult some smaller premises with a capacity of just  or  people. For them, social distancing may mean they can only have  or  people in at a time. They will have to decideitrsquos worthwhile opening.According to Ryan James, chairman of the Glasgow Restaurant Association and owner of Two Fat Ladies, some restaurants may choose to follow the lead of some European restaurants and fit plastic shields around tables.ldquoWe anticipate being in the last tranche of places that are able to open, he said. ldquoWe expect tables to have to be moved so they are two metres apart ndash in some places that could mean restaurants losing up to % of their business.ldquoI think the days of entire families of groups of  people at a time dining out are gone for the moment.Schools are already having discussions behind the scenes to lay the foundation for ato school.Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS, said: \"We could be looking at smaller class sizes or perhaps children attending in either the morning or afternoon.ldquoI think reopening is likely to involve some prioritisation of certain learning groups or part-time education in some instances to ensure that physical buildings can comply with social distancing and avoid pupils congregating while still accessing all the hand-washing and practical things we need."},{"url":null,"title":"world-view-sweden-tackling-coronavirus","story":"Once upon a very long time ago I lived in Sweden. It wasnrsquot an especially y stay, probably a little over a year or so. I had gone there with my then partner who was Swedish and whom I had met while working as a correspondent in Jerusalem, where she too was based for a time.Living as we did in the Swedish capital Stockholm, the contrast with our time in the Middle East could not have been starker.In the beginning I never warmed to Stockholm. I found it lacking in the spontaneity and colour I had so much enjoyed while in Jerusalem. Somehow it seemed tame, quiet and conservative even, despite the countryrsquos liberal reputation.As time when on, however, and I became accustomed to Swedish ways, the place grew on me. Today Stockholm has become a city I love and is home to one of my closest friends with whom on occasion I continue to work alongside overseas when not having regular online chats.These days almost iniably much of our conversation revolves around comparing notes on the coronavirus and our respective experience of lockdown.Even from the start of the pandemicrsquos impact in Europe, what my friend told me about Swedenrsquos way of tacking the virus made me sit up and take notice.Irsquom not alone in this reaction given that Sweden now has one of the worldsrsquo most closely watched and controversial coronavirus response strategies.Itrsquos a strategy that has been met with both some confusion by ordinary Swedes as well as criticism from within certain sections of the countryrsquos scientic, political and media community. So, just what is it that Sweden is doing dferently and what has the reaction been at home and away At first glance there might not seem many dferences compared to other countries responses. In Sweden as where people are encouraged to practice social distancing, work from homepossible, and avoid non-essential travel as well as visits to elderly relatives or hospitals.In fact, a survey from Swedish pollsters Kantar So carried out for the countryrsquos Civil Contingencies Agencyshowed that around % of people in Sweden say they have reduced their participation in social activities to stop the spread of the infection.But where Sweden has dfered in achieving its aims in response to the virus is that the government has relied on voluntary measures, urging citizens to act responsibly and adhere to these guidelines rather than enforcing a lockdown.All of this has given the country an air of remaining open for business, evenitrsquos not exactly business as usual. Primary schools, cafes, gyms, bars and restaurants, and most businesses have continued tothroughout the spread of the pandemic.Some critics of the policy, both domestic and international, have been alarmed to say the least, but there remains little evidence that Swedes are underplaying the enormity of the disease rampaging across the globe.The architect of the controversial policy the country has adopted, and hero or villain of the piece depending on the Swedes you talk to, is Anders Tegnell, state epidemiologist at Folkhaumllsomyndigheten, Swedenrsquos public health authority.The -year-old has become a household name in Sweden, appearing across the media and holding daily briefings outlining the progression of the outbreak with a precise, quiet demeanour.Asked last week at a press conference as to why the government had chosen not to lock down the country, Tegnell reiterated its position.ldquoBasically because we think we can achieve the same results with voluntary measures, and I think that to a great extent we have shown that we can do that, came Tegnellrsquos characteristically frank reply.This candour has been a hallmark of the countryrsquos approach to tackling the pandemic in its midst.ldquoWersquore trying this strategy out. We donrsquot knowit will work or not. If it doesnrsquot, wersquoll revisit it, Tegnell openly admitted few weeks ago.To date hersquos stuck to his guns, but not everyone in Sweden agrees or approves, pointing to the fact that more people so far have died in Sweden compared to its Nordic neighbours.At the time of writing, Sweden has , confirmed Covid- cases and , people have died. According to figures from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Sweden at face value is not doing well.By April , its mortality rates from Covid- were the tenth highest in the world, with . deaths per ,. By comparison, its neighbours Denmark, Norway and Finland ranked th, nd and st, with ., . and . deaths per ,.More than half of Swedenrsquos deaths have so far occurred in Stockholm ndash , as of April  ndash yet only % of the population lives there. Bad as all this is, itrsquos still a far cry from those European countries worst hit.Currently a lot of the anger in Sweden over its case and fatality figures has come from a perceived lack of shielding of older people. More than one-third of fatalities have been the elderly living in care homes.Just a few weeks ago in light of this death toll, Swedenrsquos prime minister Stefan Lofven suggested the government might need to review its approach amid the prospect of many more fatalities.He accepted too that the failure to protect people in nursing homes stood out as a clear weakness of the governmentrsquos strategy, contributing to higher death rates than in neighbouring Scandinavian countries.ldquoThe protection for people in elderly care should have been better, Lofven admitted last week. ldquoWe need to look closer at what has gone wrong.Some Swedes have suggested that their country is deviating from most other nationsrsquo response in order to hasten herd immunity, and in doing so risking lives unnecessarily. The public health authority denies this.Inevitably, as in countries where facing the threat from the virus, this has resulted in some confusion and a polarisation of opinion.ldquoThe mixed messages are plentul, and they seem to make people want to pick sides, dig their heels in, argue that in Sweden we have a system and it works or no, Swedes always think they know best but they donrsquot, observed journalist Emma Lofgren, writing in the Swedish edition of the online newspaper The Local.Some, however, are adamant over the stance they take. Lena Einhorn, a virologist who has been one of the leading domestic critics of Swedenrsquos coronavirus policy, recently told The Observer newspaper that the government and the health authority were still resisting the most obvious explanations for many of the deaths from the virus.She argues that the reason why there has been such a high number of deaths in care homes is not because of the homes themselves, but because of Swedenrsquos decision not to close down other public facilities and amenities.Einhorn is one of  doctors, virologists and researchers who recently criticised the health authority in an op-ed published by Swedenrsquos Dagens Nyheter newspaper.It called on politicians to break with the countryrsquos tradition of entrusting policy to its expert agencies, and to seize control of Swedenrsquos coronavirus strategy from the health authority.ldquoThe approach must be changed radically and quickly, the group wrote. ldquoAs the virus spreads, it is necessary to increase social distance. Close schools and restaurants. Everyone who works with the elderly must wear adequate protective equipment. Quarantine the whole familyone member is ill or tests positive. Elected representatives must intervene, there is no other choice, the signatories to the newspaper article implored.But despite such criticisms recent polling suggests that overall prime minister Lofvenrsquos strategy continues to have the support of Swedes. His personal popularity has soared, as has that of Anders Tegnell.In accounting for this robust public display of confidence, experts point to a number of underlying factors, not least of which is the collective trust that Swedenrsquos citizens are recognised for having in their government and officials.The country has long benefited from a politically and socially stable democracy, with a well-institutionalised rule of law, transparency, and accountability.This is a nation too with a constitution that doesnrsquot allow for a state of emergency during peacetime.In other countries where such a measure exists it allows their governments to impose tougher restrictions during times of crises, something many of them have done in their efforts to combat the pandemic.According to historian Lars Tragardh, of Ersta Skoumlndal University College in Stockholm, a strict law in Swedenrsquos constitution prohibits the government from meddling in the affairs of the administrative authorities, such as the public health agency.ldquoTherefore, you donrsquot need to micromanage or control behaviour at a detailed level through prohibitions or threat of sanctions or fines or imprisonment, Tragardh told the New York Times recently. ldquoThat is how Sweden stands apart, even from Denmark and Norway.Social solidarity among citizens is also a feature in this manestation of trust.ldquoIn Sweden, the path chosen may be less draconian but it is possibly more demanding, since it shts the burden from laws and policing to self-regulation, explained Tragardh in a recent article inexamining this trust between citizens and the state and among citizens themselves.Culture matters too in how any country reacts to a crisis such as the coronavirus ndash and Sweden is no exception.In an essay written for the New York Review of Books a few years ago examining why Sweden as a country so often evokes such a strong reaction, author Paul Rapacioli talked of the social precept in Nordic countries called Jantelagen, the law of Jante, a code of conduct which is said to restrain outward displays of success or excessive inidualism.ldquoIt is a reminder that you are no better than your neighbour. This may place an obligation of modesty on Swedes, but for Sweden itself dferent rules evidently apply, observed Rapacioli.ldquoIn ranking after ranking, whether the metric is social justice, democracy, press freedom, gender equality, rule of law, innovation, or sustainable development, the country consistently places in the top , and often in the top three, added Rapacioli, reinforcing Swedenrsquos reputation for often doing things dferently and well.Amid the seriousness of the situation, however, Swedes, like others where in the world faced with the coronavirus threat, have also responded with their own brand of humour.Currently the internet is awash with jokes about how naturally social distancing comes to the countryrsquos citizens and the many years in which they have been in training for just such a scenario.ldquoSwedes, especially of the older generation, have a genetic disposition to social distancing anyway, quipped former prime minister Carl Bildt recently, echoing the other widely held view that Sweden is,not coronavirus-proof, certainly naturally coronavirus-resistant.But all joking aside, while the country to date has stood out for its relaxed approach to fighting the pandemic, on Friday there were signs the government may adopt a tougher approach in enforcing social distancing guidelines after throngs of people headed for parks, bars and restaurants to make the most of the warm weather.Interior minister Mikael Damberg was at pains to urge Swedes not to let down their guard.ldquoIn some places and in some situations, the recommendations arenrsquot being followed, warned Damberg, while stressing that most people in Stockholm are acting responsibly.As many bars, restaurants and businesses this weekend remain open, le in the city, as my friend in Stockholm told me last week, ldquofeels strangely normal.For now, the Swedish government has held fast to its almost unique approach in tackling the virus, intoning repeatedly that it is acting according to scientic advice and data and not, it implies, according to the political considerations that are motivating some of Swedenrsquos neighbours and other countries.For the moment the countryrsquos ldquonew normal in the face of the coronavirus pandemic looks remarkably like the ldquoold normal.In tackling the pandemic on its doorstep, Sweden has certainly done things dferently.Whether it has done things effectively and well, time is yet to tell."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-missed-six-coronavirus-cobra-meetings-virus-spread-scotland","story":"The Sunday Mail revealed the First Minister skipped the crucial UK Government meetings and did not attend her first until March  -

However, concerns have been raised about the impact of this transfer, as well as obstacles in the way of securing new ship orders and Powers of Attorney.The Justice Secretary acknowledged these concerns, and offered to pursue the issue with the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service.Mr McArthur said: “Nothing is ‘business as usual’ at the moment, and the well-being of court staff and the wider public has to be the number one priority.  However, there are many aspects of civil court business that we cannot afford to put on pause.“Over recent weeks, I have been contacted by local solicitors in Orkney, extremely concerned at the dficulties they have faced in getting urgent business completed.  Delays in getting a new ship Orders or Powers of Attorney in place, for example, can have serious consequences. Vulnerable people rely on effective and timely court processes that make sure their rights are properly safeguarded.“In England and Wales we are seeing technology being used to enable more court business to be undertaken. There is no reason why a similar approach cannot be adopted in Scotland.  Indeed, Sherf Courts already conduct procedural hearings by tele-conferencing.“The justice secretary insists that progress is being made, but has offered to take up these concerns with the Scottish Court and Tribunals Service.

The yoga postures we’ll be doing in the sessions bring some easy, relaxing movements for the body. Mindfulness allows us to be in the present moment rather than worrying about the past or future which can make it easier to accept change and to make the adjustments necessary to feel well.”Angela Mitchell, national director of Diabetes Scotland, said: “We are proud to have over  local groups serving communities across Scotland. Of course, not everyone can attend a group, especially now when we’re advised against all but essential trips out of our homes.“We had already planned to introduce digital peer support groups this year but due to social distancing measures we brought our launch forward.  Many people at home are feeling isolated and,you’re also managing a long-term condition like diabetes, it can be even more challenging. We want to support people with diabetes in any way that we can at this time. As well as online peer support groups, yoga and mindfulness, we also have a helpline, online forum and the Diabetes Scotland team can be reached as we continue to work from home.”Groups meet in private sessions over Zoom. Peer support group times are still flexible while a schedule is created to meet demand. Mindfulness and yoga will run on Wednesdays at pm and Fridays at pm for the next four weeks.Anyone who is interested in joining either peer support or mindfulness and yoga should email scotland@diabetes.org.uk to be invited to a group and given instructions on how to access Zoom .Guidance regarding diabetes and coronavirus can be found at www.diabetes.org.uk coronavirus or by calling the Diabetes Scotland helpline on    or emailing helpline@diabetes.org.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In challenging circumstances, however, they are not helped by supply chains that are simply not operating fairly or equitably.“During a recent conference call with the cabinet secretary and islands minister, I raised concerns about the behaviour of some suppliers towards our island communities. It was a call echoed by MSP and MP colleagues from across the parties.“Unfortunately, two weeks on and shop owners and local wholesalers, who also supply our care homes and hospital, tell me little has changed. If anything, the situation is getting more serious.“I welcome Fergus Ewing’s recognition of the problem and the action he has taken in writing to  of the main suppliers. However, these efforts must now be redoubled as we need to see a dference on the ground.The Orkney MSP added: “At a time of crisis, getting access to food and essential items should not be a postcode lottery. Supply chains should be working in the interests of the entire population, and suppliers should be treating island wholesalers with fairness”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This might included certain businesses being allowed to reopen where customers can safely stay at a two metre distance, and the reformatting of classrooms before pupils canto schools.The First Minister has advised that restrictions are likely to continue in some form for at least the rest of this year, and possibly beyond that.She added that the Scottish Government would be relying on the latest data to inform it of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing. When asked about whether certain regions of Scotland might undergo a more localised approach, the First Minister said she wasn#t ruling out anything that might help us deal with the virus.#Today I am seeking to start a grown up conversation with the public about the complex decisions that lie ahead of us as we look beyond lockdown,# she said.“As we have done all along, we will seek to inform the public with the best scientic advice possible, but the science will never be exact and we are in uncharted territory so we also need to make careful judgements and be prepared to adapt and change course as we go.“We want to ease restrictions, but we cannot rule out having to reapply them should the virus run out of control.#Nicola Sturgeon said she and her colleagues would be relying on the latest data to inform them of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing.“Every day we see evidence that this virus causes real harm, but so too do the lockdown measures we are taking to contain it,# she continued.#This is causing harm to the economy and living standards, to children’s education and to mental health and wellbeing.“That is why we need to try to find a better balance than the one we have now, but as we do so we cannot take our eye off the need to suppress the virus and minimise the damage it does.“It is only when we are sure the virus is under control that we can even start to ease any of the restrictions because the virus will not have gone away.#Nicola Sturgeon has advised everyone to take part in the conversation about how we might leave lockdown.

Until late last year, a suitable vessel proved dficult to source, said the council.It then became known that the Nordic Sea, which operated on a number of passenger routes in the far north of Norway, had become available.Following visits and sea trials involving Orkney Marine Services and Orkney Ferries staff, the vessel was considered as a suitable replacement for the Golden Mariana.As the Nordic Sea was operating under a Norwegian Passenger Certicate, it was known that a number of requirements would have to be met before she was considered ready for a UK passenger certicate.With surveys now completed and a works list developed, the decision to complete the purchase was made and the vessel departed Bergen for Orkney yesterday morning, Thursday.On arrival, the vessel was handed over to Orkney Islands Council, but due to Covid- restrictions and the need for some works to be carried out to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication, it will be a while yet before the residents of Papa Westray are able to benefit from their new passenger ferry.The purchase of the new vessel was part funded by the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland.More details in The Orcadian Marine Scene section next week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

For urban wildle, which includes mammals and birds living alongside people in towns, this will affect levels of disturbance from humans and food availability.In recent weeks there have already been reports of animals adapting to the reduced human activity including Kashmiri goats roaming around Llandudno, North Wales, troops of monkeys in Singapore, wild boars in cities across Europe and Coyotes wandering streets during daylight hours in the US.Lead researcher Professor Dawn Scott, an expert in Mammal Ecology and Conservation, will use this unprecedented time to try to collect information and answer the study’s overarching question # How have urban animals responded to changes in human activity during the COVID- lockdown The research will collect records on any observations of unusual animal behaviour during the lockdown, determine the effects of reduction in human activity in city and town centres on urban wildle, and the effects increased human activity in gardens and outdoors space is having. The data from the survey will then be combined with other data from media searches to produce a report on the response of urban animals to lockdown across the globe.Professor Scott, head of the School of Le Sciences at Keele University, said: “Urban animals have been able to adapt to our landscape and live alongside towns, cities and suburbs so we know they are already highly adaptable. This flexibility in behaviour means they can usually quickly respond to changing conditions, including the absence of humans, which is happening during the lockdown.“Across the world we have seen reports of animals roaming cities and in locations that they wouldn’t normally be seen during the day. Social isolation is an opportunity for many to learn more about nature and how we can support it. We’re asking people to take part in our study and help us discover how urban animals are responding due to our change in behaviour.”To find out more and take part in the study visit: www.keele.ac.uk wildlestudycopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years.

It is expected to be pressed into service as soon as possible.Health board chairman said demand for testing on the Scottish mainland had seen tests take up to five days for processing.But having the kit on-island, he said, would see results turned round in a matter of hours.Mr Robinson said he recognised there had been a #hiatus# after initial testing coronavirus had stopped.#We recognised in NHS Shetland that capacity for testing was going to be an issue.

It almost makes a case for education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!Reading it helped me to reflect on how dangerous it is for us to accept a narrow and rigid definition of what makes for a permissible #Shetlander#,and how important it is to reject the idea that some are entitled to more of a voice in that discussion than others.Those wishing to contest the need for such points to be made should first read Malcolm#s recommended article and then reflect on how recently a SMUHA squad featured a black-faced member of the NHS.As the article points out there is a prospect that this visus will not lead to more harmonious societies.The price of the peaceful cooperation we should wish for with all our neighboursis vigilance against those who would needlessly turn us against each other.Ilove how Peter and Malcolm appear to be so in veneration of each other, just a tad too preachy for me. As for #an education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!# I would respectfully suggest a basis eduction in the STEM subjects would be of far more value to humankind. That way most would understand what a virus is, how a vaccine works. The sort of simple science stuff that lives depend on.Humanities educated, Like Boris Johson and Rees Mogg. Go for it, Peter!One hesitates to perturb so a warm a socialist embrace. However, re the linked article, any author who discusses Nazism and bigotry in one breath and then Trump, Bolsonaro and Modi in the next while omitting to mention China’s Xi Jinping or the North Korean monster, Kim Jong-un, is clearly peddling a dishonest agenda.It#s a wonder people #educated in the humanities# didn#t see that. Interesting.Having installed himself as president for le, Xi is reportedly responsible for the most appalling, vicious repression and imprisonment of a million Uighur people and the relentless destruction of their culture in China’s Xinjiang province. The “ View” is clear: “Speak out or be complicit.”“Without sustained pressure, the grotesque human rights abuses seen in Xinjiang will not just continue but intensy. The time to speak up arrived long ago. Countries should be shouting about this from the rooftops.”If you want a chilling reminder of Nazism, guys, look no further.Does anyone want to remind John the NHS is socialist in intent and inception Did he learnall this from the wonderful British Empire ,I wonder, so ,he is a poor apprentice.John Tulloch#s unwillingness to engage with the main points previously made is unsurprising.Have I missed something here  An article about testing equipment arriving in Shetland allowing results to be available in hours rather than days has very quickly turned into a debate about immigrants, racism, humanities -v- STEM Education and extreme left right wing politics. It’s not always necessary to find something to disagree about.@Stephen Johnston, I agree. That#s precisely why I hadn’t commented on any coronavirus item, here or where, until my above post. The coronavirus pandemic is a rapidly unfolding tragedy, a national and global emergency. Using it as a political football is completely inappropriate.However, there comes a point when people pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, endlessly stirring the pot of social ision and bitterness, must be challenged. Ideally, we would support those faced with tackling the crisis # at all levels # and keep our criticisms constructive. Or keep quiet and let them get on with it. Lessons can be learned later, with the benefit of hindsight, once all the facts are knownAs they say, # you won#t help, at least, get out of the way.#JT, straight from the right wing playbook# Tell them to be quiet. It#s an effective way to silence people # who could disagree that the coronavirus is a terrible tragedy after all  But#JT, How is the racism suffered every day for thousands of NHS staff not up for discussion  Why do you wish to silence that discussion Why don#t you deal with issue, rather than making a series of accusations and personal attacks What facts about racism faced by NHS staff are not known  Maybe not known to you, but lived by the people in the poem. Maybe for you racism and anti-immigrant sentiment is a political football to be put away until you see fit. But for the people who have lived with it through their lives, suffered because of it, it is a matter of day to day struggle. And yes, a political issue.When John declared that “People pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, must be challenged” I assumed that he was going to say something about Dr Mr Lt.Cdr Tinkler.For what it’s worth John, my own qualications are an HGV and PSV licence sothat’s what you regard as a superior education, you must have the mother of all inferiority complexes.Whenever anyone tries to bring up subjects like racism or social exclusion on this forum, the same few iniduals fly into an apoplectic rage and you, John, are always one of them.As someone once said:“If you won’t help, at least, get out of the way.”Malcolm Henry Johnson, O dear me, that chip on the shoulder. It was actually Surgeon Lieutenant Commander with  years training in Nuclear, Biological and ChemicalWarfare including triage and casualty care. I rejoice I never had time to waste on the humanities, more important work to do, like keeping people breathing.I know, tell me about it Ian. I for one would be fine without HGV drivers. In fact, I have been training our blessed grandson on how to handle a mule and cart . On a side note, I was exposed to radiation as a child in the s. The triage nurse was excellent and the radiation never did me any harm. So what I am saying is you are both valued by old John Thomas.I’ve often pondered the nature of predictability and wondered: What came first, the Surgeon Lieutenant Commander or the wind-up, clockwork toy To Peter Hamilton and John Thomas I say, thank you, for exemplying my point about using the coronavirus tragedy as a political football. Perfect.I hadn#t commented about NHS or care home staff. However, relatives of mine are currently benefitting from their work and their courage and conviction is truly admirable. Whatever their race or nationality, I heartily applaud it.Call me what you like. I won#t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic#Punch and Judy# food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. I invite readers to check my above points and judge for themselves.Have a nice day, boys.JT:#I won’t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic “Punch and Judy” food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. ##pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments,#Pot meet kettle. I see you exemplied my points too # namely numbers ,  and  of the right wing playbook. I see you signed off by patronisingly calling us #boys#. Rising above it eh No one attacked you John. Engaging your in debate is not an attack. Calling people who you disagree with pompous might have been though.Inspiring attempts at deflection from John Tulloch. Clap the NHS and public sector workers without remembering many are subject to racist abuse why don#t we Let#s not consider how society might be madebetter after this mess, let alone how the UK has got into it so deeply. #Now you clap for me#was a welcome call for some, but not, John Tulloch. As founder of Wir Shetland#s UKIP, John is something of a past master when it comes to #stirring the pot of social ision and bitterness#, but we aren#t allowed to talk about that, about the complex nature or history of racism in Shetland, or anything closer to home than China it seems.Inconveniently for John though, lessons can be, and are being, learned now.These are hard times, but hard times are good times to imagine how things can and should be made better.#Now You Clap For Me# had something powerful to say.John Tulloch, however, remains somehow both vocal, but as yet, completely disengaged.A rising chorus of #Shetland for the Shets# might refocus him,anyone is feeling creative enough to write it. It goes to the tune of #We shall overcome#.I most say that over the years I’ve never been one to comment on any stories here or where on news items, but holy hell Shetland Times , what are you doing Mr Editor or moderator  A whole positive story totally hijacked by the same, apparently educated peoplethat plaster your letters, any and all topics, with the same diatribe time and time again !Argumentative boys should really just take their handbags, go to the play park and dance around them, after the lockdown is lted of course !Well done Shetland NHS for all you do for us and all that you endeavour to do to help keep us safe and healthy !!You tell them Steven! 😉Was Carmichael right to call the government#s approach ideological  Who cares  There is no room for politics in any of this.

When the tide was out, it was a grey-sanded, multi-rockpooled, playground.The entire village could be found there on a summer’s weekendwhen it appeared that everything celestial had aligned just perfectly.Hang on, rose-tinted glasses being fetched.We changed into our trunks behind towels held up by impatient fathers, determined themselves to let the sun shine, however briefly, on pale skin that hid, perennially, under jumpers and boiler-suits, the unorm of the tweed-mill and croft.Our young horizons were beginning to broaden and, like every islander before us, the sea needed to be properly introduced.These were the halcyon, formative, summer days of my youth and I was a veritable Jacques Cousteau in black, knee-, wellies.We overturned large pebbles and boulders in the pools, discovering quickly the habits of their occupants and that the miniature world, whilst of huge interest and education, was but a microcosm of what lay beyond the surf crashing not too far away with its warning roar.It was a gentle build up to boldness.We were relatively safe and required little, or no, supervision: the worst that could happen to us was a graze from a slip on the rocks, or a nip from a, larger than was wise to attempt to corner, portainn .We learned which fish were ‘horned’ or awkward to handle and delighted ourselves when we managed to capture one in our hands.Everything was done with your pals.Some of us were more adept than others at this new ‘sport’ a lack of fear, and possibly consequences, proving hugely advantageous when it came to the ‘hunt’.We broke open winkles and limpets on the rocks and threw them, defenceless, into the bigger pools and waited and watched.We experimented and we learned.We filled jars and tin cans, wandered home with our capture, and learned the dference between salt and seawater when it came to aquatic le.Usually several days later from the smell in the shed.At the time it seemed like simply harmless fun, but it was just what generations previous had done before us, and it was preparing us for the serious business ahead.The menfolk of the village all had a bamboo pole which they used to fish ‘properly’ with. The trick was to keep it wet so it wouldn’t get brittle and crack, hence the best place for hiding, and protecting, it was usually in the waterone.You might have had some guttering, we had several waterones.The post office at Knock was the place from which to procure such an item and, yes, they did them in miniature sizes too.I watched in awe as my father rigged my first ‘bamboo’.Half-way up the pole he tightly bound one end of theof tarred sisal twine that he had precisely cut just below a protruding culm .The twine was then wound around the narrowing bamboo to the fragile tip.The tip needed to be light and flexible, for casting and for ‘feel’, but strong enough not to break under the weight of anything with scales or fins.He then expertly tied off a secure fastening at this apex, leaving a working portion of twine which was brought back down the pole and loosely bound.We were, I was told in Gaelic, ‘good to go’.‘Look after it !’, I was warned.Of course we weren’t allowed, immediately, to go to ‘the rocks’ on our own: there had to be some kind of schooling before we were let loose where the big fish swam andyou fell in you’d almost certainly drown.These were the early seventies in Lewis, and the only things that knew how to swim were the creatures that you so desperately wanted to catch.We were taken, yet again, to Shinigeadh where, when the tide was full, we had our very own ‘training pond’, full of cuddies, desperate to hit the frying pan.The bodach had attached a hook to the end of the twine with about a yard of monofilament and had spent low tide filling a bag with some bàirnich , which I’m pretty sure we referred to as maoraich .The walk down to the geo, proudly behind my father and uncle , rod over my shoulder, made me proud as punch.In hindsight, yes it was a graduation.Naturally it was a beautul summer’s evening , the sun was behind us and, despite the bay being filled with grey sand, the sea seemed blue-transparent and I swear I can remember seeing the fish shoaling and darting about, ready to tease us with nibbles and tugs, each one magnied to the size of something huge.Possibly a mackerel Plucking a limpet from the bag, my father swtly extracted it from the shell with a squeeze of the thumb.He tore off the working anatomy, the gastronomic bits of the gastropoda, and popped the rest into his mouth and chewed.Not for long just enough to soften the muscular foot of the newly despatched mollusc so that it could easily be stuck onto the end of my waiting hook.It was the one ‘trick’ that I was never to repeat.I was told about the dangers of fishing too close together , the dangers of standing too close together , the dangers of waving a rod around , the dangers of getting too close to the sea .There were dangers from wet rocks , danger from extracting a fish, no matter the size, from a hook when it was thrashing around, determined toto terra-fliuch , and danger, generally, from not paying full attention, at all times, to what was going on around me.Maybe not all at the same time, but, as the night progressed, and my schoolboy enthusiasm spectacularly combined with my schoolboy errors to make repetition often and necessary, I quickly realised that to mistake ‘playing’ with ‘fishing’ could have serious consequences indeed.I was, however, undoubtedly ’hooked’.From the moment that first vibration was transmitted from fish to fingers.I’ve often wondered about heredity and whether or not certain traits get handed down from previous generations.I’m certain that in many cases they do.But we all, certainly most boys of my generation, grew up with the hand-me-down skills of our fathers and grandfathers.I never met my father’s father, the original ‘Tomsh’.He died before I was born.As a long-line fisherman working out of Portnaguran, his was very definitely not the easiest of lives.The photographer James McGeogh, a former Glasgow policeman, married the daughter of his next-door-neighbour.He is well known for his stunning photographs of the guga hunters of Ness.He found time as well to capture many other images of ‘s Lewis, including one of my grandfather in his working gear.‘Tomsh’ here was the same age in it as I am now.Check out the missing digits on his left hand.Not that I would have ever dared to answer my father back, or not pay attention to his instructions at the rocks: but looking at that picture of his father, I’m pretty sure I know why the message stuck.We all had to start somewhere.I think I managed around a half-dozen cuddies that night.Though I had to get someone more experiencedto get these huge fish off my hook.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may

years ago on a beautul clear morning we were walking to the monastery on Eilean Chaluim Chille in the drained loch in front of Whitewave in Kilmuir.High up a plane flew over leaving a thick, white vapour trail, soon to be followed by another and another. I started counting them and by the time we reached the island, over  planes had flown across, each leaving a mark in the sky.The clear blue became hazy, and the afternoon never ed to the clarity of when we began our walk.These days in lockdown, as we experience this incredible weather we have the clarity which was lost that day.With few or no airliners flying over, the atmosphere seems sharper, brighter, and maybe pollution from industrial parts spreads worldwide and in the past, found its way over to us via jet streams and high air currents.This pollution seems now much reduced.The talk now is of exit strategies and how we end this lockdown. The term “other side” has been coined and was even used in last week’s very moving front page editorial.What will the other side look like There will be many in tough situations during lock down, and for many more the future will be uncertain, and much of the stress from that uncertainty will probably revolve around financial security.A new normal will have to emerge, and we might hope that it will be more sustainable, on all fronts, both locally and globally.Some say that it was Steve Jobs of Apple computers who turned wants into needs, and empires have been built in our commercial world by making desires into needs.There seem to be business models which require constant expansion or ‘biggering’, to use a phrase from the well-known Dr Suess’ children’s book ‘The Lorax’, which is warning of the consequence of continual industrial growth.It is always worth looking at nature, even when thinking of economy and industry.Diversity is healthy in the natural world, a healthy ecosystem has an element of sustainability, but within that system, things grow and die, and more importantly are eaten, nothing is wasted.Businesses will come and go, but the reliance on a single sector for a whole community could never be healthy.The tourists are unlikely to visit Skye in the numbers they have in the last few years, and perhaps never will again.There will be no ‘go’ button pressed after lock-down, and even next season is likely to be considerably quieter. We will have to learn to exist with the reduced numbers.There is risk in business, such is the way of it, and I suspect there was a perception that investing in tourism on Skye was a fairly reliable bet.Investing to meet the seemingly never-ending demand was something even banks might have been comfortable with. Looking back at the tourist season last year, maybe it just could not have continued growing and growing.Something had to give, it is just that nobody could have envisaged such a collapse, and for such a reason.Many of us are guilty of chasing the dollar, but is it for the dollars sake, is it for needs or wants, and what do we lose in the quest I used to joke about retiring to the city “where the pace of le is slower”. The cliché of getting a work le balance sorted is never more relevant.On my few travels into Portree, I have seen parents playing football with their children in their gardens.

But Kit Adams said he feels more isolated on ing to a Northern Ireland that bears no resemblance to the one he left just a few months ago.When the Co Down man departed his native Newcastle for a stint as a postmaster at Port Lockroy in Antarctica, the main concern back home was the effect Brexit would have on the border between north and south.Now, however, the entire island is in lockdown due to the coronavirus epidemic and -year-old Kit, who came home at the end of March, told the Belfastthat it has been a challenge trying to adapt to the culture shock of post-Covid Northern Ireland.It#s strange, but in many respects I have stronger feelings of isolation back home in Co Down than I had when I was living in one of the least populated places on the planet, he said.Even in Antarctica, we actually had quite a few people coming and going. We had cruise ships regularly visiting, with  people at a time passing through [Goudier Island].It#s hard to believe but I see fewer people now I#m home!Here, however, it#s all about making the best of a bad situation and seeing the good where it is.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe Port Lockroy team of Kit, Vicky, Lauren and Lucywith Goudier Island in the background FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe Port Lockroy team of Kit, Vicky, Lauren and Lucywith Goudier Island in the backgroundSince histo Northern Ireland, Kit has been enjoying spending time with dad Colin, an estate agent, conservation volunteer mum Janette and brother Nick , who is also back home having left his former job in the Swiss Alps.You become fantastically close to people you#re away with and then everybody goes their separate ways so it#s nice to be back with family, he said.The young adventurer, who already had three Arctic expeditions under his belt before he left for the other pole, said the experience more than lived up to his expectations.It was fantastic - I could have stayed a bit longerit had been an option but we had to come back before winter set in, he said.Perhaps surprisingly, the geography graduate said he was not on his own that often when he was there.We had some trouble getting in initially because of sea ice and at the start of the season we were iced in so we didn#t see anybody  for a week, he said.We had to gather bits of icebergs and melt it down for water.We#d only been on the island for a few days when the wind direction changed and it blew a load of ice close to the island and none of the ships could get in, but we managed.At that point, there were only six of them there, but later there were ious people coming and going from conservators to electricians and other workers.Being postmaster in such a remote part of the world was quite interesting, according to Kit, whose job entailed sending missives all over the world.It was always a surprise where things went to from here, he said.Tourists coming to the island sent mostly postcards or letters, staff sent stuff to family and friends and people also wrote to us from all over the world asking us for information about ious things.He added: We all received stuff as well from family and friends which was nice.Kit admitted that he pined for nothing while he was gone.It sounds bad but there really wasn#t an awful lot I missed, he added. It was warm, dry and there was lots of chocolate.The lack of normality he now faces at home is a bit strange, Kit explained.You go away and you come back with all these grand plans to go travelling or something... he said.And then I found myself in a not too dissimilar situation than I was in Antarctica.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseKit Adams FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappKit AdamsBut he certainly sounds happy enough.It#s really not that bad, Kit said. You can still get outside, you can go for a run, you can do ious forms of exercise that I just couldn#t do in Antarctica so in many ways it#s easier.When we were in Antarctica it was  days before two of us left the island for the first time.He added: There are more opportunities here at home - you can go for a run or a cycle. I suppose it#s what you make of it, really.Although Kit, who has a Master#s degree in polar and alpine change, initially said it would be tough to single out the best bit of his Antarctic adventure, he subsequently revealed one special memory which will be hard to surpass.We got to kayak around the island on Christmas Day which was pretty special, he said.It meant that we could see the island from a dferent perspective.Recalling a December  like no other during his stint at the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust#s post office, Kit said he did not even miss not getting the usual turkey dinner.There was a little bit of snow on Christmas morning, then it cleared and it was a real blue sky day, he said. We started cooking the Christmas dinner and we had an offer to borrow kayaks from a ship that was in the area so we borrowed those, put the Christmas cooking on hold, left it on the hob and went kayaking around the island.Not many people ever get up close and personal to the penguin population, but Kit can now be counted among their number.The chicks are inquisitive and would go into buildingsyou left doors open too long, he said.Some of the adults are a bit less friendly, and more protective. But they#re fantastically funny to watch I don#t think you could ever get bored watching them and we were literally surrounded by them the whole time.Four months in one of the world#s most remote locations must be hard to follow. Asked what#s next on the agenda, Kit replied: I really don#t know.You can have all these grand plans and ideas and then a virus throws a spanner in the works.I wanted to see some places that I#d never been before. Now I#m sorting through photographs from being away.Kit said he would love to go back to what must be one of the coolest destinations he has ever visited.We#ll see how thing span out for next November, he mused.The trust has said they#ll be choosing people who#ve been before to go back ... so I#ll possibly throw my hat into the ring.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Bronagh O#Connell was speaking after the death of her parents Ignatiusand Mary .Mr O#Connell passed away on April , before his we died at their Strathmore Park home in north Belfast on April .They were laid to rest together on Monday in the village of Carrigart in Co Donegal, where they enjoyed many summers together.Mrs O#Connell was head of art at Dominican College, Fortwilliam, while her husband was principal of St Augustine#s secondary school on the Ravenhill Road before moving to St Joseph#s teacher training college.The couple would have been married  years this August, having met in the s while teaching in Ballycastle. They have two daughters, Bronagh and Aine.Speaking to the Belfast , Bronagh said that losing her parents in such a short period of time has left an indescribable void.We have a very small family and to lose an entire generation in one fell swoop is just overwhelming, she said.Bronagh explained that when the coronavirus outbreak began she brought both her parents to stay at her Randalstown home so they had less chance of catching it.However her father, who suffered from Alzheimer#s, began to develop symptoms of a chest infection and was prescribed an antibiotic by a GP.They were warned thatit had no effect within  hours then they must contact their GP again.Praising the GPs in Salisbury Medical Centre and the Covid- team from Grove Wellbeing Centre, Bronagh said they had gone above and beyond the call of duty.The GP said to get them back to their home in Belfast and they would take things from there after the antibiotic didn#t work, Bronagh added. They askedwe wanted to nurse them at home. My daddy had Alzheimer#s andthey both went to hospital we wouldn#t have been able to nurse them or visit them, and they would have died on their own.After arriving at their home in Belfast Mrs O#Connell developed the same symptoms her husband had just three days later, but she was in a much worse condition.Following the death of her father Bronagh was advised to be tested for Covid- and the result came back positive.Thankfully the community midwe is making a full recovery at home. Due to the current restrictions at funerals, only a few family members were able to take the long drive to Donegal, but with the roads being deserted Bronagh felt it was like the path was open for her parents to go to Heaven.I don#t think we have grieved at all yet, she added.You just do the al things, but mummy and daddy are constantly in our minds.There was a Mass but nobody was allowed to attend and the coffins weren#t allowed in the chapel at all.The priest told me that it was the first time in his professional le that he buried a husband and we together.Urging Stormont not to lt the lockdown too soon, Bronagh used her own family#s loss as an example of what can happen.We have no mummy and daddy and granny and grandad anymore, she said.I know people are restricted being in lockdown, but when I look at my mummy and daddy, they got sick and they went nowhere.I think when the lockdown is lted we will see a rise in deaths as people will go crazy.People aren#t abiding to the regulations as well as they should. If the lockdown is lted too soon we will have a pandemic.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The community in Magherafelt responded to a plea from nurses for accommodation in the area and within  hours, a house had been located and refurnished ready for them to move in. Mid Ulster councillor Darren Totten had been alerted to the nurses’ plight and set in place a train of events that would reveal a heart-warming tale of community spirit. He told the County Derry Post: “One of the nurses had been askingthere was any accommodation available – Air BnB or something along those lines in the Magherafelt area. googletag.cmd.push “Somebody had tagged me into it and that’s how I got involved. I sent her a message to give me a ring and she rang me more or less straight away. “That was on the Friday evening and I met them over at the house at a quarter to  on the Saturday morning. It was a bit rough round the edges, it had been lying empty for a while.  “The fella that has recently bought it had said to me a few weeks ago thatit was of any use to anybody, to use away at it. He brought the keys down and left them with me.” googletag.cmd.push Darren posted online appealing for help to make the house a bit more inhabitable for the healthcare staff and found himself inundated with offers from both friends and strangers. “I threw it up on Facebook asking for a favour from anyone who could help kit a house out from start to finish,” he said. “There were people who came here with tins of paint. Four fellas landed and they were painting the living room and bedrooms. “One fella, who I had never met in my le, rang me and said ‘I’m here whenever you need’ so I told him to come on ahead. He landed with dust sheets, rollers, paint brushes and all the rest.  “Bradley’s furniture landed out with a lorry-load of furniture and kitted the whole thing out with brand new mattresses, beds, bedside lockers and all. “The smaller stuff was all made up from donations that people had given. Cloverhill Oil landed with  litres of heating oil and a local fella wired up the TV aerial free of charge.” Cllr Totten hailed the effort as a fine example of community cohesion and said the positivity had helped create a space for the healthcare staff to rest from the harrowing reality of Covid-. He said: “They were over the moon. They would have taken it as it was on Saturday morning, but I asked them to give me a day or two to make it a bit more homely for them. “The whole thing took legs, there’s a real good will out there at the minute and not a penny changed hands. “It was all hands to the pump and it was amazing to be part of it. You would have thought anyone working in that house had been friends for le, they were chatting away to each other. With the house ready to move into on Saturday evening, the mammoth effort left out just one important utensil. “The only thing we forgot about was a tin opener,” said Darren, “but that’s sorted now.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The annual event was due to take place in venues across the city area next month but was cancelled due to COVID-. However, Council have instead put together a digital programme that will be broadcast as a live event on the City of Derry Jazz Festival Facebook each day from Thursday May th to Sunday May th - called the Virtual Jazz Festival…Sofa Sessions. People will be able to see and hear from their favourite bands and artists, as well as taking part in some jazz dance classes. googletag.cmd.push Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Michaela Boyle said the online festival will help lt spirits. There is always such a buzz around Derry and the whole district when the Jazz Festival rolls around every year and while we will unfortunately have to miss out on that this time, I think this is a brilliant way of recreating a bit of that excitement and atmosphere in our own homes. Theres nothing quite like a bit of toe-tapping and catchy music to lt your spirits and ease les anxieties, and this revised online programme gives us all something to look forward to – which is exactly what we all need right now – and with over  artists and bands taking part there will be something for everyone to enjoy. googletag.cmd.push I want to thank Councils Culture Department for their hard work in putting this programme together. Im certainly looking forward to a bit of jiving and singing! Jacqueline Whoriskey, Councils Festival  Events Manager, said they felt it was hugely important to keep the festival going, albeit in a dferent capacity. The Virtual Jazz Festival… Sofa Sessions is an opportunity to celebrate artists from our own district and from all over the world, and we felt that now, more than ever, it was imperative that we find a way to do that. In putting together the programme we have made sure that local artists are well represented in line with the ethos of the festival. Its a really tough time for them, and for all of the artists and bands involved, given the financial hit that they have had to endure in the past few months. This is the th year of the festival, and although it will certainly be much dferent to any that we have had before, we were determined that it would go ahead in some form, and we hope tobigger and better than ever on our th anniversary next year.

Council members and senior management have been meeting regularly to review impacts on Council services, with daily updates on the changing response to the COVID- situation. It was decided that given the ongoing situation and all the guidance from health authorities regarding public safety and the restrictions regarding public gatherings it would be prudent to cancel at this stage.Announcing the decision, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Michaela Boyle, said it was necessary to look ahead and be realistic about what events can safely be delivered over the coming months. I know this will be disappointing as these are both popular events and ones which positively promote health, wellbeing and fitness, she declared.But these are exceptional times and dficult decisions must be made for the greater good.Local people have been responding well to the social distancing advice and I know people will understand that under the current government guidelines regarding public gatherings, it would not be possible to host these events without making major changes to their format that would have a detrimental impact.By making these decisions at an early stage, we can avoid accumulating unnecessary costs and resourcing in terms of planning, and we will continue to review other major Council-led events over the coming weeks.We do however want to send out a strong message regarding exercise and its importance to both mental and physical health at this time. Council is promoting smaller exercise challenges – such as the Family Home k Run Walk on May  – and the online Friday Fitness Challenge, which people can do at home, in their garden or near their home. We will continue to explore other activities and programmes in the coming weeks which will enhance health and wellbeing and offer people the chance to exercise in a safe and fun way.Please take the opportunity to get together as a family and enjoy games and activities, and the extra time we are getting to spend with loved ones.The decision was taken by members during a virtual meeting this week where they were reminded that regulations set out by the Department of Health in their Coronavirus Legislation which came into operation on March  were still in place.The announcement follows on from the decision to cancel the City of Derry Jazz Festival and St Patricks Day programme in recent weeks. Council will continue to adhere to the requirements to keep premises and businesses closed, including burial grounds and cemeteries, and to adhere to the restrictions on movement and gatherings. However, it continues to explore alternative options for the public including the launch this week of an online Jazz Festival. The Virtual Jazz Festival… Sofa Sessions will be broadcast as a live event on the City of Derry Jazz Festival Facebook each day from Thursday May thto Sunday May th- called the Virtual Jazz Festival…Sofa Sessions.For more information on all the impacts on Council services in relation to COVID- please go to www derrystrabane  coronavirus googletag.cmd.push  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Fireside selectors picking teams is one of Ireland’s national past times. This selection is based on players who took part in county senior, intermediate and junior finals -. It is based on the grade they were playing at that time. Five from each is selected. Just like putting five litres into a one litre jar. Here goes...  - Antoacutein McMullan For years it was the ‘big boot’ in defence who would do the kicking out. Distance was important. Now it has developed into an art form with the qualities being, a cool head, the ability to kick the ball through basketball hoop at a distance of  metres, safe hands and cat like reflexesrequired. Antoacutein has all the credentials. googletag.cmd.push  - Oisin Duffy A good defender is one that the forward hates playing against and the energetic Duffy was one of those prize assets. Firm in the tackle, virtually impossible to stop on the run and full of scores from his defensive position. His display in the Ulster Intermediate championship against Magheracloone, where he scored - from play, was exceptional.  - Brendan Rogers No player can change gear as quickly as the tall Brendan when he motors out of defence. He would excel in any sport and could play anywhere on the football field. A brilliant hurler as well. Seeing a forward chasing him with tongue hanging out is something were are used to. A real pleasure to watch. googletag.cmd.push  - Karl McKaigueThere is a famous film called the Quiet Man. Karl could be titled the quiet marker in defence. He has snuffed out some of the best forwards in the game and still manages to slip forward and get a point or two. Tackles the ball and not the man, so he rarely gives away frees. His anticipation of where the ball is going to drop is exceptional.  - Niall KeenanA neat and tidy footballer. His build would suggest corner forward material but he is actually a quality defender. Came through the minor and U ranks showing class all the way. His display at Croke Park in the  minor semi-final for Derry marked him as a player with a great future and he has lived up to that billing.  - Joe Gray Play anywhere Joewas the heart beat of Faughanvale teams for the most of two decades. He led a young team from the junior ranks to a solid intermediate outfit. Played and managed at dferent times and had a few games with Derry in the s. Has all the skills and a read dead eye free taker.  - Jimmy O’Connor Jimmy was ‘spotted’ by an Derry U scout when he was closer to  than . Now, nearer  than , he keeps up an amazing standard of fitness. Normally listed as a corner forward he is let loose to conduce the orchestra. Not the biggest but he makes light of that with his wide range of skills.  - Enda Muldoon Could have played on any team, in any era. Great hands and a master of the ever accurate foot pass. Always made the game look easy since he broke into a Derry minor team in . Now a qualied coach, passing on his skills to the next generation the youngsters could not have had a better tutor. A gentleman on and off the field.  - Mark Lynch From enthralling Croke Park in the  All-Ireland minor final, at the age of , Mark has continued to show quality. Stepped down two years ago after a long inter county career. Still the heart and soul of Banagher teams. He was exceptional in their senior championship run last year and the intermediate title a year previous. In his all round skills is the mastery of free taking.  - Michael McNaughtGrandson of the great Mickey McNaught who was on the Derry  National League winning team. His accurate left foot is one of the reasons why the Waterside men have become a solid force in Derry football. Can play midfield or half forward and seldom is below par. A very accurate free taker.  - Richard KingRichard broke into the Wolfhound’s senior team at the age of  as a corner forward. Now a commanding figure in the half forward line and an excellent free taker. Was a key figure in the treble winning junior team of . His rather harsh sending off against Red Hugh’s almost certainly cost Limavady the Ulster title. At  there is a lot more to come from this excellent footballer  - Enda Lynn Good enough to captain his county for two seasons. This man is a virtual scoring machine. Such is his dedication that he has been known to train on Christmas Day. His pace and tireless running makes him nearly impossible to mark. Missed a lot of action last season with an injury. Greenlough and Derry will be glad to see him back againthe action ever resumes.  - Paudie O’Neill Probably the best club footballer in Derry never to get a county call. Time after time, he would win games on his own for the Henry Joys. His scoring tallies were mind boggling but like a lot of good footballer had ongoing injury problems. A loyal club player he often played through the pain barrier.  - Kevin O’ConnorEvery year he postpones his retirement is another good year for Foreglen. From being an excellent half forward he now brings his deadly accuracy to the role of target man. A quite superb free taker who is always calm and measured. Played a leading role in their intermediate championship win last season.  - Conleith Gilligan Has to be one of the highest ever scorers in Derry club football. From his teenage years to his mid-s his quality never dimmed. Be it from frees or open play, he seldom missed the target. His pace and ability to be in the right place at the right time marked him as one of the best. His retirement left a huge void in the Shamrock’s attack. He is now passing on his skills to others.

He was impressionable. In September, he was listening intently to the wireless, as Derry launched their first bid for Sam Maguire. He wasnt just reliant on the radio waves to savour the magic. Twice a week, the Derry team would train in nearby Newbridge and he got to meet his heroes. Where the towns Credit Union now resides, John Joe Diamonds cafe was located on Bellaghys Castle Street. Tommy, now  years of age, vividly remembers the scene as his mother Cathy made plates of sandwiches for the players before they ed home, to the four corners of the county. googletag.cmd.push “When you get the county stars in your kitchen twice a week, I got to know them all well and I was friendly with them through the years,” Diamond begins. Sean OConnell would later train the Derry teams that Diamond would captain to All-Ireland glory. “I played with him too, hiscareer lasted a brave while...he mustve been  when he was still playing with Derry,” Diamond adds. When Bellaghy All-Ireland winning manager Harry Cassidy took charge at county level, he called Diamond into the senior  in the early s. He was part of the team that toured New York and Connecticut. googletag.cmd.push “We went out to play exhibition matches out there. It was an experience to get out there. We also won the Wembley Tournament two years in a row.” The semi-finals were played in the iconic stadium, with the final played out in New Eltham. “I was taking a look the other day and I think I have played in every county in Ireland,” Diamond added, of a county career that ended in . But it was the s, when he left his greatest imprint. *** In , Tommy was on Bellaghys first county U championship winning team and was a minor champion three years later. At county level, Derry minors had yet to reach an Ulster final. The first of Diamonds three years in the county minor team began in the closing stages of a game in Dungiven, with Antrim in the lead. “I remember being threw on as a late sub and two balls were kicked right over the full-back,” he recalls. “They landed in my hands and all I had to do was to kick them into the net and I think we won by a point.” After another season of consolidation, a place in the final again eluded them, but there was a crux of a team still eligible for . “We knew from , we had a good  and we didnt lose many,” said Diamond, who was made captain. When Derry defeated Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh on their way to the  minor league final, they did so without the St Columbs Derry players who focussed on winning the MacRory and Hogan Cups, under the management of former Fermanagh player Fr Ignatius McQuillan, just four years after tiptoeing onto the Ulster Colleges scene. “Then seven or eight of them came onto the Derryteam – which was some help,” Diamond added. “FrShields was the man who put the backbone into us and Sean , he put all the final touches to us, he was a great trainer.  Sean OConnell, Tommy Diamond and Fr Seamus Shields with the Tom Markham Cup “We trained twice a week up in Ballinascreen and after training we went into Timoneys for sandwiches and milk every night.” Aside from the medals and success, Diamond is grateful for the memories and friendships built up, that stood the test of time. “If any of us ever meet each other, it is a half day session. Thats the great thing about it.” They hammered Donegal in the  first round, in Dungiven, but the win came at a cost with a knee injury to Chris Brown. In the semi-final it was a dferent story and it was a narrow - to - win over Down, a game that saw Phil Friel sustain three fractured ribs. “We beat Cavan in the final in Clones,” Diamond remembers. “It was a hard, dour match and a typical Cavan match with hard hitting and not a lot of finesse about it.” Derry were Ulster champions and with the Hogan Cup now in the county, there was an air of quiet confidence as the squad headed to Croke Park. Diamonds first memory of their epic semi-final with Roscommon was giving the referee his name. “I was marking Dermot Early that day and we got booked after  seconds,” he laughs. “It was some start to a semi-final. I caught the ball and as soon as I caught the ball, he hit me. He was about two seconds late, I hit him with an upper cut and put him on the broad of his back and both of us were booked.” Derry were - to - winners and with the game in the melting pot in the second half, Early pulled a penalty wide of the posts when the Rossies were four points in arrears. “The great Miacutecheaacutel Oacute Muircheartaigh was commenting and he called it the game of the golden goals. Every one of them was hit in from  yards, absolute screamers.” It was time for one last push. Derry had one hand on the Tom Markham Cup. So too had Kerry. *** The Kingdom had the breeze and thanks to some wastefulness in Derrys attack, Kerry were a point ahead at the break. Sean OConnells pep talk worked wonders and the cogs began to turn. Tommy Diamond and Seamus Lagans performance at midfield helped them to a - to - win. “I dont remember an awful about it.” Diamond says. Earlier in the day, GAA President Alf Murray asked himhad his speech prepared with the customary lines of Irish, should Derry win. “I had no Irish, so he penned out the speech with the phonetics and I tucked it into the pocket of my shorts”. The speech mustve slipped out during the game and as he stood on the presentation podium, Diamonds pocket was empty. “I am the first man to just speak in English, I dont think it went down to well but I just had to go ahead with it,” he continued. The team stayed out in Portmarnock on the Saturday and Sunday night. Just recently Donal Mullan, son of county official at the time Paddy, handed Diamond a ticket from the post-final banquet. “The entrance admission was just  shillings,” he added. The homecoming on the Monday took nearly six hours, with crowds coming out along the route to salute the new champions. There were bonfires as the team crossed the county border. On the final leg of the journey, the victory cavalcade of cars coming to Maghera streamed all the way back to Tobermore. The Brackaghreilly Pipe band led John Mulhollands decorated lorry up Maghera street. “I remember being up on the top of the cab. They had a seat and I was tied into it and held the cup,” Diamond proudly beams. “It was some occasion for the firstchampionship to come into Derry.” Two years later, with Diamond still as captain, Derry won the Ulster U title before getting trounced by Mayo in the All-Ireland semi-final in Charlestown. “We were favourites for Ulster but we just werent ready for it ,” Diamond admits. “We were a year young and the next year we were all U and Sean OConnell was still in charge of us.” In , Derry swept all before them in Ulster, with only Down putting up any sort of resistance and Seamus McCloskeys - tally was enough to see off Monaghan in the final. Kerry came to Ballinascreen for the semi-final and trailed - to - at half-time, but had pegged the team back to a point midway through the second half. Diamond was switched to mark Brendan Lynch and a Kevin Teague goal helped swing the game in the home sides favour. Holders Mayo were shocked by Offaly in the other semi-final, setting up a Croke Park meeting with Derry. The Oaks led by nine points at the interval with the Faithful County down to -men after the dismissal of Eugene Mulligan, before easing to victory. He was the first player to captain his county to minor and U All-Ireland titles. But for Diamond,  was far from over. Despite playing three years for Derry minors, it took Diamond time to break into the Bellaghy senior team who would win seven titles during the s. He was dismissed, along with his brother Laurence, in the  semi-final win over Kilrea and missed the final. “Bellaghy had a strong  of players,” Diamond points out. “I only got my place on the senior team when Anthony Madden went to Australia and I got his place at right corner back.” There was nothing  only football and it is still the case. Karls son James is the first of his grandsons to play senior championship for the blues. The recent underage production line represents the hope in the new batch in the club. “They have the greatest facilities and have everything you would want and we have no team,” Diamond adds, referring to the -year gap since the John McLaughlin Cup rested in Bellaghy. “At that timewe had no facilities but we had teams....its a change of circumstances.” He picked up the third of eight senior medals in , but the Bellaghy adventure was only beginning. Once again, Diamond was involved in a first as the club were crowned Ulster champions in the first year of the competition. Frankie OLoane scored - in a  point win over Pearses of Belfast in the first round and it was followed up by a victory over a Newry Mitchells side that hammered Bryansford in the Down decider, thanks to goals from Sean Lee and Tom Scullion. Bellaghy beat St Josephs in the final, a combination of Ballyshannon and Bundoran, played on December  in the falling snow. “They had Brian McEnf and about  county men in total. They had a strong side and they actually, by right, shouldve beat us, but we were that dogged that day,” Diamond states. “It was a really cold day and we got a bit of a lead up against them. It was a rearguard action against the breeze in the second half but we held out.” There was no All-Ireland series until  when East Kerry won the title. Bellaghy retained their Derry title with a win over Slaughtneil in  before losing the final the following year to Newbridge. When they bounced back, it took them to their finest hour. A - to - win over Lavey saw them win Derry title number . In Ulster, they defeated Ballybofey, Ardboe and Teemore before taking on Armaghs Clann na nGael in the Ulster final. A - to - interval lead put them on their way to a facile win. In the All-Ireland series, it was a dferent story and Frankie OLoane was twice their savour. Tommy Diamond, Hugh McGoldrick and Chris Brown led from the half-back line against Portlaoise, but it was OLoane who tied the game late on, before Hugh Donnelly scored the winner in a - to - win. In the final, they took on the might of UCC and once again it took OLoane, with his seventh point of the game, to level matters late on. When Hugh McGoldrick broke up a Cork attack, Brendan Cassidy went on to score and the Tones were crowned All-Ireland champions. “Theyhad  county players, they were from all around. Moss Keane was full-back, he was a big tower of a man but Tom Quinn was too much for him.”   All-Ireland club - Tommy is on the extreme left of the front row Later that night, Cassidys lorry ferried the team up and down Bellaghy street to a heros welcome. Absent was the cup, as East Kerry didntit. “It is the sort of thing they cant take away from you,” Diamond said, of achieving the pinnacle of club football. He would later turn to management and managed Derry for  months at the end of the s, but stepped down after he felt the County Board were not allowing him full control of the team. Before that, at the start of the  season, Bellaghy were unable to get a senior manager, so Diamond put his name forward. The Tones went seven seasons without a title and werent tipped for glory. “Nobody wanted to take it. A lot of these managers, unless theyare good they are not interested at all,” he said. After winning the Derry title, Diamond took his side to Crossmaglen for the opening game of Ulster. After a battle, Bellaghy came out on top, but lost in the next round by a point at home to Castleblayney. “We shot in and shot inand Blayney went on to beat Burren in the Ulster final. I went to it in Dungannon, it was a dour match, - to -,” Diamond recalls, as Burrens quest for four-in-a-row failed. ”I said I would take themas far as I can, there wasnt much hope for them. We got them going rightly and I was disappointed we didnt win an All-Ireland with that team. I felt they were good enough.” *** Another passion is golf. He has been member of Ballymena Golf Club for  years, where he still plays with lelong friend Gerry McCann. He has been a member of Moyola, where he is now the Ranger.  Tommy andSeve Ballesteros Another friend of Diamond, Willie Cassidy, pulled off a coup in  by bringing Seve Ballesteros to play a round at the course, just months after he won the Masters. “I think it cost pound, to bring him to Moyola, he was number one in the world and Willie got him,” Diamond adds. “It is the only course in the north of Ireland I think he played on and I had the honour of caddying for him, I was the lowest handicapper at the club. “I marked his card, he countersigned it and it is up in the clubhouse for ever more amen.” A letime of memories. Aside from the current lock-down, the chat continues every Thursday night over the winter. Tommy plays cards with friends and his sons. It is a ritual. The social hub and the legacy of parents John Joe and Cathys cafe continues. RELATED - Derrys path to their first taste of September. Click here...

He was impressionable. In September, he was listening intently to the wireless, as Derry launched their first bid for Sam Maguire. He wasnt just reliant on the radio waves to savour the magic. Twice a week, the Derry team would train in nearby Newbridge and he got to meet his heroes. Where the towns Credit Union now resides, John Joe Diamonds cafe was located on Bellaghys Castle Street. Tommy, now  years of age, vividly remembers the scene as his mother Cathy made plates of sandwiches for the players before they ed home, to the four corners of the county. googletag.cmd.push “When you get the county stars in your kitchen twice a week, I got to know them all well and I was friendly with them through the years,” Diamond begins. Sean OConnell would later train the Derry teams that Diamond would captain to All-Ireland glory. “I played with him too, hiscareer lasted a brave while...he mustve been  when he was still playing with Derry,” Diamond adds. When Bellaghy All-Ireland winning manager Harry Cassidy took charge at county level, he called Diamond into the senior  in the early s. He was part of the team that toured New York and Connecticut. googletag.cmd.push “We went out to play exhibition matches out there. It was an experience to get out there. We also won the Wembley Tournament two years in a row.” The semi-finals were played in the iconic stadium, with the final played out in New Eltham. “I was taking a look the other day and I think I have played in every county in Ireland,” Diamond added, of a county career that ended in . But it was the s, when he left his greatest imprint. *** In , Tommy was on Bellaghys first county U championship winning team and was a minor champion three years later. At county level, Derry minors had yet to reach an Ulster final. The first of Diamonds three years in the county minor team began in the closing stages of a game in Dungiven, with Antrim in the lead. “I remember being threw on as a late sub and two balls were kicked right over the full-back,” he recalls. “They landed in my hands and all I had to do was to kick them into the net and I think we won by a point.” After another season of consolidation, a place in the final again eluded them, but there was a crux of a team still eligible for . “We knew from , we had a good  and we didnt lose many,” said Diamond, who was made captain. When Derry defeated Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh on their way to the  minor league final, they did so without the St Columbs Derry players who focussed on winning the MacRory and Hogan Cups, under the management of former Fermanagh player Fr Ignatius McQuillan, just four years after tiptoeing onto the Ulster Colleges scene. “Then seven or eight of them came onto the Derryteam – which was some help,” Diamond added. “FrShields was the man who put the backbone into us and Sean , he put all the final touches to us, he was a great trainer.  Sean OConnell, Tommy Diamond and Fr Seamus Shields with the Tom Markham Cup “We trained twice a week up in Ballinascreen and after training we went into Timoneys for sandwiches and milk every night.” Aside from the medals and success, Diamond is grateful for the memories and friendships built up, that stood the test of time. “If any of us ever meet each other, it is a half day session. Thats the great thing about it.” They hammered Donegal in the  first round, in Dungiven, but the win came at a cost with a knee injury to Chris Brown. In the semi-final it was a dferent story and it was a narrow - to - win over Down, a game that saw Phil Friel sustain three fractured ribs. “We beat Cavan in the final in Clones,” Diamond remembers. “It was a hard, dour match and a typical Cavan match with hard hitting and not a lot of finesse about it.” Derry were Ulster champions and with the Hogan Cup now in the county, there was an air of quiet confidence as the squad headed to Croke Park. Diamonds first memory of their epic semi-final with Roscommon was giving the referee his name. “I was marking Dermot Early that day and we got booked after  seconds,” he laughs. “It was some start to a semi-final. I caught the ball and as soon as I caught the ball, he hit me. He was about two seconds late, I hit him with an upper cut and put him on the broad of his back and both of us were booked.” Derry were - to - winners and with the game in the melting pot in the second half, Early pulled a penalty wide of the posts when the Rossies were four points in arrears. “The great Miacutecheaacutel Oacute Muircheartaigh was commenting and he called it the game of the golden goals. Every one of them was hit in from  yards, absolute screamers.” It was time for one last push. Derry had one hand on the Tom Markham Cup. So too had Kerry. *** The Kingdom had the breeze and thanks to some wastefulness in Derrys attack, Kerry were a point ahead at the break. Sean OConnells pep talk worked wonders and the cogs began to turn. Tommy Diamond and Seamus Lagans performance at midfield helped them to a - to - win. “I dont remember an awful about it.” Diamond says. Earlier in the day, GAA President Alf Murray asked himhad his speech prepared with the customary lines of Irish, should Derry win. “I had no Irish, so he penned out the speech with the phonetics and I tucked it into the pocket of my shorts”. The speech mustve slipped out during the game and as he stood on the presentation podium, Diamonds pocket was empty. “I am the first man to just speak in English, I dont think it went down to well but I just had to go ahead with it,” he continued. The team stayed out in Portmarnock on the Saturday and Sunday night. Just recently Donal Mullan, son of county official at the time Paddy, handed Diamond a ticket from the post-final banquet. “The entrance admission was just  shillings,” he added. The homecoming on the Monday took nearly six hours, with crowds coming out along the route to salute the new champions. There were bonfires as the team crossed the county border. On the final leg of the journey, the victory cavalcade of cars coming to Maghera streamed all the way back to Tobermore. The Brackaghreilly Pipe band led John Mulhollands decorated lorry up Maghera street. “I remember being up on the top of the cab. They had a seat and I was tied into it and held the cup,” Diamond proudly beams. “It was some occasion for the firstchampionship to come into Derry.” Two years later, with Diamond still as captain, Derry won the Ulster U title before getting trounced by Mayo in the All-Ireland semi-final in Charlestown. “We were favourites for Ulster but we just werent ready for it ,” Diamond admits. “We were a year young and the next year we were all U and Sean OConnell was still in charge of us.” In , Derry swept all before them in Ulster, with only Down putting up any sort of resistance and Seamus McCloskeys - tally was enough to see off Monaghan in the final. Kerry came to Ballinascreen for the semi-final and trailed - to - at half-time, but had pegged the team back to a point midway through the second half. Diamond was switched to mark Brendan Lynch and a Kevin Teague goal helped swing the game in the home sides favour. Holders Mayo were shocked by Offaly in the other semi-final, setting up a Croke Park meeting with Derry. The Oaks led by nine points at the interval with the Faithful County down to -men after the dismissal of Eugene Mulligan, before easing to victory. He was the first player to captain his county to minor and U All-Ireland titles. But for Diamond,  was far from over. Despite playing three years for Derry minors, it took Diamond time to break into the Bellaghy senior team who would win seven titles during the s. He was dismissed, along with his brother Laurence, in the  semi-final win over Kilrea and missed the final. “Bellaghy had a strong  of players,” Diamond points out. “I only got my place on the senior team when Anthony Madden went to Australia and I got his place at right corner back.” There was nothing  only football and it is still the case. Karls son James is the first of his grandsons to play senior championship for the blues. The recent underage production line represents the hope in the new batch in the club. “They have the greatest facilities and have everything you would want and we have no team,” Diamond adds, referring to the -year gap since the John McLaughlin Cup rested in Bellaghy. “At that timewe had no facilities but we had teams....its a change of circumstances.” He picked up the third of eight senior medals in , but the Bellaghy adventure was only beginning. Once again, Diamond was involved in a first as the club were crowned Ulster champions in the first year of the competition. Frankie OLoane scored - in a  point win over Pearses of Belfast in the first round and it was followed up by a victory over a Newry Mitchells side that hammered Bryansford in the Down decider, thanks to goals from Sean Lee and Tom Scullion. Bellaghy beat St Josephs in the final, a combination of Ballyshannon and Bundoran, played on December  in the falling snow. “They had Brian McEnf and about  county men in total. They had a strong side and they actually, by right, shouldve beat us, but we were that dogged that day,” Diamond states. “It was a really cold day and we got a bit of a lead up against them. It was a rearguard action against the breeze in the second half but we held out.” There was no All-Ireland series until  when East Kerry won the title. Bellaghy retained their Derry title with a win over Slaughtneil in  before losing the final the following year to Newbridge. When they bounced back, it took them to their finest hour. A - to - win over Lavey saw them win Derry title number . In Ulster, they defeated Ballybofey, Ardboe and Teemore before taking on Armaghs Clann na nGael in the Ulster final. A - to - interval lead put them on their way to a facile win. In the All-Ireland series, it was a dferent story and Frankie OLoane was twice their savour. Tommy Diamond, Hugh McGoldrick and Chris Brown led from the half-back line against Portlaoise, but it was OLoane who tied the game late on, before Hugh Donnelly scored the winner in a - to - win. In the final, they took on the might of UCC and once again it took OLoane, with his seventh point of the game, to level matters late on. When Hugh McGoldrick broke up a Cork attack, Brendan Cassidy went on to score and the Tones were crowned All-Ireland champions. “Theyhad  county players, they were from all around. Moss Keane was full-back, he was a big tower of a man but Tom Quinn was too much for him.”   All-Ireland club - Tommy is on the extreme left of the front row Later that night, Cassidys lorry ferried the team up and down Bellaghy street to a heros welcome. Absent was the cup, as East Kerry didntit. “It is the sort of thing they cant take away from you,” Diamond said, of achieving the pinnacle of club football. He would later turn to management and managed Derry for  months at the end of the s, but stepped down after he felt the County Board were not allowing him full control of the team. Before that, at the start of the  season, Bellaghy were unable to get a senior manager, so Diamond put his name forward. The Tones went seven seasons without a title and werent tipped for glory. “Nobody wanted to take it. A lot of these managers, unless theyare good they are not interested at all,” he said. After winning the Derry title, Diamond took his side to Crossmaglen for the opening game of Ulster. After a battle, Bellaghy came out on top, but lost in the next round by a point at home to Castleblayney. “We shot in and shot inand Blayney went on to beat Burren in the Ulster final. I went to it in Dungannon, it was a dour match, - to -,” Diamond recalls, as Burrens quest for four-in-a-row failed. ”I said I would take themas far as I can, there wasnt much hope for them. We got them going rightly and I was disappointed we didnt win an All-Ireland with that team. I felt they were good enough.” *** Another passion is golf. He has been member of Ballymena Golf Club for  years, where he still plays with lelong friend Gerry McCann. He has been a member of Moyola, where he is now the Ranger.  Tommy andSeve Ballesteros Another friend of Diamond, Willie Cassidy, pulled off a coup in  by bringing Seve Ballesteros to play a round at the course, just months after he won the Masters. “I think it cost pound, to bring him to Moyola, he was number one in the world and Willie got him,” Diamond adds. “It is the only course in the north of Ireland I think he played on and I had the honour of caddying for him, I was the lowest handicapper at the club. “I marked his card, he countersigned it and it is up in the clubhouse for ever more amen.” A letime of memories. Aside from the current lock-down, the chat continues every Thursday night over the winter. Tommy plays cards with friends and his sons. It is a ritual. The social hub and the legacy of parents John Joe and Cathys cafe continues. RELATED - Derrys path to their first taste of September. Click here...

They cant get enough credit. The leadership didnt faff about once Leo Varadkar signalled the need for a lock-down earlier this month. On a local level, clubs have rallied around their communities and provided direction on so many fronts. Last week they delivered the archive of All-Ireland finals to the world. What a brilliant gesture, following on from the terric coverage given by broadcaster TG. Struggling with the withdrawal from sport, for those who are fanatical about it, cannot be underestimated. Last week, it was great to take a look back at Derrys only All-Ireland title. Highlights aside, I havent watched the final - in full - since I was at school. googletag.cmd.push WATCH - All-Ireland final  Hammering Down in the first round was a statement of intent. A mauling that led Pete McGrath to admit, in the post-game interview, that Mourne fans deserved an apology. The gesture didnt sit well with the Down players. Monaghans Gerry Mone gave Derry a torrid time in the Ulster semi-final at Casement before Joe Brolly came from the bench to give the spark needed for victory. The Ulster final saw Damian Cassidy gracefully skating over the puddles in Clones, in a game the Derry players were going to win, come hell or high water. It took a late block by Tony Scullion on Manus Boyle and Brian McGilligans intervention to deny Donegal another goal chance, when they had crafted a two on one situation. googletag.cmd.push In the All-Ireland semi-final, it wasnt until Johnny McGurks wonder pressure point that Derry would eventually rest easy against the Dubs in the season-defining clash. Anthony Tohills outstretched arms of celebration before Joxers kick went over the bar will always stick in my mind. The branch of the Derry Supporters Shop at the top of Hall Street in Maghera was thronged with people in the lead-up to the final. There was so much expectation that Sam wouldon the Monday evening. In a powerful video interview with Shane Stapleton on #OurGame, Tony Scullion touched on how he felt the wave of emotion was almost congratulating them as they departed for the final. It was a Cork team that hammered a poor Mayo outfit in the semi-final, I thought. With hindsight and on watching the final, from someone outside the camp, the mental strength was Derrys greatest asset that day. Cork had nine players who had played in an All-Ireland senior final. They had played in five, winning two and losing twice, once after a replay. Derry, while being the upcoming team and having dispatched the  and  champions on their way, they were untested on the biggest day of the season. HAMMER BLOW From my position on the Hill that day, I can still see Joe Kavanaghs number  jersey cutting through the Derry defence before hammering past the advancing Damien McCusker. It was the first goal Derry had conceded since June , that sunny day in Castleblayney when Derry fans applauded Monaghan scoring their only point of the first half. In the second half, three Farney goals had Oakleafers shaking, before getting out with a draw. Kavanaghs goal brought me back to that day. Derry never do anything the easy way. Colin Corkery won the first two balls off Gary Coleman, John ODriscoll beat Tony Scullion to an early possession. Corks running game had Derry in all sorts of trouble. Fergal P McCusker and Henry Downey couldnt get to grips with Don Davis and Joe Kavanagh respectively. When Derry eventually went on an attack, Mark OConnor won the first battle with Seamus Downey. Derry were - to - in arrears. Was Derry going to fail the final hurdle again  Brian McGilligan then won a vital possession at midfield. It was small, yet massive. Later in the attack Damian Bartons trademark disguised hand pass - where he looked one way and gave the ball the other - found Johnny McGurk who fired over Derrys first point of the game. It took a series of Cork mistakes to swing the momentum. Teddy McCarthy dropped a routine pass from Niall Cahalane and McGilligan curled between the posts. The now dominant Tohill hoovered up a loose Teddy McCarthy pass before going on a storming run to win a free and Gormley slotted over. The Oaks were now only two points in arrears and growing in confidence. McGilligan turned the screw even tighter. John Kerins had been targetting Barry Coffeys height advantage over Johnny McGurk on his kick-outs. Across came McGilligan to win a ball he had no right to. It was inspirational. The big man launched a pass forward that eventually found Damian Cassidy. Cass swung a ball into the square. Seamus Downey made up the guts of  metres to take advantage of a mix-up between Kerins and OConnor, before punching to the net. Boom. Derry were on top. Heaney nearly beat Kerins to the ball for a further goal chance and, earlier, the Cork stopper made a brilliant save to deny Cassidy. Then referee Tommy Howard made two wrong calls. Cahalane buried Enda Gormley off the ball and got off with just a lecture. Seconds later, Tony Davis was harshly sent off for a lazy lunge at Dermot Heaney, with Howard gesturing the use of an elbow. It was the wrong call. The narrative was always that the punch woke Enda up. Thats harsh I feel. There was very little ball directed into his corner before that. Everything went thought Brolly. However, it lit a fire and Gormley went on to score six points. Derry twice led by three points and when Dermot McNicholl curled over, after the interval, it shouldve been the catalyst to push on. Brolly was toasting Brian Corcoran and shouldve been used more. John ODriscoll started the second half at wing forward, with Colin Corkery in on Tony Scullion. But when Don Davis inch-perfect pass took out the entire Derry defence, ODriscoll drilled to the net and Cork were ahead. Thats where the Derry resolve was again tested. And they passed. There was no sign of panic. McGurk was allocated the extra-man role. Fergal P McCusker, Henry Downey - and later McKeever – ran the show in defence. With the extra man, Damien McCuskers outfield experience saw him use short kick-outs before they were even invented. For all their control, they failed to ask any questions of Derrys defence, but when Gormley levelled the game, the Ulster champions superior fitness carried them into the three point lead. Even then, Derry did it the hard way. With Steven OBrien now at full-forward, Cork began to throw the dice for the last time. If every the term getting over the line was used, then this was all so relevant. Derry had performed better on other days during the Eamonn Coleman era, but winning was the only thing. Failure wasnt an option and they refused to be denied their moment of glory. It was richly deserved. Its just a pity there was no back door and that Eamonn was controversially sacked. This group had so much more to offer. RELATED - Sideline View wants Derry to fast forward.Click here...

They cant get enough credit. The leadership didnt faff about once Leo Varadkar signalled the need for a lock-down earlier this month. On a local level, clubs have rallied around their communities and provided direction on so many fronts. Last week they delivered the archive of All-Ireland finals to the world. What a brilliant gesture, following on from the terric coverage given by broadcaster TG. Struggling with the withdrawal from sport, for those who are fanatical about it, cannot be underestimated. Last week, it was great to take a look back at Derrys only All-Ireland title. Highlights aside, I havent watched the final - in full - since I was at school. googletag.cmd.push WATCH - All-Ireland final  Hammering Down in the first round was a statement of intent. A mauling that led Pete McGrath to admit, in the post-game interview, that Mourne fans deserved an apology. The gesture didnt sit well with the Down players. Monaghans Gerry Mone gave Derry a torrid time in the Ulster semi-final at Casement before Joe Brolly came from the bench to give the spark needed for victory. The Ulster final saw Damian Cassidy gracefully skating over the puddles in Clones, in a game the Derry players were going to win, come hell or high water. It took a late block by Tony Scullion on Manus Boyle and Brian McGilligans intervention to deny Donegal another goal chance, when they had crafted a two on one situation. googletag.cmd.push In the All-Ireland semi-final, it wasnt until Johnny McGurks wonder pressure point that Derry would eventually rest easy against the Dubs in the season-defining clash. Anthony Tohills outstretched arms of celebration before Joxers kick went over the bar will always stick in my mind. The branch of the Derry Supporters Shop at the top of Hall Street in Maghera was thronged with people in the lead-up to the final. There was so much expectation that Sam wouldon the Monday evening. In a powerful video interview with Shane Stapleton on #OurGame, Tony Scullion touched on how he felt the wave of emotion was almost congratulating them as they departed for the final. It was a Cork team that hammered a poor Mayo outfit in the semi-final, I thought. With hindsight and on watching the final, from someone outside the camp, the mental strength was Derrys greatest asset that day. Cork had nine players who had played in an All-Ireland senior final. They had played in five, winning two and losing twice, once after a replay. Derry, while being the upcoming team and having dispatched the  and  champions on their way, they were untested on the biggest day of the season. HAMMER BLOW From my position on the Hill that day, I can still see Joe Kavanaghs number  jersey cutting through the Derry defence before hammering past the advancing Damien McCusker. It was the first goal Derry had conceded since June , that sunny day in Castleblayney when Derry fans applauded Monaghan scoring their only point of the first half. In the second half, three Farney goals had Oakleafers shaking, before getting out with a draw. Kavanaghs goal brought me back to that day. Derry never do anything the easy way. Colin Corkery won the first two balls off Gary Coleman, John ODriscoll beat Tony Scullion to an early possession. Corks running game had Derry in all sorts of trouble. Fergal P McCusker and Henry Downey couldnt get to grips with Don Davis and Joe Kavanagh respectively. When Derry eventually went on an attack, Mark OConnor won the first battle with Seamus Downey. Derry were - to - in arrears. Was Derry going to fail the final hurdle again  Brian McGilligan then won a vital possession at midfield. It was small, yet massive. Later in the attack Damian Bartons trademark disguised hand pass - where he looked one way and gave the ball the other - found Johnny McGurk who fired over Derrys first point of the game. It took a series of Cork mistakes to swing the momentum. Teddy McCarthy dropped a routine pass from Niall Cahalane and McGilligan curled between the posts. The now dominant Tohill hoovered up a loose Teddy McCarthy pass before going on a storming run to win a free and Gormley slotted over. The Oaks were now only two points in arrears and growing in confidence. McGilligan turned the screw even tighter. John Kerins had been targetting Barry Coffeys height advantage over Johnny McGurk on his kick-outs. Across came McGilligan to win a ball he had no right to. It was inspirational.

Michael McWilliams writes a weekly column in the Irish News called Dodgy Tackle. For this weeks column, which is in todays Irish News, McWilliams puts forward his best ever team. The criteria for selection is based on the premise that his World XI must be made up of up of players from dferent countries who have never played for the same club sides. McWilliamssfinal selection includes many of the worlds best known footballers - and our very own Felix Healy. googletag.cmd.push His full line-up is: Manuel Neur , Junior , Paul McGrath , Paolo Maldini , Felix Healy , Paul Gascoigne , Dragan Stojkovic , Zinedine Zidane , Kevin de Bruyne , Kenny Dalglishand Diego Maradona . Explaining his choice of Healy in the midfield, McWilliams states that it was a straight fight between the Derry man and the Colombian World Cup Carlos Valderrama. He writes: Carlos Valderrama nearly went in here, but when it comes to moustachioed midfield fulcrums, the Derry man gets in on a dodgy decision. And it is Dodgys decision. Hes playing at the base of the Diamond. Just across from the Sandwich Co. Pulled the strings for an early eighties Coleraine side that delighted this young fan, all shimmies and subtlety. The only things hairier than his upper lip were the legs bulging out of a pair of royal blue Adidas hotpants, briefly ditched for a pair of white ones as he led the Honduras midfield a merry dance for  thrilling minutes at the  World Cup. Swapped blue and white stripes for Candy ones later in the decade and a treble was duly delivered. Can now be seen leading punters a merry dance in music venues across the north-west. googletag.cmd.push And McWilliams had a message for anyone who believes that Colombian star Carlos should have got in to his side ahead of Healy. You can stick your Valderrama up your Bogside, he writes.

In addition, another  food parcels were delivered by last Friday.Local council officials have been working in partnership with their colleagues across local government, health trusts and the Department for Communities to set up the hubs.Down Leisure Centre has been transformed into a processing centre to organise deliveries, with other sites currently being identied should they be required, with staff working in split shts, while observing social distancing and other safety protocols.The new service covers the councilrsquos seven even district electoral areas with deliveries focusing on food supplies with the packages including items such as tinned and dried food, cereals and some essential toiletries.Requests for help from the council and its community and voluntary partners are arriving via Access NI which is processing calls from across Northern Ireland on a freephone helpline.Council chairman Charlie Casey says he is pleased to see just how many of the districtrsquos most vulnerable residents have been able to receive food parcel deliveries recently.ldquoOur sincere thanks go to all our partners who worked with us over the Easter break to achieve this and all the volunteers who have already kindly offered their help, he continued.ldquoIt is important that we provide a leline to those following medical advice to shield to protect their health, or who are self-isolating, and have no other means of assistance.The council chairman said that during the local authorityrsquos COVID- response, it will continue to work hard to deliver essential supplies to those who need them and ensure no-one feels alone or isolated at this dficult time.A COVID- community helpline is operational, with those in vulnerable groups seeking support asked to make contact between am and pm, seven days a week, with the helpline managed by Advice NI who are processing calls from across Northern Ireland.The Freephone number is   , while the email is covid@adviceni.net.

Therersquos plenty like me and we are all in the same boat.ldquoIt started when I received requests from nurses who I made their wedding or bridesmaid dresses in the past for. I ended up making scrubs for some entire hospital wards, male and female and in a iety of sizes.ldquoThat widened out to sewing for staff at local nursing homes. I just want to do something to help, particularly for nursing homes as my daughter, Abigail, works in one in Castlewellan.There is plenty of work to be done to complete her bridal orders, but Mrs Moorhead feels that her priority is for scrubs.ldquoMy weddings have been pushed back until October or November or even next year. There are things that would hamper me. I canrsquot see brides to fit them and I wouldnrsquot want to go too far ahead with orders in case some people gain weight or lose weight, she said.ldquoAlso,the wedding changes seasons, that can change the outfit ordered in style and colour. For instance, a mother of the bride might want a jacket as well or might want to lose or shorten sleeves so I feel I canrsquot go to far ahead with my orders. Brides have needed me to reassure them that everything will be alright for their big day, whenever it happens, and I can absolutely promise that.ldquoAbigail is getting married in November and her sister, Johanna, is getting married next May, so they will be the most special wedding dresses I will make in my letime. I feel that I have to keep going with the scrubs as itrsquos so important. However, I will make sure that I will provide all outfits that have been ordered from me. It has become a family affair as Mrs Moorheadrsquos husband, Joe, who also is unable to work as an engineer in the lockdown, helps with the pressing of the garments while Johanna helps with the sewing.Mrs Moorhead has been creating the scrubs from donated material, much of it brand new, and is very grateful for the donations..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar man takes Chance with move to Hong Kong 26 years later opens superstore  ","story":"AT the age of  and without a word of Cantonese, Richard Bowsie left his family and friends behind in his home village of Crossgar for a le of adventure in Hong Kong.Twenty-six years later and now a married father of two, Richard has found love, happiness as well as a successful career as the owner of two second-hand furniture stores in the huge cosmopolitan city with over seven million inhabitants.He and his locally-born we, Mavis, run nd Chance Furniture that provides shoppers in the city and online across the world a virtual Aladdinrsquos Cave with thousands of unique and affordable items - ranging from lacquered tables to pool tables, Chinese vases to Balinese drums.While other young ambitious men were told to lsquogo westrsquo, Richard went east, finding Hong Kong to be every bit as much the land of opportunity as the United States.The father of eight year-old daughter Kailey and son George, whorsquos coming five, literally changed his le in three days when he made the decision to fly to Hong Kong.From working as a leguard at the Tropicana centre in Newcastle and at the former Down Leisure Centre, the former student of the High School, Ballynahinch, had been close to completing his BTec qualication in Leisure Management at the former Newcastle College of Further Education.He ped out of his course a few months shy of graduation due to bullying. While his parents, Margaret and Ken, a well-known architect, were shocked at their middle sonrsquos decision, they were not surprised.He recalled: ldquoI had a friend who had travelled to Hong Kong three months previously. During a phone call he told me that the new international airport was under construction and work was easy to find. Three days later I arrived.ldquoI decided to go by myself as I had been trying to find an exciting job at home for a while but kept being told I was too young for the roles or lacked experience. My parents knew I was ambitious and how frustrated I was becoming with my career ambitions being knocked back all the time.Richard admitted he hadnrsquot a clue what to do once he arrived and took a bar managerrsquos job as an interim position as many of the airport workers drank there.His first job at the airport turned out to be with the Northern Ireland company, Lagan Construction Group, before going to another Belfast-based company, Rotary International, with which he worked for two years.ldquoI felt excited and nervous all at the same time when I first moved to Hong Kong, said Richard.ldquoThe first thing that struck me was the heat, after leaving cold and damp of home. Arriving in  degrees and high humidity was certainly a shock to the system, despite having been on family holidays to France most years with my family and once to America with a cross community group. The heat in Asia was a massive shock.Having grown up in a rented manse on the Rademon estate, Richard swapped a quiet rural existence for the hustle and bustle of the global port and major commerce centre. It was still under British rule and would remain so for another three years before it was handed back to China.Richard said: ldquoLanguage was the biggest shock but I made it my mission to learn the language and enrolled in YMCA lessons but also managed to pick it up from also working alongside locals.It wasnrsquot long before Richard felt confident enough to start out his own business, an electrical supply company which employed  staff.He said: ldquoI knew after the first few months that Hong Kong was going to work for me,you worked hard, nothing could hold you back, age was not an issue here. Opening a business here was very straight forward, just need a bank account and register an address.He met his we Mavis during his first month in the city and the two have been together ever since.They opened their first store in  in the after seeing a large amount of good furniture being thrown away each week and were determined to do something that would reduce the waste and help the environment. Within months, they had outgrown this store and relocated to their current , sq ft premises in Tuen Mun.The couple has recently opened a second, , sq ft premises in Chai Wan which is closer to the busy capital.Fluent in Cantonese for many years, Richard has seen Hong Kong go through many challenges, not in the least with the recent coronavirus pandemic.ldquoHong Kong has handled the virus very well, having been through SARS and bird flu before, said Richard. ldquoAs soon as we heard there was an issue over the border in China, Hong Kong went straight into prevention measures before even being advised to. Now everyone wears masks and observes hygiene measures.The preventative measures must have been successful as the city recorded zero deaths on Monday for the first time since the outbreak before Christmas.While the move to Hong Kong was the right one for Richard, he still misses home and his brothers and sisters, Simon, Gillian, Laura and William.He said: ldquoI miss the food, the greenery and, of course, my family who are all still in Northern Ireland. I miss being close to home as I have lost family members and grandparents.ldquoBut we come home as often as we can. Mavis and the kids love Crossgar, especially AJs Diner. They love the Rademon estate where we lived beside, walks down the Church Road to Kilmore and the open green fields. We have very few here in Hong Kong and any we do have are full of mosquitos.Home is always on Richardrsquos mind, as is his business.He adds: ldquoNext for our business is hopefully more expansion as I would like to start exporting furniture to other countries such as Northern Ireland.

OrsquoHare has the advantage as he is stable amateur to Navan trainer Noel Meade.Noel McParlan also got on the scoreboard and he was the top local point-to-point rider.Last week proved to be a sad one for local racing on Easter Sunday as Dr Fitz Gillespie, MBE, passed away suddenly at the age of .

I can recall him winning on Raise An Argument at Downpatrick. Like his father, he also trained and one of his locally based owners was Joe McGrath, from Annacloy.Dr Gillespie was a regular steward at local meetings and also at many Southern racecourses. He was also a good supporter of the former Downpatrick Racecourse Supporters Club.

He said those who leave their vehicles outside the parks do so to avoid paying entrance fees and walk in instead.ldquoBoth parks have been shut since the coronavirus outbreak and now the government department responsible for them has agreed that they can reopen, continued Mr McGrath.ldquoHowever, local people are concerned that the move to open the parks for pedestrians only will encourage people to travel from further away and park outside their entrance gates.Mr McGrath said agriculture minister Edwin Poots is encouraging police to patrol the areas outside the parks and to manage this accordingly.The MLA added: ldquoThis is something I would also endorse and urge people to remember that the parks are only open for pedestrians.

Mr James said bluntly yesterday:ldquoThere are people who had an opportunity to say things at an early stage but did not. Now they have really pulled the carpet out from under our feet at an advanced stage.

It is also my understanding that Newry, Mourne and Down Council and Northern Irelandrsquos other  councils are working closely alongside the government department at this time.Cllr Walker said he would like to see the recycling centres open again, suggesting that strict controls could be introduced to only allow two vehicles access them at any one time.ldquoI would also appeal to people at this time to keep their waste until the recycling centres are open again. I appreciate that many people who are not at work at the moment are making the most of the time they have to clean out their homes, sheds and garages and I commend them for being active.ldquoHowever, it simply isnrsquot on to load up you car with waste, drive to a secluded area and dump it. I just donrsquot understand the mentality of people who engage in this kind of behaviour.Cllr Walker also said the cost of clearing up illegal waste is borne by the districtrsquos ratepayers.ldquoWe have the ironic situation that those who dump their waste illegally end up paying for its removal viatheir rates. This beggars belief, he declared. ldquoThe stupidity of those who dump waste in secluded areas is beyond me.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe time has come for common sense and people really need to catch a grip of themselves. One of the most worrying aspectsof illegal dumping is that waste which ends up in fields is sometimes eatenby livestock which often results in deadly consequences. To those who dump their waste illegal my appeal is stop now.The local council has confirmed that it is receiving increasing reports about fly-tipping across the district since the start of the COVID- crisis. But the organisation insists that it is currently able to manage the issue within existing resources.A council spokesman said that the organisation continues to work closely with the Environment Agency which also performs a key role in addressing incidents of larger illicit dumping.On the issue of reopening the districtrsquos household recycling centres, the spokesman explained that the decision is continually being reviewed in line with government social distancing measures.He continued: ldquoFly-tipping is illegal and the council will strictly enforce this where evidence can be gathered. Responding to fly-tipping incidents also erts important council resources away from providing other essential services.The spokesman confirmed that the council is unable to remove illicitly-dumped waste from privately-owned land, explaining that where this occurs, both it and the Environment Agency has the legal powers to request its removal.He said the council will enforce this where required.The spokesman added: ldquoThe council would urge the public to avoid producing any unnecessary waste, including undertaking DIY and house and garden clearances at this time due to the considerable pressure being placed on public services.ldquoAny additional waste that is produced should be stored for future disposal at the household recycling centres once they re-open.

In a glittering playing career, the Ballykinlar man went on to win two more All-Ireland medals and established himself as one of the legends of the Gaelic football. Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals. He was the leading scorer in Ulster for eight seasons and in Ireland for three years.Now in his s, hersquos followed Downrsquos fluctuating fortunes ever since, relishing in theof the glory days in the early s, sharing in the disappointment of the barren times and casting a critical eye from the sidelines, though always with the optimistic outlook of the true fan.So what does he believe is the greatest Down team of all time Not surprisingly, given their accomplishments, hersquos largely selected his choice from his team-mates from the Sixties mdash though with typical modesty, he has not picked himself for the starting .ldquoYou have to remember that the Down team of s was the first to bring the Sam Maguire over the border, he says.ldquoThat was a really big achievement and we had beaten Kerry in the final. We had shown we were the best team in Ireland and we proved that again the following year in the final against Offaly after beating Kerry in the semi-final. We also beat Kerry in the  final, which meant that we had beaten them three times.ldquoKerry have always been the benchmark. If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 Queen.jpg","title":"Queen Karen Europe’s best  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH grandmother is a European powerlting champion at the age of .Karen Burns won the European title in France in March and set a new world record in the process.Powerlting involves three disciplines mdash squat, bench press and deadlt mdash and Karen capped a brilliant performance with a world record breaking lt of  kilos in the deadlt.Itrsquos a fantastic achievement for Karen, who only took up powerlting four years ago.The legal secretary, who has two daughters and four grandchildren, started gym classes at the age of , but within a few months made the switch to powerlting.Coached by Aaron Kelly, from Affinity Fit at the CG Fitness gym in Annacloy, she trained four times a week and was soon competing and winning medals at a national, international and world levels.She was the British champion two years running in  and .

This would be known as Serious Condition Criteria.While widely welcomed, what was not made clear was Departmental staff have discretion around who meets criteria and can overrule a claimantrsquos medical evidence.A number of enquiries were submitted to the Department under a Freedom of Information request.The responses are concerning.The Department stated legislation does not refer to serious conditions but rather whether there is a relevant change of circumstances. The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who are unlikely to ever move into work: ldquoTook effect from  September , but did not result in legislative change.The Department was asked about the right of appealing a decision rejecting a claimant for Serious Conditions Criteria, who responded: ldquoThere is no automatic right of appeal against a determination which is embodied in or necessary to a decision. , a claimant has a right of appeal against an outcome decision rather than a determination, which is merely a component of the outcome decision.This was complicated for non-legally trained or represented claimants, so questions were put around full compliance with the Disability Discrimination and Human Rights.The Department responded stating it: ldquoDoes not hold any information relating to this hellip.may have been undertaken by DWP.A copy of the risk-assessment template used by the Department in instances of considering Serious Condition Criteria, was requested, but: ldquoNo template existsInstead, the response referred to assessment procedures where Departmental Healthcare Professionals advise on the re-referral period, and consider whether a claimantrsquos condition meets: ldquoThe new severe conditions criteria andno further assessments are required.However, the claimantrsquos own medical professionalrsquos opinion around Serious Condition Criteria could be over-ruled, with this decided by: ldquoAn Administrative Officer appointed by the Department.In respect of providing the legislation or guidance which permits the Department to overrule clinical opinion provided by a claimant seeking consideration under the Serious Condition Criteria, the response referred to ESA Regulations , which: ldquoProvides for the redetermination of whether someone has limited capability for work. The time period in relation to this is not set down in the legislation but is largely at the Department Decision Makers discretion ndash usually based on available medical evidence including medical reports from ATOS hellip The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who would be unlikely to ever move into work, took effect from  September  but did not result in legislative change.As the Freedom of Information request was answerd prior to the restoration of devolution, the Department was asked with a Minister now in post, to comment on current processes around Serious Condition Criteria decision-making and in particular, how it can by discretion supersede a medical diagnosis by a claimantrsquos clinician. It was also askedprocedures are under review andthere is intention to bring forward legislation to allow for scrutiny or challenge.A spokesperson said: ldquo Anyone claiming ESA will be automatically assessed for the Severe Conditions criteria at their Work Capability Assessment by a Healthcare Professional. If the personrsquos condition or its al effects meet the criteria, the Department will be advised that no further assessments are required.In response to the overruling of clinical decisions, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe Work Capability Assessment looks at the al effects of a personrsquos condition, rather than the diagnosis itself. It is not a supersession of the opinion of their clinician.This dfered to the response provided prior to the Minister taking office, which appeared to show the Department was permitted to over-rule the evidence of claimantrsquos clinician.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reality is we will look at the medical evidence. The Northern Ireland Executive will have its own flexibility and we may see across the country some iations we saw some iations going into lockdown as well. Itrsquoll be a decision that all four nations take together based on the evidence, he said.Mr. Lewis said he was aware of the complexities of Northern Irelandrsquos Border with the Republic of Ireland amid the pandemic, explaining that he has been meeting with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle OrsquoNeill and Taacutenaiste Simon Coveney.ldquoEven where there are dferences in the approach between the Republic and the North,there are,we know that we can make sure we are clear with residents why those dferences are there.ldquoThe challenge of having iations within Northern Ireland is how we manage that.An investigation in The Sunday Times at the weekend featured a Whitehall source claiming the government ldquomissed the boat on testing and PPEand ldquojust watched as the death toll mounted in Wuhan, China.The report also claimed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson missed five crucial COBRA meetings in the Cabinet Office in London.When asked to respond to these serious allegations, Mr. Lewis said: ldquoI didnrsquot recognise some of what I saw in the Times.ldquoI was in the Cobra meetings in January and February COBRA meetings are chaired by the Secretary of State in the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms. Itrsquos a place, not a thing.ldquoWe were making decisions the scientists and medical experts were making decisions at that time and planning was going on. This is the point to judge it now when we have two months more evidence is dangerous and a misleading thing to do.Turning to PPE which has been an issue in Fermanagh, Mr. Lewis used his own constituency of Great Yarmouth as an example of where there has been ldquono problems with accessing equipment.He added: ldquoWersquove had gowns sent over to the UK, OrsquoNeills [sportswear] converted to gowns, there is gin distillery in your part of the world producing sanitisers.ldquoWersquore shting five and a half million pieces of PPE across to Northern Ireland. Wersquove been able to supply that itrsquos in good order. I am talking to the first minster every day that.Mr. Lewis said the priority of the United Kingdom government is to make sure ldquowe donrsquot hit the second peak of the virus.ldquoOne of the most damaging things economically would be, as well as health wise, to start coming out of lockdown ndash restaurants, pubs, whatever start opening again ndash and suddenly you have to close down again and thatrsquos not viable.ldquoI think itrsquos right to be cautious about this wersquoll make that decision in a few weeks.ldquoThe science is shting on this the experience is changing. I am cautious about predicting what will be in a few weeksrsquo time.He believes the government could ldquoflatten the curve of Covid-people continue to stay at home, adding: ldquoWe want to see past the peak, you donrsquot want to see a downward trend and ease up as all you do is let it shoot back up again.ldquoIf you think back to the beginning there were some quite scary numbers being put about by some experts about what the deaths might be. Now any death is too many and we have sadly lost people, friends and family who have gone through tragic experiences recently, and the figures are nowhere near those numbers we saw at the beginning.ldquoThatrsquos because the public across Northern Ireland and the UK have done a good job generally of following the guidelines which means we can flatten that curve, he said.Mr. Lewis explained that he had personal experience of people close to him who had been diagnosed with Covid-, including his parliamentary private secretary.ldquoSomeone I know lost a member of their family this week, I have a few people in family who had the disease.

There is a transition period where you are not really the Archbishop of Armagh but you want to be as helpful as you can and you are also I suppose trying to work out what and how you are going to approach the task.The Archbishop-Elect explained the three facets to the roleHe said there was the appointment of Bishop of the Diocese of Armagh, which has a larger population with a great number of large towns in it than Clogher Diocese.In addition, there is the role of Primacy of All Ireland, considered lsquoFirst among equalsrsquo acknowledging there is another Primate in the southern province but to some degree to be an ambassador for the Church of Ireland.He added: ldquoThe third element is your place within the wider Anglican Communion which I have relatively little experience of. You become a member of the Primatersquos Meeting which is one of the instruments of communion within Anglicanism. There are a number of ways we hold ourselves together, the Lambeth Conference, the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Anglican Consultative Council and more recently, the Primatersquos Meeting.So what type of church do you see under your leadership ldquoItrsquos dficult to speak for the church as the Church of Ireland General Synod is the body which has that authority. There is a saying that the Church of Ireland is synodically governed and episcopally led. What the Archbishop of Armagh can do is to speak to the Church and suggest can concern itself with. It sets a bit of a tone as well. Itrsquos about its spiritual le and its own governance and the need to acknowledge that like probably all institutions and all bodies some bits of it do well and some do not do well some bits are growing and some bits are shrinking some bitsvery well and some bitsnot so well and to maybe try to discover that the bits that do not do well could do a bit better, in terms of spiritual le and acknowledging there is a huge ersity within Anglicanism and to remember that thatrsquos all part of the Anglican heritage.ldquoThere are obviously particularly challenges at the moment, what the church says to society and what it does for the society in which it is placed. You cannot pretend it doesnrsquot live in a political context. Politics is not something that just happens in Parliament. Democracies are places where political discussion or dialogue are about what we can do together or decisions which are deeply embedded. There are institutions which are recognisable bodies in civil society such as the business community, trade unions, voluntary sector and churches are one of those. I think they have their particular things to say and its perfectly legitimate for them to say it.ldquoThe big imponderable at the moment is coronavirus and we have no idea how deeply that will affect the patterns of society. We could come out the other side of that challenge a changed society, with maybe small changes and maybe some very profound changes. Of course the other big external issue is Brexit which involves the relationships between the dferent regions within Ireland and the United Kingdom.ldquoI could be in both parts of that jurisdiction in one day praying for good governance for both of them and for their leaders, he said.In terms of reaching out to people in the Church of Ireland, the Archbishop-Elect recalled how a Northern Ireland Le and Times survey revealed around  per cent of people in Northern Ireland attend church at some point. He said the heyday for attending church was in the period from the late th Century to the period to the middle of the s. But he thinks current attendance is ldquoback to the old norm with fewer people committed to regular churchgoing.He rightly points out that churches are among the very few inter-generational bodies with people of dferent ages attending.The Archdeacon-Elect says people in very small rural parishes are committed to their churches in the sense that they are contributing to their community who feel it is being enriched with their presence. He said the church finds its place in the community.ldquoThe second challenge is what we are for ourselves as a group, as a faith community, how we build up the church, which canrsquot live in isolation but we have our particular family traditions - how we contribute to the ersity of Ireland, how we build up the church to be confident communities of faith and not hesitant or fearful or invisible communities of faith.He said for the Church of Ireland, there was tremendous heritage from Anglicanism.ldquoThe Church of Ireland has a particular way of doing things, liturgically. Liturgy is both the expression and source of our belief. Our vocation may be to hold together what on the face of it appear to be contradictory things is maybe one of our roles in religious and spiritual le. I have no ideait is the best way to be a Christian but it is our way and it seems to contribute something to the catholic church, the wider church.ldquoHarry McAdoo, a well-known Archbishop of Dublin and a great scholar, once said, lsquoIf I hadnrsquot been born an Anglican, I would have had to become one.rsquoThe Archbishop-Elect leaves Clogher Diocese after forging and maintaining good relations with other denominations.He said: ldquoI think the vast majority of committed Christian people see more in common with other Christian traditions than separating us. There is a very long history of ecumenism in the diocese of Armagh as well. There is a long association and friendship with Archbishop Eamon Martin and I hope we can continue to build relationships and friendships.The Archbishop-Elect trained for Church of Ireland ministry after a career in industry in which he held a senior role in Shorts and was for a time, Assistant Director of the CBI in Northern Ireland.ldquoThat probably give me some skills in organisation and about leadership. Irsquove been very lucky here. Irsquom not very fond of the word lsquoleaderrsquo in the ecclesiastical world but one of the things a leader does is to build a team around him. It is almost a contradiction in terms to be involved in a leadership role in Christianity, to do it on your own.ldquoThere are certain things as a bishop that end with you. There are plenty of lonely moments in that sense where you have to make decisions. But by and large business acclimatised me to working with all sorts of dferent people from all sorts of dferent backgrounds in dferent ways and to experience what every parishioner experiences, normal working le with those pressures.As Bishop of Clogher the new Archbishop-Elect held a number of positions nationally and internationally representing the Church.He was the Church of Ireland contact person to the Churches of the Porvoo Communion which represents the Scandanavian and Baltic Lutherans as well as the Spanish and Portuguese Anglicans and other Anglican churches and provinces from these islands making contact at senior level travelling with them.He has also held senior roles on the Irish Council of Churches, the national ecumenical instrument and also the Irish Inter-Church meeting, the latter which includes the Roman Catholic church.He said those bodies were important especially as ecumenism was becoming bland and it was important to keep going and keep talking.These inter-church bodies contribute to providing resources for churches around Brexit, homelessness, welfare reform and subjects churches would be expected to have a voice in.ldquoI enjoyed that hugely, I am coming to the end of that, six years in total two years as vice-President, two years as President and two years as outgoing Vice President. I will be involved again as a member of the Church Leadersrsquo Meeting.The Archbishop-Elect says of his time in Clogher Diocese ldquoItrsquos always been an aim of mine wherever I have worked to try to create a family atmosphere where there are degrees of mutual respect and degrees of mutual accountability. I remember saying that the diocese of Clogher is big enough to do thingswe all pull together in the same direction and small enough for everybody to be necessary for that to happen and to be accountable for what the contribution is. If you treat people with respect, then relationships are easier.ldquoBy and large I felt people were for me rather than against me. It helpsyou are reasonably interested in people and their families and what they do and acknowledge that as an important factor in their faith. Whoever the next Bishop of Clogher is theyshould allow him or her to be his or her own bishop of Clogher and not that they should be like me, Brian Hannon or Michael Jackson or like St. Macartan.The Archbishop-Elect says he enjoys reading history and poetry and in terms of music, takes particular pleasure in the tradition of Anglican anthems . He does admit to particularly enjoying the Psalms which are poetry.The Archbishop-Elect acknowledges that his mother who had a profound influence on his le, reciting the Daily Office at home and was happily committed to God and His Church and would have sung the Te Deum while washing the dishes. One of her favourite biblical phrases was from the Gospel of St. John, Chapter  ldquoI come that you would have le and that you might have it more abundantly.Relaxation for the Archdeacon-Elect is visiting one of his favourite places, the Ulster Museum to see the collection of Irish Art and reading.ldquoThe thing I am looking to reading most is I took possession of the third volume of Hilary Mantelrsquos Wolf Hall trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, lsquoThe Mirror and Light,rsquo an historical novel, he adds.The Archbishop-Electrsquos we Mary teaches in Enniskillen Royal Grammar School and his daughter, Dorothy, is at the University of Oxford.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Providing that people continue to be generous then there wonrsquot be a problem.As increasing numbers of people self-isolate to protect themselves from the virus, Claire said that the food bank was able to offer deliveriesnecessary.ldquoWe are a very open foodbank. If yoursquove got a need, just ask and we can do our best, said Claire.After the Church in Wales announced the suspension of public acts of worship, the Tabernacle and other churches in Penarth have been finding innovative ways to support their congregation.ldquoFrom this weekend we are going to be streaming virtual services, said Clair.ldquoOur musicians are recording pieces in their homes which will be shared online.ldquoAll our small groups meet on Zoom so wersquore in touch with our congregation.ldquoThe more elderly congregations are keeping in touch by phone and telephone to support them in every way ndash spiritually, emotionally and practically.ldquoThe epidemic is pulling everybody together and cutting across denominational boundaries.The Tabernacle Foodbank is open for donations and collections between am and pm Monday to Friday.You can also deliver donations to their collection point in Sainsburyrsquos on Windsor Road.The foodbank would particularly welcome tinned products, including curry, chilli, corned beef, and potatoes.For more information, visit: Info@tabspenarth or call:  . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If your dog stays where they are, wait a moment, then go back and reward them with an extra treat.Increase the distance you move away and the time you wait before ing with the extra treat. You should soon be able to leave the room and close the door or gate. Progress to spending more time in a dferent room. Build this into the daily routine.It’s important that your dog remains relaxed. If they show signs of distress, leave them for a shorter period, or don’t move as far away, next time.Rachel Casey, Director of Canine Behaviour and Research at Dogs Trust, said: “For many of us it has been great to spend so much time with our dogs during lockdown andmostly our dogs love us being around too. But all this extra attention could potentially create a ticking time bomb of separation anxiety for our dogs. If they expect us to be about all the time, it will be more dficult for them to cope once we go back to our normal lives and aren’t in the house  .“Now is the time to act to avoid future problems – and it’s easy to do. Just make sure that you factor in time apart from your dog each day to help them be able to cope when alone – this could be separated from you by a door or child gate for an hour or two whilst you’re working or home schooling the kids. By organizing your dog’s day, with time apart, play times, exercise, other activity sessionsand quiet times, you can make sure that your dog maintains their ability to cope with the dferent aspects of ‘normal’ le when we get back to it.”For more ideas on how to keep your dog occupied visit www.dogstrust.org.uk--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

INPT-. : -TONY HENDRONNNLocal MLA Jonny Buckley said: “I’m relieved that the Northern Ireland Executive have now come to the collective decision of reopening our cemeteries in a controlled manner.“This has been an extremely sensitive issue for grieving families and I am glad that Executive Ministers have reconsidered their stance.“Please keep safe whilst visiting the cemetery and adhere to social distancing rules.”Local MP Carla Lockhart said: “I know this has been heartbreaking for many families who have lost a loved one. Please await Council guidance on opening times and guidance on regulations.”Councillor Paul Berry said: “Let’s think of all those people who had loved ones die due to COVID and other health related illnesses but who couldn’t visit their loved ones grave . A very tough time for many many people.”SDLP Upper Bann said they were awaiting further details of opening hours and how it can be managed with social distancing but added: “For many people this visit is very important to them as part of their grieving process and something which they did on a daily basis prior to the pandemic.“The lockdown has robbed them of that special moment in the day where they go to visit the resting place of their loved ones.”Cemeteries were closed when social distancing measures were introduced towards the end of March .The NI Executive met on Friday afternoon and agreed that cemeteries throughout Northern Ireland could reopen.“This is about balancing public health concerns with the basic human need for people to visit their loved ones,” said First Minister Foster.Mrs Foster stressed it remains vitally important that the public remember they must continue to adhere to social distancing guidelines and wash their hands.Sinn Fein and the Alliance Party had previously supported the decision to close cemeteries across Northern Ireland.However, deputy First Minister and Sinn Fein vice-president, Michelle O’Neill, said the decision to re-open cemeteries came about because they had “listened carefully to the genuine distress of families who have not been able to visit the grave of a loved one”.“I understand that there’s a fine balance and making sure that people do not face additional burden in terms of their mental health and well-being and also our role in making sure that people are not put at further risk from the transmission of coronavirus,” she said.“So the opening of graveyards would only be permitted where there are those in charge of burial grounds that can ensure that we have compliance with the regulations and appropriate social distancing.“We continue to keep these issues under review,” she said.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1587656147249.jpg--marts_to_reopen_gradually.jpg?158765614700","title":"marts to reopen gradually ","story":"THE Department for Agriculture, Environment and Ruralaffairs has welcomed the decision by the Northern Ireland Livestock and Auctioneers’ Associationto open Livestock Marts on a gradual basis from Monday,  April.Livestock Marts closed voluntarily on  March - including Rathfriland Co-Op and Hilltown Saleyard - in response to Covid- health and safety concerns. Recently mart operators trialled a number of successful online sales to enable livestock trading to continue and are now gradually moving towards re-opening on a phased basis from next Monday, with some restrictions in place.In welcoming the decision, a spokesman said: “Farmers are key workers and are continuing to provide food for us all in very challenging circumstances. Part of that food supply chain is the ability to trade and sell animals.“Staff within the Department have maintained regular contact with Livestock Mart operators over recent weeks and have been reassured that robust operational protocols, developed by the Marts in conjunction with other stakeholders, will enable them to conduct business in a manner that is safe for staff, farmers and buyers and adheres to social distancing requirements.“DAERA therefore welcomes the decision to recommence sales of primestock, cull animals and store stock on a gradual basis from week commencing  April.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eefdcbdafae   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_beeadfaffdbfac   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
