The 14-day quarantine is set to be reduced to just a week by 14 November. Located almost 1,500 miles north east of New Zealand, Tonga is home to about 106,000 people. Only about 31 per cent of Tongans are fully vaccinated with 41 per cent have had at least one dose, according to research group Our World in Data.This is far behind both New Zealand and the UK with the countries having fully vaccinated 63 and 67 per cent of their eligible population respectively.   "},{"url":null,"title":"Cleo Smith family friends open Blowholes campground search","story":"Share this articleCleo Smith search: Family friend reveals first desperate hours of search for girl at Blowholes campsite | The West Australian"},{"url":null,"title":"RMT staff walk UNION accusing bosses questioning integrity","story":"Share this article General secretary Mick Lynch wrote to his members: \u0027I have been advised that our head office staff have entered into dispute with the union and have collectively decided to take industrial action today.\u0027That will mean that I am without administrative support or services until further notice.\u0027I will be seeking discussions with the GMB representatives and their trade union officials as soon as possible in order to address the issues and the situation.\u0027I hope you will understand that there won\u0027t be an ability for head office to respond or provide services at this time.\u0027He added that he was working to resolve the dispute \u0027as soon as possible\u0027.It comes after RMT and ScotRail reached a deal on Wednesday to avert train staff striking during the COP26 climate summit, being held in Glasgow from Sunday.The RMT trade union had demanded a 2.5 per cent pay rise backdated to April, and a so-called \u0027COP26 payment\u0027 for all staff in its final negotiating position.The union confirmed the planned industrial action would be \u0027withdrawn immediately\u0027 after an agreement on a pay rise was reached. "},{"url":null,"title":"BBC unveils plans impartiality crackdown","story":"Share this articleBBC to analyse all of its programmes for potential biasBBC boss offers to meet black executive after claims he was blocked from job | BBC | The Guardian"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09abc6ab56c03d15984196855196afc1aaddc7c/0_2837_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=ecc559100ef9cce6441340b923fa7ad3","title":"from last night in soho to narcos mexico a complete guide to this weeks entertainment","story":"AzorOut nowFrom debut director Andreas Fontana, Azor is a drama set in the world of Swiss bankers, but this ain’t Wall Street with cuckoo clocks: Fontana renders everything in a Graham Greene-ish hue, with an impending sense of doom trickling through every interaction in this cloistered and morally murky world.

However it was on advantage and the Ref brings play back for a Tongan opportunity to get on the scoreboard from the tee.Tonga go for the corner but they are off their feet at the breakdown to let the home side off the hook. Townsend - not a bad stand-off himself - has been giving us his thought about Blair Kinghorn in the position. Tell me all either on the email or tweet. I saw Dune last week, and reckoned it was very good, but you may not reckon this.  Other subjects are available for your reckoning the match today for example. Gregor Townsend couldn’t be bothered to pick a captain today, so he’s asked Jamie Ritchie and Ali Price share the job. This seems a confusing scenario and I hope they decide between themselves who is going to chat to the ref. I suggest they do via an arm wrestle or a dance-off, or perhaps a combination of the two. If it’s one-all after those two events the decider will be a round of Play Your Cards Right hosted by Dougie Donnelly.There are debuts in the forwards for Pierre Schoeman and Jamie Hodgson as well as a return for Rob Harley.

But there’s some quality here too, with captain Takalua an experienced operator and Walter Fifita of Glasgow Warriors. It’s been a bit of gap since Scotland last spent some time together, what with the cursed virus putting paid to their scheduled summer matches against Romania and Georgia. But while the playing timeline may have shifted, the intent from Gregor Townsend has not as he today fulfils his desire to try out lots of new stuff. Like the summer, the head coach has no access to a number of top men, this time due to scheduling outside the agreed test window rather Lions absences - of which Townsend was one, lest we forget. Tonga have similar issues. Coach Toutai Kefu is not with the squad as he recuperates at home following the shocking attack he suffered two months ago, and the net has been cast far and wide for players in Europe from as far down as the third tier in France. This is fifth time the nations have faced each other since their first outing at RWC1995. The previous meetings produced a wonderful solitary Tonga win at Aberdeen’s Pittodrie Stadium in 2012.

Coalition sources expect the outcome will be an expansion of the programme.Antigen testsMeanwhile, Taoiseach Micheál Martin has ruled out a widespread return to contact-tracing policies that absent children from the classroom, but said there could be a role for antigen testing in selected situations.The Department of Health said “mindful of the recent increase in Covid-19 incidence across the population, including amongst children” the National Public Health Emergency Team was reviewing data, international evidence and guidance on the use of antigen testing.Antigen tests are now being deployed to people who are deemed close contacts to a person infected with Covid-19, and who are asymptomatic, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said on Saturday.Mr Donnelly said the rapid tests are also being used in the health sector, and will continue to be deployed “where they’ll benefit”.To prevent further spread among children over the Halloween weekend, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan has advised people to give treats to trick-or-treaters outdoors if possible.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"g20 agree on urgent climate action ahead of cop26 draft document shows","story":"The Cop26 UN climate change conference is to be held in Glasgow from October 31st. Photograph: Andy BuchananAFP via GettyIntense diplomatic efforts are being made in advance of the Cop26 climate summit to get the world’s biggest emitters of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to increase their ambitions to combat climate change.Led by the US, the UK and Italy, the drive is taking place with a view to ensuring a better chance of limiting the global temperature rise this century to less than 1.5 degrees.A significant potential positive has emerged in the text of a draft G20 communiqué in circulation among world leaders gathering for talks in Rome, which commits to taking urgent steps to reach that key target of the Paris agreement. G20 countries are responsible for 80 per cent of global emissions.The communiqué, which is subject to negotiation and changes during Saturday’s talks, indicates that the world’s 20 richest countries are on track to commit to tackling the existential threat of climate change.This would pave the way for more detailed actions at the United Nations gathering of almost 200 countries, which begins in earnest in Glasgow on Monday.Pope Francis\u0026nbspon Friday lent his voice to calls for action rather than mere words at Cop26. He later met US president Joe Biden at the Vatican, with the climate crisis dominating their discussions.Expectations of a breakthrough at Cop26 are at their highest level since the Paris pact was agreed in 2015. Since then, as extreme weather episodes have intensified and carbon levels in the atmosphere have grown to record levels, climate scientists have underlined the importance of the 1.5 degree cap to limit the risk of environmental catastrophe. It is a key element of the agenda being pushed by the UK government, which is hosting Cop26.“Responding to the call of the scientific community, noting the alarming reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and mindful of our leadership role, we commit to tackle the existential challenge of climate change,” the draft communiqué, seen by Reuters, adds .“We acknowledge the key relevance of achieving global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions or carbon neutrality by 2050,” the statement says, referring to a recommendation by IPCC experts who say the mid-century deadline is crucial to meet the 1.5 degree warming limit.However, the 2050 date appears in the draft in brackets, indicating it is still subject to negotiation. Some of the world’s biggest polluters say they cannot reach the 2050 target date. China, by far the largest carbon emitter, is aiming for 2060 – as is Russia, which is not part of the G20. The bloc includes Brazil, China, India, Germany, Australia, the US and the EU.The draft communiqué reaffirms a commitment to “phase out and rationalise” fossil-fuel subsidies by 2025 and to curb coal-powered electricity generation. They also pledge to cut collective emissions of methane “substantially” by 2030. This deadline is also in brackets.The willingness of developed countries to help finance the ecological transition of poorer ones, known as “climate financing”, is likely to be crucial to the success of the G20 and Cop26.“We stress the importance of fulfilling the joint commitment of developed countries to mobilise $100 billion annually from public and private sources through to 2025 to address the needs of developing countries, in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation,” the draft says. There are indications some $80 billion has been committed by the developed world considerably short of promised.UK prime minister Boris Johnson said the fall of the Roman Empire showed how quickly civilisations can collapse as he urged G20 leaders to go faster on tackling climate change.Speaking to reporters on his flight to the G20 summit, he said it showed humanity “can go backwards as well as forwards”.“When things start to go wrong, they can go wrong at extraordinary speed,” he added."},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics covid rising energy prices and internal strife a difficult winter for the eu","story":"Europe correspondent Naomi O\u0027Leary talks to Hugh about the rising Covid numbers in many EU member states, the rising energy prices that are dominating the news and the row between Brussels and Poland over the rule of law.The best analysis of the Irish political scene featuring  journalists, political thinkers and the occasional politician.

Photograph: Gareth FullerPA Britain has threatened to target all European Union fishing boats in its territorial waters for “rigorous checks” if France blocks British boats from landing catches at its ports. France has also threatened to impose extra checks on British lorries as part of a package of retaliatory measures in a standoff over fishing licences with crown dependencies Jersey and Guernsey. Britain summoned the French ambassador on Friday and Brexit minister David Frost raised the issue at a meeting with European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic in London.“Lord Frost also set out to the vice president our concerns about the unjustified measures announced by France earlier this week to disrupt UK fisheries and wider trade, to threaten energy supplies, and to block further co-operation between the UK and the EU, for example on the Horizon research programme,” a government spokesperson said.\u0026nbsp“Lord Frost made clear that, if these actions were implemented as planned on November 2nd, they would put the European Union in breach of the Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA).\u0026nbspThe government is accordingly considering the possibility, in those circumstances, of launching dispute settlement proceedings under the TCA, and of other practical responses, including implementing rigorous enforcement processes and checks on EU fishing activity in UK territorial waters, within the terms of the TCA.”Fishing rightsUnder the terms of the agreement, European fishing boats that can demonstrate that they have been fishing in British coastal waters before Brexit should be given licences to continue fishing there. But Jersey and Guernsey have refused 55 applications from French boats on the grounds that they have not provided sufficient evidence.The issue has come to a head now because temporary licences issued earlier this year expire this weekend and only boats that have been licensed or are still under consideration will be able to continue to fish near Jersey and Guernsey.Boris Johnson, who is due to meet Emmanuel Macron in Rome on Sunday morning during the G20 summit, said he did not believe the French president wanted to threaten Britain.“There may be people on both sides of the Channel who may think they have an interest in promoting disharmony between the UK and France, promoting the impression of disharmony between the UK and France. I don’t think Emmanuel shares that perspective personally at all,” he said.‘Appropriate action’“On the particular issues that we have, we are puzzled about what is going on. We fear that there may be a breach of the terms of the Trade and Co-operation Agreement implicit on what is happening and some of the things that are being said. We stand by to take the appropriate action.”Lord Frost’s meeting with Mr Sefcovic ended without a breakthrough on the Northern Ireland protocol but their negotiating teams will meet again in Brussels next week. Lord Frost acknowledged “some overlap\u0026nbspbetween our positions on a subset of the issues” but said substantial gaps remained.The EU has offered sweeping changes to the way the protocol is implemented, which would eliminate most checks on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland but will not entertain Lord Frost’s demand to remove the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in determining if single market rules are being applied properly.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc analyse programmes signs potential bias","story":"The BBC is set to appoint external experts to ensure all of its content is impartial.Tim Davie, the director-general, has sought to tackle accusations of bias with an impartiality crackdown, which has included controls on staff sharing their opinions on social media and emphasising the need for neutrality in news roles.This firm line will now extend beyond news and current affairs, with experts from outside the BBC appointed to analyse all the broadcaster\u0027s content for signs of potential bias.Outside investigators will do this by leading a series of rolling reviews into different areas of output, from how tax news is covered to the contents of CBeebies programmes, to ensure impartiality guidelines are being met across the corporation.The BBC unveiled the initiative in a 10-point action plan aimed at maintaining editorial standards, stating: “This strategic programme of reviews will have topics and review chairs, likely to be independent of the BBC.“Reviews will look beyond news and current affairs to the treatment of the issue across the wider range of BBC output (e.g. documentaries, children’s programming and educational content).“They will consider how this broader output might contribute to overall public perceptions of impartiality, while recognising that audiences have varying expectations of different kinds of output, and that the creative processes involved can be very different.”The BBC’s board will select the topics up for review, and sign off on the independent chairmen appointed, according to the unveiled action plan.The announcement follows Mr Davie’s work in guarding against accusations of bias levelled at the broadcaster.It also responds to concerns over editorial standards raised by Sir Nichlas Serota, who led a review into the culture at the BBC following revelations about the deceitful way Martin Bashir obtained an interview with Lady Diana in 1995.Sir Nicholas found that the BBC “needs to do more to embed editorial values into the fabric of the organisation”. He also said the corporation has now announced it will be launching a “new editorial whistleblowing policy” for staff to flag breaches of editorial rules.There will be newly-assigned “senior iniduals in each ision with whom staff can raise concerns”, as well as editorial training courses rolled out across the organisation.The BBC has also said that no employee will be beyond reproach following the scandal surrounding Mr Bashir’s work with the corporation.The action plan states: “This will be reemphasised to all staff, making it clear that deliberate or negligent breaches of a serious nature, or attempts to conceal them, will result in disciplinary action or dismissal, regardless of seniority, profile or role.”More from NewsRight-wing firebrand Eric Zemmour targets French motorists to win over Gilets JauneWhen do the clocks go back, and why do we do it?Stonewall to judge NHS on LGBT ‘inclusion’Civil servants told not to use ‘black mark’ over alleged slavery linksMinister warns universities: ‘Put free speech at risk and you will face consequences’Lack of Margaret Thatcher figure has hindered fight against climate change, says leading scientistMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"booster vaccine under 50s might not needed say scientists","story":"With the booster programme for the over-50s finally picking up pace, thoughts are now turning to whether younger age groups will also be offered a third jab.In the initial vaccine rollout, the first under-50s received their jabs in mid-April - about four months after the programme started for the oldest and most vulnerable.If this booster rollout follows a similar timeframe, we might expect the first under-50s to be eligible for a jab in February. Yet it may not be needed after all. Current research has suggested that waning immunity is likely to be less of a problem for younger people than older age groups, so it is possible that the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) will not advise a booster for younger age groups.Recent data from Public Health England - now the UK Health Security Agency - shows that the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab’s effectiveness against symptomatic infection for the over-65s nearly halves to 36 per cent, five months after a second jab.In contrast, in 40 to 64-year-olds, effectiveness remains at 57 per cent at five months, having dropped by just nine per cent. The decline is likely to be even less for younger groups, who mount a stronger initial response to the illness. However, many had their second jabs less than six months ago, so scientists cannot be sure.Similar results were seen with the Pfizer vaccine, where effectiveness in over-65s dropped from 80 per cent to 55 per cent at five months, while the younger group still enjoyed 75 per cent protection.A similar pattern emerges in protection against hospitalisation. Effectiveness in over-65s who had the AstraZeneca jab dropped from 92 per cent to 86.5 per cent between four and five months after a second dose, while younger groups were still at 93 per cent. A source close to the JCVI told The : “Basically, waning doesn\u0027t seem to happen as quickly in younger people who were, in any case, vaccinated later than older people, so this doesn\u0027t become an issue until much later in the winter.“Waning is not a cliff edge. There is reasonable evidence of antibodies continuing to give a significant level of protection for at least eight months, especially when the first and second dose were in the UK.“And there is a respectable school of thought that the current booster campaign is a bit of an overreaction to a wave of infections that it won\u0027t actually affect, because it is being driven by teenagers.”There has also been a huge rise in the number of younger people infected since September, meaning many have already picked up protection from a recent natural infection that should last for many months.According to the most recent data from MRC Biostatistics Unit Covid-19 Working Group at Cambridge, some 71 per cent of 15 to 24-year-olds have now been infected, along with 78 per cent of the five to 14-year-olds.Figures from the Office for National Statistics also showed that while antibody levels are now declining in all age groups over 50, they are remaining strong or rising in all the younger groups. While vaccines and infections have caused antibody levels to rise, the lack of decline in younger groups is because they mount a stronger immune response to begin with. It is the reason they are far less likely to become seriously ill or die from the virus. Even without vaccination, a person aged 30 to 39 is still about half as likely to be hospitalised with Covid, compared to a vaccinated person aged in their 70s.For older people, immune cells that normally respond to infections or produce antibodies become less efficient and sluggish with age, and no vaccine or infection will trigger the same protection as it does in the young.The  also understands that some experts at JCVI believe that it may be time to allow the virus to move freely through younger age groups.A well-placed source said there may be little point boosting younger people when they will be just as well-protected by repeatedly catching a virtually harmless low level infection.Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, agreed and said: “The best thing is to get vaccinated and then a few months later get the infection.Then the quality of the immunity you have in terms of going forward is going to be better.“The longer you wait to get a reinfection, the more likely it is to be severe.” However, the virus may have a sting in its tail. According to recent modelling by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the epidemic is expected to rapidly decline in November before a deadly resurgence next spring. If that is the case, the next wave could hit just as a large majority of the under-50s are starting to lose some of their immunity. High case rates in younger people also eventually trickle into older, more vulnerable populations. Analysis by the school has suggested that extending boosters to the under-50s would result in 20,000 fewer deaths in 2022. A source at the JCVI said there was still “plenty of time” to make a decision on the under-50s, which will allow more data on waning immunity to be gathered. But if waning immunity studies hold up and infection rates continue at such a high level, boosting such a low-risk population is unlikely to make much of a difference. More from NewsRight-wing firebrand Eric Zemmour targets French motorists to win over Gilets JauneWhen do the clocks go back, and why do we do it?Stonewall to judge NHS on LGBT ‘inclusion’Civil servants told not to use ‘black mark’ over alleged slavery linksMinister warns universities: ‘Put free speech at risk and you will face consequences’Lack of Margaret Thatcher figure has hindered fight against climate change, says leading scientistMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vulnerable can get covid vaccine boosters earlier six month","story":"Rules insisting upon a six-month wait for Covid vaccination boosters will be relaxed in some circumstances, with medics told the vaccine can be offered up to a month earlier.Care home residents and vulnerable people booked for flu jabs are among those who could receive vaccines sooner, following new guidance drawn up by public health officials.Doctors are being told that flexibility can be shown for “operational reasons” as long as five months has passed since the second jab.The change could enable care home residents to receive booster jabs en masse, making it quicker for vaccination teams to protect all residents.The new guidance from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) also says that those being called for flu jabs could also be offered an early booster at the same time.However, health officials said the most vulnerable were likely to be prioritised for early access to boosters.They said most over 50s should not expect to be called for their jabs earlier than the current six-month timeframe, recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.The latest advice is published in the UKHSA’s “green book”, which advises all clinicians of the latest advice on vaccines.People who are about to receive immunosuppressive treatment could receive boosters after a gap of four months, to avoid being vaccinated when their immune system is weak, under the guidance. Such patients would get a further booster, six months later, the guidance states.It comes after the deputy chairman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunsation said that reducing the interval for all over 50s was something that “we will need to consider in due course.”The new advice does not come from the JCVI, but the steps from health officials mean vaccination teams can have more flexibility in administering the programme.Officials said this would speed up the administration of life-saving booster jabs, making it more efficient and much quicker to reach the most vulnerable, helping to ensure they were protected over the winter months.The change reflected the “practical approach to vaccination that has made the programme successful so far”.Sajid Javid, the Health and Social Care Secretary, said on Friday: “We are making great progress with the booster rollout and I want to thank everyone working so hard to get jabs in arms.“This updated guidance will ensure healthcare professionals have the necessary flexibility in the booster programme, allowing more vulnerable people to be vaccinated where it makes operational sense to do so – including our loved ones in care homes.”Latest figures show that more than seven million booster jabs have been administered, including two million in the last week.More than half of over 50s eligible for a booster in England have now taken up the offer.Maggie Throup, the vaccines minister, said: “Covid-19 booster vaccinations are extremely important in keeping people and their loved ones safe this winter, and this updated guidance will ensure the programme can adapt to best protect certain groups.“I encourage everyone eligible for their jab to book theirs as soon as possible and secure this protection.”More from NewsWhen do the clocks go back, and why do we do it?Stonewall to judge NHS on LGBT ‘inclusion’Civil servants told not to use ‘black mark’ over alleged slavery linksMinister warns universities: ‘Put free speech at risk and you will face consequences’Lack of Margaret Thatcher figure has hindered fight against climate change, says leading scientistBritain cannot give in to France’s blackmail.

Remainers were right. They always said that Brexit would lead to an upsurge in populism and demagoguery that would undermine international relations, and it has. But it has happened in France, not the UK.The fisheries row follows a familiar pattern, with French ministers blustering and threatening while their British counterparts urge both sides to follow the rules. We saw the same thing over Aukus, over illegal migration and over vaccines. In each case, France threw a tantrum while the UK tried to behave like an adult.Over the past week, British ministers have been appealing both to their French counterparts and to the EU (which controls France’s fisheries agreements) to stick to the deal that the two sides signed on 30 December, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA).French ministers, by contrast, have been threatening all manner of semi-legal and illegal measures, from a go-slow on checks at the Channel ports to a ban on British vessels landing their catches in France.France’s Europe minister, Clément Beaune, speaking as one might speak of Iran or North Korea, says that Britain understands “only force”.“Ce n’est pas la guerre, c’est un combat,” adds his colleague, the fisheries minister, Annick Girardin, as if making some sort of concession. But picking fights that stop short of outright war is hardly the act of a friend.Make no mistake, France is crossing the road to have a fight with us. When such rows blow up, it is tempting to think that there must be a dollop of blame on both sides. But not this time.Let’s recall the sequence of events. Under the Common Fisheries Policy, fish stocks were treated as a “common resource” to which every EU state had “equal access” according to a quota system worked out in Brussels. Jersey was not in the EU, but its foreign policy was run by the UK, and it was covered by a supplementary treaty, the Granville Bay Agreement.When Britain left the EU, it resumed control of its territorial waters, out to 200 miles or the median line, as laid down by marine law. In theory, it could have reserved an exclusive right to fish in those waters for its own boats, but almost no country does that.Britain secured a larger quota for its skippers – a phased increase of some 25 per cent – but also agreed to recognise the rights of vessels that had historically fished in its waters, some going back to pre-EEC days.Part of the treaty dealt with waters between six and 12 miles from the coast. Here, Britain and the EU agreed to grant access to boats which could demonstrate an existing presence.In practice, that part of the deal applied only one way, because almost no UK vessels fish on the other side of the Channel. None the less, Britain interpreted the rules generously, defining “presence” as having fished at least one day a year over four years.Both sides – Britain and the Channel Islands on the one hand and the EU and its coastal states on the other – understood what was being signed. The deal was intended to cap foreign access to British waters at its existing level, a common enough concept in fisheries agreements, resting on what is known as a “reference period”.The UK and the Channel Islands have been immensely accommodating within the terms of that deal, admitting any reasonable evidence of past access to their waters, even offering their own electronic records, and granting interim licences to skippers who struggled to complete the paperwork in time.Jersey has licensed more than 160 EU vessels, almost all of them French. But a further 50 or so have not been able to provide any evidence of a presence in Jersey waters – almost certainly because they have not fished there. On any conceivable interpretation, the terms of the TCA exclude them.In this sense, France’s dispute is not so much with the UK as with the EU, which signed the treaty on its behalf – a point made acidly by Marine Le Pen. The EU has not disputed Britain’s contention that it is acting within the letter and spirit of the TCA.The question is whether, in the last resort, Brussels will uphold the law, or whether, like an unreformed trade union, it will take a “my member right or wrong” approach.You might think, given that it is currently suing Poland for an alleged refusal to uphold the EU legal order, that it would prioritise the rule of law. France, after all, is being quite open in its threat to flout international agreements.There are, for example, rules governing customs and borders procedures that allow for increased checks only as a proportionate response to an identified threat. The EU, as the signatory and guarantor of the TCA, has a responsibility to enforce it.But legality is usually trumped by what in Brussels is called “solidarity”. France’s prime minister has written to ask the European Commission for support, not on grounds that France is in the right, but because it must show that “leaving the Union is more damaging than remaining in it”.My guess is that the EU will be receptive to that argument. In the 21 years that I was an MEP, I witnessed dozens of spats between Greece and Turkey.Sometimes Greece had the better claim and sometimes Turkey had, but Eurocrats were never much interested in the rights and wrongs. It was Athens, not Ankara, that had the power to make their life awkward, so they invariably backed Greece, however petulant or unreasonable its position, to the point where Turkey lost interest in the Western alliance and turned its face eastwards.Is that our future? To be Turkey to France’s Greece? To be drawn into one needless spat after another until we abandon our strategic partnership with Europe? Or is there a chance that things will settle down after the French election?While we can’t say for sure, the omens are not encouraging. It is true that Macron can be more Anglophobic in his language than his Right-wing rivals. He knows that foreign quarrels play well at home. The issue itself is secondary – Astrazeneca, the Northern Ireland Protocol, an energy blockade, bah – what really matters is being seen to bash the old foe.Macron, who recently looked unelectable, is now leading the polls in any putative presidential run-off. Why should his tactics change if he wins?The most depressing aspect of the row – though, after five years of similar antics, hardly a surprising one – is the number of British commentators who have had their heads so turned by Brexit that they automatically back any EU state against their own.This requires some painful intellectual contortions. For example, the demand that Britain reward unprovoked blackmail is framed as a call for “maturity” or “de-escalation”. France’s blatant threats to act outside the law are excused on grounds that Britain has supposedly done the same thing over the Northern Ireland Protocol.(In fact, there is no comparison between a legal measure – Article 16 is expressly part of the Protocol, and the EU was quite ready to trigger it – and openly ignoring the rules but, even so, Britain has sought a negotiated settlement rather than invoking the clause.)As for the claim that all this is happening because of Brexit, it is true – but not in the way that Europhiles mean. French blockades were a frequent occurrence when we were in the EU. As an MEP representing Kent, I would regularly pursue compensation claims on behalf of hauliers and other afflicted businesses – usually, I am sorry to report, without success.But there is a sense in which this row was indeed prompted by Brexit. Britain has, as promised, taken back its territorial waters. The EU, rather than face a no-deal outcome that would have resulted in its total exclusion from those waters, signed a treaty in which it agreed to a phased reduction in its share. France does not like the consequences and so pretends to be shocked – shocked – by what the treaty means in practice.Britain cannot begin its relationship as an independent neighbour of the EU by giving in to patently illegal threats. Someone must stand up for a law-based international order.Boris Johnson should take inspiration from his predecessor Lord Palmerston, the priapic patriot who dominated our mid-nineteenth century foreign policy.

Homeowners, businesses, and environmentalists have all expressed their opposition. But there’s one consequence of the high-speed rail venture that has proved far less controversial: the fascinating discovery of hundreds of archaeological treasures. Armed with spades and hardhats, archaeologists working on Phase One of the project – the 150-mile route from London to Birmingham – have unearthed coins, moats and skeletons, right through from the Iron Age to the Victorian era.Archaeologists describe the rail project as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to shed light on more than 10,000 years of British history. New treasures are still being found every few months.On Thursday, a trio of Roman statues depicting the head of a man, woman, and child became the latest objects to excite historians. The discovery was “utterly astounding”, says Rachel Wood, lead archaeologist at the site in Stoke Mandeville, Buckinghamshire. “They’re really rare finds in the UK. The statues are exceptionally well preserved, and you really get an impression of the people they depict – literally looking into the faces of the past is a unique experience.” A hexagonal glass Roman jug was also discovered.But this week’s Roman discovery is just one of many intriguing finds along the HS2 route. What are the others?In conversations about HS2, it’s the natural beauty of the Chilterns that gets the lion’s share of attention. But some 80 per cent of the home demolitions required for Phase One are taking place in the north London borough of Camden, according to the borough’s council. In July, it was in the nearby borough of Hillingdon, in west London, that excavators discovered hundreds of coins dating back to the Iron Age. On one side, the coins were decorated with a profile of the Greek god Apollo on the other side was an image of a charging bull. Their design is thought to be based on coins used in Marseille some 2,000 years ago.“We found a patch of soil that was a very different colour from what it would be expected to be,” said Emma Tetlow, HS2’s historic environment lead, recounting the moment her team found the treasure. “The patch of soil was dark greeny-blue, which suggests oxidised metal. This is a once-in-a-lifetime find and allows us to expand our knowledge of what life could have been like in Hillingdon many centuries ago.”At Coleshill in Warwickshire, in January, archaeologists found the remains of a large manor house from around 1600. Aerial photography also picked up the outline of a moat surrounding the house. The house, dubbed “Coleshill Manor”, was thought to be owned by Sir Robert Digby. After marrying an Irish heiress, experts believe, he built his home in what was then a modern, flashy style, in an attempt to show off his new wealth. It included huge gardens measuring 300 metres across.“This is one of the most exciting Elizabethan gardens that’s ever been discovered in this country,” said Dr Paul Stamper, a historian at the University of Leicester, at the time. “The scale of preservation at this site is really exceptional and is adding considerably to our knowledge of English gardens around 1600.”Do not disturb the dead, warn the superstitious. Unfortunately for them, Phase One of HS2 collides with a number of ancient burial grounds, requiring the exhumation of thousands of bodies.Most controversial was the excavation of St James’s burial ground, near Euston station, which began in October 2018. Diggers found around 40,000 items of human remains, including that of Captain Matthew Flinders, who commanded the HMS Investigator as it navigated around the entire coast of Australia.It’s not unheard of for burial grounds to be relocated thousands of skeletons were moved across London in 1862 due to the construction of Charing Cross station, for example. But it always proves controversial.HS2 archaeologists were particularly interested in the village of Offchurch, Warwickshire. In the 19th century, a dig in the area unearthed an Anglo-Saxon burial ground dating back to AD 650, complete with shields, knives, spearheads, and items of jewellery. Hoping to unearth a similarly exciting discovery, a team of 42 archaeologists got to work between June and November last year.And it delivered. In the North Area of the site, archaeologists found a settlement of roundhouses (circular farm buildings), thought to be from the Middle Iron Age (between about 400 and 100 BC).In the site’s South Area, excavators found pottery dating back to the Romano-British area (40 to 410 AD) as well as signs of small timber buildings (they were probably used as farms), and evidence of metalworking and pottery kilns.More from NewsWhen do the clocks go back, and why do we do it?Stonewall to judge NHS on LGBT ‘inclusion’Civil servants told not to use ‘black mark’ over alleged slavery linksMinister warns universities: ‘Put free speech at risk and you will face consequences’Lack of Margaret Thatcher figure has hindered fight against climate change, says leading scientistBritain cannot give in to France’s blackmail.

Hydrogen is a cleaner fuel than natural gas because it does not produce carbon dioxide when burned.To speed up the transition away from carbon-intensive fuels, the Government is expected to pay hydrogen producers an amount which bridges the gap between the cost of hydrogen and fossil fuels, under a contracts for difference scheme.The plans by Advanced Biofuel Solutions Limited (ABSL) are set to be expanded to cover 650,000 households across five larger plants, the first of which is expected to open in Cheshire in 2025.The gasification process, which does not release any carbon dioxide or other pollutants into the air, is different to existing processes which burn waste as fuel for electricity.At the Swindon plant, which can process 8,000 tonnes of waste each year, the warm-up process has begun and the first shipments of household waste are expected to arrive within weeks.The process involves heating up mixed household waste to 800C alongside pure oxygen to make carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Recyclable materials such as metal and plastic are removed first.Initially, this hydrogen will be further processed to become methane - already widely used in transport and boilers - but the company hopes that growing demand for hydrogen will make it worthwhile to sell the cleaner fuel in the coming years.Currently, most hydrogen is created from methane in natural gas fossil fuels, a process which has high carbon dioxide emissions, so-called grey hydrogen.Scientists have been working on capturing and storing this carbon in a process known as blue hydrogen, though critics say this process is energy-intensive and may not be any cleaner than using fossil fuels.Hydrogen can also be made using electrolysis, which is known as green hydrogen as long as the energy is from renewable sources, but this is expensive and energy-intensive.ABSL say their process offers an alternative to these options, and also involves capturing the carbon dioxide and liquefying it.It can then be used to carbonate drinks, in food packaging and in making beer, though initially it will be used for non-edible uses such as fire extinguishers while quality tests are done to allow it to be used in food and drink.Chief executive Andy Cornell said: There\u0027s clearly a range of industrial heating applications, and even domestic heating, which won\u0027t be able to be met by electrification.So we\u0027re a solution for those areas. And then there are areas of transport - HGVs, buses - where electrification won\u0027t necessarily work.So we\u0027re not going to be the solution to decarbonise all of the economy. It\u0027s just picking the areas where you need fuels in order to be successful.The company says it will be the first in the world to take household waste and make it into gas that can be added to the grid.The ambitious project, which originally began in 2008, has faced problems, with a previous company going into administration. Some funding has come from the Government, including an £11m grant from the Department for Transport.Critics of gasification plants say the process can lead to more waste if they end up processing recyclable products such as plastic, and that more focus should go on reducing the amount of materials used and thrown away and improving sorting and recycling.Similar projects have faced technological problems, with American company Air Products cancelling two planned developments in the North East in 2016, blaming design and operational challenges. More from NewsStonewall to judge NHS on LGBT ‘inclusion’Civil servants told not to use ‘black mark’ over alleged slavery linksMinister warns universities: ‘Put free speech at risk and you will face consequences’Lack of Margaret Thatcher figure has hindered fight against climate change, says leading scientistBritain cannot give in to France’s blackmail.

After a decade of hung Parliaments and weak governments, here was a Conservative who then won a real majority and a real mandate. And not just a Conservative but a Conservative who the country seemed to love, an optimistic figure who promised brighter days. A man who was not just going to do what the electorate told the politicians to do in 2016 but who believed in the British future.Of course, all politicians end up being the creation of events, but still there is something especially bitter about the fact that Boris Johnson would appear to be leading Britain back to the 1970s. Because it increasingly feels like it is that un-missed decade that the present government is returning us to.The recent fuel shortages were caused by many things. They are a global issue and have been worsened by a worldwide shortage of heavy goods vehicle drivers. But the sight of cars backed up at petrol stations and drivers swapping rumours of places reported to have fuel supplies are not things that people are likely to forget.For those old enough to remember the 1970s, they were deeply reminiscent of the shortages which affected the country then. What the present crop of ministers seem to have forgotten is that it was only the genuine Conservatism of Margaret Thatcher’s government in the 1980s that did away with such problems.Perhaps the greatest change that the Thatcher government enacted was that performed by her revolutionary chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson. Before Lawson, the UK had performed the experiment that so many flailing Leftists still try to perform: they believed that the country could become rich by taxing the rich.It was the insight of Lawson, along with a crucial collection of Right-wing economists, that if you lowered the tax rates not only would the tax pot increase but the fuel of the economy would go into superdrive. So it was. When people know they are working for themselves they work harder. But when a majority or near majority of their earnings goes to the government then a deep stasis beds in, one which affects the inidual and then from the inidual seeps out across the whole of wider society.The Conservatives of the 1980s got Britain out of that mire of a high-tax, low-innovation society. Yet it is the Conservative Government of today that seems to be returning us to it.Naturally, some aspect of this has been out of their hands. During the coronavirus pandemic the whole world was in a situation that proved very far from business as usual. Staring at the options, the Government in this country – as in developed economies across the world – chose basically to buy up the economy for a period of time. They opted to keep whole sectors afloat on borrowed money. That period had to end, but it also had to be paid for. And that is part of the explanation for Rishi Sunak’s budget this week.The Chancellor has been adept at hiding some of the bad news. Not least by adding complexity to an already complex tax system. But the bottom line is that those who do the most for the economy will be taxed even more. Tax-payers in the highest bracket – that is those earning over £150,000 a year – will be taxed at a figure very nearly nudging 50 per cent. At 45 per cent the Conservatives are getting perilously close to the point at which they make top-rate taxpayers spend more time working for the state than for themselves. They already are, if you include national insurance.Such taxpayers are not a popular group of people to stand up for. More demagoguery can be achieved by lambasting higher earners than by expressing any sympathy for them. But we have been here before. The politics that thought that higher earners were both the problem and the piggy-bank was the politics that brought us to the economic slump of the 1970s.Worse is that a Conservative Government should be instituting these tax hikes while all the time showering money on an entirely unreformed public sector. Every part of it exemplifies the lazy big-state problem. On matters grand and pedestrian the behemoth asserts itself in the old familiar way.For instance, the Civil Service has been unsurprisingly reluctant to return to normal office working patterns. Recent negotiations with them centred on the desire of civil servants to invert their post-Covid working week. Their preferred option appeared to be in favour of going into the office for perhaps a couple of days a week and then having five days at home in the garden to recover from the strain.With other parts of the public sector it is even worse. The NHS is the reason why this country went into endless lockdowns and stasis during the Covid era. Again and again it was explained to us that we needed to protect the NHS, rather than the NHS protect us. The reality was that a Tory government lived in terror of the health service buckling. All those Labour lies about the Conservatives wanting to destroy the NHS would have run on for several more generations if anything remotely like that had happened, and so they showered the health service not just with love but with cash.This week, Sunak committed yet more billions to the NHS. The old joke of Britain being an NHS with a nice country attached is coming to look perilously true. The Government behaves as though it is held hostage by the health service, just as the country was held hostage by the coal miners in the 1970s. Even the new money that is being committed is intended to address problems – like patient backlogs – which the NHS itself needs to explain.But it never does. Instead of accounting for its shortcomings, the NHS just gets another cash injection from a terrified government.When a government is this scared of making bold moves or is captivated by the arguments of its opponents then it is hardly surprising that the country looks like it is sliding backwards all these decades. Across the country in recent weeks a group of rabid and extremist protesters from Insulate Britain, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, have been blocking major roadways, an echo of the disruption ushered in by the strikers of the 1970s.They are a pest and a menace. Yet these people who have been literally trying to block the economic arteries of our country have been getting away with it. Policemen stand around observing the pandemonium as though they are recording the events for some future purpose. Others negotiate with the occasional road-sitting granny, as though she were a jihadi with a suicide vest ready to blow.It has been members of the public who have had to do what the police will not do and haul these wretched nuisances out of the roadway. Often, happily, by the scruff of their necks. Why should the public have to do this? Only because this Government lives in fear of telling the police what they need to do. Just as they live in fear of telling the NHS what to do.So what, if anything, is the agenda of this Government? It appears that the aim is to become greener at all costs – even at the expense of soaring fuel supplies – and otherwise to be a high-spending, high-taxing welfare superstate. We will see what happens as the fuel bills keep coming in. And we will see if the fuel itself even does keep coming. But in the meantime we can say that the route this Government is taking is a route that cannot work. Because we have been here before.That time the Conservatives came in to save us. How strange it is that this time they are the people who have got us here.More from NewsWhen do the clocks go back, and why do we do it?Stonewall to judge NHS on LGBT ‘inclusion’Civil servants told not to use ‘black mark’ over alleged slavery linksMinister warns universities: ‘Put free speech at risk and you will face consequences’Lack of Margaret Thatcher figure has hindered fight against climate change, says leading scientistBritain cannot give in to France’s blackmail.

However, the more that the virus is able to spread, the more chance there is of it finding a way to break through vaccine defences. Follow Covid news - live: NHS chiefs urge government to implement winter ‘plan B’Figures show that the number of people testing positive for coronavirus currently stands at more than 40,000 per day. Hospital admission numbers are still below levels seen last autumn, although they are rising gradually.According to Professor Neil Ferguson, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) from Imperial College London, there are “a number of reasons” why the UK currently has higher infection levels than many other European countries.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the professor suggested that the UK has “lower functional immunity in our population than most other western European countries” for a number of reasons.According to Professor Ferguson these reasons include the vaccine rollout starting earlier in the UK than elsewhere and the fact that “we relied more on the AstraZeneca vaccine”.There are other suggestions that less mask wearing, more relaxed rules around mixing and a slowing vaccine rollout could also be behind the surge in figures. But why exactly are cases of Covid rising in the UK?Waning immunity?The UK was one of the fastest countries in the world to rollout the Covid-19 vaccine, meaning that immunity of some of those who were first vaccinated may be lower now.A study of Covid test results of vaccinated people who logged their symptoms in an app, suggested that after about five or six months, the protection against catching the virus wanes significantly.Join our new commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesView  comments"},{"url":null,"title":"covid stop spread tips winter","story":" simple ways to stop the spread of Covid - including new -minute ruleThe future looks a lot brighter than it did this time last year thanks to the vaccination rollout, but Covid is still here so we must do our bit to prevent its transmissionAdvertorialByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct Cold and flu season always puts pressure on the NHS, and although the Covid vaccines are the best line of defence against the virus, you can still catch it evenyou’re fully vaccinated. You can spread it to others too, and what might be no worse than a cold for you could spell danger to more vulnerable people. Cases are already high after theto school and university, and as peopleto the workplace and socialise indoors, they could rise further. But there are some simple steps you can take to stay safe... Let fresh air in  You’re much more likely to catch Covid- indoors, especially in a confined space with no ventilation. The risk isn’t just about being near other people – mixing indoors can lead to a build-up of the virus in the atmosphere. Meeting outdoors is safer, but that’s not always possible when it’s cold and raining. So whether you’re at home or at work, let fresh air in wherever you can. Leave vents open and windows ajar. If you’re having visitors round, open the windows for ten minutes before, during and after. Don’t worry about losing heat from the houseyou give it a good blast of fresh air – it will soon build up again. Wear a face covering One in three people with Covid- has no symptoms – and you can still get ityou’re fully vaccinated, so it makes sense to wear a face covering indoors whenever you can. Although the rules no longer require you to do so in some indoor settings, you’re protecting others when you wear it. Make sure it covers both your mouth and nose becauseyou do have Covid-, you can release contagious droplets every time you breathe out. So next time you hop on the bus or pop to the shop, think about wearing a face covering to protect those around you – and hopefully they’ll be doing the same. Get testedTaking regular rapid lateral flow tests gives you peace of mind – they’re free, easy to do and give results within  minutes. Go to nhs.uk get-tested or call  to order a pack. They’re also available at some pharmacies: first visit gov.uk get-collect-code to get a code that you will need to show when you collect them.You may also wish to consider taking a testyou’re likely to be in a higher-risk situation that day – for example, mixing in a crowded indoor space such as a nightclub, or visiting vulnerable people. Doing a test will reassure you that you are unlikely to be infectious with Covid-. If you do test positive, you can take action to help stop the virus spreading. Let’s send our children back to school safely. “It is a very good test,” says Public Health England’s Susan Hopkins. “Rapid lateral flow devices are effective at finding people with high viral loads who are most likely to transmit the virus to others.”It’s important to report all test results, whether they’re positive, negative or void, because that helps identy outbreaks early – you can do this at gov.uk report-covid-result, or call  free from your mobile or landline.Take a testyou think you have Covid  If you have symptomsyou must take a PCR test immediately, which you can book online. Evenyour symptoms are mild or you’re not sure, it’s worth getting tested. You can either go to a local test centre or you will be sent a PCR test to do at home. Don’t leave home until you get the result, andyou test positive you’ll need to self-isolate from the day your symptoms startedfor ten days. NHS Test and Trace will continue to protect the public this winter, by helping to break the chains of transmission – and they will inform youyou’ve been in close contact with someone who’s tested positive for Covid. If they contact you, they’ll tell you exactly what you need to do, so just follow their advice.Keep up to date with your jabs  Vaccination is the best defence against serious Covid-related illness. You can still get Covid and pass it onyou’re vaccinated, but it’s a vital step to keep yourself safe. Make sure you book your Covid and flu jabs when invited. This autumn, Covid booster jabs are being offered to more vulnerable groups such as people over , over-s with certain health conditions and frontline health and social care workers, including those who work in care homes.“As we approach winter, everyone should keep following the simple steps to protect themselves and others. “Avoid mixing with othersyou feel unwell, get a PCR test straight awayyou have any Covid symptoms andyou’re meeting people indoors, make sure you let fresh air in. “Remember, the best way to protect yourself and others against Covid- is to get the vaccine, so please do come forwardyouare eligible.”"},{"url":null,"title":"angela rayner apologises unreservedly tory","story":"Exclusive: Angela Rayner apologises unreservedly for Tory scum commentsLabour Deputy Leader Angela Rayner said she had thought hard about threats and abuse in political le as she issued an apology for her comments at the Labour Party conferenceLabours deputy leader Angela Rayner Image: PAByLizzy BuchanDeputy Online Political EditorDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct  Angela Rayner has apologised for her comments about Tory scum in a late-night event at the Labour Party conference. Labouraposs Deputy Leader said she had reflected on her language during a recent period of bereavement leave after losing a close loved one.Ms Rayner said she unreservedly apologised for her remarks and she would be more careful about the language she uses in future. In the wake of the murder of Tory MP Sir David Amess, which police are treating as a terrorist incident, Ms Rayner said she had thought hard about the threats and abuse that feature in political le. In a statement shared with the Mirror, she said: I was angry about where our country is headed and policies that have made le harder for so many people I represent. But I would like to unreservedly apologise for the language I used, and I would not use it again. I will continue to speak my mind, stand up for Labour values and hold the government to account. But in the future I will be more careful about how I do that and in the language that I choose. Angela Rayneraposs full statement is at the bottom of this article  All of us in positions of leadership have a responsibility for our language and rhetoric, whether towards political opponents or anyone  in society, especially those already most vulnerable. As Deputy Leader of the Labour Party I take this responsibility with the utmost seriousness and I am sure that politicians from all parties, the media and others with a prominent role in our public le will also reflect on this shared responsibility. The row centred on comments Ms Rayner made to Labour members from the North West of England at last monthaposs conference in Brighton.In an informal speech, she joked about the quality of food at conference and slapped down a heckler who apparently urged her to challenge Keir Starmer, saying: Youaposve had all the wine that I havenapost had mate!She told members weaposre at a cross roads like in , saying: We face a global threat again. Many of our comrades havenapost made it. Everyone in this room will know somebody whoaposs been seriously ill or died from Covid. Weaposve been through so much and deserve so much better than what weaposve got. She added: I’m sick of shouting from the sidelines and I bet youse lot are as well. We cannot get any worse than a bunch of scum, homophobic, racist, misogynistic, absolute vile [inaudible] Banana Republic, vile, nasty, Etonian [inaudible] piece of scum.” Ms Rayner originally stood by her remarks despite furious demands from Tory MPs for an apology. Keir Starmer distanced himself from the remarks, saying he would not have used them.  Askedshe was talking about Tories in general, Ms Rayner said last month: No, let me be clear, I am talking about members of the Cabinet. She told Sky News last month: I am not saying that anyone who voted for the Conservatives are racist, scummy and homophobic… I’m saying the Prime Minister has said those things and acted in that way. If the Prime Minister wants to apologise and remove himself from those comments he’s made that are homophobic, racist and misogynistic then I will apologise for calling him scummy. Boris Johnson has faced criticism over his past comments, including when he dubbed gay men tank-topped bum boys and described black people as piccaninnies with watermelon smiles. In a  Spectator column, Mr Johnson described children of single mothers as ill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate”. In her statement today, Ms Rayner also spoke out over the terrying threats she has received in the wake of the row over her comments.They have had a devastating impact on me, my children and others close to me, she said.It shakes you when you get these threats. You worry about the safety of your home, your office and everything in your le. And it takes its toll on the people who work for me too. She said her staff should not be required to deal with death threats on a day-to-day basis. Two men have been arrested since yesterday in South Yorkshire and Halax as part of a police investigation into “threatening and abusive phone calls, emails and letters” to Ms Rayner. It is understood further enquiries are still ongoing across multiple police forces. A third man, Benjamin Ilfe, , of Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, today pleaded guilty to sending a threatening email to Ms Rayner, and also pleaded guilty to possessing a quantity of cannabis on Wednesday when he was arrested. The former delivery driver warned Ms Rayner to watch your back and your kids and said I already found your personal home address in the threatening email on October , Huntingdon Magistratesapos Court heard. Ilfe was sentenced to  weeks in prison suspended for  months. A probation officer told the court Ilfe had felt Ms Rayner was partially responsible for the attack on Sir David following her use of language. He was later apologetic and remorseful for sending the threatening e-mail, the court heard.  Angela Rayneraposs statement in full I have been off work over the last couple of weeks after losing a close loved one. Grief is the burden we bear for love and losing someone close is something that we all experience at some point in our lives, but that knowledge doesn’t make it any easier when it happens to you. So I can’t imagine what the family of Sir David Amess are going through, but I know they will be hurting. I send my heartfelt condolences to them. Sir David was a fine parliamentarian, a proud advocate for his constituents and above all such a kind, generous and warm-hearted man. He will be missed on all sides of the House. As a society we need to offer better support to people who are going through bereavement, loss and other traumatic or dficult experiences in their personal lives. I hope that the fact that I took time to deal with a bereavement will encourage other people to do the same when they are going through grief or trauma. While I have been away from the cut and thrust of Parliament I have reflected on our political debate and the threats and abuse that now seem to feature all too often. I have also reflected on what I said at an event at Labour Party conference. I was angry about where our country is headed and policies that have made le harder for so many people I represent. But I would like to unreservedly apologise for the language I used, and I would not use it again. I will continue to speak my mind, stand up for Labour values and hold the government to account. But in the future I will be more careful about how I do that and in the language that I choose. All of us in positions of leadership have a responsibility for our language and rhetoric, whether towards political opponents or anyone  in society, especially those already most vulnerable. As Deputy Leader of the Labour Party I take this responsibility with the utmost seriousness and I am sure that politicians from all parties, the media and others with a prominent role in our public le will also reflect on this shared responsibility. I want to address the threats I have received recently. In the past I have been reluctant to speak out about the abuse that I receive because I fear that doing so will only make the situation worse. However, in recent weeks the threats that I have received against my le and the lives of close family have been so terrying and explicit that I could not stay silent and simply continue to take it as ‘part of the job’. They have had a devastating impact on me, my children and others close to me. It shakes you when you get these threats. You worry about the safety of your home, your office and everything in your le. And it takes its toll on the people who work for me too. My staff come to work and do their jobs with dedication and professionalism. They bear the brunt of much of this abuse and then get on with their working day. Dealing with death threats and liaising with the police about their safety should not be a standard part of the day-to-day working le of a Member of Parliament or their staff. So I want to thank the police officers from Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire and Cambridgeshire Police who have arrested a number of people in recent days and demonstrated the utmost professionalism, courtesy and kindness both in carrying out their investigations and in supporting me, my family and my staff during what has been a very dficult time. I and my team will continue work with them to ensure that the perpetrators of these crimes are brought to justice After attending a funeral on Monday I will be back to work, rolling my sleeves up and standing up for my brilliant constituents in Ashton-under-Lyne, Droylsden and Failsworth – along with everyone who needs a Labour government.

Tens of thousands of negotiators and officials will try to wrestle more money and pledges out of rich nations at COP. The UN summit is aiming to “keep . alive” - limit global temperature rises to less than . degrees Celsius. Boris Johnson and US President Joe Biden will attend the glittering event, though the Queen has pulled out due to health issues.The -day summit is the th COP, which means “conference of the parties” to the UN Framework on climate change. It is being held at the Scottish Event Campus , which includes a ,-seat auditorium, ,-capacity arena and five exhibition and meeting spaces.  This year the UK has the Presidency of COP. It’s our job to bring together  nations in a historic set of pacts - with the gavel coming down on Friday  November. What will you do to save the planet  Join the debate in the comments below  Butsix friends can barely agree on a pub, imagine getting  countries to agree on the future of the world. Boris Johnson admitted this week he is “very worried” it “might go wrong” and end without the right agreement. “It’s touch and go,” the Prime Minister said - hosing down expectations after he was criticised for setting them too high. And today Boris Johnson is holding last-minute talks with G leaders in Rome, calling for concrete steps on coal, cars, cash and trees so we can keep . alive and stay on track for net zero. He will send a warning shot, with his spokesman saying too many countries are still doing too little and the success of COP hangs in the balance. We cannot create a better future while running down the clock on climate., his spokesman warned. Much of the focus will be on global diplomacy and late-night talks in sweaty conference rooms, thrashing out agreement.It’s also likely to be speckled with a string of UK announcements, after the PM’s Net Zero Strategy was criticised for offering only a handful of £, heat pump grants and giving no final cost of getting to net zero emissions by . So after all the headlines, how will COP actually work  What do we need to get out of it  And how will it affect your le  Here’s everything you need to know.What the world is trying to achieveUnlike the Paris COP of , there won’t be one flashy new agreement signed by the world leaders in Glasgow. Instead, there will be a series of smaller agreements patched together in a bid to keep what’s already promised on track. These include:‘Keeping . alive’The Paris Agreement in pledged a goal to limit global warming to C, preferably .C, compared to pre-industrial levels.But to keep within .C by the year , the UN says the world will need to HALVE annual greenhouse gas emissions in the next eight years.And a damning UN report has warned current pledges will tip us towards a global temperature rise of .C by the end of the century. That would swallow up whole cities and island nations as seas rise due to “catastrophic changes in the earth’s climate”, the UN warned. It’s understood the UK doesn’t expect that projection to come down to .C due to COP, but wants a “plausible” chance of closing the gap by . Pushing for countries’ new emissions plansThe Paris Agreement made a pledge of .C, but didn’t at that point have anywhere near enough solid plans to achieve it. So the agreement contains a system to “ratchet” up nations’ pledges to cut their carbon emissions every five years - starting in Glasgow. Muchof the ratcheting is done through Nationally Determined Contributions , which were due to be submitted before COP. But these may come down to stressful, last-minute talks with nations trading off what they think they can stomach politically and economically. Vast nations like China and India still haven’t submitted their NDCs and could wait until the climax of the summit.Closing the gigaton gapTo ‘keep . alive’, the world needs to cut global emissions by  gigatons of CO equivalent by  - over and above unconditional NDCs. UK officials think they might get one gigaton of commitment from China and . from India. Wider policy decisions like cutting coal use are crucial. One source admitted “we’re never going to get” to the target by mid-November” - but  gigatons would be a good outcome from COP. Getting billion a yearAt COP in Copenhagen in , the parties agreed to “mobilise” billion a year for poorer nations by  to deal with climate change. But the pledge has been missed and a report has suggested the target will not be met until , three years late. That is despite US President Joe Biden announcing he would double America’s commitment to .bn, bringing the running total closer to bn. The bn commitment from public and private finance helps nations that have caused the least climate change but are most vulnerable to it.How does the summit actually work The summit is being held from Monday  November to Friday  November - bookended by world leaders glad-handing at either end. It is not being held online despite soaring Covid cases because smaller nations fear they would lose their voice - or ability to press home a deal - on a shaky Zoom connection. Tens of thousands of attendees will gather inside a ‘blue zone’ at the SEC, taking daily lateral flow tests to try to prevent a super-spreader event. Boris Johnson will meet allies on November - and there was due to be a reception hosted by the Queen, though she will no longer come. The rest of the week will be taken up with rattling through the “backlog” of less controversial plans from the last two years.  In week two the focus will sht onto the more dficult political issues. A source said: “It will run late into the night - especially in the second week. “It’s going to go long, it’s going to be messy.” COP President Alok Sharma - a UK minister - will spend % of his time darting round negotiating rooms trying to keep ious delegations happy. That will then lead up to a moment of agreement on the final Friday when a series of deals are sealed - more on this below. At the same time as all this there are themes for each day - energy, youth, nature, gender, transport, cities for example - as well as a dazzling array of side events, lobbying organisations and protests outside the venue.What are the big pinch points The obvious problem is persuading the world’s nations to come up with something ambitious enough, as they grapple with politics back home and the ructions of Covid- on their economies. This is shown in a leak to Greenpeace, which claimed countries were lobbying for changes to a UN report on how the world should tackle climate change. Documents named countries including Australia and Saudi Arabia as those trying to get the report to weaken a conclusion that fossil fuels should be phased out. Brazil and Argentina also reportedly made comments pressing report authors to delete messages about the climate benefits of undertaking a plant-based diet, despite a study in  finding that moving to a meat-free diet could cut food land use, and reduce emissions by %. And the Australian government asked to be deleted from a list of the worldaposs major producers and consumers of coal, despite being the fth largest coal producer, Greenpeace said.  Closely linked is the attempt to get more action from “non-state actors” - better known as global corporations,  of which are blamed for % of the world’s emissions in a  report. Those companies will need action in their own right - not just to be compelled by governments - to get the world on the right side of .. Deforestation is a tricky issue, with a few countries - such as Brazil, led by tree-chopping Jair Bolsonaro - responsible for much of it. Boris Johnson made a personal plea on the issue to Russia’s Vladimir Putin this week. A final pinch point is persuading the most vulnerable nations - from Bangladesh to island states like Barbados, Fiji, Costa Rica, Marshall Islands - to back plans. A UK source suggested they are “swing voters” and “whoever wins them wins COP”. “Some of these guys are facing the existential loss of their nation above . degrees”, they added.How will the deal get sealed Friday  November is the big day to seal the deal - or is it The last COP in Madrid ran  HOURS late - and sources have not ruled out a similarly nightmarish late finish in Glasgow.On the Friday some world leaders are due to , while other leaders - such as those of island states - are likely to have stayed in the Scottish city throughout. Together they will “gavel” a set of documents, some long and technical, all topped by a document called  CP.. The UK wants this document to allude to progress on NDCs and policies and address the  emissions gap.From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times.

Why does it matter to you With all the high politics inside a top-security ‘blue zone’ it can be hard to see how this affects your le. Even some of the practical things, like mangrove planting in Barbados, can seem terribly far away. But the big numbers agreed at COP will drip down slowly into national policies that will affect your le - and your wallet. The UK is already talking about banning all new gas boilers by  and the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by .Global trade also affects the things you can buy in the supermarket - for example,the use of palm oil reduces across the planet.How does the G fit in Just before COP, world leaders are gathering in Rome today for the G summit of  of the world’s richest nations. Boris Johnson is be among them, having flown out last night on a charter plane with a full delegation of press and aides. But with the G focusing on “people, planet, prosperity”, there’ll be a lot of overlap. It could well end up as a warm-up act to the COP summit that follows. “We see all those issues as being linked, the PMaposs spokesman said. “This is an important moment to use this gathering of world leaders as we come into the final days before COP to look them in the eye and make sure we are getting the level of ambition that’s required to keep . alive.” If things go well, it could give Boris Johnson a “bounce” going into COP - but equally,the G falls flat it could make things tougher when COP kicks off. One bad sign is that the nations of Russia, China, Japan and Mexico are not expected to turn up in Rome - with Putin and Xi not expected at COP either. While all nations are likely to send negotiating teams, it sometimes takes the gravitas of a national leader to get a deal over the line - especially with a country like Russia and China which have a fraught relationship with the UK. Which leaders WILL attend COP While neither Russia’s Putin nor China’s Xi are expected, the leaders of the US, India, the UK, Australia, France, Canada, Turkey, Israel, Colombia and Sweden are all due to turn up in Glasgow. But Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro, who leads a country containing much of the Amazon rainforest, is not expected to go.

HRT triumph Women in England saving up to £ a year in prescription charges for HRT treatment is another great victory courtesy of battling Labour MP Carolyn Harris. Forcing the Tory Government to back down, bringing costs in England closer to Wales and Scotland, came a few years after the Swansea East MP shamed the Conservatives into abolishing official fees for children’s funerals. England’s women will only have to pay once for a -month supply, though Health Minister Maria Caulfield churlishly resisted Harris’ attempt to axe HRT charges completely. But this triumph doesn’t just save women money. It recognises they shouldn’t be paying for vital NHS treatment. We look forward to prescriptions for everybody being free in Tory England, as they are in Labour Wales and SNP Scotland.

There was no plan to tackle the growing cost of living crisis. No plan to reduce the tax burden on working people and small businesses. No plan to grow our economy in the years ahead or to create the high-wage high skilled jobs of the future. No plan to deal with the huge challenge of climate change for the years ahead. A Labour budget would have been very dferent, because Labour wants a brighter and better future for our country. We’d have invested in dealing with the challenge of climate change and fitting our country for the future - starting with proper insulation for millions of homes to reduce emissions and drive down soaring heating bills.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section We’d have changed the way the government does business to ensure we buy, make, and sell more in Britain, supporting manufacturers and our amazing small businesses. Growing our economy is the best route to better services and a better future for everyone. It means more jobs and higher tax revenues to invest in our services. Instead, after a decade of weak growth, Wednesday’s budget saw taxation go up to the highest level for seventy years. Working people are paying an ever higher price for eleven years of Tory economic failure. We’d have invested in the future of our public services, especially for children, as we recover from the pandemic, with a properly funded education catch-up plan so every child has the chance to succeed. We only get one chance as a country to get these calls right, and the Tories are getting it wrong. We’d have cancelled the Prime Minister’s new yacht, and spent the money on policing hubs and more special constables.  And we’d have reformed our tax system, as Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves set out at conference. We’d make it fair, so those with the broadest shoulders make the bigger contribution. We’d bring it up to date, so high street family firms face a level playing field with tech giants like Amazon. We’d make it more efficient too, by removing unfair tax breaks, like the one that benefits private schools - and spend that money on giving every child a better start. What we needed was a Budget for our future, for growth, and for our public services. The Tories failed again to deliver what we need. Labour would be building a brighter and better future.

Instead, we got a Chancellor disconnected from the reality of a growing cost of living crisis. As energy bills soar, the Chancellor piled the biggest tax burden in peacetime on working people. As businesses on our high streets are held back by outdated business rates, the Chancellor gave bankers a tax cut. A decade of sluggish growth. Public services cut to the bone. Billions of pounds of taxpayer money wasted. But still, no plan to boost our economy. The Government will always blame others for its failures. But the reality is that working people are paying more for less for three simple reasons. Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  Economic mismanagement. An unfair tax system. And wasteful spending. Our country deserves better. But they’ll never get it under a Chancellor who gives with one hand, but takes so much more with the other. People are getting wise to this. Every month they feel the pinch. They are tired of the smoke and mirrors, of the bluster, of the  dawns, of the promises of jam tomorrow. Use our autumn Budget tax calculator to see how it will impact your money - The solution starts with growth. Labour would put working people first. The Government is caught in a bind of its own making. Low growth leads to less money for public services, unless taxes rise. Labour would use the power of government and business to create the next generation of quality jobs right here, in Britain. We’d tax fairly, spend wisely and after a decade of faltering growth, we’d get Britain’s economy firing on all cylinders. That is what a Labour budget would have done today.

Lib Dem MP Munira Wilson hit out at the admission after millions were left out of a rise in benefits in the Budget - despite fears inflation could hit % next year.The Chancellor announced a taper rate boost for .million benefit claimants who work - weeks after cutting UC by £ a week. But the IFS think tank warned millions of claimants who don’t or can’t work will not see an extra penny. They include .million Brits who are not required to work at all due to sickness, disability and caring responsibilities. The IFS said UC looks set to rise by around % next April - but that could be wiped out by % inflation at the same time. Ahead of the Budget, Ms Wilson asked “what research and preparation” the Department for Work and Pensions had done “on the impact ofrising energy prices,rising fuel bills,potential food shortages andthe removal of the £ uplt to universal credit on familiesapos ability to fund their childrensapos meals while at school”.  But DWP minister David Rutley replied: “We have not undertaken research of this kind.” He added the £ uplt was temporary and the government had invested in a plan for jobs, higher Healthy Start food vouchers, a £ million Household Support Fund and the Covid vaccine rollout. Ms Wilson said: “For the government to not commit any research on the impacts of their own damaging policies is complacent at best and heartless at worst. The Tories think they can impose dreadful policies and get away with it, they’re taking the good faith of people across the country for granted. The budget does nothing to help those households petried by spiralling energy prices, and the Chancellor’s announcement on Universal Credit is giving just a third of what he snatched away. Millions of families will not be helped at all but this government.

It comes after Catherine Colonna, France’s ambassador to the UK, was summoned to the Foreign Office in London to explain ‘disappointing and disproportionate’ threats of retaliation by Paris over what it claims is a lack of licences for French boats to fish in UK waters.The skipper of the Cornelis, who had not been publicly identied, is specically accused of having fished , kg of scallops in the French exclusive economic zone without holding a valid licence.Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter  He now faces a fine of €,as well as administrative sanctions, said le Havre deputy prosecutor Cyrille Fournier. Mr Fournier said: The captain of the Cornelis Gert Jan was given a summons by maritime police to appear at the hearing of the Criminal Court of Le Havre on August , . The prosecutor added: After verication, the captain of the vessel did not have the authorisation required to fish in the French exclusive economic zone.This was despite claims by the owners of the Cornelis that the boat had been fishing legally when it was detained on Wednesday night.Andrew Brown, director of Scottish firm MacDuff Shellfish, said she was being used as a apospawnapos by angry French ministers. Mr Brown said before news of the court action: MacDuffaposs fishing activity is entirely legal. We are looking to the UK government to defend the rights of the UK fishing fleet and ensure that the fishing rights provided under the Brexit fishing agreement are fully respected by the EU.On Friday morning, the Cornelis was still moored in Le Havre - still banned from leaving the port. The French ambassador has been summoned the Foreign Office in London later today to explain why the boat was detained. The crew of the Cornelis Gert Jan are still onboard as the legal battle rumbles on. It is moored up in a quiet area of the harbour with a sign saying “no unauthorised entry” on the gangplank. Boat owner Andrew Brown insisted they had all the right paperwork and the vessel should be allowed to leave as soon as possible. The boat had headed out from Shoreham, Sussex, early on Tuesday morning, and had expected to spend five days catching scallops in the English Channel.  Her seizure is the latest move by France in an ongoing row with the UK over who has rights to fishing grounds in the Channel now Britain has left the EU. The Cornelis’s haul has been thrown back overboard by the French, while her skipper spoke to an examining magistrate with the help of a French lawyer. Gendarmes on board the Athos – the police boat named after one of the Three Musketeers which detained the Cornelis– also fined a second, unidentied British boat on Wednesday. Her skipper was dealt with for initially refusing police permission to board, but then left toto the UK. Clement Beaune, Franceaposs Europe minister, has said we need to speak the language of force to Britain because it is the only thing this government understands. He was immediately accused of sabre rattling by British critics, as was Annick Girardin, the Maritime Minister in Paris, who said: It’s not war, but it is a fight. Referencing Brexit, Ms Girardin said: We are going to ask the European Commission to tell the United Kingdom that it is not respecting its agreement and therefore that retaliatory measures can be put in place. Before Brexit, French fishermen had free rights to fish in UK waters under EU law and only had to apply to their own government for a licence. But earlier this year the new Brexit Agreement came into force, meaning French fishermen now need to apply to the UK for a licence. All vessels that fished in UK waters aposfor at least four years between  and apos should be granted the same level of access until at least , when it will be up to the UK and France to negotiate new deals. The UK is asking French boats to provide tracking and fishing quota data for those years to qualy for a permit. The French have protested, saying smaller vessels under m do not collect this data and are being unfairly punished. The Brexit Agreement makes no mention of such data, they argue. British environment minister George Eustice told Parliament the seizure of the boat is being aposurgentlyapos looked into, but ruled out any apostit for tatapos retaliation. UK vessels with their licence to fish in EU waters should be allowed to do so uninterrupted, he said.

Clinical guidance from the UK Heath Security Agencyhas been updated to allow booster jabs to be given earlier to those at highest risk, but only where it makes operational sense. The recommendation will, for example, allow care home residents who may have received their second doses at dferent times to be vaccinated in the same session, as long as it has been five months since their second dose.It may also help with other vulnerable groups, such as housebound patients, so that they can have their flu and Covid- boosters at the same time, the UKHSA said.People who are eligible for a booster and are about to receive immunosuppressive treatment, which would hinder their immune system, will be able to get their booster from a minimum of four months after their second dose, under the updated guidance.  The UKHSA said the new flexibility will protect the most vulnerable more quickly.Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: This updated guidance will ensure healthcare professionals have the necessary flexibility in the booster programme, allowing more vulnerable people to be vaccinated where it makes operational sense to do so - including our loved ones in care homes.The update comes as the UK recorded more than seven million booster jabs, after a record breaking week of more than two million being administered in the last seven days alone.  Vaccines Minister Maggie Throup said: Covid- booster vaccinations are extremely important in keeping people and their loved ones safe this winter, and this updated guidance will ensure the programme can adapt to best protect certain groups. I encourage everyone eligible for their jab to book theirs as soon as possible and secure this protection. Meanwhile, people who do not qualy for having their booster sooner will continue to be invited for the jab when it is their turn - six months after their second dose. The independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationhas advised that those most at risk to the virus receive their booster six months after their second dose, based on the available evidence.  The Government accepted this advice earlier this year. This advice has not changed and the JCVI keeps its advice under continuous review, using the latest data available. The latest evidence from the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesshows that protection against symptomatic disease falls as low as % depending the the vaccine given. The booster programme is designed to top up this waning immunity. There are more than  extra vaccination sites now compared to April this year, with , vaccination centres in operation in April  against , vaccination centres in operation now. Vaccines are also available for those aged - to offer the best possible protection this winter in schools, as well the option to be jabbed in more than  vaccine centres.

Thomas Hughes, , and Emma Tustin, , are accused of murdering Arthur Labinjo-Hughes at their home in Solihull, West Midlands.The schoolboy, six, suffered fatal brain damage from an alleged bang to the head and shaking injury on June , , reports Birmingham Live. Coventry Crown Court was told Hughes gave a series of police interviews in the aftermath of Arthuraposs death, and in one told cops: I effectively killed my son. It was not intentional.  Jurors have been hearing horric details of Arthuraposs le, and were told he lived through a campaign of cruelty before his death that matched the “medical definition of child torture”. On Friday, they were told how Arthur told Hughes he was the worldaposs worst dad and recalled the little boy saying he only loved his grandparents and his uncle Blake. Hughes told the court: He said I was the worldaposs worst dad. Said he hated me. Itaposs all words. But words play on people sometimes. He has never been as nasty to me as what he was towards Emma. At times I walked through the door and found Emma in the kitchen crying. Yes she did get snappy. She hated herself for biting back. A post-mortem revealed  bruises on Arthuraposs body, and doctors said he had so much salt in his system he was unable to put up a fight before his death.  Birmingham Crown Court was told he had over six spoons worth of salt in his body - the highest level a medic had ever seen. The little boy was also allegedly segregated and isolated for up to  hours a day - and was deprived of food, a bed and clothes. Hughes admitted in court he could account for most of the bruises on Arthuraposs body, Birmingham Live reports. He said he knew where all of the pressure points were and would pinch Arthuraposs neck for around  seconds with a force of six or seven out of . Hughes said: When he was lying on his back I didnapost want to keep picking him up. I put my foot on his stomach almost to take the wind out of him. It paints me in a dferent light altogether. Three or four out of . Just so I didnapost have to keep picking him up. It paints me as a monster Iaposm aware. Iaposm  years old, nearly , for nearly all of those years Iaposve never been in trouble with the police.  Nobody would have a bad word to say. But the last few weeks they would have lots of bad things to say. That last few months I effectively turned into a monster. Thataposs how Iaposm going to be seen now. Iaposm not going to be the dad whose boy worshipped the ground he walked on. Hughes added: I never intended to hurt him. Itaposs a case of discipline gone too far. Gone horribly wrong.The court was told this week that Arthuraposs grandmother called social services weeks before he died and said she would send them pictures of the bruises but they didnapost want to see them.Tustin and Hughes are accused of multiple counts of child cruelty, which include claims they fed him salt and forced Arthur to endure systematic, cruel behaviour of physical and psychological abuse in the weeks before he died. Prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC said: Both defendants participated in a campaign of cruelty intended to cause Arthur signicant harm and suffering. Violence and intimidation, both physical and verbal, were routine.  “Arthur’s visible injuries, his miserable physical condition and obvious despair provided each defendant with a daily reminder of the s to which the other would go to cause him harm.” Arthuraposs death came only three months after his father had moved into Tustinaposs home, whereas before he lived with Hughes and his extended family, in an annexe in the garden of Hughesapos parents. Arthur had been placed into his dadaposs care after his mother was jailed for  years for stabbing her boyfriend to death. Hughes, , of Stroud Road, Shirley, and Emma Tustin, , of Cranmore Road, Shirley, have both pleaded not guilty to murder. Tustin admitted one count of child cruelty, but has denied further charges of the same offence. Hughes also denies child cruelty offences. The trial - held at Coventry Crown Court - continues.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON PoliceCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Medics urged the -year-old to take it easy for at least a fortnight, meaning she will not be at the Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall on November . But a senior royal source said the armistice commemoration, which takes place a day later, is “one of the few dates that is completely and utterly cemented in the Queen’s annual diary”. The insider added: “The doctors who are advising Her Majesty to rest would have to have a very strong case to stop her going. “It remains her firm intention to be present for the National Service of Remembrance on ­Remembrance Sunday. “Her Majesty regrets she will be unable to attend the Festival of Remembrance on Saturday, November .” Have your say on this story in the comment section  The Queen is ­understood to be “incredibly saddened” at missing that event. But the source added: “Doctors are satisfied this is the best course of action right now.The Queen’s ­condition is unknown although sources insisted she “is in good spirits” and taking it easy at Windsor Castle. Buckingham Palace said last night: “Following on from their recent advice that the Queen should rest for a few days, Her Majesty’s doctors have advised that she should continue to rest for at least the next two weeks.  Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.Click here to sign up.The doctors have advised that Her Majesty can continue to undertake light, desk-based duties during this time, including some virtual audiences, but not to ­undertake any official visits.” The Queen has only missed six Remembrance Sundays at the ­Cenotaph during her -year reign. She was on royal tours around the world for four of those and two absences were owing to being pregnant. The monarch was last present at the Festival of Remembrance in . A virtual event was held due to Covid curbs last year. She had already pulled out of addressing world leaders in person at the COP climate change summit in Glasgow on Monday, as she continues to recover from an overnight stay in hospital last Wednesday where she underwent ­“preliminary investigations”. The Mirror revealed yesterday the Queen has had to give up her beloved pursuit of riding until the spring after reportedly suffering “discomfort” several weeks ago while out on her horse during her summer break at Balmoral. Since being admitted to hospital she has also been unable to walk her dogs during the day, a pastime she takes on ­religiously to get out. Sources have remarked on the Queen’s “relentless schedule” of late, especially after ing from her summer break in Scotland.

Steve Brown, manager of a security company based at an industrial estate in Crewe, Cheshire, said he watched on in horror as the driver attempted to move his motor.In footage of the incident the man can be seen tying a rope to his car and then dragging it along a road, Cheshire Live reported. Steve alleges truck drivers have been aposdumpingapos trailers in and around the industrial estate where he works and coming back to collect them another day. The business owner claims his vehicle was parked legally in front of a trailer when the trucker took it upon himself to move it.  Steve witnessed everything unfold and, after recording a video of the incident, confronted the driver. I was absolutely ballistic, I just thought aposI donapost believe thisapos I was screaming at him, Steve said. I park my car opposite Peugeot on Gateway. My car was parked in front his trailer and he decided he was going to put a massive rope and hook and drag my car away from his trailer which had been there for two weeks. Itaposs what they do. Another business owner has reported them to the council and theyaposve done nothing.  Steve said that when he confronted the driver, he told Steve that he used to be a recovery driver and there would be no damage to his car. I said aposwhat do you mean thereaposs no damage apos Steve continued. He pulled up in a heavy goods truck and put a massive rope and hook around my car and dragged it in gear. He dragged it about  feet. Itaposs bent my steering arm and messed up my gear stick. Steve also said that the whole incident was seen by a police officer who was conducting a traffic stop nearby.  He did that in front of a traffic cop, Iaposm surprised they did nothing, Steve added. The police had pulled a car over at the back of the trailer. While they were dealing with the driver they pulled over, that idiot in a truck comes along and drags the car out in front of the police. Steve claims repairs to his Fiat panda will now cost around £.

It was originally refused planning permission by Midlothian planners in Edinburgh who felt it would cause vehicle to overhang onto a pavement, Edinburgh Live reported. But it got the go-ahead after the resident was urged to parallel park. Councillor Peter Smaill told the council’s Local Review Body meeting: “A reasonably dexterous driver would be able to park parallel to avoid an overhanging bonnet.” The space was built by homeowner George Burnett at the end of his front garden after he removed his boundary fence and a shed.  Councillor Smail added: “In the particular circumstances of this quite quiet street with quite wide pavements it would be disproportionate to stop the appeal from succeeding. “We could perhaps ask for a personal undertaking, I realise these things are dficult to enforce, that there will be no overhanging onto the pavement however the site is approached. “It probably means a proper dropped kerb, quite a long one, to allow parking at  degrees and also parking parallel. The short parking space was given the nod partly due to its impressive .metre width. Councillor Jim Muirhead pointed out the irony of cars being parked on pavements across the county while the driveway freed up a parking space. He said: “We are having a debate here about a vehicle sticking six inches out onto a pavement yetyou look all over Midlothian there are vehicles parked on pavements and pavements being blocked. “Just me going to my front door and further down the road you cannot get a buggy past because people park on pavements.”  The review body granted planning permission for the drive with a condition that a dropped kerb running theof the owner’s house would be introduced. Parking is an issue that deeply concerns members of the British public. At the end of September The Mirror reported how an angry note was pinned to a car parked so badly a supermarket delivery driver couldnapost get down the street. The offending vehicle was parked in Burton, and reportedly left an Asda driver having to park up and carry the delivery all the way to their customeraposs door. The note, left by someone living on the street, reads: Please think before leaving your car parked like this down this street. If an emergency vehicle needed to get through, it couldnapost.

Bookmaker Wiliam Hill today opened its book on the UK being treated to a white Christmas, with prices being assigned. Northerly duo Edinburgh and Newcastle favourites for festive flurries, while Britain’s highest airport, Leeds Bradford, is - to experience snowfall on the big day.Wintery weather may have us all dreaming of having our Christmasesadorned with snow flurries , but itaposs been years since the UK enjoyed a proper white holiday.Some enjoyed a sprinkle of snow last year, but for the majority of the UK, it was a typically grey affair. The last substantial snowfall recorded on Christmas Day was in , and the last widespread white Christmas was in . In the UK, snow or sleet falls an average of . days in December, with the MET Office able to accurately forecast whether snow is likely on any given Christmas Day up to five days beforehand.  Edinburgh and Newcastle Airports are current favourites for this year, both - to experience wintry conditions on December . And despite its disruptive nature, Christmas is the one time of the year when the bothersome weather appears to get a free pass. Leeds Bradford Airport is more than ft above sea level and holds the record for being the highest airport in the UK, making it surprising to see it appear alongside the likes of Birmingham, London City Airport and Dublin on -. Manchester is   while Bristol, Liverpool and Cardf Airports are -.  The popular pastime of betting on a white Christmas was in fact instituted by William Hill, and traditionally required a single snowflake to fall on the MET Office operations centre in London. Nowadays, and with that building long since sold - the national weather service now based in Devon, all that is needed to declare a white Christmas is the observation of a single snowflake falling in the  hours of December , at one of  major UK airports. The UK has not seen snow on the ground on Christmas Day since  when it was observed at a tenth of weather stations. Those  flurries came five years after widespread snow and the coldest December for a century in . The last widespread white Christmas - in  - saw snow on the ground at % of weather stations, the highest amount ever recorded. Snow or sleet fell at % of stations. Technically though,  was the last true white Christmas in the UK - with  percent of weather stations recording snow falling, but none recorded any on the ground.

Dylan Forster had no driving licence or insurance when he tried to outrun an unmarked police car before crashing and flipping his Ford Fusion into a building leaving a gaping hole. The -year-old was carrying cocaine, cannabis and wads of cash as he sped through the suburb of Burnage, south of Manchester city centre, before losing control.Passenger Deon Simpson, , later died from his injuries in hospital just weeks from his eighteenth birthday, reports the Manchester Evening News. Forster was locked up for six years by a judge at Manchester Crown Court on Friday. Members of the tragic teenaposs family burst into tears in the public gallery, with one branding the sentence an absolute joke. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Deonaposs devastated mum told the court her son died for something minor and questioned why Forster didnapost pull over. Prosecutor Gavin Howie said officers first came across the Ford being driven at speed along Kingsway in Burnage at .pm on November , . As they followed, Forster accelerated. The car was using a spare tyre and was therefore unsuitable for being driven anymore than mph - but reached  during the chase. The officers turned on their blue lights in an effort to stop the fleeing car but Forster continued driving, including navigating speed bumps at speed on Burnage Lane.  It became obvious that the defendant refused to stop for them, said Mr Howie. As the defendant approached a junction with Lane End Road, he lost control of the car and smashed into a boulder. The impact caused the car to flip onto its side and collide with the gable end of a building. Paramedics attended the scene and found Deon unresponsive. Both he and Forster were rushed to hospital, where Deon was pronounced dead shortly after .pm.  His cause of death was given as aposhead injuriesapos, though the court heard the teen suffered multiple injuries. In a statement, Deonaposs mum said he had excelled at sports, playing for Manchester City and Manchester Unitedaposs youth sides. She described her sonaposs death as senseless, adding: I donapost know why Dylan just did not stop. I donapost know why he thought he could outrun the police. I feel like Deon died for something really minor. Mr Howie said one explanation for Forsteraposs actions is he had drugs as well as hundreds of pounds in cash inside the car. Those drugs were for onward supply and the cash was present from previous sales, the prosecutor added. Forster discharged himself from hospital in February of last year and was arrested five months later. He pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving at a hearing in August. Mitigating, Richard Dawson, said Forster had suffered serious traumatic brain injuries in the crash and had no recollection of what happened. He said the chase had only lasted for a minute or so and was therefore a short-lived piece of bad driving from his client. He added: It seems likely that his lack of experience may have been a factor,not the factor causative of the collision. Forster, of Southbank Road, Manchester, sat with his head bowed throughout the hearing. Sentencing him, Judge Nicholas Dean QC said: I do not accept that Deon in any way, shape of form endorsed or approved of your driving. He also acknowledged that Deonaposs family thought the sentence was inadequate. Forster was also banned from driving for six years and will have to take an extended retest before getting behind the wheel again.

They begin to show themselves when the first leaves fall - usually from the start of September to mid-October.The Mirror reported earlier this month that female spiders are known to stay in one place throughout their lives and establish themselves in our homes, but male of the species are always wandering.During mating season, they search for females, which are often found residing in our homes.  Ecologist Dr Chris Terrell-Nield of Nottingham Trent University says house spiders can be up to cm long and can be as big as a hand. They descend from species that come from the Mediterranean or North Africa, which is why they invade our warm homes.Chris told the Mirror: They have biting fangs. These things have been breeding and started their le span in the spring.He added: This time of the year, August and September, the male spiders have the urge to mate and start wandering and looking for females. When they find them they mate and she lays eggs and the male usually dies.

Contestants have to show public speaking skills, talents, sportsmanship and intelligence. But for Liam Ulla and Rehema Muthamia, who were crowned Mr and Miss England this summer, there was an extra achievement on top of the tiara – they became the first winners of the competition who were both of black heritage. Rehema, , said: “To have myself and Liam as the faces of that will change perceptions hopefully and influence the younger generations.”Join the discussion in the comment section  Born in North West London, Rehema comes from a traditional Kenyan family. Having spent time in both countries, Rehema embraces both cultures. She is also a linguist – speaking four languages. Liam, , of Sandbanks, Dorset, is of mixed race heritage with a white mother and black Jamaican father. He said: “It’s nice to see that we’re starting to get the recognition we should be getting already. “Becoming a mixed race Mr England is nice.

She said surviving an abusive relationship motivated her to enter in order to raise awareness about domestic abuse. “I’m mostly working on my charity work with One Woman at a Time, Elle for Elle, Women’s Aid and teaching young girls and boys about healthy relationships and signs to look for in terms of domestic abuse. “I am a black woman with a genetics master’s degree and there aren’t very many of us. That I was able to achieve that has to be the proudest thing I’ve ever done.” Through his not-for-profit organisation Coacoara, keen kite surfer Liam, who cites his mother Sharon Green as his biggest inspiration, sells eco-friendly products and has organised beach and river clean-ups. Unfortunately Rehema’s win led to horric abuse on social media. “There was definitely some racism that I faced,” she said. “There are people in this country that aren’t happy that I’m a black woman representing England and it’s unfortunate that that’s the case.The UK began celebrating Black History Month, an idea first spawned in the United States and then also adopted by European countries including Ireland and the Netherlands, in October . Black History Month helps give context to modern le and the countryaposs history, while championing the experiences and celebrating the contributions of Black Britons here in the UK. The observation was first organised through the leadership of Ghanaian-born analyst Akyaaba Addai-Sebo. He served as a coordinator of special projects for the Greater London Council. Consequently, Akyaaba created a plan aiming to recognise the contributions of African, Asian and Caribbean people to the economic, cultural and political le in the UK. “Hopefully by me being here, I can change some viewpoints of those that don’t maybe understand or are ignorant towards it.” Speaking about racism in society, Liam says: “It’s crazy, with the [Euros] football, all the way up to the finals, everyone’s so supportive, they love the [England] players but as soon as they lose, the amount of racism is disgusting.” Comment MORE ON Black CommunitiesMiss EnglandRacism\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Fred discovered there was a large colony of over , honey bees that had made a home in the cladding of the wall. He said: A lot of people confuse honey bees with wasps because theyaposre smaller.  The homeowner thought she had wasps and called the council out to kill them. They said aposwe canapost theyaposre honey beesapos and gave her my number. She had noticed them for a few months and thought they were wasps and hoped they would die off. Normally I would insist on the scaffolding being erected but she was  the woman. It wasnapost very high and the lady was pretty desperate so I did them by standing on the garage roof. Fred said that once he located the swarm, he had to remove the cladding from the side of the house to access the bees.  He added: Because of the location I couldnapost access that one easily, theyaposd gone right around into the corner into the cavity - I vacuumed the bees out. The video shows Fred, having climbed on the garage roof to tackle the swam, as he starts sucking out the bees with a special vacuum cleaner. He then placed the comb in frames and took them back to live in his own hives.  Despite the grateful homeowneraposs surprise at Fred telling her that there were over , bees crawling about inside her walls, he said: Thataposs not a lot really, but a queen honey bee can lay , eggs a day so the colonies can increase dramatically. The thing is with bumble bees they die off at the end of the year, apart from the queens. Honey bees donapost hibernate and thataposs why they produce a vast amount of honey.  The thing is they can just go huge and in the end you can have honey dripping down walls. One of the worst ones we did, a woman in Warrington had a colony up in her chimney for over five years but she was perfectly happy because they were so high up. But during a really hot spell the combs melted and they collapsed down her chimney. She ended up with over , bees crashing down into her living room. Fred, who has been keeping bees for around  years, is often asked by the council to remove nests of bees and wasps.His Facebook page, Fredaposs Bees, shows the ious swarms heaposs called upon to tackle at a momentaposs notice.At  years of age, Fred said he shouldnapost be clambering around on roof tops, but he does a lot of dancing to Northern Soul records which helps keep him in shape.

Carol said: “The night will be a proper celebration.” Here, we reveal some of this year’s inspirational winners...Letime Achievement – Rosemary Cox, , WolverhamptonSuccessfully campaigned to set up the first Organ Donor Register in the UK, helping to save thousands of lives. After their -year-old son Peter died in  following a brain tumour, Rosemary and John Cox saw the need for a register for people who wish to donate their organs. Peter had asked before his death for his organs to be used to help others and his sacrice saved or transformed the lives of  people. Have your say on this story in the comment section But his parents found that although patients in need of a transplant were listed on a central NHS computer, there was no equivalent register for potential donors. Over the next five years, the couple from Wolverhampton and their daughter Christine launched their campaign, travelling the country fundraising, lobbying politicians and creating awareness for their cause. Their efforts culminated at the  Conservative Party Conference when Christine made an impassioned plea from the  for a register of donorsapos wishes. Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley pledged there and then to set up an NHS Organ Donor Register, which launched on th October . Today the number of people who have registered their organ donation decision on the NHS Organ Donor Register has reached over  million or % of the UK population. Meanwhile, since the register was established on the th October , over , people have donated their organs after their death and over , deceased donor transplants have taken place. Rosemary is now . Her husband John passed away in , but their son’s legacy lives on and she continues to campaign to promote the benefits of organ transplantation. When the NHS marked the register’s th anniversary in , it was revealed it had saved or transformed , lives. And over the last  months, NHS Blood and Transplant facilitated nearly , transplants.Special Recognition – Rob Allen, , Northampton Founded Sands United, an inspirational network of football teams where men who have lost babies and young children can come together to grieve. Rob and his we Charlotte’s third child Niamh was stillborn, days before her due date in . They were helped through their loss by the stillbirth charity Sands, but at one meeting, Rob counted  women and three men. Realising that grieving dads were finding it dficult to reach out for help, he organised a charity football match to raise funds for Sands, but also giving men an opportunity to come together and talk about their loss. The one-off game, featuring bereaved fathers, grandfathers, uncles and brothers, raised £,, but the emotional benefit for the players was even more signicant.  And so, Sands United was born, and entered a local league in Northampton. But Rob’s impact has spread far wider. Inspired by his example, there are now more than  Sands United teams across Britain. Each team’s kit is embroidered with the names of the babies they have lost, and hundreds of men, and their families, have been empowered to open up about their loss, and support each other through sport.This Morning Emergency Services Award – Stephen Warton, , CumbriaPart-time firefighter risked his le to e to the rescue of a teenager who had been submerged in icy waters for more than  minutes.Kacper Krauze, , had been attempting to swim across the River Eden in Appleby-in-Westmorland in February . The weather was unseasonably warm, but the icy water sent his body into shock, and he sank to the bottom of the river. Appleby fire and rescue officers, who are retained with full-time jobs including butcher and mechanic, were the first emergency responders on the scene. Crew manager Stephen, a painter and decorator, and firefighter John Bell went into the river, supported by colleagues David Anderton, Michael Dowding, Bradley Hall, James Wood and Neil Aitken from the river bank. After a short search they located Kacper under two to three metres of water. Unable to e down and reach him due to his safety gear, Stephen went against protocol and took off his flotation equipment and helmet so he could e fully and bring the boy to the surface. Kacper had been underwater for about  minutes, and when Stephen brought him to the bank, he was in cardiac arrest and severely hypothermic. Paramedics resuscitated him and he was flown by air ambulance to hospital, where he was placed in an induced coma. He spent several weeks in intensive care but has since made a steady recovery. Mum Wioletta said: “It’s a miracle he survived.

He devised his own fundraising challenge on behalf of his pal, running km every day in the  days leading up to Christmas.

The pair had hoped to remain part of the Queenaposs procession at the beginning of the service. Instead, they were shown to their seats like all the other guests, which reportedly led them to be upset and emotional. However, the Daily Mail reports that, in a bid to smooth things over, Wills and Kate made a last minute change to the running order. The couple offered to skip the procession and join the Sussexes in their seats so they could all wait together for the service to start.  The decision was made so last minute that the order of services was already being printed - meaning they ended up being inaccurate. Sadly, itaposs reported their gesture didnapost have the desired effect and the meeting of the two couples appeared somewhat awkward. The Sussexes arrived first and sat in the second row. The Cambridges were shortly behind them, but Meghan and Harry didnapost stand to greet them. During the  ceremony Meghan and Kate greeted each other with a kiss on each cheek, but they seemed more reserved at this event. While it wouldnapost have been possible for them to kiss, the two couples exchanged only one or two words as they waited for the Queen and Prince Charles to arrive.  Meghan, who was already sitting down, could be seen saying hello and giving an awkward wave. Harry also said hello, but that was as far as their conversation went, with Harry turning to talk to his we. Then Sophie Wessex, who was sat behind Kate, leaned forward to chat to the Duchess while Harry and Meghan spoke to Prince Edward. There had been rumours of a rt between the two couples in the months leading up to Meghan and Harry announcing their intention to step down. These were fuelled when the couple scrapped their plans to live at Kensington Palace, just a few doors down from the Cambridges, and moved to Windsor instead. William and his dad Prince Charles were reportedly incandescent with rage when they were sent their announcement just  minutes before it was shared with the world.

Dane Rowe, , aposspiralled into despairapos when he was unfairly sacked then attempted to commit suicide a day after his appeal was rejected. The health and safety coordinator had been off work for three months with severe depression and anxiety after his mental health dramatically plummeted. Mr Rowe, who has suffered mental health issues for  years, told bosses of his aposregular suicide contemplationapos and complied with their requests for regular sick notes while he was off. But, after he missed aposinformal wellness meetingsapos because he was so mentally unwell he couldnapost leave the house, he was unfairly sacked.  Mr Rowe, who worked for food producers David Wood Baking, has now been awarded £, compensation after suing them for disability discrimination and unfair dismissal. He had worked for the firm - which says it supplies aposluxury meals to the UKaposs top grocery retailersapos - in Newport, Wales, for two years when his mental health worsened in March  as the pandemic hit. Mr Rowe missed a dayaposs work and aposfabricated a bizarre explanationapos which apossnowballedapos and ended with him facing a disciplinary hearing before he finally admitted he lied and was given a final written warning. He was then off across April, May and June in  with severe depression and said he would be unable to attend a aposwellnessapos meeting at work. In messages across those months, he told managers: Iaposm really struggling mentally at the moment and spent most days isolated and alone in my flat as have been experiencing massive panic attacks when I try to go out. To be honest, Iaposm not well and Iaposm not coping. Iaposm struggling to find a reason to get out of bed each day and suicide is a regular contemplation. Iaposm in regular contact with my GP but all they can do is keep increasing my dosage of Mirtazapine which Iaposm not even sure is doing any good anyways. I just canapost get my head straight but Iaposm really trying.  He said his aposanxiety is through the roofapos and didnapost attend three of the meetings but continued to provide sick notes. He told bosses: Without sounding like a moan, the thought of going anywhereis still a little daunting. My intention was to come in today for meeting but I canapost leave the flat.  I know it sounds like a completely feeble excuse but Iaposve worked myself up into a state and now Iaposm frantic. I donapost know why as Iaposve been OK this morning but the last hour Iaposve been going out of my mind. Iaposve booked and cancelled three taxis now and feel like I just need to go back into bed and hide. Iaposm truly sorry to mess you all around I wish I could leave as planned. On July  he was dismissed without a disciplinary hearing for aposcontinuous absenceapos, perceived sick note failings, his aposinability to fulfil his contractual obligationsapos, and his failure to attend wellness meetings. He appealed and in early August received a letter informing it failed. As soon as a day later, Mr Rowe was hospitalised after a suicide attempt. Chair of the Cardf Employment Tribunal, Employment Judge Stephen Jenkins, said: We noted Mr Rowe attempted suicide in early August, a matter of days, possibly even only one day, after the receipt of the appeal outcome letter. It therefore appeared to us that the dismissal clearly had had an impact on him, and had exacerbated, potentially signicantly, his health and ability to work. We noted and accepted Mr Roweaposs evidence that, following his dismissal, he had felt in desperation, leading to thoughts of suicide, and that, when he knew that he was not going to go back to work having read the appeal letter, he aposspiralled into despairapos. Judge Jenkins ruled he was unfairly dismissed and discriminated on grounds of disability as David Wood Foods failed to make suitable adjustments. Judge Jenkins said: No investigation was undertaken in relation to the question of whether Mr Rowe had committed an act of misconduct. Had one been undertaken it would have been made clear he was suffering from ill health. David Wood Baking has been contacted for comment. The Samaritans is available  you need to talk.

Harry and Meghan met in  and tied the knot in May  - two years before leaving royal le.In a  interview, Meghan - who was still an actress in Suits at the time - made some comments that somehow seemed to foreshadow her and Harryaposs future decision to become independent, the Daily Star reports. She told InStyle: I think the biggest part of being a girl boss in the office, at home, or anywhere you go is just knowing your value. As you get older, you become more comfortable in your skin and comfortable in saying aposnoapos to things...Itaposs something that, I think, comes with age and really having a sense of your self-worth. And then you make choices based on that. During an interview Harry and Meghan gave in  while on a trip in South Africa, the Duchess of Sussex admitted she was not okay. She made the admission in a chat with ITVaposs Tom Bradby about the pressures of her new role as a royal mum, appearing to hold back tears.  Meghan was asked about the true pressures of le in the spotlight and the toll it has taken on them both.She said at the time:Look, any woman especially when they are pregnant you’re really vulnerable and so that was made really challenging, and then when you have a newborn – you know.And especially as a woman, it’s a lot. So you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or trying to be a newlywed it’s, well... She then thanked Tom for asking how she felt, saying: And, also thank you for asking, because not many people have askedI’m OK. But it’s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.  The comments seem to suggest that the possibility of leaving the Royal Family was on their minds for some time before they announced they would step down. This year Harry, , also admitted that he had thought about quitting the Firm in his twenties. He told actor Dax Shepard on the Armchair Expert podcast: In my early s, it was a case of, aposI donapost want this job, I donapost want to be here, I donapost want to be doing this, look what it did to my mumapos. In a statement released on social media in January  to announce their decision of quitting royal le, the Sussexes said: After many months of reflection and internal discussions, we have chosen to make a transition this year in starting to carve out a progressive new role within this institution.  We intend to step back as ‘senior’ members of the Royal Family and work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support Her Majesty The Queen. It is with your encouragement, particularly over the last few years, that we feel prepared to make this adjustment. We now plan to balance our time between the United Kingdom and North America, continuing to honour our duty to The Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages. The couple went on to discuss Archie and their plans to raise him with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born. They said: This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity. We look forward to sharing the full details of this exciting next step in due course, as we continue to collaborate with Her Majesty The Queen, The Prince of Wales, The Duke of Cambridge and all relevant parties. Until then, please accept our deepest thanks for your continued support.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have joined the World Health Organization and Save the Children in an appeal to G leaders meeting this weekend.Theyaposve urged them to honour promises to get Covid- vaccines to low-income countries where just % of people have had a jab.In a two-page letter, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Save the Children International CEO Inger Ashing and other leading voices in global health called for the world’s wealthiest countries to accelerate long-promised donations of vaccines.They coalition has demanded that the hold pharmaceutical companies have over access to vaccines must be broken.  “Among countries represented at the G, there are a handful with millions of surplus vaccines that are destined to be wasted once they expire,” the letter said. “Every discarded dose of a Covid- vaccine, when there are the mechanisms to donate them, should outrage us all. Each dose represents a real person—a mother, father, daughter, or son—who could have been protected.”  They pointed out that seven billon doses of Covid vaccines have been administered globally but Covax, the initiative designed to help fair achieve global access to vaccines, had only received .% of the promised . billion doses. Global targets have been set to vaccinate % of the population of every country by the end of  and % by the mid-. Decisions made at the G leaders’ summit in Rome this weekend could make or break those targets.  “By delivering already-pledged doses, helping countries manufacture their own vaccines, and prioritizing vaccines for nations in need, the G can help ensure the world delivers on these promises,” said the letter that was also signed by the Vaccine Alliance, UNAIDS, Clinton Foundation, Global Citizen and the Rockefeller Foundation. “We can’t simply hope for the pandemic to end on its own. As the virus progresses through unvaccinated populations, we risk new and more deadly strains sweeping the planet.”In the Spring Prince Harry urged people to “look beyond ourselves with empathy and compassion” during a speech at Vax Live.Harry, appearing without the Duchess of Sussex who was then expecting their second child, praised the world’s frontline medical workers at the concert. “Tonight is a celebration of each of you here, the vaccinated frontline workers in the audience and the millions of frontline heroes around the world,” he said. “You spent the last year battling courageously and selflessly to protect us all. You served and sacriced, put yourselves in harm’s way, and acted with bravery, knowing the costs. We owe you an incredible debt of gratitude.

And both of them were struggling emotionally and mentally to cope with, first of all, being pregnant, but also with le inside this goldfish bowl of the Royal Family. The royal biographer added that one of the biggest misconceptions about Meghan is that she was in control of their lives while they were senior royals, but actually, Prince Harry was the real expert.He explained:Meghan Markle is blamed for Harry coming to Hollywood. When ironically, it was Harry who was very keen to do an interview with Oprah. Mr Morton added: So she has deferred to him and often got the blame for things that have gone wrong. Sadly for Meghan, thereaposs a narrative thataposs built up thataposs wholly negative towards her.Last month, Meghan paid a subtle tribute to Princess Diana as she rounded off a trip to New York City with Harry.She carried a black Christian Dior Lady D-Lite bag that Diana liked and also wore her Cartier Tank watch. In her book aposThe Benchapos, which was published in June this year, Meghan also paid tribute to Diana with a picture of her favourite flowers.Meghan told NPR : “I think you can find sweet little moments that we hid in there – of my favourite flower, even my husband’s mom’s favourite flower, forget-me-nots.“We wanted to make sure those were included in there.

Beckie Searle, from Birmingham, is currently living in private rented accommodation but must leave by November .She cannot afford to continue private renting and has been told it could take months for her to find a council home, BirminghamLive reports.Birmingham City Council said there is a shortage of properties in the city and it is encouraging residents to look at the private market. Single mum Beckie, , has four children, Tyler aged , Jodie, aged , eight-year-old Kaine and five-year-old Leyla. Kaine is autistic and the strain on the family is having a particularly negative affect on him.  Jodie suffers from bronchitis and Leyla has mobility problems. Beckie has contacted Birmingham City Council for help but has been told she could face months to find a new home. The mum says private renting is too expensive and now faces splitting her young family up - a decision which she says will break her heart. The family have already packed up their belongings and are just counting the days until they have to leave their home. Beckie, who is currently claiming Universal Credit but is looking to go back to work as a support worker, said: The family will be split up as I will have to put them all up at dferent houses within our family. I need my autistic son settled.He is getting more aggressive than he usually is because of the situation. He doesnapost like to leave his bedroom because he doesnapost knowthat will be the last time he will see it. Two of my other children also have health problems. I have gone through the homeless department at the council but have told me that I have to wait six weeks before I get a bidding number to bid for a house. They have told me to private rent. I just canapost afford the prices. I canapost afford £ per month for a four bedroomed house. My wages would just not cover it.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter I feel absolutely wounded by whataposs happened. Itaposs just going to be a massive upheaval for everyone. A spokesman for Birmingham City Council said: We are very sorry to hear that this family is being made homeless. Anyone being asked to leave a rented property should seek legal advice on what this means in terms of the circumstances under which they may need to leave. This can sought from a housing law solicitor or through Birmingham City Council’s Housing Solutions service. If a household is at risk of homelessness the Housing Solutions service will assess the circumstances and determine in what way they may be assisted.  Demand for housing in Birmingham is considerably greater than supply, this does regularly result in households who are homeless, being placed in emergency accommodation including BB’s, until a alternative option can be secured. We do encourage households to look at other options. To help with renting in the Private Rented Sector we have introduced a new scheme with HelpRent, an organisation that makes housing simple for tenants and landlords and provides incentives to landlords who offer -month fixed tenancies to those on the Council’s homeless and housing registers.

David Capper said his -year-old father was told he had just four weeks to purchase a brand new caravan at the Shanlieve Holiday Park in Kilkeel or his caravan would have to be removed. The vehicle was deemed too old to be on the site, according to new rules imposed for holidaymakers or home owners parking up there. His father was devastated, he said, not being in a position to fork out the £, or more for a new caravan and facing losing the site he’d enjoyed for  years. David said he was “disgusted” someone who has been loyal to the site for so long would be given such an ultimatum. His father had spent a lot of money investing in the caravan and keeping it up to date, David said, but most importantly it holds a lot of sentimental value to him with memories of family holidays and spending time with his late we.I really cannot believe the way that my father has been treated by this caravan park after going there for  years and being such a loyal customer,” David told Belfast Live. He was given around four weeksapos notice that he would have to buy a new caravan, which would be £, or more, or he would have to have his caravan removed from the site altogether. “All they said was that the park would give him a £, discount off of the cost of a new one for his old one. For someone of my fatheraposs age to be asked to come up with that sort of money on short notice is ridiculous, although it would be the same no matter what age that you are. He has been left very upset by it all. That caravan is somewhere that our family grew up at, we would spend entire summers there and the memories and sentimental value that it has for my father is beyond measure. It was somewhere he had memories of our mother and now all of those are gone.  David said that there were dozens of owners at the holiday park who had been told the same thing as his father. He believed it was a problem affecting owners across Northern Ireland. It is not just Shanlieve that is doing this to owners, it is happening across Northern Ireland and it is ruining peopleaposs lives who have invested thousands into these caravans,” he said. Earlier this year, a group of  fuming caravan owners at Kingfisher Caravan Park on the Lincolnshire Coast announced they were taking East Lindsey District Council to court over the decision to boot out any caravans that were more than  years old. The group claims the council informed residents on the Ingoldmells site in October  of a change in the contract that meant caravans  years or older could not be there, YorkshireLive reports. After the deadline was initially pushed back for vans to be removed from the site, mainly due to the coronavirus-gtcoronavirus pandemic, the group now say they have until the end of the year to move them. However, after failed attempts at mediation the caravan owners say that they have no choice but to take the council to court over the decision. David said that due to the pandemic and more people wanting to staycation a lot of holiday park owners have become greedy and are pushing people out so that others will buy new expensive ones. “But in a year or two when people are going back to holidays abroad they will struggle because the previous loyal owners will want nothing to do with them. Something needs to be done soon to ensure that caravan owners have more rights because at the moment their circumstances seem to be able to change at the whim of a site owner.

Like ghostly apparitions, rising from the deep, they appear only occasionally to spook passers-by on Anglesey’s northern coast. For much of the time the cluster of figures remain submerged beneath the Irish Sea, only to reappear like maritime Chewbaccas or the Crew of the Flying Dutchman. Now that Halloween is approaching, the human-like shapes at Newry Beach, Holyhead, have gained wider fascination on social media. Locals have been aware of the phenomenon for some time and been mildly disturbed by them but a new picture of the marine ghouls have brought them to a larger audience. One person told NorthWales Live they do a double-take every time they walk past the eerie group.Another said: “I wouldn’t like to see them on a dark evening, very spooky.” A third added: “Actually that’s quite scary.... especiallyseen in the moonlight.” The photo was taken by Craig Fairclough of Chester, a regular visitor to the area in his touring caravan.He told North Wales Live : “I was walking the dog along Newry Beach when I saw what looked like human bodies emerging from the water,” he said.“I thought it would make a good photo, so I grabbed my mobile phone.“It was a spur of the moment thing. After the picture was posted on Facebook, it was shared widely with people saying how unique and atmospheric it looked.”The aposghoulsapos are in fact a seaweed-covered cluster of old wooden pilings from Holyhead’s former leboat ramp.Nature has fashioned them into human shapes that now stand testimony to the bravery of leboat crews who have operated out of Holyhead since . Over the centuries the rocky coastline and strong currents have caught out many a ship in the treacherous shipping lanes leading from Liverpool and Dublin.In the  years after the station was taken over by the RNLI in , the station lost seven leboat crew members as they battled to reach floundering vessels in the Irish Sea.The old leboat ramp now lies next to Holyhead Maritime Museum, which moved into the former leboat house – the oldest surviving one in Wales – in . Craig’s photo of the museum’s ghostly neighbours have intrigued fans of MR James, the medievalist scholar best remembered for his ghost stories. On a fans forum, one said it proved that Wales was a place where it was easy to get spooked. “It is a beautul country, but you can feel a dark sadness in these wild places,” he wrote. “It is a unique sensation here, I feel.” Comment MORE ON Ghosts\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Lancaster University graduate Polly Sutherland was  when she was spiked five years ago, but says she still feels vulnerable going out all these years later. Miss Sutherland, from Stone in Staffordshire, had been on a night out at the universityaposs The Sugarhouse, run by the studentsapos union, in December  when friends noticed her behaving strangely. The graduate, who also has type  diabetes, said being drugged left her needing to use a walking stick for around a month because it damaged her blood sugar levels - something which can be fatal for people with the condition.  It took away the use of her drawing hand for weeks. Recalling the night, Miss Sutherland, now , said: I donapost remember anything suspicious happening, or noticing anything happening. It was just, later in the night, friends with me noticed that my personality changed - I seemed very dferent... erratic. So they took me home, I went to bed, but when I woke up in the morning I had a lot of bodily weakness and twitches in my arms, legs, all over really. She went on: When I went tothey werenapost very helpful. I remember feeling really disappointed, because I went to them saying aposFrom whataposs going on, I think Iaposve been spikedapos.  They almost raised their eyebrows, almost accusing me of taking drugs, and I was trying to get out of it somehow or making excuses. I felt very let down by the doctors at that point. Miss Sutherland had to apply for deadline extensions in the final year of her art degree because she could not paint or draw following the incident. She said she reported the incident to Lancaster University Studentsapos Union , but received little response. Asked how the incident made her feel, she said: Very... I donapost want to use the word violated, because maybe thataposs too strong. But itaposs scary to think what could have happened. Iaposm lucky that I had a lot of friends around me that took me home when they noticed something wasnapost right, so Iaposm very thankful for that, because I donapost know what purpose that person went out with.  It made me feel very vulnerable. Even now, when I go on nights out, Iaposm very cautious of it now, and itaposs in the back of my mind all the time. The graduate, who is now in her second year of a politics degree at Keele University, said she has joined the Girls Night In movement, which sees students boycotting clubs following reports of drink spiking incidents. But she said: The thing that bothers me is that, with the boycotting, the onus is on girls, again, to stay in. I think the fact that we are the ones that have to stay in because this is happening is putting it on us, itaposs our responsibility to make sure we donapost get spiked, instead of telling people not to spike people. Miss Sutherland said clubs should use CCTV and scan ID cards on entry, instead of just checking them by eye, so that they have a record of who attended each night. In a statement, Lancaster University said: We pride ourselves on Lancaster being a safe place to study and are distressed to hear about any of our students being assaulted in this way. The Sugarhouse is owned and managed by Lancaster University Studentsapos Union, and we cannot comment on inidual incidents. However,any of our students have safety concerns in relation to spiking, or any other kind of assaults, then we would strongly encourage them to report them to the university and we have created a range of ways to enable our students to do so. We would also encourage students to report any such incidents to the police.

The messaging  is removing support for a number of old smartphone models, meaning that from November  many must do without the popular app which offers free picture sharing across the world. On Monday,  smartphone models - both on Android and iOS - will stop working. Users will lose the ability to send messages and snaps, or make video calls to family and friends, using the encrypted messaging service.

However,youaposre holding off buying a new phone and want to save your chat history there is a way of doing it.You can back up your message history to Google Drive or iCloud depending on which  you use .Alternatively, you can export your chat history as an email attachment. If you have a younger phone but are running it on outdated software, now is probably a good time to update your phone.

It is ideal to have WiFi enabled when doing so unless you are ok with using your phone data, butit is a large download then it could be costly.  If your phone is too old to update the software then you may want to think about upgrading to a newer model in order to continue to use the app. WhatsApp has lost a lot of users over the last year due to ongoing privacy concerns around its new terms of service. WhatsApp has traditionally marketed itself on offering secure, encrypted messaging, but announced wildly unpopular changes to the way it handles user data.

Katie Murphy, , attacked the man, Joseph Walker, as he was out for drinks with friends at the busy Masquerade bar in Liverpool.The glass narrowly missed Mr Walkeraposs right eye but he was left with signicant injuries which will leave him permanently scarred, the Liverpool Echo reported.Murphy of Stonyfield, Netherton, previously admitted she was off her face after a cocaine and alcohol binge which started the night before the attack on the evening of October  last year. She appeared at Liverpool Crown Court for sentencing on Friday after pleading guilty to causing grievous bodily harm without intent.  CCTV showed Mr Walker chatting and drinking with friends at the bar in the moments leading up to the sickening attack. Suddenly, while Mr Walker is looking down at his phone, he is approached by Murphy, who swilled a drink at him and smashed the glass in his face. She then blew two kisses at the victim before walking outside. Chris Hopkins, prosecuting, said: Mr Walker described a hand appearing with a glass which was thrust into his face. The glass broke with the impact. He bled profusely and was left with a jagged wound. He was taken to hospital and needed four internal stitches and  external stitches above his right eye. In his victim statement, Mr Walker said he now has a visible scar to his forehead, and he had become conscious of the way he looked. He added: I had a bubbly, happy nature before this happened, but I am now more nervous around people. I still donapost know why it was me she did it to. Maybe it was mistaken identity, maybe she just didnapost like the look of me. The injury was very close to my eye and it could have been a lot worse. Mr Walker bravely said he had forgiven his attacker. Mike Hagerty, defending, said Murphy accepted the victim of her attack was wholly innocent. He added: The defendant has a signicant mental health problem, including a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, which is exacerbated by the use of drugs and alcohol. She has expressed regret and is remorseful. Judge Recorder Richard Leiper QC sentenced Murphy to  weeks in prison, suspended for  months. She was ordered to undergo a mental health and a drug rehabilitation programme, along with  hours of unpaid work.

Chloe James, from Fleet, was getting changed in a tanning salon cubicle when she saw a phone and a hand above her. The perpetrator, a -year-old man from Aldershot, was arrested but later released with a conditional caution. Chloe said it feels unfair he can carry on with le as normal while she continues to feel the effects. Chloe has waived her right to anonymity, wanting to tell her story to raise awareness and change peopleaposs attitudes towards voyeurism. The -year-old said she sometimes has flashbacks of the incident, the memory of which “sends shudders” through her.“Itaposs not a nice feeling at all,” she toldSurrey Live.I thought I would get over it, but it happened in August. It still upsets me, itaposs an invasion of my privacy completely. Iaposm never going to get that back.A conviction of voyeurism, as defined underSection of the Sexual Offences Act , carries a maximum prison sentence of two years.It was August  when Chloe arrived at Tantastic in North Lane, Aldershot, for her appointment. She recalled: I walked in and the guy was talking to the owner. He kind of looked at me and we exchanged an aposare you alrightapos kind of look you do to someone you donapost know. He saw me walk into the cubicle, and then walked into the one next to me. I was just waiting for the bed to heat up, just standing there. Luckily, I just looked up and then I saw a phone. I just panicked. For him to get his phone over he would have had to have stood on a stool or sunbed or something. Theyaposre high walls. Chloe wasnapost wearing anything at the time and described her initial feeling of disbelief. I doubted myself, aposdid I just see that apos I went out and told the owner and had a complete panic attack and started crying, she said. She said the owner brought the man out and demanded to see his phone, but he refused.Chloe managed to get hold of his name and contacted him on Facebook. Over the app, in a message seen bySurreyLive,he then admitted wrongdoing.Chloe went to police the same day with this evidence. On October , the man was arrested and questioned, but the outcome was not what Chloe had hoped for. After admitting the offence to police, the man was given a conditional caution, ordered to pay £ in compensation to Chloe and attend a Victim Awareness Course by January , . Chloe tried to appeal the conditional caution decision on October , but police said it was not eligible for the Right to Review Scheme. A senior investigative officer did carry out a review, however, but they found the decision to be legal and proportionate, and the outcome was likely to be similar toit had been dealt with at court, a Hampshire Constabulary spokesperson said. Chloe said: Itaposs the first time he has done it, but I donapost think this is just a random thing you just do. Heaposs probably done it before. I went to police becauseit happened to me, this could be the start of something worse. Chloe added: Itaposs unfair I am still having to deal with it, and heaposs got away with it. Sexual assault [and other sexual offences] is happening so much more often, nothing is getting done. There needs to be a change. A Hampshire Constabulary spokesperson said: As a force, we take all allegations of sexual offences very seriously, and we have specialist officers who provide a compassionate and professional response to victims. Investigations into these offences are among the most complex that our officers carry out and cautioning offenders is just one example of formal action open to the police. When considering how best to deal with someone for any offence, we consider many factors including the circumstances of the case, the victimaposs welfare and whether they support a prosecution through the courts, whether there has been an admission of guilt, the offenderaposs situation, and the ages of those involved. Our officers are professional decision makers and on a daily basis make decisions about how to achieve the best outcome, when to give a community resolution, a conditional caution or pursue a charge with the Crown Prosecution Service . We do take the victimaposs wishes into account. Officers are making decisions about whether it is fair and proportionate to give someone a criminal record for their first offence, when theyaposve accepted responsibility, offered to remedy the crime, is considered unlikely to reoffend, and can be given a sanction that deters further offending. Cautions for the most serious offences are only used in exceptional circumstances and after advice is sought from the CPS.

Victoria “Snooks” Triece, whose two children attend Sand Lake Elementary School, was told earlier this month she could no longer take part in Orange County Public Schools’ ADDition volunteer program. The notice came after an anonymous letter from a “concerned parent” outed her, her attorney said on Friday. Triece’s attorney, Mark NeJame, said the -year-old was “stripped” of the chance “to participate in her children’s lives with no legal or constitutional justication”. “What happened is somebody who took the posture of being a moralwrote a letter to the school and without notice she was unceremoniously dumped from being a volunteer,” Mr NeJame said.According toNew York Post reports , Triece had been volunteering in the district for five years, having passed a background check to do so.Now, she is no longer allowed to volunteer at the school, though she is allowed to chaperone field trips with her - and -year-old sons, NeJame said.  But NeJame said the latter point was only claried to Triece by OCPS officials prior to a press conference on Thursday, which he said suggested the school was “scrambling” to clean up their mess. Speaking to reporters, Triece said she had been on OnlyFans for more than two years, something she had never taken steps to hide.She also ran Twitter and Instagram pages which had attracted up to , followers and featured the heavily-tattooed mum in sultry poses.Speaking at the press conference, Triece said “nobody” has the right to judge what other people do for a living. “I feel judged, and so isolated,” she said. She went on to explain that she felt “humiliated” that someone felt the need to expose her online presence. “No one  should be concerned about what another parent does,” Triece said. “I just love spending time with my kids and I have a great relationship with other parents and students.” A school district spokeswoman had declined to comment on the matter, citing “potential, pending or ongoing litigation.” However, according to Orlando Sentinel reports, none of the guidelines for the volunteer programme explicitly stated what volunteers can or can’t do while on campus. Triece explained that her work le was separate to her being a mum, adding that she had the support of other parents at the school. “I think everybody’s just floored because they’re like, ‘We know you, we know who you are,” she said.

What do you think about Haileyaposs situation  Let us know in the comments...Taking to TikTok, Hailey said: When she was in labour, she called me and I drove her to the hospital. I was with her when she got an epidural and I wore the daddy wristband and I gave the baby her first bath. It was a beautul experience, right  I will never forget it. I was just happy to be a part of it. Unfortunately three days later I saw the hereditary birthmark, which Iaposm very familiar with because my oldest son has it, itaposs an extra piece of cartilage that grows outside the neck so he looks like a little Frankenstein baby.  She said she noticed what she called the bowling bumps on the baby girlaposs neck while changing her nappy. Several of his other children have it as well, so I knew exactly that the baby was my husbandaposs at the time. Later, the woman said her then-best friend admitted the affair and that she had been sleeping with her husband. Recalling the moment, she said: She was standing next to me when I was changing the baby, thataposs when we both saw the birthmark.

The initial search for four-year-old Cleo Smith, who has now been missing for two weeks, involved close friends after she disappeared from the Blowholes campsite near Carnarvon, Australia. It is a case that has shocked the country and is being compared to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. Cleo’s mum Ellie had discovered that the toddler was missing from the tent around am and that was when the search got underway on October .  The conditions with remote terrain meant it was dficult to search the area with some people using quad bikes and even a drone. Police now believe that Cleo must have been abducted as it would be strange for a four-year-old to wander very far. On top of the fact that her sleeping bag also has vanished with her. A friend of the family is hoping that Cleo will still turn up safe and sound.And we were still in hope that she was just kind of coming out of a hiding spot, one friend told The West Australian. I mean, weaposve got to just hope that she shows up and that she came home in the end. I mean, you canapost lose hope otherwise you start to lose yourself. Police have said they were at the campsite less than an hour after Cleo was found to be not in the tent by her mum. A call was logged at .am by Ellie to say that her daughter was missing - almost straight away - despite having initially felt that she spent hours looking for Cleo first. Police arrived at .am and by .am set up a protected site, revealed Det Superintendent Rob Wilde. Then by am homicide detectives were at the scene and searches were taking place of cars at the campsite. Det Supt Wilde said that police had responded to around  possible sightings of Cleo around the country but none have been the little girl. Unfortunately all of those have proved unfruitful, Mr Wilde said. Thataposs been national as well, other policing jurisdictions have helped us and followed those leads through for us, so weaposre very grateful for that. Police are still appealing for information and believe she was abducted but they have no suspects yet. They are trying to gather more information over a car that left the campsite at about am with its tyres heard to be screeching. More than  visitors to the Blowholes campsite so far have been interviewed. We do however believe there are still other campers that were staying in that Blowholes vicinity who we have not yet identied, he said.

The red hot piece of lava could be seen rolling at speed down the side of the volcano before coming to a stand still in the amazing footage from La Palma. Eruptions from the Cumbre Vieja volcano have continued to light up the sky on Friday night with no end in sight with so far around , buildings have been destroyed and , people evacuated. In the last few days the lava flows have appeared more fluid and the the track, labelled “number three” is currently the most worrying as it heads to the coastal villages of La Bombilla and Puerto Naos.  Maria Jose Blanco, director of Spain’s National Geographic Institute on the Canary Islands, said that the volcano is erupting “furiously” at the moment rather than showing signs of slowing down. The number three track has progressed around  metres in the last  hours said Ms Blanco and covering land that has not so far been affected by the lava flow. It is forcing some of those who have not so far been evacuated from villages in the area to have to leave their homes.

Then he gets a call from apal, chooses an outfit for his avatar, and heads to a meeting with the avatars of hismates in a spaceship, where he receives a video call from hiswe showing him hisdog going wild in theirgarden.Confused  Most of us have probably got quite a bit of catching up to do, because according to the billionaire Facebook founder, this vision is quite possibly our future.The video posted by Zuckerberg yesterday was his attempt at introducing us to the metaverse - a theoretical future world of interlinking digital s, a fusion of virtual and augmented reality with, er, reality, which he and much of Silicon Valley believe is our brave next new frontier. On Thursday, in the wake of a damning wave of revelations and criticism aimed at the safety of his social media s, the tech tycoon announced he was changing the name of his company Facebook to Meta.What do you think about metaverse  Have your say in the comment sectionHe explained while his global social media juggernauts Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp would continue to operate under the new umbrella name, its focus would now be on helping to shape and create the future metaverse.While critics pointed to distraction tactics, he explained: “Now we have a new north star to help bring the metaverse to le, and we have a new name that reflects the full breadth of what we do and the future that we want to help build. From now on, we’re going to be metaverse first, not Facebook first.” But what is it, and what might it mean for us all  What does metaverse mean  A fusion of meta, meaning ‘beyond,’ and ‘universe’, the word is being used to describe a future space where our real-le physical world and digital worlds increasingly blend. In this “immersive” world people would be represented by avatars - digital forms of themselves, be that close to le, or fun cartoon figures - or even holograms, and meet in virtual or augmented reality worlds to socialise, watch concerts, shop, learn, or work.  Virtual reality is a completely digital world, whereas augmented reality is where some elements of the digital world appear on top of the real world, like the Pokemon Go game.The vision is for a plethora of digital worlds, be they created by Meta, Google, Apple etc, to be interlinked so users could flit between them. It could change the internet completely.Where did the term come from  Not Zuckerberg. The word was first coined back in  in a sci-fi novel called the Snow Crash by American writer Neal Stephenson. It described a computer generated D virtual reality where people were present as avatars in a digital representation of the real world. Will the metaverse be safe  Zuckerberg’s social media s have come in for heavy criticism in recent weeks over safety. Key fears for a future metaverse are privacy and security. It would not only be ‘old-fashioned’ data like gender and age weaponised by trolls, advertisers, hackers, and even states, but potentially our body language, movement, moods, biometrics. Our opinions, information and community could be even more manipulated than now. Facebook announced million would go into building the metaverse “responsibly”, allocating that to a number of organisations and academic institutions.  Sir Nick Clegg said: “The way I look at it, in the past the speed at which new technologies emerged sometimes left policymakers and regulators playing catch up. “I really think that it doesn’t have to be the case this time round because we have years until the metaverse we envision is fully realised, this is the start of the journey not the end.” How will we access the metaverse, and can you already  The metaverse is already in its infancy, although far from being a joined-up universe.The computer game Fortnite is a good example. Now far more than a game, it is a virtual land where players can visit, meet and even watch events, including real-le fashion shows and concerts - Ariana Grande is the latest artist to perform there. You can also enter an early form through Zuckerberg’s Oculus VR headsets. The company has an app called Horizon Workrooms, which lets people wearing them go into virtual offices. Reportedly, Nick Clegg, the company’s VP of Global Affairs, holds his Monday meetings this way, round a virtual table. The company is reportedly now developing a better headset, codenamed Project Cambria, which has “improved social presence, colour passthrough, pancake optics, and a lot more”. What do those terms mean  Social presence means how real it feels to be alongside others. The new device hopes to allow avatars to keep eye contact, and have more developed facial expressions that even reflect each other. Passthrough means how real the world you are in seems to you - asyou weren’t wearing a headset at all. It is hoped it will be colour, whereas with Oculus it is black and white. Pancake optics are the lens, and aim to be lighter, with clearer focus. The company is also reportedly experimenting with AR glasses. How long will it take for a fully ing metaverse to be created  Zuckerberg believes a billion people will be using it in a decade’s time, and to help with that he wants his newly-named Meta to become a “metaverse business”, announcing plans to hire , people across the EU. Will anyone run the metaverse  Zuckerberg has said he will put tens of billions of dollars into it, but, like the internet, no one company will run the metaverse. However, anyone instrumental in helping to build it will have a lot of sway - andit becomes a key form of human interaction, that could be a lot of power.

lead at half time.Star looked to put the game to bed as quickly as possible in the second half and did so as Aaron Moore grabbed his second of the afternoon following a slip from the Duncanrig keeper.MacLean was next to double his tally as he proved too sharp for the Duncanrig defence and finished well from a tight angle to make the score - with half an hour to go.This gave manager Weir the chance to ring the changes, with Ryan Caskie coming on to replace Aaron Moore and helping himself to two goals of his own from close range to make the final score -.The only sour note was an injury to goal-scoring substitute Caskie which will rule him out of Star#s next game.Star look to make it back-to-back wins on Saturday October , again on their travels to Port Glasgow OBU."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-borders-recorded-50-cases-24-hours","story":"THE Borders has recorded  new cases of coronavirusin the last day, latest figures show.According to Scottish Government data published at pm today , the Borders has now seen , cases of the virus since the start of the pandemic.There are currently  people in the hospital in the Borders with confirmed cases of the virus ndash nine more than yesterday.Scotland has now recorded , cases of the virus since March last year, according to the latest data."},{"url":null,"title":"peebles-destruction-communal-garden-very-disturbing","story":"THE destruction of a recreational area in the Borders has been ldquoshocking and very disturbing for residents, says a Tweeddale councillor.But Heather Anderson, of the SNP, says that there was no illegality in the developer removing the communal garden in Peebles as he owns the land.The developer had wanted to build two houses on the ground, but Scottish Borders Council rejected the plans as it had been earmarked for a play recreational area.The landowner appealed to the Scottish Government, but by the time an official visited, residents of Ballantyne Place had added slabs, shrubs and trees to the space.However, a bulldozer was used to remove the communityrsquos additions earlier this month, leaving everything in ldquoa big pile.:Borderers urged by council to prepare for lsquoheavy and persistentrsquo rainfallldquoBecause the owner owns that site, there was no illegality in him displacing the landscaping, said Ms Anderson, who confirmed that she had approached council officers to see what action could be taken.ldquoI also got officers to check whether the site was safe for the public, and they assured me that it was safe, but it was still a slightly shocking event that was captured on camera.The Tweeddale West representative added: ldquoWhat we now have to try and do is ensure that the residents of Ballantyne Place and that owner hopefully navigate a mutually agreeable solution to how to use that piece of land.The space had been used as an area for households to come together to enjoy barbecues.One resident, who does not want to be named, told the Peeblesshire News: ldquoWe set about clearing it from all the rubble and weeds.

We will see somewhere in the region of  world leaders in Glasgow next month for the COP climate change conference, and that will occupy the front pages for its duration.However, itrsquos clear that the scale of action needed in the face of catastrophic climate change requires strong collective leadership at every level. Where better to begin than education to relay the message of how urgently our behaviours need to change.With that in mind, Scotlandrsquos colleges are providing leadership on a strong collective front. Not only do they need to be the messengers, but they also need to pay attention to the message, with shts in their own working models and practices.Many colleges in Scotland have been working on this steadily. Following the Paris agreement at COP in , colleges have been making good progress in reducing carbon emissions. In fact, since reporting began in  . The sector has achieved an overall % reduction in emissions. This is better progress than the whole of the public sector, which has reduced by % over the same period.Clearly % is impressive but there is work to be done towards achieving the Scottish Government reporting expectations, and the sectorrsquos own statement of commitment, to achieve Net Zero climate emissions by  or earlier.Bringing together the current thinking and setting out a joint agenda, College Development Networkrsquos Climate Emergency Expert Group hosted the inaugural College Climate Change Conference, earlier this month.Held online with representatives of the college expert group and partners, it gave a strategic overview of the climate change actions that the college sector should be engaged in.It follows the development of the Scottish Colleges Statement on the Climate Emergency, which lists  key actions that colleges have committed to delivering.ldquoThe college sectorrsquos role in this is going to be huge, says Jim Metcalfe, Chief Executive of College Development Network . ldquoWe have a role to make sure that our own institutions, campuses, and staff and student travel is Net Zero. We have a role to provide the skills to ensure the economy can reform itself to be Net Zero ndash how we teach and train and develop people. And we have a role in how to influence change in our communities ndash we are crucial anchor institutions across the country that can influence the way our regional economies can change for the better.Skills development is something that is absolutely crucial in the contribution of colleges. The vocational courses that many offer, those that have an impact on our everyday lives will clearly need to change in line with green technologies as well as manufacturing and building practices.ldquoTo achieve Net Zero wersquoll need new green jobs, which in turn means wersquoll need to ensure we have people with the right skills to take up those jobs, says Dr Mike Cantlay OBE, Chair of the Scottish Funding Council.Providing an idea of scale, at the conference he pointed out that one change, the sht to electric vehicles, will require , people to be trained or retrained to support the new technology.ldquoThat means we have huge reskilling and upskilling tasks ahead of us. Through initiatives such as the National Transition Training Fund, colleges are already providing great opportunities for reskilling and upskilling ndash and these examples demonstrate the responsive-ness and agility of the college sector. But our success will rely on our ability to inspire future learners to consider these new career options, and I commend the work of colleges in this crucial task.Its clear that colleges are playing a crucial part in our rapidly changing landscape and as Angela Cox, Principal and CEO of Borders College, explained at the conference, colleges, perhaps more than ever are acting as catalysts of change.Also a lead Principal on the Climate Emergency within the College Principals Group, Angela Cox details some of the changes happening at Borders College.ldquoAll students at Borders college will complete a carbon literacy module at the start of their programme but this is only a small part of their development, she explains. ldquoHowever, that needs to be brought to le in their subject learning. A small but good example is a project with Bordersrsquo hairdressing students looking at the choice of dye products ndash synthetic versus organic and what happens when the waste product including peroxide is rinsed and flows into the water system.Angela Cox points to projects that are initiated by students, and through creating employer partnerships are also powerful catalysts for change. An example is a former Borders College plumbing student who invented a device to stop water leaks immediately while the fault was found. His company Kibosh now operates globally.She says, ldquoWe are also sharing our carbon literacy module with our schools and housing associations and supporting the delivery through a train the trainer approach. Over time this means that students progressing to the college already have the basics and our projects become more innovative and collaborative through our community partnerships.Angela Cox adds, ldquoColleges are in a unique and privileged position to take a leading role in achieving Net Zero. We have the power to influence the behaviours and values of our students, staff and communities. I am proud that Borders College is seizing the opportunity to help secure a sustainable future for the Scottish Borders and beyond.College staff and students have spent a considerable amount of time creating this new culture for colleges, where the consideration of climate impact isnrsquot a tick box but goes to the heart of everything they do.In November  Dundee and Angus College was invited to take part in the pilot of the College Learning for Sustainability Champions course, run by EAUC and Learning for Sustainability Scotland.Christine Calder, Academic Development Lead at the College explained at the conference how important it was for Dundee and Angus to be involved.ldquoOne lecturer from each of our  curricular departments attended the course. This gave us a real opportunity to know who a friend of sustainability was in each department.  lecturers, working with an average of  students. Thatrsquos  people directly affected. Thenwe add in the conversations that have happened in those studentsrsquo homes and with friends or the conversations that the lecturers had within their departments let alone their friends and families as well as students in other classes. Thatrsquos the ripple effect.Dr Katie Paget, Science Lecturer and Learning and Teaching Skills Mentor at Dundee and Angus College was one of the lecturers who was part of the pilot for the science team. She says, ldquoIn many ways the pandemic has brought the themes within the UNrsquos Sustainable Development Goalsinto the limelight, and this gives us a powerful opportunity.ldquoThis academic year we have embedded the SDGs into our Lecturer Professionalism Pathway. Within the course lecturers can reflect on, and share ways that they can embed such themes within their teaching and have the opportunity to try out ideas in a supportive environment.ldquoOur hope is that by weaving these into our curriculum with new lecturers during their early career, linking SDGs in their classrooms can become a foundation within their teaching, and not an extra.Its clear that the sector has put time and effort into creating a climate change strategy with clear goals and is working with a greater shared purpose than ever before.ldquoThe sector is now focused on operationalising those actions and achieving against that statement of commitment, on campuses and in teaching across the country as a sector, adds Jim Metcalfe, Chief Executive of CDN. ldquoIrsquom hopeful and aspirational about this agenda. ____________________________________________________________________Roadmap outlines path towards Net Zero futureWORKING towards the same ends takes collective knowledge and purpose. To that end a Climate Action Roadmap for colleges has been developed by the Climate Commission for UK Higher and Further Education, to support colleges at all stages of their progress towards Net Zero.The roadmap was developed closely with college leaders, students, and partners to ensure that it was relevant to every college, no matter what stage it hasreached on its sustainability journey.Itrsquos a tool that can be a useful gap analysis, to show where you are doing well, but identy where improvements are required. The roadmap alsofactors in cost and time commitments for each action, which helps in that planning.It covers all areas of the college, so you look at distinct areas in detail, such as leadership and governance, teaching and learning, estates and partnerships, and engagement.The Climate Action Roadmap illustrates clearly what an emerging college could look like. It helps colleges to tailor actions to match strategy. This is seen as an opportunity, in advance of COP to show how Scottish colleges are leading the way on climate change.From the date that every college commits to the roadmap, it has a full year to develop targets and show how those will be implemented.Workshops to develop the roadmap were carried out in June, attended by staff, and partners of Scotlandrsquos colleges. Billy Currie, Head of Corporate Services at Dumfries  Galloway College attended those workshops and says he could identy benefits for reviewing climate change plans immediately.Some colleges across the sector havebeen working in this area this since . Billy believes that one of the roadmaprsquos great strengths is its flexibility, where it can strengthen and consolidate the work that has already been done.At the College Climate Change Conference he explained, ldquoAt Dumfries  Galloway we carried out something of a progress review. We have used the Colleges get to work on key climate actions roadmap to reflect on our previous climate change action plan, to see where we could identy successes.ldquoWe could identy elements such as using renewable technologies in new builds, looking at our electric fleet vehicles, and identying partners for our student transport. We also have an established waste network with zerowaste goals for going to landfill.Billy Currie adds that an area that they could strengthen was governance. ldquoWe had already taken steps at Dumfries  Galloway in terms of setting our targets and annual reporting, both to the board and the cross-college Climate Action Group.ldquoBy using the roadmap we were able to declare a climate emergency, signed by the Principal, the Board Chair, and the Studentsrsquo Association President. ldquoThe declaration document commits the college to taking continued action on climate change matters. ldquoClimate change is now embedded into our systems and infrastructure strategies. We also have key performance indicators measuring what wersquore doing year on year ndash these are monitored by the Board, senior leadership and the climate action group.Billy Currie adds that working on awareness among staff and students, particularly in subject areas, is crucial to achieving the sustainable development goals.ldquoClimate change action is embedded at Dumfries  Galloway College, and we now have a revised plan, which is more focused because of the roadmap. As well as identying the key areas where we need to make changes, we can look at not only the college itself but how we fit in to the wider plan, regionally and nationally."},{"url":null,"title":"eyemouth-man-involved-two-domestic-bust-ups-borders","story":"A MAN involved in two domestic bust-ups within the space of a month has been ordered to carry out  hours of unpaid work at Jedburgh Sherf Court.Aleksandrs Kravcovs, , was abusive to the woman at a party in Eyemouth on Christmas Eve and then followed it up by assaulting her a month later.Describing the first incident Depute fiscal Alison Atkins said: \"The accused attended at the locus with a number of people on the evening of Christmas Eve.\"People were consuming alcohol and in good spirits.\"However as the evening progressed the accused became aggressive and wanted to go home and take his young daughter with him.:lsquoMajor incidentrsquo stood down but number of roads still lsquoaffectedrsquo by flooding\"A witness and his partner both said this was not a good idea due to his level of intoxication.\"This caused the accused to become even more aggressive and was shouting and swearing in an aggressive manner.\"He was prevented from entering the daughters bedroom and the police were contacted.\"In January the fish processing factory worker got involved in another argument with his partner which escalated and resulted in him slapping her face and seizing hold of her by her arms.Ms Atkins said: \"She was knocked to the ground.

Surely they could be stored at the council depot, especially when not getting used.The grass throughout was cut and the loose grass was left lying in thick clumps, asit was a playing field, instead of a cemetery.This cemetery, in years past, won an award but I fail to see the same happening again with things as they are of late.The grass around the stones, at the sides and back, is not being cut, resulting in long grass and often ferns growing there are bollards lying loose which will undoubtedly result in damage to a car there are cones at the main car park, restricting the amount of cars that can park there, and there are also cones at the portable cabins the road in the cemetery is a total disgrace!I in no way blame the men who work in the cemetery as they are doing as they have been told to do, and I know they are taken from the cemetery to work where, resulting in those men not having the time to complete the work which is necessary to keep the cemetery in the condition it should be.I understand about cutbacks and lack of funds but I am wondering where the money goes that people have paid for plots and or council tax, which increase and yet there are even more cutbacks.My biggest concern is where has the respect gone The following is in response to the debate about the state of the A over Rest And Be Thankful in the Scottish Parliament last Wednesday, October .I fear that the current Rest and Be Thankful is a catastrophe waiting to happen and I think that there needs to be an urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver a medium-term and long-term solution for the people and businesses of Argyll.The Cabinet Secretary discussed the necessity to collect data for the end long-term solution and, as much as I appreciate that, it should have been done years ago and I completely understand the frustrations felt by businesses and travellers alike.The Cabinet Secretary also invited all contributing MSPs to walk the forestry road with engineers and I am going to write to him to accept that invitation."},{"url":null,"title":"tale of two halves as pupils lose out in paisley","story":"Campbeltown Pupils suffered late heartbreak last Saturday as they suffered a reverse away result to Paisley outfit Glenvale.Leading - at half time, the Pupils played well beneath their top level in the second half and succumbed to a late goal at Ferguslie Sports Centre to lose -.Travelling with a strong squad of , the Pupils looked determined in the first half to take three points back to Kintyre.Moving the ball with precision and purpose the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils were well on top and made a great start within  minutes when Liam Renton’s corner found Ross Souden in the box and the young central defender forced the ball into the net.The Pupils’ front three of Rhys Casci, Scott Souden and Renton were in full flow, keeping the Glenvale defence facing their own goal and latching on to some well-aimed distribution from goalkeeper Alasdair Ferguson.The Pupils doubled their lead before half-time when holding midfielder Ellis Robertson broke free of his marker and guided a sublime curling effort into the Glenvale keeper’s top left-hand corner.What followed in the second half, however, was bitterly disappointing.After fending off some early pressure from their hosts, the Pupils retreated which only served to embolden Glenvale, and sure enough before the hour, their first goal arrived after an onrushing midfielder drove home a low shot from just inside the penalty box.The Pupils struggled for a foothold as the second half progressed, their fluidity furtherMidfielder Stuart Crossan also received a nasty kick to the ankle in attempting to block a Glenvale effort, and was replaced by young forward Conner McMurchy.With only a few minutes remaining, Glenvale scored a third when a through-ball was erted into the path of a Glenvale winger, who burst forward to score.On reflection, it was a confusing Jekyll-and-Hyde performance from the Kintyre Park side, with lessons to be learned in maintaining a level of performance for  minutes.Tomorrowthe Pupils will travel to Petershill Park, Glasgow, for perhaps the most high-profile competitive match in the club’s history to date, when they take on Premier Division Rossvale FC of Bishopbriggs in the WOSFL’s league cup.Those who would like to travel to the game to support the Pupils should check @PupilsAFC and @RossvaleJFC on Twitter for postcode details, or see Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week october 15 2021","story":"One morning recently, I heard the following two news items on the radio:First was a report about the petrochemical plant at Grangemouth which emits tons of CO into the atmosphere.

Look out for the third and final piece in next week#s paper.Wartime needs created additional traffic and pressures for the two main operators, thereafter, once into peacetime, West Coast Motors and its rival were able to modernise their fleets.McConnachie#s stole a march by bringing Kintyre#s first double decker to the town in , buying two more in the late s which older residents may still remember. However, failing general economics resulted in West Coast acquiring this business in . These #deckers never ran for West Coast and it would be more than  years later before such buses entered their fleet.Liveries iniably provide a recognisable identity for any bus operator and West Coast is no exception. The flowering of the company#s one surely came to its climax in the s with the flowing combination of ivory, red and maroon, set off by polished body trim lines and wheel embellishers. Styles continue to evolve but, in the opinion of this writer, no other Scottish operator has chosen a more distinctive colour scheme than West Coast which still uses two of those principal colours, ivory and red, which it bestowed on its buses  years earlier.During the s and s, West Coast#s modern vehicles were typical examples of their time. In the latter period, new bus grants were obtainable under certain conditions resulting in some splendid coaches being purchased.In post war years, the company gradually built on its service network in Kintyre and Mid Argyll. In , it picked up the East Loch – West Loch Tarbert mail ship link from Tarbert-based Dickies then the Tarbert – Kilberry service from McEacherns in , the Lochgilphead Tayvallich service from McLachans in  and, perhaps somewhat prophetically, the Benderloch-based operations of McColls in .Without doubt, the most signicant developments in West Coast#s history occurred in the - period. During the s, William Craig had attempted to introduce a direct Campbeltown to Glasgow service but failed in this ambition then and at later attempts. Finally, in , these hopes were realised when the company became a joint operator, with Scottish Citylink, of the through service between the two locations.The s continued to see signicant developments. Firstly the acquisition, also in , of the buses and Mid Argyll routes operated by Lochgilphead-based Stag Garage. This was followed, a year later, by the purchase of the old MacBrayne garage in Ardrishaig, giving West Coast an excellent base in the area.The early s saw a further involvement in Oban when West Coast secured responsibility for the Oban to Glasgow service and by  it had acquired the former Alexanders depot in Oban enabling it to build further on its already signicant presence in Argyll.Since , the rate of change has quickened further. West Coast secured the Cowal and Bute area contracts and depots in  and when Bowmans, the long-established Mull services operator retired in , West Coast added this to its portfolio. Their Oban base allows vehicle and manpower deployments on Mullneeded. Of the major Argyll islands, only Islay remains independently served by the Mundell concern of Tarbert, whose lorries are also a familiar sight in the county."},{"url":null,"title":"arkell takes dunaverty golf clubs october medal","story":"Lee Mathieson, first man out, took full advantage of the conditions to record the lowest gross score of the day.He completed the first nine in  strokes which included three birdies and one bogey.Despite having a double bogey at the th and a bogey at the th, two birdies on the way back helped him to  strokes.Donald MacNeil was next best, concluding his round in  strokes, having had two bogies on the front and back nines.James Finlay, out in the sixth group, set a nett target of  for those following him to chase.Match secretary Alex Arkell responded in exemplary fashion by not only posting the third lowest gross score of  but also taking the lead from James with a winning nett .Result:  Alex Arkell -

with  minutes played, after a long-range effort arced beyond Ferguson into his top right-hand corner, after nicking off a Pupils defender.Then, on  minutes, the sixth and final Rossvale goal was scored after Ferguson#s save from a striker#s shot rebounded off the post and into the path of a grateful Rossvale winger, who slotted into the net from point-blank range.Overall, the Pupils can reflect on a respectable cup performance,not a giant-killing, against an established semi-professional outfit, especially with an injury-ravaged squad, as the Kintyre Park club adapts to its busiest fixture schedule in its years in amateur football, with  competitive matches already played by mid-October.Despite the heavy defeat for the Pupils on the field, one notable footnote to the game was the presence of former Tarbert AFC and Pupils player Reverend John McGregor, who is club chaplain for Rossvale, having performed the same role at Dumbarton FC in previous years.After the match, he met and chatted with the Pupils management and the current Pupils squad#s Tarbert contingent, Lewis McNaughton and Rhys Casci.Tomorrow, Saturday, the Pupils are back on league duty, travelling to Paisley to play St Peter#s FC.

out","story":"Campbeltown Pupils were left to rue the loss of another late goal last Saturday after an th-minute strike resigned the Kintyre Park side to a narrow defeat away to St Peter#s.Playing at Renfrew FC#s impressive New Western Park, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils started the match brightly, despite another y injury list which saw several established first-team players ruled out and others unavailable due to work commitments.The Pupils took the lead before the -minute mark when John McCallum, playing at right wing in a --- formation, reacted quickest to Craig Lamont#s long throw-in, which bounced up on the dry synthetic surface, to guide a deft looping header beyond the reach of the St Peter#s keeper.The Kintyre side had efforts from left winger Scott Souden and lone striker Sean Grady go wide of the target – the latter#s promising effort deflected wide of goal – while McCallum was released by Grady and rounded the hosts# keeper only for his cutback to be cleared for a corner, away from the feet of the waiting Souden.At the other end, the Pupils had a new-look combination in defence, with full backs Craig Lamont and Michael McKinlay, and Ross Souden in central defence partnered by -year-old debutant Antonio Akoulli, studying in Scotland and hailing from Thessaloniki, Greece.The four had to be alert to the efforts of St Peter#s wingers Menzies and Lewis on either flank, and did so very well for the opening  minutes until a lapse in concentration saw Scott Lewis – signed from fellow WoSFL side Benburb FC for a transfer fee – ghost along the edge of the box and slot home a fine finish across keeper Alasdair Ferguson with his weaker left foot, into the young keeper’s bottom left-hand corner to make it -.Impressively, the Pupils rebounded from this setback and scored with  minutes played when Liam Renton, playing as an attacking midfielder, latched onto a ball from Scott Souden just inside the hosts# box, and turned his marker sharply before guiding a left-footed shot beyond the keeper#s grasp.All the while, the Pupils# deep-lying midfield pairing – a real contrast of experience levels between skipper Keith Mitchell, and Conner Brown beside him making his club debut – continued to break up play and keep the Feathers Inn-sponsored side moving forward.Despite this, there was a further scare in the visitors# penalty area when St Peter#s hit the bar from a powerful volleyed shot on the stroke of half time, but the Pupils# lead remained intact.Into the second half, though, the Pupils were pegged back in the opening few minutes of proceedings, a clever turn and precise shot beyond the grasp of Ferguson providing a fine equaliser.Admirably from a Pupils point of view, there was no onslaught from the ision#s third-placed team, also boasting a loan signing from Greenock FC, another semi-professional side, in their midfield ranks, and smatterings of semi-pro experience across their starting .However, what followed instead was a gradual build-up of pressure which the Pupils had to work increasingly hard to contain, the home side#s willing forwards continuing to probe for openings in the visitors# defence.The hard-working pair of Matthew Lang and Calum Houston were introduced in attack for the Pupils with  minutes remaining, with fresh legs required as the embattled visitors# energy levels began to wane.But even the dismissal of Lewis for the hosts, hitting out at Renton in reaction to a robust tackle from the latter, which earned the Pupils man a booking, couldn#t deny the Paisley side a late, late winner, a long ball going undefended in the Pupils ranks, and slotted home in the box by a St Peter#s midfielder to give them all three points, and in turn deny the Pupils a probably deserved draw.The Pupils# management team conveyed thanks to the travelling players for their efforts, even in defeat, and will surely take consolation from giving experience to young talent in the side, with four club debuts made in the space of week – after -year-old Andrew Renton#s appearance against Rossvale on cup duty – and within that clutch, a potentially very useful defensive addition.Tomorrow , the Pupils are at home to Glenvale FC, from Paisley, again on league duty, with kick off at pm.For more information, visit @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"leader october 29

budget, including:"},{"url":null,"title":"budget-today-budget-summary-impacts-scotland","story":"It marks the second budget of the year, with the first taking place just seven months ago in March.With devolution, only certain aspects of the budget announcement apply to people in Scotland.When announcements are England specic,Scotlands overall spending budget will increase thanks to something called the Barnett formula.For example, the UK have proposed to spend pound. billion on dealing with the NHS England backlog, so Scotland will get around .% of this figure because Scotlands population is roughly .% of Englands population.Heres a breakdown of how the budget will impact people in Scotland...Yes - minimum and living wages are not devolved so all changes made by the UK government apply to Scotland.It means that from April  ,those on national living wage in Scotland will be paid pound. hour.The national minimum wage will also see rises:The taper rateis amount your benefit payment reduces asyour income increases.Currently p is takenoff your benefit for every extra pound earned after tax, with the rate set at %.In todays announcement, the chancellor confirmed this taper ratewould be reduced to p, a cut of %.This will benefit low-income families where the adults are in work by increasing their overall income.However, it wont impact families who are out of work, who recently faced the pound cut to universal credit which came into force earlier this month.Since benefits are reserved the Westminster and not devolved to Scotland, this taper rate reduction will apply to people in Scotland.English cities will see money invested to improve transport infrastructure.Transport is a devolved matter, however Scotland will get money through the Barnett formula, which is what the UK government uses when they spend more money in England to keep spending more fair.Although Scotland will get money because England are spending more on transport, the Scottish government can do what they please with this money and do not necessarily need to use it for transport.Health is completely devolved, so announcements regarding funding for the NHS refer to NHS England only.However, Scotland will once again get money through the Barnett system, which they could choose to spend on the NHS.For example, during yesterdays Covid update, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed the Scottish government would spend additional money on NHS Scotland.Fuel duty is a tax included in the price ofpetrol, diesel and other fuels used in vehicles or for heating.It is reserved to Westminster, meaning the freeze to the price of fuel duty will apply to Scotland.Foreign affairs are not devolved, so the UK government is in charge of Great Britains border control.This means that thepoundm to protect UK borders, including poundm for a new fleet of patrol boats, will apply to Scotland.According to the UK government, this fund aims to invest in infrastructures which will improve every day le for people across the UK.This pound million allocated to Scotland will back projects in places including Aberdeen and Lewis, Rishi Sunak said in todays announcement.Through the Barnett formula, there will be an increase to Scottish Governmentfunding in each year by pound. billion, according to the chancellor.Yes, alcohol duty is reserved to Westminster, so the announcement that alcohol dutywill increase on stronger alcohols such as fortied wine and higher volume red wines will apply to Scotland.A new lower rate of alcohol duty on draught beers and cider will also apply to Scotland, as willthe cancellation of theplanned increase in duty on spirits like Scotch Whisky, wine, cider and beer - which will come into action from midnight

It could be argued that as one of the cityrsquos leading cultural religious location, that it is one of the few tourist attractions open during the summit.Rev Johnstone said: ldquoWe often respond to lsquosacred spacersquo emotionally, physically and spiritually. Some have said sacred space is founded on serious ground. When we encounter something unexpected in a space we thought could predict we can be startled. We may be more than startled when we encounter James Pfaffrsquos new neon piece within the cathedral. It brings the playful high street nuance of neon and places it in a context more associated with civic pomp. The new work allows the lsquolightrsquo to shine, proclaiming an embrace that can be seen as a spiritual mandate.Mr Johnstone described the installation at light across a dark cavernous space and that the eye is drawn towards as people make their way through the cathedral.The present building was consecrated in . Since that same period, the Cathedral has never been without a roof and worship has been carried out within its walls for more than  years.The Cathedral is the best-preserved example of a large church to have survived from the medieval period in Scotland and it has one of the finest post-war collections of stained-glass windows to be found in Britain.During the COP the cathedral is running a number of events including a vigil on Tuesday, November  led by the Iona Community.

On another occasion an attendant has faced verbal abuse from a member of the public as they were dealing with a blocked toilet. Some cases of vandalism have also included fire damage.“These stories are really disappointing to hear about,” said Kenny MacPherson, OIC’s interim head of property, IT and facilities.“Our dedicated and hard-working staff do a fantastic job of keeping our facilities and waiting rooms clean and safe.”“Orkney is often voted as one of the best places to live and work. We all play a part in keeping the place special – including the unsung heroes in our cleaning team who day in, day out, face up to all kinds of situations with dedication and resolve. The ongoing provision of these facilities is a credit to the county while many in other parts of the country are closed. Vandalism and anti-social behaviour detracts from these achievements.“Be kind.

However, there are a growing number of folk self-isolating, and the community has taken quick action to prevent any further transmission.#I think there has maybe been a few folk that have had positive lateral flow tests — myself included,# Mr Cooper explained.#A similar thing happened maybe back in August, where there was just one confirmed PCR case, and the whole island just closed down for a peedie while.#Mr Cooper has praised the population of around  for the way it has responded during the pandemic to self-isolation — particularly in terms of folk supporting each other when many are unable to leave their homes for essentials.#It#s a small community,# he said.#Everybody just pulls together. If anybody needs something, there is always someone there to help out.#As those who have received a positive lateral flow result now receive PCR testing via the Stronsay surgery, Mr Cooper anticipates that there may be a rise in confirmed cases. He is confident, however, that the community will remain on top of the situation by taking the appropriate self-isolation, social distancing and hygiene precautions advised by the Scottish Government.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I sense every step of that journey.In , Borrodale school closed for that last time. And yet,we listen, we can still hear from Borrodale, forever young and in timeless cèilidh.Put in this kind of context we can sense how community relationships are deeply connected to change. The continuity of change, both backwards and forwards, gives us insight, and proximity with dferent and creative ways of being in place.Times change and culture continues. It is important to be hopeful in this and to not perceive the shadows of the past as a fading le force but as an index pointing to future relationships.The second social experience is of course relates to the typical excitement of guising at Oidhche Shamhna. Originally, Oidhche Shamhna was integral toour sense of place and the cultural relationships of le cycles, including time itself.Oidhche Shamhna is ‘the night of summer’s end,’ and in our older understanding of the festival, it reveals that new le begins in darkness and is born into light similarly, just as days used to begin and end at dusk, the move to the darker half of the year is also the continuation of a cycle and is equally about new beginnings.In the deeper memory of Gaelic cosmology, this is the beginning of the new year, and of course, November is still called ‘an t-Samhain’ in Gàidhlig.My earliest memories of guising would be like those of many, our dad taking my sister and I for a few easy visits to long-standing neighbours and family friends. Even though we would only go to a few houses in those early days, the intensity and excitement of the initiation on a cold dark night was largely experienced through the warmth and kindness revealed in the relationships that emerged in the evening.Guising, then, is a form of cèilidh, where the encouraging and nurturing of the gt of exchange is more intangible than we always appreciate. It is that dimension of sustaining or developing relationships that seems most important to me.One of the first homes we would have visited on my first Oidhche Shamhna will have been that of Angus and Effie Ross in Fàsach. In my early years it was a home that we probably had more time in than any house outside of my family.It was a home I visited everyday day walking home from Borrodale school. My errand was to collect our newspapers from the post office, but it wasn’t a job, it was a relationship.Our family had a strong connection with these Rosses. In , Angus Ross’ great-uncle Alexander Ross had been nominated to deliver the prepared statement for the Fàsach croftersto the Napier Commission.In it he testied specically to the clearance of my great-great-grandfather from Ramasaig , who was removed along with all the families from Ramasaig around -, to make way for sheep, congesting further the land in Fàsach. So, it is from at least that time that our family had been friends.Alexander Ross’s brother, Kenneth Ross, also Fàsach, had among his eight children a first son called Neil and a second called Norman, both being young boys during the land wars....I did know Margaret but I never did met James Ross as he had a fatal accident in the early s in Glasgow, outside the BBC.Angus Ross and Seanair worked together on the County lorry . We saw Angus and Effie a lot and my mum credits him with telling her and her siblings about their Cameron origin story in Glendale.A mysterious tale of a man with long grey hair and a beard living in a cave at Scornandaoine on the east side of Loch Poolteil. He had arrived from Lochaber, in the mid to later s, likely a refugee from any number of social problems in the Gàidhealtachd of that time.Even now it still sounds like a good Halloween story. Certainly, my mum has never been a fan of beards in the family, but we were always welcomed by the Rosses in the ceilidh ethic of everyday relationships., Tobraichean a’ Gluasad .Here, ‘Tuam’ talks about his knowledge of local wells the necessity to move between dferent wells for sustenance, and so there will be times when a well in one place becomes dry while water would be plentul in another well.A resource such as Tobar an Dualchais helps us think about our many and ied relationships with culture, place, and time.Part of the intangible gt to be found within the archives, and also with the people and places around us, is how the wells of culture will be found popping up with all their potential, anywhere and everywhere, carried through the voices and relationships we nurture and come to know.Importantly, this can activate new dialogues, experiences, and gestures of cèilidh, and to embrace these for all in our communities, our futures, wherever the wells emerge."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4172051.jpg--.jpg?1634716497000\n","title":"live practices return for seven towers choir","story":"ON a very pleasant note comes the news this week that Ballymena’s Seven Towers Male Voice Choir has ed for live practice!

A long black dress complete with red lipstick makes this an easy yet classic spooky look. For Gomez, try out your local charity shop and look for a striped suit jacket to pair with black trousers.

We’re grateful for that just in terms of the continuity of the industry, but it’s a very soulless place without the public.“What makes horse racing stand out is that there’s so many dferent tribes of people that come here.“It’s a real myriad of groups of social racegoers, the industry diehards... you name it.

Where there is a genuine attempt to provide information, there is a clear link between the application and the documents provided and a reasonable level of confidence that the person is eligible, they should be veried.”Read MoreNI high street voucher: Over , outstanding applications as Gordon Lyons doesn’t rule out extending schemeCommenting on the dispute was Chief Commissioner of the Equality Commission, Geraldine McGahey.“It goes without saying that all government policy decisions should be taken with the statutory equality duties in mind,” she said. We raised our concerns about the equality impact assessment carried out for this policy in September. We were very disappointed that the screening was not completed at the earliest opportunity in the policy development process and we queried the potential for the screening to actually inform the development or delivery of the High Street Scheme.”She added: “The screening lacked data or information on which to determine impacts across the Section  equality grounds and consequently the assessments that there were no impacts for most of those grounds lacked coherence.A more robust and timely equality assessment would have enabled the Department to thoroughly consider and consult on the potential equality impacts.”She said the scheme appeared to be causing problems for specic groups such as some married women and older people who may not have forms of identication such as a driver’s licence or a valid passport required by the scheme.“There is potential for discrimination against some of these groups who may experience less favourable treatment than others, in this case on grounds of their sex,” she said.“We are writing to the Minister for the Economy today to remind him of the importance of adhering to the Section  duties and asking him to review the deadline set for applying for and using the card to ensure some groups of people are not adversely impacted and left out.“Importantly this situation also highlights the lack of protection for older people who are currently not protected against discrimination in the provision of goods, facilities and services, unlike their counterparts in the rest of the UK and Ireland.”Meanwhile, the Ulster Unionist MLA Andy Allen has called on the Economy Minister Gordon Lyons to extend the period for people to spend their £ vouchers after delays of issuing the cards.“Colleagues and I continue to be contacted by a considerable number of constituents, many of whom applied at the outset of the high street voucher application opening, who have still not received their spend local card,” he said.This is against the backdrop of the thousands of people who were contacted because they could not be veried by the automated process, asking them to provide further evidence. Many of them have been informed it is likely to be a number of weeks before they will receive their card.”Mr Allen said it was now “clearly” the case that the Minister could not guarantee everyone would have four weeks to spend their £ and that it was time to review the end date.Most ReadJohn LavertyOpinionHard man on the pitch, angry, violent man off it... ‘Tweedy’ had a lot of enemiesFamily tributes to former Ulster and Ireland rugby player David Tweed who died in road crashEscape to Craigantlet: Location and lots of space inside and out in heart of Holywood hillsLorry driver who stole a near £, shipment of Jägermeister gets anti-vax lecture from judgeAs flu cases start to arrive in Northern Ireland hospitals, here’s how to tell the dference between it and CovidTop VideosPlayVideo: The moment round-world sailor finds mummied body on drting yachtPlayThe young people fighting for our planet and what they want from COP PlayVisitors hail #amazing#of Down Royal after two yearsLatest Northern IrelandMan arrested as two officers injured in police pursuit in Newry Two officers injured in police pursuit‘Of course, there were bigots and rogues, but some of the most honourable people I met were in the RUC’, says Peter SheridanSinn Fein’s O’Neill accuses DUP of ‘rolling back’ on political agreements‘My children were attacked.

That was incredibly dficult’“I was hopeful that this was the end of all that nonsense and a chance for a new beginning,” he said.Now the CEO of peace-building organisation Co-Operation Ireland, he recalls a meeting with Fr Peadar Livingstone, his careers teacher at St Michael’s College in Enniskillen, that was the start of what would become a  year policing career.“I was going in to talk about hotel management and the Post Office were hiring at the time, I was only , but he talked to me about the police cadets and, back then when the priest spoke, you did as you were told.“At the time, I was following George Best and more into chasing girls from the school up the road, but I applied to the RUC, the Met Police and the Garda. The Met came back and said they weren’t recruiting and I’m still waiting to hear back from the Guards”.His family were concerned for his safety — in , it was almost unheard of for a Catholic from Co Fermanagh to join the RUC — however, his grandmother, who lived with the family, took a dferent view.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “This whole discussion was going on and she said, ‘Well,he’s meant to be shot, he’ll never be drowned’, but strangely it made me think, maybe it’s meant to be and, when I look back, she was right.“When I joined, there was only % of the force Catholic and even among that % I suspect some were Catholic in name only.“When we were on the job, Catholic and Protestant never came into it, but the culture was, of course, very Protestant and there was a risk of losing your identity, I probably pushed against that, because I didn’t want to lose who I was.”Targeted twice by the IRA, on one occasion an attack was thwarted only at the last minute and he was forced to move house.“We didn’t move the second time, because the ceasefire came in, but, yeah, on one occasion they had all my details and the kids’ details.“I remember reflecting on all this when thinking about legacy and what is justice. They can get the guy who was going to put the bomb under the car, the guy who made the bomb, the guy who was hijacking the car, the guy who did the house takeover, but for me all those people are less relevant than the person who was meant to be saying their prayers in church on a Sunday collecting information. Was it a neighbour  Was it someone I knew ”Rising through the ranks, Peter Sheridan was a deputy chief constable when he retired in .“Clearly, I was never discriminated against, because of my promotions, and religion wasn’t the same issue internally as it would have been externally.“Of course, there were scoundrels and bigots and rogues and at times like the Twelfth of July, you were aware you from a dferent community, but in the day-to-day working, some of the most honourable and decent people I met were in the police.”In the run-up to the release of the Patten report, Mr Sheridan said that, internally, there was a realisation that change was coming.“There were people who were more political about it and were concerned at the loss of the RUC at the time, I suspect it wasn’t much dferent from what you’d have found in society.“For me, it was an opportunity to try and take politics out of policing. If you were going to do it and do it quickly, you had to do something dferent and   [recruitment] was part of that.”While Mr Sheridan says Patten was a success, he adds that the failure to deal with legacy is polluting modern policing.“The past acts like a bungee rope — all those younger people who signed up to policing, those legacy investigations pull them right back into that ground, even through it’s ground they never walked on.”Related topicsPolice Service of Northern IrelandMore On Police Service of Northern Ireland‘My children were attacked.

With this result, major landowners must end hunting on their land today.#EndHunting #NationalTrustAGM pic UzfvlpoP— League Against Cruel SportsOctober , The results of the vote are not binding, but the board of trustees is expected to consider the outcome following Saturday’s annual general meeting.Demonstrators from the League Against Cruel Sports gathered outside Harrogate Convention Centre in North Yorkshire as the event was being held, to show their support for the banning proposal.The Hunting Act  banned hunting with dogs.Trail hunting simulates a traditional hunt without foxes being deliberately chased or killed by laying an articial scent for riders.In November last year the National Trust and Forestry England suspended licences for trail hunting on their land in response to a police investigation into webinars involving huntsmen discussing the practice.Saturday’s vote comes just weeks after a prominent huntsman was convicted after giving advice about how to covertly carry out illegal fox hunts.Director of the Masters of Foxhounds Association Mark Hankinson was found guilty at Westminster Magistrates’ Court of intentionally encouraging huntsmen to use legal trail hunting as “a sham and a fiction” for the unlawful chasing and killing of animals via two webinars held in August .The huntsman’s illicit advice was exposed after saboteurs leaked footage to police and the media of the online discussions.He was ordered to pay £,, with the judge concluding that he was “clearly encouraging the mirage of trail laying to act as cover for old fashioned illegal hunting”.During a short debate on the motion, Polly Portwin, representing the Countryside Alliance, said that organisation believes the trust “should not be discriminating” against anyone who “wishes to partake in a lawful activity”.Another attendee, who identied himself as Will from Hampshire, referred to the Hankinson conviction and judge’s remarks.He said: “I think it’s time that the National Trust woke up to the reality of trail hunting.” Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.

It comes as part of the Northern Irelands Executives winter Covid contingency plans. The Executive said there was a need to keep as many sectors open to the fullest possible extent. First Minister, Paul Givan said doing that would depend on as many people as possible getting vaccinated.” googletag.cmd.push Just over % of people aged  and above in Northern Ireland had received one dose of the vaccine. Mr Givan said: Our vaccination rates are very good but there is still room for improvement.” Further Covid restrictions are due to be relaxed by the Executive onOctober . This will allow for nightclubs to reopen, restrictions on indoor dancing lted and the requirement to be seated in hospitality to drink and eat food will no longer be in place. Mr Givan said it was a fact of le that Covid remains an ongoing issue, and that the Executive needed to continue to find ways to manage the situation.     The First Minister says that the Executive will launch a new public information campaign before the end of October to build on the need for all of us to keep making safer choices.

Colin has performed a few small gigs since restrictions were lted and had his first postponed ticketed show atBelfast’s Orchestra Hall earlier this month.This was his first show of the set that was due to go ahead in March  before lockdown began. googletag.cmd.push Murphy said it has been a long time coming: I’m just trying to remember the whole set. Its mad- and you have to write a whole new bit as well because you know, obviously stuff has happened. “It’s weird having a stage again, people, an audience. I didnt do any gigs during lockdown. Other people did, and some people really enjoyed them, but that didn’t really appeal to me, so I just decided to wait. “It was pretty scary going back to live shows. It was like starting all over again, like doing a show for the very first time again, which was good.     “I had an adrenaline rush for about a week.” Colin decided not to gig virtually during lockdown and spent his time on other things: “We did a couple of series of the Blame Game with the virtual zoom audience. I then did a show on RTE as well, that had no audience. “I had the obligatorypodcast that everybody did. Then I was just doing what everyone  was doing, learning skills. I just amused myself. Painting, just doing stuffto pass the time. “It was a foretaste of what retirement will be like, unless you’re under , and then youre never going to be able to retire. That was your year and a half of retirement.” Colin’s new show, Colonisation, toured theatres across Northern Ireland. He had four shows left, including at the Millenium Forum, before lockdown hit. He last performed in the Millenium in : “I was last performing in Derry with the last tour. I was really annoyed this time because this show sold more tickets than Ive ever sold before in the Millennium and then it was pulled. “Thankfullypeople haven’t asked for their money back, so thank you people of Derry. I need to remind people that the gig is on because people were given these tickets for Christmas presents and so on in , they’ll be sitting on a fridge somewhere covered in coffee stains, so its just to remind people as well that it is actually happening.” Colin isn’t making any drastic plans for the next year and beyond, after everything the last  months has thrown at the entertainment business: “I’m doing the ones that Ive got and then I’ll just see what happens after Christmas. “I’m just excited to get back to a live audience. The virtual audiences you know, theyre not the same. Its just not the same. “The whole thing of being in an audience is the collective feeling of people around you and sharing something and even though you are sort of doing that on Zoom, you’re in your own living room. I know some people are a little bit nervous about being in an audience again, but I think, for the shows, theyre taking all the precautions that they can.” Colin said there will be chat of COVID because we’ve all experienced the pandemic, but there will be other content: “Well be messing around and talking to the audience as usual. “My live shows never really have a theme, its always just what’s been going on in the world and my le. Check your emails and your junk box, Derry, the show is happening.

The whole ward of Eglinton and Claudy will be transferred from Foyle much to the chagrin of some. “Having spoken with iniduals impacted by this restructuring it’s clear that many have concerns about the implications and have expressed their desire to remain within the Foyle constituency. “Elected representatives have built a rapport with many of their constituents, particularly in the Eglinton ward and its removal would be a great loss to Foyle. “The Boundary Commission is carrying out a public consultation on these changes, which will be followed by further consultations and public hearings before final recommendations are made in July . “However, the SDLP are currently preparing a response to the initial consultation and are keen to hear the views of Eglinton residents by December . “I would urge anyone impacted to get in touch with any of the SDLP offices and have their voices heard.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Mr Eastwood was speaking ahead of the easing of restrictions in the North on Sunday October . SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon argued for the introduction of vaccine certications at the Executive, but it was opposed by Sinn Feacutein and the DUP. googletag.cmd.push Mr Eastwood said: “The easing of restrictions this weekend has been cause for much excitement. “The public will be happy they can once againto nightclubs and businesses will be rightfully ecstatic to open their doors for the first time in nearly two years. While this is welcome, we cannot ignore the fact that our hospitals are under increasing pressure. “Rarely a day goes by without another horror story about the state our health service is in. This year’s winter pressures have arrived earlier than normal and are affecting services across the board. Our health staff are crying out for help, they know what’s to come.     We are still recording over , new cases of the virus daily and people are dying.“We cannot continue to lt restrictions without mitigations while we are in this situation. Eventually the pressure on our health service will increase and we will be faced with tough decisions. Nobody wants to see another lockdown, it will have a devastating impact on people’s mental health, businesses and their staff. “We have a proven alternative that will allow us to prevent another lockdown while protecting our health service from being overrun – vaccine certications. “The evidence from other jurisdictions is clear – the introduction of vaccine certications encourages vaccine uptake, particularly in younger age groups. Surely this is not too much to ask in the interests of keeping the public, their families and our staff safe. “Our proposals for vaccine certications were blocked at the Executive by Sinn Feacutein and the DUP who instead left the matter in the hands of inidual businesses. This will create confusion and pressure for both businesses and their staff from patrons who may experience dfering rules from one venue to the next.“This decision marks a serious abdication of responsibility and leadership, with the consequences set to play out in our hospitals in the months to come. I hope the impact of this weekend’s reopening will be closely monitored and Sinn Feacutein-DUP ministers will reconsider their decision on vaccine certication before it’s too late.” The Welsh and Scottish Governments have both implemented proof of vaccination in order to enter nightclubs and other large capacity events and venues.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

So, I told the parents who came to me I would bring it up at council.ldquoThe motion will be seconded by Cllr Sean Carrandit is passed, which I have no doubt it will be, it will become the official corporate position of Derry City and Strabane District Council, which will write to the ious bodies named in the motion.ldquoA lot of it is aspirational but it will highlight the issue and bring it out into the public domain. It will also send a message to the parents who contacted me that we are going to push this agenda and try and ensure Year  who want to do A-Level Irish, we will back them. We are also going to write to the Department of Education and the Education Authority, said Cllr Donnelly.RELATEDIrish is being marginalised and its importance downgradedLegislative authorities,governors and principals have to realise Irish language more than a school subjectA Level Irish provision absolute disasterPolicy of undermining Irish - Aontuacute Education spokespersonAnger at lack of Irish A-Level provision in Derry schoolsNo access for Year  students grossly unfairLast month, Bishop of Derry, Most Reverend Dr Doacutenal McKeown, said the purpose of the Area Learning Communities was that pupils who wished to study a subject like Irish should be able to attend classes in a school.He added: ldquoThat comes down to both planning and agreement between the schools in question. Thus,the Foyle Learning Community has not offered that subject co-operation, it would be appropriate to ask them and the governors of schools that are involved, why not. With plenty of fore-knowledge and forward planning, co-operation ought to be possible.Councillor, Emmet Doyle Aontuacute said he did not understand how timetabling could stand in the way of a childs education.In addition, Professor Malachy Oacute Neill, the director of regional engagement at Ulster University, said he would be following the issue up with the chairperson of the Foyle Learning Community Network in order to clary the situation.Reacuteamonn Oacute Ciaraacutein, the director of education with Gael Linn, placed the blame squarely on the legislative authorities, boards of governors and principals.In September, Mr Oacute Ciaraacutein chaired an online discussion on the critical decline in the uptake of Irish in English-medium post primary schools. The discussion was attended by  teachers who felt compelled to seek urgent and decisive action..They called upon the legislative bodies of the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Department of Education and their armrsquosbodies, such as CCEA, as well as the Education Authority, to intercede as matter of urgency to reverse the worrying trends in the study of the Irish language and other languages in English-medium post-primary schools.Aontuacute education spokesperson and representative for East Derry, Gemma Brolly, expressed wholehearted support for Gael Linns position.She added: ldquoWe would also like to reiterate our demand for accessibility to A Level Irish language courses for our young people throughout the North.ldquoAs education spokes- person and a gaeilgeoir myself, I would like to assure Gael Linn and all involved, we stand firmly, shoulder to shoulder with teachers, academics, authors and Irish language activists in their demand for urgent and decisive action to undo the wrongs and commit to the recommendation of studying a modern language at GCSE Level.Cllr Donnelly said his motion would also acknowledge the proud history of Irish language learning in Derry and Strabane, particularly the rich learning experience afforded to generations of post-primary pupils, instilling a love for Irish language and culture in many of our citizens, and widening career opportunities.ldquoThe motion further states:This council recognises the continuous growth in demand for Irish-medium education in this council area and beyond as reflected in the thriving communities in our local Irish-medium pre-schools and primary schools. Council welcomes the creation of new jobs, career opportunities and pathways in and around the Irish language, particularly in the context of forthcoming legislation.ADVERTISEMENT -- -- Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- -- Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- -- Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy.     “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment. “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Cllr Harkin had tabled a motion calling for Council to support retail workers right to receive time off during the Christmas and New Year period. googletag.cmd.push The Foyleside councillor cited a survey conducted by trade union Usdaw that consulted its members across the north of Ireland with a vast majority in favour of such a measure. Cllr Harkin also cited that other trade unions in the north had backed Usdaws demands. Cllr Harkins motion read: “Council notes its concern that many workers in a wide range of dferent sectors are not receiving a decent break from work over the Christmas and New Year holiday period. “Council notes the results of the Christmas and New Year working surveys by Usdaw which show  per cent of respondents from across the North said that they spend too little time at Christmas with family and friends. Christmas Day trading legislation means that nearly all shops do not trade on Christmas Day.     “However, many retail workers report that for them, Christmas is just a day off, not a holiday. Long hours in the run-up to Christmas and shops re-opening early on Boxing Day leaves many retail workers too exhausted and with insufficient time off to enjoy the Christmas holiday. “Council commits to supporting the campaign to allow retail workers to have quality time with family and enjoy the benefit of the break in the way so many of us do rather than use Christmas Day as a day of recuperation. “Council supports Usdaws call, backed by the March  NIC-ICTU Biennial Delegate Conference, for early closure on Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve Closure on Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year’s Day and no loss of pay for retail workers when stores are closed. “Council will write to large retailers in our district area and to the Stormont Executive requesting they support these demands.”  Trade Union Usdaw are campaigning for time off for retail workers in Derry and across the north of Ireland However, Cllr Brian Tierneytabled an amendment saying the motion should encourage dialogue between employers and employees as he had spoken with a number of workers this past week and was told that working the festive period should still be there for them to do. Cllr Tierneys amendment put forward the removal of the last paragraph of Cllr Harkins motion and replace it with: “Council will write to large retailers encouraging them to begin meaningful discussion with their employees around opening times on Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Years Day.” In explaining his reasons for the amendment, Cllr Tierney said: “This motion states a lot of facts but from what I can see from the motion its Usdaws responses from its members across the north of Ireland. It doesnt tell me anything about retail workers from across this city and district. “Theres no doubt that the workers deserve this time off and theres no doubt they have worked hard right throughout the entire year. “But we dont actually knowretail workers across this city and district want these demands met. Ive spoken to retail workers over the last number of days who have told me that they take a benefit for working these particular days over Christmas. “A majority of them are getting double-time because the pay-cycle is so long over December that many people actually budget the double-time they receive for the following January. “By supporting the motion as it is, we could be taking that leline away. We are all for getting good terms and conditions for workers. “But they have to be terms and conditions that those workers want, not what Usdaw wants. We want and encourage employers to speak to their employees and come up with reasonable ways forward.” Cllr Harkin was not happy with what he saw as Cllr Tierney diluting his motion and responded in no uncertain terms his anger at the amendment. He said: “There is no level playing field here. What you have here are big corporations making tremendous amounts of money and not treating their workers properly – be that with low wages, forcing them to work far too many hours and making them work right through the festive period. “I think what the SDLP are saying here is absolute anti- union nonsense.Brianhas talked to a few people in Derry who say I am not sure about this. “The entire trade union movement across the northis backing this demand from Usdaw. Theyve been campaigning for it for years. “Ive talked to lots of workers who tell me all the time that they hate the fact that they have to work right through the Christmas period. “The demand actually makes it clear that workers who are scheduled to work should suffer no loss of pay. Thats a demand we have to take to these corporations. “We have to send a clear message to the bosses that they need to start treating their workers a lot better. “Thisis trying to appease the employers and make it seem like workers are happy to be working at six am on Boxing Day. “This just seems to me that the SDLP are saying that they know better than the entire trade union movement across the north. Usdaws demand has been supported by every trade union in the north of Ireland. “The amendment doesnt have my support as it loses the point.” Cllr Gary Donnellyalso voiced his opposition to the amendment adding: “I had no problem with the motion as it stood until the SDLP tried to ride two horses here by bringing in a half-a-loaf anti- union amendment. And this from a so-called Labour party. Its not even surprising.” The amendment was voted on and the SDLP amendment was passed by  to  – with eight votes from unionist members being pivotal in carrying it through. Despite the amendment being accepted, Cllr Harkin did not withdraw the motion. He said: “This motion can still send a clear message to employers because the demands havent been stripped out by the SDLP and the DUP. They havent stripped out that Usdaw did do a survey on this. “Trade unions are attempting to campaign for a better deal for ordinary people. But its going to be hard and its going to be harder because political parties are not willing to actually stand up to corporations. “They are willing to have a very blaseacute approach to workers rights and I think we have to start being clear that patting people on the back and thanking them for being there during the pandemic just doesnt cut it anymore. “People deserve to see real gains but those gains arent just going to be gted to them. They are going to have to be fought for.” The motion with the amendment was passed unanimously by Council.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.         Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.    The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.    Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound.

Also included are Manus and Majella Martin. uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ue u uc p ue r n ucp ueThe youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O ursquoNeill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from  ulsquoTeenage Kicks ursquo to  ulsquoMy Perfect Cousin ursquo to  ulsquoIt ursquos Going To Happen ursquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O ursquoNeill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThe way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage, urdquo he said.  uldquoWe really have no bad feelings towards him. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. uc p ue r n ucp ueCaroline O ursquoNeill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoHe ursquos going to kill me for saying this, urdquo she said.  uldquoBut he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ue ucstrong ueNot so good-natured abuse uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ueThe laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThere were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street, urdquo admits Damien O ursquoNeill. uc p ue r n ucp ueAnd Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home:  uldquoIt was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn ursquot buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. uc p ue r n ucp uePaul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal ursquos shoes described the documentary as  uldquobrilliant, really enjoyable urdquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueJohn O ursquoNeill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets:  uldquoI think it ursquos great.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound. Manus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. Two versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute ‘short version’ by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board.

The comments were made during a Government press conference on Tuesday October th, after the announcement of the countrysrevised reopening plan, where Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin confirmed all of the restrictions set to ease from Friday,  October and the restrictions that will remain in place. googletag.cmd.push The pandemic isnt over yet. Unfortunately, were going to have to get through at least another winter before we can safely say that its behind us, Varadkar said at the press conference. The situation took a turn for the worse about two or three weeks ago and since then, weve seen rising case numbers, rising hospitalisations and rising ICU numbers.So, were not where we hoped to be or expected to be for  October... were not past the peak of the Delta wave. Later in the press conference, he said the government would be meeting with unions and employer representatives to update the Work Safely Protocol.     Well have that done over the next couple of days and essentially what were saying is that a staggered and phasedto the office is possible, he explained. So, people going back to the office for a specic business purpose, like a meeting or a training, for example, or inductions - that is allowed. But certainly people who can work from home and want to continue to work from home, their employer should facilitate that. But bear in mind, there are also people whove been working from home with a laptop on a bed for  months now and they really want to get back to the office. Andthat can be facilitated,they can be in an office on their own or in an office where theyre socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too. But the fullto offices as we knew them, that will be next spring, added the Taacutenaiste. The announcement from the Taacutenaiste comes days after Deputy Chief Medical OfficerDr. Ronan Glynn advised the public towork from home where possiblethis autumn and winter.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

They lost heavily to the city side at the group stage, finding themselves on the wrong end of a - to - drubbing in between victories over Ballymaguigan and Lissan. googletag.cmd.push In a Halloween date with Steelstown, manager Karl Diamond is expecting to have to quell fireworks in the opposition forward line. “They have four or five marquee forwards, which not a lot of clubs at intermediate level would have,” he said. “You have a real top quality forward line and well find it dficult to hold those boys. We played them last year in the league section. “Theyd only half a team out and they beat us comfortably, and then they beat us again in the league section this year by ,  points. “Itll probably be a step too far, but well give it a rattle.” Diamond can point to a number of dangerous forwards of his own, with Cormac Quigley and Richard King joined by Ruairiacute Hasson and John Butcher. Cormac Quigley will be crucial for Limavady. Full forward focal point Quigley pillaged - against St Marys last time out, with Richard King registering -. Both will be key to the Limavady effort, as the underdogs will need to hurt Steelstown with every opportunity that comes their way. Limavady will be sweating on the fitness of Aaron McGregor and John Butcher as they bid to reach their first intermediate final since , but the vibes are good on Roeside at present. “Its a massive club. With the number of chimney pots around Limavady, it should be punching a lot higher than it actually is,” said Karl Diamond. “There is a nucleus of five or six within the club who are driving it hard. They are as passionate about football in Limavady as they are in Bellaghy, but passion doesnt do it alone. “Were not short of talent, but playing junior football doesnt give you the know-how to play top level games. “It was a big bonus to get out of junior football and hopefully next year well compete better and have the good training of B football. “It [the Faughanvale win] defnitely gave them a lt. Weve worked very hard all year and a lot of things just seemed to click for us on the day. “I suppose the shock was in the result, not from the performance on the day. We totally outplayed Faughanvale and they maybe came into the game taking it for granted a bit. Hugh McGrath “They are a good side and we caught them on the hop, but were well capable of performing at that level and we need to carry on doing so.” Steelstown have experienced the ultimate stage as recently as last year, when Greenlough inflicted the heartbreak of their third final loss. Manager Hugh McGrath has reported a clean bill of health, and said the quarter final win over bogey team Castledawson was a means to an end. “Theyve been a team weve always had an issue getting past. Are we happy with our performance on the day  Absolutely not,” he said. “These things are about getting over the line and getting into the semi final, not about how pretty it is.” Ben McCarron proved vital to their success last time out, hitting -, and led by the experienced Neil Forester, Steelstown weathered a late storm to see them home. McGrath praised his sides resilience in the face of past disappointment. “We have a very good bunch and not a lot fazes them,” he said. “Weve been knocked back before, its never been an issue getting back up and going again. This season has just proven that the guys have a lot of heart and determination to eventually get over the line.” He is wary of the threat posed by their opponents, who he watched dispose of Faughanvale in the semi final. “Its not the semi final we thought we were going to get, but It will be a test for us, and we have to work very hard to end up on the right side of it.” VERDICT: STEELSTOWN CHAMPIONSHIP STATISTICS: ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

And so it proved. St Patricks are back in the last four for the second year running under the tutelage of Bradley and Antrim native Kevin Brady. googletag.cmd.push The Loughshore side have hit an impressive  goals in championship football, winning all but one game a group clash with Dungiven. Joint manager Kevin Brady says the scores are a sign of the players footballing intelligence. “The boys have taken the goals well and the boys themselves on the field sense when a goal opportunity is on,” he said. “We have quite smart players in that regard, and so far, they have executed them well. They will probably be fewer and farther between in terms of the chances that Glen will give us. “Weve unearthed another couple of players, not necessarily young players, but guys who are early to mid-s who might not have been making the senior team previously.     Loup manager Paddy Bradley. “Theyve taken their chance. Some players have seen that was the case last year and a few other fellas have stepped up and staked their claim for a place.” That progress will be needed as they prepare to take on Watty Grahams. The  finalists misfired in last years championship, exiting to fierce rivals and eventual winners Slaughtneil at the quarter final stage. Glen have set about righting that wrong with a vengeance and showed their intent in appointing Malachy ORourke as manager. They have amassed a - championship haul over five games, with goals from Paul Gunning and Conleth McGuckian easing them past Swatragh in this years quarter final. It is a side sprinkled with talent and the mercurial Conor Glass and Ciaran McFaul at its heart, and the conveyor belt has created a cohesive blend of youth and experience. Terence OBriens renaissance has had a big impact for Loup, and the big midfielder fired home a goal in the win over Bellaghy. Midfield partner Paddy Coney also chipped in with a goal in that game, and the ever-present trio of Anthony ONeill, Ciaran Devlin and Caolan Devlin are a handful for any defence. Defensively, the lads from the Glenshane have the edge, conceding -to Loups -throughout the championship, but the figures suggest it could be an open game. Malachy ORourke is in charge of Glen. Kevin Brady says thats not necessarily the case. “Hopefully it will be an entertaining game from a neutral point of view,” he said. “Glen certainly put you under a lot of pressure. You dont really get any time to catch your breath, so I expect it to be high intensity. “Its sometimes hard to know. A goal going in at some point can make the other team come out and play. “Hopefully the disappointment of last year will spur our boys on to go one step further and make the final this year.” The bookies will certainly favour Glen, but Loups traditionally attack-minded managerial duo will be relishing a chance to lock horns with Malachy ORourke in the heat of championship battle. The Owenbeg pitch is in better condition than it has been in previous years, and will help create firm enough underfoot conditions for both these sides to serve up an entertaining battle. Loup have managed an average of three goals per game, and this game could well all come down to how well Loup manage to balance the guages of risk and reward on Sunday evening.

Greyhound racing willto the venue, which has been closed since August , under its new owners, The Lford Greyhound Racing Club . Contracts were signed this week and Derry Now understands that a date of March ,  has been pencilled in for theof racing at the border venue. The news is welcomed not just by sporting enthusiasts in the area, but the venues impending reopening also serves as a signicant employment boost. googletag.cmd.push In June, Greyhound Racing Irelandapproved Lford’s application for a licence. A signicant investment into the stadium reopening came from the UK Tote Group, who will also operate at the stadium. The new owners are made up of a group of businessmen from England and Ireland with greyhound enthusiast Harry Findlay said to be the driving force.  Earlier this year, it emerged that Paul Lawrence, the former Crayford racing manager, and Lorraine Sams, an ex-GB Greyhound Board stipendiary steward, were to head up the management team having agreed terms with the consortium, who purchased the stadium from the Duffy family. The Stadium, which underwent a €million refurbishment in , was put up for sale in , tagged with a €.million price. In August , the traps were closed for the last time, the owners citing a lack of support from the sport’s hierarchy. Lford Stadium was first opened in  and the . acre site includes a -seater restaurant overlooking the track. The  Indecon Report, which identied Lford among the tracks for closure, said: ‘An important point to note is that there may be opportunities for inidual stadia to continue to operate without IGB prize money or with lower fundingthey can generate resources from sponsorship, fundraising or local support, or sufficiently reduce costs.’ The new owners have already confirmed that they will be in a position to operate without a reliance on government funding.

Greyhound racing willto the venue, which has been closed since August , under its new owners, The Lford Greyhound Racing Club . Contracts were signed this week and Derry Now understands that a date of March ,  has been pencilled in for theof racing at the border venue. The news is welcomed not just by sporting enthusiasts in the area, but the venues impending reopening also serves as a signicant employment boost. googletag.cmd.push In June, Greyhound Racing Irelandapproved Lford’s application for a licence. A signicant investment into the stadium reopening came from the UK Tote Group, who will also operate at the stadium. The new owners are made up of a group of businessmen from England and Ireland with greyhound enthusiast Harry Findlay said to be the driving force.  Earlier this year, it emerged that Paul Lawrence, the former Crayford racing manager, and Lorraine Sams, an ex-GB Greyhound Board stipendiary steward, were to head up the management team having agreed terms with the consortium, who purchased the stadium from the Duffy family.     The Stadium, which underwent a €million refurbishment in , was put up for sale in , tagged with a €.million price. In August , the traps were closed for the last time, the owners citing a lack of support from the sport’s hierarchy. Lford Stadium was first opened in  and the . acre site includes a -seater restaurant overlooking the track. The  Indecon Report, which identied Lford among the tracks for closure, said: ‘An important point to note is that there may be opportunities for inidual stadia to continue to operate without IGB prize money or with lower fundingthey can generate resources from sponsorship, fundraising or local support, or sufficiently reduce costs.’ The new owners have already confirmed that they will be in a position to operate without a reliance on government funding.

It looked asPromise Omochere’s second half goal would be enough for Bohs, until Boyce struck with his th goal of the campaign to save the hosts. Bohs shocked Derry by taking the lead less than five minutes into the second half. A ball forward saw Eoin Toal and Promise Omochere battle for possession, and the striker emerged with the ball before shooting low past Gartside and into the net from  yards. googletag.cmd.push It should have been game over for Derry  minutes from time when Gartside completely messed up a routine clearance, and Ali Coote set up Ross Tierney for a tap in, only for an incredible clearance from Eoin Toal to deny Bohs a second goal. Derry responded well to that scare and came so close to equalising. A long throw into the area by Will Fitzgerald was flicked on by Toal, and it came to Junior who volleyed the ball past Talbot but the ball hit the underside of the crossbar and somehow stayed out. It looked asDerry were out of luck, but deep into added time, James Akintunde’s cross went all the way to the back post where Boyce was on hand to bundle the ball over the line to save what could be a huge point for Ruaidhri Higgins’ team.  Teams DERRY CITY: Nathan Gartside, Ciaran Coll , Cameron McJannett, Danny Lafferty , Eoin Toal, Ronan Boyce, Ciaron Harkin , Joe Thomson, Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe, James Akintunde, Jamie McGonigle.

It looked asPromise Omochere’s second half goal would be enough for Bohs, until Boyce struck with his th goal of the campaign to save the hosts. Bohs shocked Derry by taking the lead less than five minutes into the second half. A ball forward saw Eoin Toal and Promise Omochere battle for possession, and the striker emerged with the ball before shooting low past Gartside and into the net from  yards. googletag.cmd.push It should have been game over for Derry  minutes from time when Gartside completely messed up a routine clearance, and Ali Coote set up Ross Tierney for a tap in, only for an incredible clearance from Eoin Toal to deny Bohs a second goal. Derry responded well to that scare and came so close to equalising. A long throw into the area by Will Fitzgerald was flicked on by Toal, and it came to Junior who volleyed the ball past Talbot but the ball hit the underside of the crossbar and somehow stayed out. It looked asDerry were out of luck, but deep into added time, James Akintunde’s cross went all the way to the back post where Boyce was on hand to bundle the ball over the line to save what could be a huge point for Ruaidhri Higgins’ team.      Teams DERRY CITY: Nathan Gartside, Ciaran Coll , Cameron McJannett, Danny Lafferty , Eoin Toal, Ronan Boyce, Ciaron Harkin , Joe Thomson, Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe, James Akintunde, Jamie McGonigle.

The replica kits were brilliant even though the shorts were a wee bit too long for my liking, said Tollymore club chairman Adrian Howard.ldquoOur guys really got into the spirit of things with the  moustaches and at one point I thought history was repeating itself with the teams locked at -. But it wasnrsquot to be with the English boys winning -.After such a wet and dismal start to last week, Donard Park was bathed in sunshine for the match and despite all the best laid plans, the England team was delayed on route from the airport.However, this gave Mr Lewis the opportunity to meet some volunteer coaches and officials from the Tollymore club. He chatted to coaches Simon Thornton and Dr Gavin Devlin about their involvement with the club and volunteering in general.Mr Lewis also met Seamus Heath and Mark Hughes, from the NI Veterans team who were involved in organising the fixture.The project is one of  funded through the Shared History Fund which supports groups to mark the Centenary, in a thoughtful, inclusive and engaging way.The Tollymore Club has been working on its project since October last year and was very pleased to hear that it had been awarded funding to deliver the project and to date the ious events have been extremely well received.ldquoI would like to thank everyone for taking part and making this part of our project such a success, in particular, the guests for attending and Rob Manley of the Anchor Bar for providing gts for the Secretary of State, council chairwoman Cathy Mason and Darren Rice from Heritage Lottery NI, said Adrian.The Tollymore club presented a number of gts to the Secretary of State including a framed print of Newcastle, circa , provided by Mr Ivor Anderson. He also received a replica  England top and The Friend at Hand Irish Whiskey presentation box.Gts of The Friend at Hand Irish Whiskey were also made to the council chairwoman and Mr Darren Rice.Also in attendance at the event was South Down MLA Jim Wells, a huge Northern Football fan and regular attender at the teamrsquos home fixtures.The latest football match starring the veterans is a testament to how far the teams have developed over the past few years.Formed almost  years ago after Tollymore United organised a long running five-a-side football programme, the NI Veterans encourage men that had stopped playing regular football to get back playing.The veterans believe that age should not be a barrier to playing football and that there are incalculable health benefits, both physical and mental, to keeping active.Players ages range from rsquos through to rsquos with teams at over rsquos, over rsquos, over rsquos and over rsquos age groups.Every year the NI Veterans take part in a home internationals tournament with their English, Scottish and Welsh counterparts and travel to venues across the UK, with the home internationals played in a dferent country each year.Players meet their own travel and accommodation costs with Tollymore United offering their pitch for home fixtures and the Anchor Bar providing visiting teams with food and refreshments.Veteranrsquos football is huge in England and Wales with organised leagues and dozens of teams. It is also becoming increasingly popular in Europe with the NI Veterans having played European opposition.Last Fridayrsquos football match was the third of four events that the Tollymore club is delivering as part of their project.The first part of the project was a talk on the events leading up to lsquoThe Partition of Irelandrsquo with leading historian Dr Cormac Moore and took place in July.

In my opinion this does not appear to be consistent with the regulations which clearly suggest mph was more appropriate, but it is still a positive result after many years of campaigning.ldquoRoad Service Officials confirmed to me last January that the mph limit would be introduced this year and we have all been tenterhooks waiting delivery day.

It didnrsquot even rain on the day. All in all, it was a good way to start the season.The event included a full programme of junior racing so the atmosphere was buzzing by the time the seniors arrived at the Billy Neill playing fields in Comber.As the last junior race finished, the senior women swarmed to the start area. East Down AC was out in force with  females on the start list plus Wayne Giles by virtue of being in the Male  plus age group was in the same race.The runners were herded into pens to await the whistle and in fact when the race started two minutes early, some of the team were nearly caught on the hop as they were facing the wrong way getting their photo taken.Off they went at a pace across the level grass of the pitches stretching out quickly from a pack to a winding snake of coloured vests.They then turned sharply to get on to the hilliest section for the first time.This part is a gradual but leg sapping climb with the odd flatter bit for respite.Even after reaching the top, there are a few lumpy bits before a welcome downhill section. The runners then have a road crossing to contend with before sweeping round to the next loop.For women and male plus, it was three laps to make the k which meant three chances to try dfering techniques on the hill.At the end of the last lap there was an added cruel twist - a steep uphill to the finish which seemed primarily to be for the entertainment of spectators.It required huge reserves to push to the very end but the cheering onlookers provided the much needed encouragement with gusto.Caroline MacNabb led the team in with a gutsy run. She went out strongly and kept pushing to keep in contention. This earned her eighth overall in . and should encourage her that her consistent training is paying off.Catherine OrsquoConnor not far behind was forced to work hard for her tenth place coming home in  minutes exactly. This placed her first in her age category.Further back the rest of the team were all putting in the hard yards and finished in the following order: Sharon Madine , Wendy Findlay , Maureen Kelly and Janine Murray, who spent the entire race neck and neck, crossed the line together in ., Roisin Gaffney , Alison Carroll , Shauna McGreevyand Rachel Madine .Wayne Giles smiling as always placed nine  veteran men.The women had no time to relax as they took on the supporting role to pay back the shouts given by the EDAC men earlier. The men had an even bigger team.This level of participation is a sign of the numbers currently attending training. The club has definitely bounced back post Covid- and the enthusiasm to race is ing.Neil McCartan was out to show that his recent speedy . for K was no fluke so he was gunning for action.He along with a bunch of sharp shooters came out of the pens at a rate of knots, fighting to get away from the melee and make sure that they were not impeded in any way.Aaron McGrady also close to the front at the start was determined not to get sucked into a chase situation but found it hard to stay controlled when he saw the way the pack was breaking up.Neil ended up having to run solo as the top three were hammering on but to his credit he stayed solid and claimed a worthy fth place finishing in . for K.Aaron settled as per plan and worked his way through the field each lap ending up ninth overall .Gordy Graham wasnrsquot a fan of cross country before and hadnrsquot changed his opinion after but still managed to come th in ..The rest of the team streamed in not far behind.Neil Curran , Conaill MacNabb , Martin Willcox , Jonny Holmes , Barrie Atkinson , Dee Murray , Mark OrsquoConnor , Eamon Holmes , Seamus Savageand John Taylor .Cross country is definitely a dferent kettle of fish from a road race and many found that the iation in terrain made for an interesting outing while others found it an extremely hard session.The truth is that cross country is the most valuable way to pass the winter as it adds strength and stamina and the camaraderie almost makes up for the pain.Hopefully the turnout at Ballyclare in a couple of weeks time will show that that our members have been convinced of the merits.Declan Teague is continuing to push himself by completing multiple marathons in a short time frame.This weekend he headed to Kildare for his third crack at the . miles in five weeks. EDAC was well represented as Phillip Vint, completing his th marathon, and Dermot Cahill were also on the start list for the Thoroughbred Autumn Marathon.They had taken part in this event before but on a two lap route. This time it was one lap which was ldquotough enough according to Declan.He described it as rolling countryside and said that it felt like there was more up than down, with a bit of a headwind for good measure.On a positive note there were many plus points such as welcome sunshine and blue skies, plenty of support along the road, a great t-shirt and medal and best of all chicken curry at the finish.No wonder they recommend this race. All three men were pleased with their run. Declan set himself a target of : and worked hard up to  miles to give himself a cushion for the inevitable slowing after miles.His strategy worked well as he completed in three hours  minutes. Phillip Vint ran a commendable three hours  showing no repercussions from his recent efforts in the London Marathon and Dermot Cahill was pleased to lead the trio home in three hours .They were th, th and st respectively out of the  entries. A great showing on behalf of the club.Sam Anderson headed for Shanersquos Castle for the Championship Half Marathon to make the most of the long miles of training that she has put in for the recent Belfast full marathon.She might also have thought that she was escaping the mud of the cross country as the two events coincided.She was wrong though as overnight rain had left the estate very mucky and their mud was mixed with manure so it was a very smelly, sludgy . miles for Sam.With her usual stoicism, she coped with the adversity and came home smiling in two hours .On Sunday, the junior cross-country season got off with a bang at Billy Neill playing fields in Comber.It was the NI and Ulster Even Age Group Championships and there was a massive entry at all ages. Memories of the horrendous weather the last time it was hosted two years ago were still fresh in everyonersquos minds but it couldnrsquot have been more dferent.The sun shone, the wind was light and the ground was dry even though it had poured the night before.The East Down AC junior entry list was depleted over the days beforehand for a number of reasons but in the end the club had eight runners in five races.The runners were in age categories U-, U-, U-, U- and U- based on their age before the end of December .Luke Napier was first up running in the U- boys racewith his sister Cara running in the U- girls racejust after.Cara was also the clubrsquos only female junior running. This was their first race at this level and although they found the pace tough going they really enjoyed it and were excited to be part of an Ulster race with runners from all parts.Luke came nd out of  runners, the biggest junior field on the day, and Cara came th out of  runners.Alex Robinson, Finn Gibney and Freddie Ferguson were next with ,m in the U- boysrsquo race. As always the start was a mad stampede.As with the Napiers, Alex and Freddie were young in their category and it was Freddiersquos first race of this scale.At the finish Alex said he went off too hard but despite this he managed to come th out of  runners. Finn came th and Freddie st.As the runners get older the distance increases and so it was a tough ,m which faced the U- boys.Jacob Crawford and Oliver Robinson have been training hard over the last few months under the watchful eye of their coaches and race tactics were much discussed before the race.Ollie likes to lead from the front but was given strong advice to sit with the pack. He wasnrsquot surethat helped when he got hemmed in on the first shorter lap of the course in the big leading bunch.Jacob was wisely sat close to Ollie but managed to stay out of trouble. The U- race was the first to include a bigger lap which started with a long uphill section.Thankfully the wind was behind them for part of the lap as it had picked up a bit. This was Jacobrsquos first XC race for EDAC and he did the club proud coming th out of  runners.Ollie was just behind in th place with a sprint finish after struggling with a stitch for over half of the race. Last up for the juniors was MacKenzie Murray in the ,m U- boys race.He stayed resolute with the tough competition and came rd out of  runners. The standard at the age groups is high so all the EDAC Juniors should be proud of how they performed.As well as medals and podiums on the day, runners are seeking qualication for the All-Irelands either as an inidual or via slots based on the placing of their club or county.It is fantastic that as a result of their efforts that Alex Robinson and Finn Gibney , Jacob Crawford and Ollie Robinsonand Mackenzie Murrayhave all qualied to run for the County Down team in Santry Dublin on November .This All-Ireland event will literally take them to another level and is an exciting achievement.

work to repair Shrigley clock  ","story":"FRESH appeals have been issued for the restoration of the historic Shrigley clock, with Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey urged to step in to help put the tick back in the ageing structure.Owned by the Housing Executive, the Martin Memorial clock dates back to the Victorian era, with ious calls made over many decades for it to be restored to its former glory.The latest politicians to throw their weight behind the campaign are Strangford MLAs Michelle McIlveen and Harry Harvey who, in addition to raising the issue with Ms Hargey, have contacted Housing Executive chief executive Grainia Long.The housing body is responsible for the clock which had its bell and interior mechanism removed over three decades ago and placed in storage.Many are concerned to see the historic landmark falling into disrepair, but hopeful that it can be restored to be enjoyed for generations to come to reinforce its connection with the villagersquos industrial past.Shrigley was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.It was powered by water supplied from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill mdash which is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash has long gone, the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Ms McIlveen mdash who is also the current Stormont education minister mdash said the clock which enjoys protected status and is one of the last remaining pieces of Victorian architecture in the village.She said while full restoration could be very expensive, there is a need to focus on what can be done in the interim to prevent further deterioration of the clock.ldquoIt is unacceptable that an old clock of this signicance and splendour should be allowed to fall into such a sad state of repair, she declared.Ms McIlveen said that previously, funding was provided for a conservation management plan by the Department for Communities Historic Environment Division which was developed on behalf of the Follies Trust.She said the report found that it would cost almost pound, to fully restore the Shrigley clock tower, a cost which the Housing Executive was unwilling to meet.Ms McIlveen and Mr Harvey said they have written to the housing body to not only highlight its public responsibility to maintain this listed property in its possession, but stressed the importance of the monument to the people of Shrigley:ldquoMonuments such as these are an important snapshot of our history and part of the fabric of our built heritage which should be cherished and protected said Ms McIlveen.ldquoWe have asked chief executive Grainia Long to outline what measures can be put in place ahead of a full restoration of the clock.The MLAs added: ldquoWhile I appreciate that full renovation works might be extremely expensive, it is very important that further deterioration of the monument does not occur.In a response to the Strangford Assembly members, Ms Long confirmed the clock is owned by the Housing Executive and sits on land transferred to it in the early s by the local council.She continued: ldquoThe condition of the monument has been raised with us and other agencies on a number of occasions and I can assure you that I appreciate the interest in our plans for it. ldquoHowever, while we have recently undertaken minor works to de-weed the monument and address any potential health and safety issues, it is our position that, at a time at which we have a signicant funding shortfall for investment in our tenantsrsquo homes, it would not be appropriate to use income derived from rents to fund the considerable costs that would be required to undertake a full restoration.The Housing Executive chief executive said that over the years, the organisation has explored options with others to secure the restoration and long-term sustainability of the monument but that these had proved unsuccessful.However, Ms Long said the Executive remains open to speaking to any interested parties and looking at any proposals.She added: ldquoThe establishment of a trust or the monumentrsquos disposal to, for example, a heritage organisation appear to be the best long-term courses of action and we would be happy to discuss these again with Newry, Mourne and Council and others..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27October2021_vandals.jpg","title":"Vandals target special school  ","story":"A SPECIAL

at Knockevin Senior School which recently opened at the site of the former Castlewellan Primary at Mill Hill.Following one recent incident, staff were forced to close the school.Attempts have been made to strip lead from the roof of the building and, more worryingly, drug paraphernalia has been found in the school grounds and in the vicinity of St Paulrsquos Church of Ireland church which is next door.Underage drinking in the school grounds has also been reported, while electrics and a satellite dish have also been damaged, with staff concerned about the risk the ongoing trouble poses to vulnerable students.Police have been asked to increase patrols and it has been confirmed that additional security measures are to be implemented, with politicians hoping that there are no further incidents during the Halloween holiday.The elected representatives, who have been liaising with Education Authority outreach workers and the anti-social behaviour committee attached to the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership , have called for the Castlewellan trouble to end.They have warned that Halloween must not be used by troublemakers as an opportunity to step up their anti-social behaviour, appealing to those involved in recent incidents to show more respect to education and church properties.Slieve Croob councillors Alan Lewis, Roiacutesiacuten Howell and Cathy Mason mdash who have appealed to anyone who knows those involved in anti-social behaviour to contact police mdash say the trouble must stop.Cllr Lewis, the current PCSP chairman, has appealed to young people to stay away from Knockevin school and the nearby church. He said teenagers who are not a ldquopositive part of the Castlewellan community should remain at home.He visited the school last week where a Halloween party was in full swing and revealed he was disappointed to learn of further incidents of anti-social behaviour.ldquoOnce again, youths had entered the school grounds, climbed on the roof and attempted to remove led, with drug paraphernalia and empty medication packets also found, confirmed Cllr Lewis.ldquoMembers of St Paulrsquos Church leaving a service found empty pill boxes littering the area outside. The fact that a service was taking place did not put these people off and the mentality and lack of respect which is being shown is shocking beyond reason.Cllr Lewis said empty packets of Pregabalin are routinely found at the school and church and warned those who consume them are potentially at risk from blackouts or death.He added: ldquoThere is a fear that over Halloween that the anti-social behaviour will intensy and we hope that does not happen. I will be working with local council staff, police, youth workers and colleagues to ensure the Halloween period is quiet and appeal for a no-nonsense approach to this issue.Cllr Howell she and Cllr Mason recently visited the new school to welcome staff, pupils and parents to the Castlewellan community.ldquoI was deeply disappointed when contacted by the school last week to learn about the anti-social behaviour taking place in the grounds. In one incident, vandalism caused to the property led to the closure of the building, she confirmed.ldquoI am disappointed and frustrated that a small number of youths are causing these issues to a special school. I know first-hand the work and commitment that is put in to delivering the curriculum to the Knockevin children.Confirming that she and her colleague have raised these issues with the PSNI and asked for increased patrols in the vicinity of the school, Cllr Howell said she has also been liaising with Education Authority outreach workers and the PCSP to ensure everything possible is being done to alleviate the ongoing trouble.ldquoNo school should have to face these issues and I would ask for the wider community to be vigilant and report any activity of this nature to police as soon as they become aware of it, she added.Describing the Castlewellan trouble as ldquocompletely unacceptable, Cllr Mason said it will not be tolerated by the community in Castlewellan which is a safe and pleasant place to live.She added: ldquoThe management of the school have reported incidents such as underage drinking, damage to electrics and a satellite dish and roof tiles being broken, along with drug paraphernalia being left on the ground and a multitude of rubbish.ldquoStaff are understandably concerned about the potential risk to pupilsthey were to find any of these items, as well as the potential risk to the youths themselves on top of a school building..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27October2021_hinch.jpg","title":"Victory for ‘Hinch men  ","story":"THIS Intermediate League game started at a fast pace, with both teams wanting to retain possession.Although CI got the ball into the Hinch , the home side showed some great defending and quickly cleared the danger.Hinch continued to display some skilful hockey passing the ball around the back from Andrew Mulholland, Ray Coffey to either Ashley Brown or Craig Harkness on the wings.This enabled Hinch to tactically move the ball up the pitch, allowing Matthew Martin to have a shot on goal.Unfortunately, it went wide hitting the side of the goal while, at the other end, Aaron Donnell was on form in nets, saving any balls getting through the strong defence.During play, Coffey was able to find the back of the net, unfortunately he was just slightly outside the CI circle.The second quarter began with the Hinch men in defensive mode and able to keep the ball out of the net.As time progressed, they settled into the game and pushing the ball up the pitch towards Martin and Adam Dodds while there was some great passing across the back from Mulholland to Harkness across to Brown.The latter was able to work the ball up the pitch, passing to Jason Campbell who saw the opportunity to knit the ball across the CI goal, to be tapped in by the prolic Alex Millar.Quarter three began with Hinch gaining the first of several penalty corners, although were unable to break though the CI defence. aEnd to end play continued with each team determined to score.

It was a damp quib. The organisers appear to have been more concerned to avoid offending nationalists than to offer anything positiveHow refreshing it was to read Ben Lowry’s critique of the centenary service in Armagh and the wider programme of events — a rare articulation of a unionist perspective on the subject Northern Ireland, ’ October , see link below. What a damp squib the centenary has been as the organisers appear to have been more concerned to avoid offending nationalists than to offer anything bold or positive. Of course it was never going to be possible to avoid offending nationalism, which likes nothing better than an opportunity to wallow in historical grievances and has seized on the centenary as an opportunity to tell us all about the ‘great wrong’ of ‘partition’ and how it is the source of all our problems.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Does unionism today really lack the confidence publicly to defend, never mind celebrate Northern Ireland and to challenge the nationalist view  Why hasn’t the centenary been used to remind people that ‘partition’ was not an imposition on nationalists by unionists, but a compromise between nationalism and unionism  One hundred years ago there were two equally valid and equally determined assertions of self-determination: granting independence to nationalist-majority Ireland and allowing unionist-majority Ireland to remain in the UK was the obvious and most reasonable solution that satisfied a majority of both peoples.The nationalists’ ‘solution’ was for their self-determination entirely to override that of unionists: a victory rather than a compromise. That would have been the great wrong. Where is the unionist articulation of this narrative  Where is the appreciation that Northern Ireland facilitated generations of British people on this island to remain as citizens of the United Kingdom, and to continue to play a role and contribute to the le of the UK, not least in our contribution to the war against Nazism  Where is the reminder that — until the s— people in Northern Ireland enjoyed higher living standards than those in the Republic, greater access to secondary and tertiary education, better public services, and were spared the oppressive censorship and social conservatism of the South  Where is the celebration of the successful determination of a proud people to retain their membership of the UK and withstand the attempt to coerce them into another state against their clear will  J.

It was just the blackest black I’d ever seen.“At exactly the same moment two things happened. One was I could hear in my ears what I could only describe as very, very loud white noise and also there was a very, very strong sense of pure distilled evil coming from this figure.”“It felt like a force of nature, everything that is good, everything that is called hope had disappeared, so there’s just complete and utter dispair.”Ken went on to give other examples of unexplained phenomenon during his time on the sixth floor of Alanbrooke Hall, which is now demolished.Presenter Danny Robins gave an interview to BBC Radio Ulster following the success of the first episode of his podcast.He said: “It’s an index of how strange he finds this experience that he wanted to talk about it and for Ken, he wants answers, he wants people to come forward,people lived in Room  did they have similar experiences “Already, since this went out last week, we’ve had people coming forward with other experiences.”• BBC Radio ’s Uncanny is available on BBC Sounds with new episodes added weekly.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

What’s it been like working with her “It’s completely dferent,” says Riley. “We used to all be in the same room together but because of coronavirus everyone’s off separately having their make-up done so we don’t see each other as much. We’ve not really done much team bonding.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Rachel with her now husband Pasha Kovalev during rehearsals for Strictly Come Dancing in “Obviously, we had  years with Nickand we really knew each other. Sheis a completely dferent character.”For now, the -year-old maths whizz is understandably much more focused on motherhood. Her Russian husband Pasha Kovalev, erstwhile dance partner from Strictly in , has been fantastic with their toddler daughter, Maven, who turns two in December.“He’s the best dad in the world,” Riley beams. “He’s amazingly patient and will let me sleep in in the morning and look after her when I’ve been up working late.“He’s taken to being a dad like a duck to water. And Maven looks just like him. He goes to the soft play, the bouncy castle and the park – then I get home and he’s made dinner!”Rachel Riley has decided to remind us all how to ide and conquer once more, mostly by mastering long ision, fractions and alegbraThe presenter started dating Kovalev after orcing her husband, Jamie Gilbert, who was a fellow Oxford University student, in .Today, she is clearly still besotted with her professional dancer other half. “He’s the most unique person I’ve ever met. He’s such a chilled, calming influence. Nothing fazes him.”She’s planning to have her second baby at homeand isn’t intending on going on a massive drive toto her pre-pregnancy weight quickly.“I’ll be breastfeeding, so you need the calories. If you are losing it really quickly it just means you are probably not giving your baby what it needs. The weight comes off in its own time and I’ve got a whole range of dresses ready in dferent sizes for when I go back to work.”She’s still breastfeeding Maven, although she hopes that will subside in the New Year, and hopes to be back at work in January, she says.“When you have a newborn, and especially when you have a toddler as well, you don’t have time for a shower. So when I get back to work someone will be paid to do my hair and make-up. You don’t recognise yourself the first time you go back because you’ve just been in mum mode and haven’t washed your hair for a while.”She and her family live in London and also have an apartment in Manchester, where Countdown is filmed. Kovalev will look after the children while Riley is working on the show, taking the baby in for breastfeeding when she’s on a break.They don’t want any more children after the new baby, she says.“We only want two. You can fit two in the car, that kind of stuff. It was a maths decision,” she says, laughing.They married in Las Vegas in  when she was pregnant with Maven, she recalls.“My friend was taking a sabbatical in the States. She said she was going to Vegas and askedI wanted to come to see Robbie Williams. We said, great. Then, when I was four months pregnant, just before the trip, Pasha said, ‘Shall we get married next week ’ We found a little chapel and I bought my dress the day before the wedding.”This year Riley has written At Sixes And Sevens, a maths book for adults, featuring tips and tricks on how to navigate your way through the minefield of equations, formulas, fractions, algebra and BODMAS , among other conundrums.“I’ve always enjoyed making maths accessible and trying to demysty it, even when I was at school,” she says.Her acumen is clearly rubbing off. “My daughter has already started counting on her hands, one, two, three,” she enthuses. “And she can do it in Russian as well.”Riley, who grew up in Essex, studied maths at Oxford University and clinched the Countdown job pretty soon afterwards. As a top maths scholar, did she ever feel her brain could be better utilised than it is on a popular show “I enjoy what I do,” she says simply. “Being on TV has afforded me lots of opportunities and I’m lucky I get to use my maths background as an advocate for maths and science and numeracy.“Through programmes like It’s Not Rocket Science I get to meet people who want to break the land speed record with the fastest car in the world, I got to interview Tim Peake. I’ve got the background to give me enough confidence to interview these people.”For now though, she is having to take things a bit easier. While knowing that sleep deprivation is coming with the new arrival, she is trying to enjoy her Friday night treat – episodes of Ted Lasso, supporting Manchester Utd , going to the park and meeting friends and family.Riley and Kovalev don’t watch Strictly these days, but do keep in touch with some of her old Strictly cohorts, Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Deborah Meaden, and a while ago they went to Majorca to see Brendan Cole and his family.And though she might feel tired right now, Riley is also planning an energetic future for when she is ready: “Once I’m back on my feet, I’ll be ready for a new challenge,” she says.Thanks to Rachel you can master long ision and fractions once moreOn Countdown, Rachel famously replaced the long-serving fellow maths wizard Carol Vorderman. Like Vorderman, Riley’s role is to handle the placement of tiles on the board for the letters and numbers rounds and to find an exact solution in the numbers roundsthe contestants are unable to do so.Riley’s appointment to Countdown was announced at the same time as new main host Jeff Stelling replaced Des O’Connor the duo of Stelling and Riley was in place for the new series beginning in January .Although she had never had any ambition to become a television presenter, Rachel was encouraged to apply for the show by her mother, and decided to do so because she was interested in the numbers part of the game. Having beaten , applicants for the role, she said: “There’s only one cool maths job around and I was lucky enough to get it so I’m absolutely thrilled”.Since it was first broadcast on January , , Riley has also performed her Countdown role on the comedy crossover spin-off version,  Out of  Cats Does Countdown, alongside comedian and host Jimmy Carr, team masters Susie Dent and Jon Richardson and a revolving door of guest stars including Bob Mortimer, David Mitchell, Richard Aoyade and other comedy greats of our time. While Countdown is seen as a straight light entertainment show, in explaining the dference between the two, Riley sees Countdown as the role she is “happy for her grandmother to see”, while Cats Does Countdown is the more risqué, cheeky role which she shows to her friends.Her new book, At Sixes and Sevens, is described as “an engaging, accessible introduction into how numbers work and why we shouldn’t be afraid of them.”It’s designed for those of us who don’t know our fractions from our percentages, or what is adjacent to the hypotenuse on a triangle or exactly how to help your offspring with long ision since those brain cells very likely perished long ago.According to the blurb: “You won’t be At Sixes and Sevens for long. In this brilliant, well-rounded guide, Rachel Riley will take you back to the very basics, allow you to revisit what you learnt at school , build your understanding of maths from the get-go and provide you with the essential toolkit to gain confidence in your numerical abilities.”Sounds like a tome the less numerically literate could definitely benefit from reading -though flashbacks from the agony of double maths at school may ensue.At Sixes And Sevens by Rachel Riley is published by HarperCollins, priced £..Maven  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularFormer Ulster and Ireland rugby player David Tweed dies in motorbike crash‘A far cry from the party of Carson’: UUP man launches broadside against Doug Beattie as he quits party in protest over lean towards liberalismNI High Street Voucher: How long can it take to get spend local card and what to doyou havent received itTrial scheme in which councils will give people free money takes step closerSandra Chapman would have been better to give away her £ high street voucherMost PopularBryson: DUP will collapse Stormont on two conditionsOwen Polley: Unconvincing poll was twisted by pundits to support the Northern Ireland ProtocolThe Belfast schools attended by celebrities like Jamie Dornan, Eamon Holmes and Christine LampardPeter Robinson: Sinn Fein finance minister’s fiscal policy is to hold out his hand for more UK cashThe unionist approach to Northern Ireland’s centenary has been a pathetic concession to the Irish nationalist narrative                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I think this is why my we and I enjoy a nostalgic steam journey when we visit an area with a preserved railway, which we did recently.Although more modern engines are more efficient and cleaner, they seem to me to not have the raw power of a steam locomotive and particularly those that used to haul express trains.This book has made me think of the power we need to live in our journey of le.There may seem to be more modern ways of living with many ideas offered, but the nothing beats the power of God.It may seem old fashioned and nostalgic to think like this, but when I see Godrsquos power at work all other efforts pale into insignicance.The Bible shows Godrsquos power with Jesus healing people, raising the dead and feeding large crowds among other things.It was supremely shown when He died and rose again which is central to the Christian faith.That power is still at work today with countless lives changed when people have an encounter with Jesus and see His power at work on their behalf.We all need help in the journey of le and God is always there for us.May I suggest that we do what The Bible says this week:\"Ask where the good way is, and walk in it and you will find rest for your souls\"PhilipGet involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have had great success with online bridge during the pandemic, but now we have reopened for Face-to-Face bridge our numbers are too small to be viable.Please come and support this historic club. However, letrsquos be positive. We are exploring merging our Tuesday and Friday evening sessions with another club.And,all fails, we will resume online bridge. Penarth Bridge Club will live on!So, here is a recent hand played at a Face-to-Face session where careful judgment by both declarer and the defence were required to achieve the optimum result.The AuctionNorth had seven spades and just seven points, ideal for a pre-emptive opening of three spades. The aim of pre-emptive bids is to put a spanner in the wheel of the defence.However, the danger always is that, as here, your partner has a good hand and so has a dficult decision to make on whether to pass or bid on for game. After some thought, South could see at least six spade tricks, evenhis partner did not have the king of spades.There were also two certain heart tricks, and it ought to be possible to rustle up a trick in diamonds and one more from Northrsquos hand. So, South bid four spades.The playTrick  ndash East was on lead and did not fancy a diamond or a club. And the jack of hearts lead was fraught with danger. So, interestingly, East chose to lead the five of spades, reasoning that his king was safe for a trickNorth held the ace.And evenSouth held three spades to the ace, North must surely have an entry somewhere to take the spade finesse. Anyway, declarer paused to consider the hand.Without the trump lead the contract would have been secure as he could have ruffed a losing club in dummy. But now things were dficult.North decided to play the ace of spades, hoping to drop a singleton king in Westrsquos hand. But no luck. Tricks  and  ndash Declarer then played a club to his ace, followed by a small club from hand, the trick being won by Eastrsquos king.East was now quite pleased he had decided to lead a trump at the first trick. Trick  - East won the next trick with the king of spades, preventing declarer from ruffing his losing club.Trick  ndash East then led his ace of diamonds, which was ruffed by declarer in hand. Trick  ndash Declarer drew Eastrsquos last trump with his queen, discarding a heart from dummy. But he could now see he still had a losing club and a losing heart, one down, having already lost two tricks.But could there be a squeeze on  Tricks , ,  and  ndash Declarer then rattled off his last four spades, forcing four discards from both East and West. East could see that dummy had to discard before West, so he jettisoned his remaining four diamonds, keeping the jack of clubs and two hearts.Declarer decided to discard one more heart and the rest of dummyrsquos diamonds. West had to hope his partner East held the jack of clubs, otherwise he was genuinely squeezed. So, he discarded the rest of his clubs, keeping his three hearts to the queen.Declarer then played a small heart to dummyrsquos ace. He followed this with the king of hearts. Bad luck, Eastrsquos jack dropped but not Westrsquos queen. Trick  - West then won the last trick with his queen of hearts, declarer only making nine tricks - six spades, two hearts, and one club, one down for a loss of  points.Four spades was a perfectly reasonable bid by South. But well done by the defence for the opening lead and care in their discards.What have we learnt . areful judgement is needed when responding to partnerrsquos opening pre-emptive bid, particularly when non vulnerable, since the pre-emptive bid is likely to be quite weak.. Sometimes it can quite be safe to lead a trump from three to king, as here.Penarth club resultsFriday  October: . Joy Seculer and Mike Downey. Peter Craig and Sean Macdougall.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.

Plans to modernise and extend the store were granted approval this week by Fermanagh  Omagh District Council following an extensive community consultation.
