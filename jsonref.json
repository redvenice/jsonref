Yeoman Warders (Beefeaters) lighting the first of thousands of flames in a lighting ceremony in the dry moat of the Tower of London as part of an installation called Beyond the Deepening Shadow: The Tower Remembers, to mark the centenary of the end of the First World War          A man plays a bugle to signify the start of a minute of silence ahead of the torches being lit for the installation \u0027Beyond the Deepening Shadow\u0027 at The Tower of LondonLast night’s opening display of ‘Beyond The Deepening Shadow: The Tower Remembers’ with a floodlit bugler on the roof of the Middle Tower playing the Last Post and a minute’s silence.A small procession of Yeomen Warders – better known as Beefeaters – plus the Constable and the Governor of the Tower formed a guard of honour and the first of the 10,000 torches were ignited by a tri-service trio.  In order to represent past, present and future, yesterday’s ceremony was performed by a retired Lieutenant Colonel, a serving midshipman from the Royal Naval Reserve and an air cadet.Out of the shadows, a small battalion of volunteer torch-lighters emerged in pairs. Each night, about a hundred of them have the task of illuminating half a mile of grass-covered moat.          A Beefeater walking amongst the thousands of flames in a lighting ceremony in the dry moat of the Tower of LondonSome turned out to have been volunteers who helped with that great poppy display four years ago. Some had simply read about this venture in the Mail and wanted to be a part of it.Each pair consists of a ‘leader’ with a magnetic wand who lifts the metal cover off each torch followed by a ‘lighter’ who carries a blowtorch on the end of a rod. Despite the scale of the exercise, it took only about 20 minutes before the whole moat was ablaze.‘There’s the same sort of buzz that there was with the poppies,’ said Charlotte Howard, a cook from Hampshire.‘It’s a wonderful atmosphere but it does make you remember all those who lost their lives.’          Yeoman of the Guard lights the first torches in the installation \u0027Beyond The Deepening Shadow\u0027 at Tower of London this eveningFirefighters tackle huge Nottingham blaze as explosions are...¿There are so many people in the House!¿: Trump dials back...Share this articleSeveral torch-lighting pairs turned out to be husband and wife, such as Dean and Kerry Rockall, from Bedfordshire.All have been issued with a flame-retardant grey boiler suit (to blend in with the Tower’s stonework) and have undergone several hours of training – not just to tick all the health and safety boxes but to ensure they light their designated ‘zone’ of torches in the correct order. It has all been planned in minute detail by Tom Piper, the designer of the installation.‘We want the flames to spread in “fingers” of light until the whole moat is ablaze,’ explained Mr Piper, a theatre designer who also oversaw the great poppy display of 2014 called Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red.He has arranged the torches at different heights to create a more dramatic effect.

The entire project has been funded by HRP and private sponsors.           A Yeoman Warder stands amongst the first of thousands of lit flames which form part of an installation called Beyond the Deepening Shadow: The Tower Remembers, in the dry moat of the Tower of London, to mark the centenary of the end of First World WarSince the arts establishment and the National Lottery refused any financial support for the poppies proposal in 2014 (the Guardian even attacked it as a ‘Ukip-style’ memorial), the Tower has not asked for arts funding this time.The whole experience takes place to the sound of a haunting specially-commissioned choral work recorded by sound artist Mira Calix. Called ‘One Lighted Look For Me’, it is based on a line from the war poem, Sonnet to a Soldier by Mary Borden, who wrote it while working in a field hospital on the Somme.Smoke wafted over the scene, though this turned out to be dry ice for theatrical effect (the torches use smokeless fuel so do not emit any smoke, fumes or smell).

Finally, at about 9pm, the torches ran out of fuel at the allotted time and, on cue, began to flicker and fade.Another team of volunteers will arrive this morning to refill each canister, as they will each day until Sunday. Unlike the poppies – which are still on display around the country – the torches will then be taken away for recycling.This mesmerising homage to the fallen will not be repeated.

The British managed to advance seven-miles but failed to break the German defence.On the first day alone, 19,240 British soldiers were killed after \u0027going over the top\u0027 and more than 38,000 were wounded.But on the last day of the battle, the 51st Highland Division took Beaumont Hamel and captured 7,000 German prisoners.The plan was for a \u0027Big Push\u0027 to relieve the French forces, who were besieged further south at Verdun, and break through German lines.Although it did take pressure off Verdun it failed to provide a breakthrough and the war dragged on for another two years.                          "},{"url":null,"title":"Unseen pictures lion cub bought Harrods 1969","story":"    Christian the lion having lunch with model Emma Breeze and friends at the Casserole restaurant on King\u0027s Road, London. the lion cub was bought in Harrods’ pet department  in November 1969‘I’ve already named him,’ replied Ace, nodding in agreement. ‘He’s called Christian.’Our visit to Harrods’ pet department that fateful day in November 1969 had been prompted by simple curiosity.As two young Australians newly arrived in the UK, we’d heard crazy tales about a London store where you could buy not just the usual clothes and household goods, but tapirs, snakes, monkeys and even pumas and lions as well.It sounded incredible, but when I saw the beautiful lion cub for sale that day — alert, trusting and magnificent — I was smitten. David Attenborough says too much alarmism about climate...Lion is found emaciated and left to die with its paws...Lion love triangle!

Anthony Bourke and John Rendall take Christian for s spin in their convertible  on the King\u0027s Road. The pair would take the lion in a ride in the car to the churchyard to get exercise and to playPatiently, the staff answered our excited but naïve questions before asking their own: where, exactly, did we think an energetic three-month-old lion cub might actually live?It was a problem. But, as luck would have it, I’d newly started a job in a pine furniture store, Sophisto-Cat, on the King’s Road, whose owner had grown up in Africa. How might he feel about having a lion on the premises?It was an outrageous request, but I didn’t have any better ideas. Surely, I argued, a lion was the ultimate ‘sophistocat’ — the perfect mascot?There was a huge basement which Christian could have to himself, and we’d be on hand to look after him, as Ace and I were living in the flat above the store. Amazingly, the owner enthusiastically agreed. To our delight, the Harrods staff approved we would collect Christian in three weeks’ time.A few days later, we had a call. ‘Can you collect Christian tomorrow?’ It transpired that our new acquisition had escaped the night before and all but destroyed a display of goat-skin rugs in the carpet department, whose manager was less than pleased. What had we let ourselves in for?It was a thrilling time to be in London. Among Sophisto-Cat’s close neighbours were Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren, whose boutique later became the birthplace of the punk movement, and opposite was ultra-fashionable clothes store Granny Takes A Trip, where The Beatles, Who, Cream and Jimi Hendrix were customers.           Pampered: Christian gets a blow dry. The lion lived in a huge basement in a pine furniture store, Sophisto-Cat, which Christian had to himselfPerhaps it wasn’t totally outrageous that a lion should be living among such a bohemian set.Christian’s new home was everything we had hoped for: airy, with plenty of natural light and lots of space for a little cub to race around in, often dragging his favourite plastic pig.With bedding, bones, toys and a large litter tray which he used assiduously after only a few days of encouragement, it was the perfect lion’s den.Harrods supplied a detailed diet sheet: a liquid meal with raw egg and vitamins for breakfast, then raw meat — usually chopped beef or rabbit — for lunch and supper, and, as a special treat, a delicious marrow-filled bone at night.Local restaurants and butchers offered steaks that were past their sell-by date, and cut-price meat.Exercise soon became a concern. But where could we take him? The problem was solved by the vicar of the nearby church, who agreed to let us use its grounds just a few hundred yards from the shop. This sanctuary made an ideal playground, with a high entrance gate and brick walls. Residents of the flats that overlooked it would watch from their balconies and shout encouragement, waving and cheering as Christian raced around chasing footballs and — if we allowed him — us. We never received a complaint.Friends would often come to join in. If Christian ever became too rough, we would just stand still and stop the game, and he quickly got the message.Fleet Street photographer Derek Cattani became a regular visitor, and documented Christian’s Chelsea life.We soon settled into a regular routine. The shop opened at 10am. By then Christian had been fed, enjoyed a ride in the car to the churchyard and returned home for a nap, leaving us to get on with running the shop.At lunchtime he would be wide awake again and ready for his first meat meal. Then it was playtime in the den with anybody who was free to spend time with him. By the end of the afternoon Christian was ready for tea.          Christian attracts young admirers as he heads out in the Bentley. Celebrities began turning up. Diana Rigg had no qualms cuddling Christian, but her co-star in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, Australian George Lazenby, did not live up to his 007 image and refused to enter the shopHe would then come up into the shop and wander happily around, often opting to sit on a table or chest of drawers in the window where he had a good view.Celebrities began turning up. Diana Rigg had no qualms cuddling Christian, but her co-star in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, Australian George Lazenby, did not live up to his 007 image and refused to enter the shop.We were bombarded with requests to hire him for parties, premieres, publicity shots. To most of these we said no, though we did agree to a photoshoot with Vanity Fair, and one with racing driver James Hunt.It was an invitation to appear on Blue Peter that brought an end to Christian’s career as a model. During a rehearsal, he behaved impeccably but by the time of the live appearance, he was bored.Instead of a nice calm chat on the sofa with Valerie Singleton, the whole thing turned into a wrestling match as we tried to stop Christian from running off.Ace and I decided such events were too stressful for him. He was not comfortable away from Sophisto-Cat or his churchyard. Christian was also now a year old and growing rapidly. Heartbreakingly, he would need a new home.We began considering Longleat Safari Park. This was where some of the lions used in the hit movie Born Free — which told the story of how conservationists George and Joy Adamson had reintroduced Elsa, a hand-reared cub, into the wild in Africa — had been relocated.Then a totally unexpected alternative arose. Actors Bill Travers and his wife Virginia McKenna, who had played George and Joy Adamson in the film, were visiting Virginia’s dressmaker, a neighbour of ours in Chelsea.          Christian tackles John during a game of football in the Moravian Close. Residents of the flats that overlooked it would watch from their balconies and shout encouragement, waving and cheering as Christian raced around chasing footballs They came to meet Christian, and asked what we were planning to do with him. We admitted we were still searching for the best solution.A few days later, Bill rang with an idea. He had contacted George Adamson in Kenya to ask whether he would consider rehabilitating Christian there. The great lion guru had provisionally agreed.It was a wonderful opportunity, but a challenge too. Take a fifth-generation captivity-bred lion, born in a zoo in Devon and then sold to us in a department store, to Africa? Could he adapt? And if he did, would he survive?On August 12, 1970, Christian marked his first and last birthday in England. Two weeks later, with photographer Derek Cattani who had come to document the first stage of Christian’s rehabilitation, we touched down in Nairobi, on African soil. His ancestral homeland.George Adamson was there to meet us. This was the man in whose hands Christian’s destiny now lay.Together we set off in George’s jeep for the Kora reserve 250 miles away — Christian’s new home. When we stopped en route at a camp and took Christian for his first walk in Africa, an event of overwhelming significance occurred.Christian spotted a lost cow in the bush and immediately crouched and froze. We watched as Christian stalked his prey — creeping slowly forward and using the low bushes to conceal himself. George was worried, though: the beast’s substantial horns could be lethal. We tried to grab Christian and, for the first time ever, he snarled at us. The episode shook us, but George was hugely impressed at his stalking instincts.That night in camp Christian was wonderfully affectionate. Perhaps it was the excitement of his first stalking, or perhaps he was trying to make up for his earlier aggression. Either way, he dozed off with his head on a pillow and his paw on my face.But we had learned what we most needed to know: our young lion was wild at heart. Everything would be all right.In the summer of 1971, a year after Christian had become a wild animal, Ace and I returned to Kora to see George and, we hoped, glimpse our beloved lion.When we called George from Nairobi he told us not to get our hopes up. Christian was now the head of a small pride — three females and a young male. George hadn’t seen them for weeks.But when he met us at Kora he was grinning. ‘The lions turned up this morning,’ he said. ‘Christian must have known you were coming.’At his camp, George identified a spot for a reunion. He told us he would lead the lions to the brow of a rock, from where they could see me, Ace and a cameraman friend, Simon Trevor, who had been making a film about our story. After that, nobody knew what might happen.As Christian crested the brow he stopped and stared at us. After a few minutes, he walked slowly down towards us, staring the whole time. He looked superb: taller, leaner and less thickly coated, but strong and confident.His body language was self-assured as he approached. ‘Call him,’ George said, unable to wait any longer.And that did it: the moment he heard our voices Christian began to run down the rocky hillside, grunting with excitement. A 300lb lion was now bounding towards us at about 20 miles an hour. We braced ourselves for the impact and suddenly there he was, jumping up to greet us, rubbing our heads, moaning with pleasure and running backwards and forwards between us as he tried to embrace us both at the same time.          Wild at heart: A 300lb lion was now bounding towards us at about 20 miles an hour. We braced ourselves for the impact and suddenly there he was, jumping up to greet us, rubbing our heads, moaning with pleasure and running backwards and forwards between us as he tried to embrace us both at the same timeToday I look at the photos of that meeting and realise how overwhelmed I was by the powerful emotion. At that moment, the gulf between humans and lions had been blurred by sheer euphoria.But that was not the end of the story. In 2006, the film of our reunion was spotted by an English actor named Marc Bolton, who was inspired to add a written narrative and a soundtrack using the Whitney Houston song I Will Always Love You.Today there have been a staggering 100 million YouTube viewings of that brief clip, with interest showing no signs of abating. Christian is one of the most famous lions there has ever been.It’s 45 years since, in 1973, Christian disappeared into the wild for ever, but some time later George heard him mating and was confident that he had established his own pride. Philip Mason, manager of a safari lodge near the Adamsons’ camp, often sees big-maned iniduals that strongly resemble Christian. Could these be his descendants? Philip thinks so.When Ace and I took Christian to Kenya in 1970, there were 400,000 lions in Africa. Today there are fewer than 20,000.As the threat to Africa’s lions increases, we have much to be grateful to Christian for. The video gains him ever more fans and I pray it will continue to help raise awareness among new viewers, and the fight to save Christian’s descendants will gain momentum.There could be no better legacy from a remarkable animal who continues to hold a unique place in our hearts.Adapted from Christian The Lion: The Illustrated Legacy by John Rendall and Derek Cattani (Bradt, £14.99). © John Rendall \u0026amp Derek Cattani 2018. To order a copy for £11.99 (offer valid to November 15, 2018, p\u0026ampp free on orders over £15), visit mailshop.co.ukbooks or call 0844 571 0640.

On the last leg of the visit, the Prince of Wales will speak at the International Conference Centre at the invitation of President Nana Akufo-Addo.While he will mainly use it to pay tribute to Ghana’s role in the Commonwealth, Charles was keen to reference the slave trade in Ghana and Britain and Europe’s role in it.He also wanted to use the occasion to highlight Britain’s determination to tackle modern slavery.The prince was visibly moved by a visit to Fort Christiansborg in Osu, a suburb of the capital Accra, during which he was told of its chilling history.Built in 1661, the fort – also known as Osu Castle – was used by the Danes to hold slaves before they were sent to the New World.In the 19th century, it became the headquarters of the local British government.Colombian star of Royal Ballet reveals he used...How the nation will remember next week: Hour-by-hour what\u0027s...Share this article    The Prince of Wales will mainly use his speech to pay tribute to Ghana’s role in the Commonwealth (pictured being greeted by dancers at Fort Christiansborg in Accra, Ghana)    Meghan and her mother Doria RaglandIn an unprecedented step, the Duchess of Sussex’s mother is expected to fly in from the US to spend Christmas with the Queen.Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland, 62, is said to have been invited to Sandringham to join her daughter and the rest of the Royal Family.The honour was not extended to Carole and Michael Middleton, parents of the Duchess of Cambridge.A royal source said it was ‘a very thoughtful gesture’, adding: ‘It’s a mark of the Queen’s respect for Meghan and an acknowledgement that she doesn’t have any other relations in this country – unlike Kate, who has a very close family.’The Middletons have joined the Queen at church on Christmas morning, but stayed with William.                                                     At the bottom were dungeons in which enslaved Africans were kept for up to six months as they awaited transportation.During a sombre moment in searing heat, Charles paused at the foot of the stairs, known as ‘the door of no return’, to reflect on the fort’s horrific past.In his speech today, he is expected to say: ‘The histories of our two nations are closely intertwined, and while today we enjoy shared opportunity, we can never forget that our past has sometimes borne witness to tragedy and loss and, at times, profound injustice. At Osu Castle, it was especially important to me – as indeed it was on my first visit there 41 years ago – that I should acknowledge the most painful chapter of Ghana’s relations with the nations of Europe, including the United Kingdom. The appalling atrocity of the slave trade, and the unimaginable suffering it caused, left an indelible stain on the history of our world.‘While Britain can be proud that it later led the way in the abolition of this shameful trade, we have a shared responsibility to ensure that the abject horror of slavery is never forgotten, that we abhor the existence of modern slavery and that we robustly promote and defend the values which today make it incomprehensible, to most of us, that human beings could ever treat each other with such utter inhumanity.’Charles will also pay tribute to the strength of the relationship between the UK and Ghana.He is keen to highlight the country’s role in the Commonwealth and stress how, by acting within the organisation, it can play an important role over environmental issues and rapid urbanisation.He will also acknowledge Ghana as an example to the region and to the world of a stable democracy, a beacon of tolerance and ersity.In his speech, the prince is expected to say: ‘The Commonwealth should strive for renewed relevance in the lives of its citizens and should draw upon its unparalleled networks of professional expertise, to offer practical solutions to some of the most pressing challenges of our time, many of which are increasingly deep seated and deeply integrated.‘No issue is more pressing than that of climate change.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Hilarious moment fisherman gets inked face trying reel wily squid","story":"This is the hilarious moment Jarrad Edwards (pictured) got unexpectedly inked by the squid as he tried to reel it inHe revealed that the squid had already inked in the water just before so he thought he was \u0027safe\u0027.\u0027I saw the squid inked in the water so I thought I was safe.

Operation Tabarin, which lasted form 1943-1945, was a Royal Navy undertaking to occupy British Antarctic Territories and to deny access to enemy ships and submarines          Operation Tabarin is without doubt one of the most significant expeditions of what might be described as the ‘post-Heroic’ phase of Antarctic exploration ultimately it would develop into the British Antarctic Survey, arguably the most important and enduring of all government-sponsored programs of research in the Antarctic. Pictured, workers unloading stores to establish Base A at Port Lockroy, 1944          Victor Russell and David James pictured at the end of the first sledge journey from Hope Bay. Operation Tabarin was a monumental event in UK Antarctic history, paving the way for the scientific excellence that has made the UK a world leader in Antarctic science Operation Tabarin was an expedition to secretly establish bases, keep a watchful eye on German and Japanese activities, and curb opportunistic Argentinian incursions.Lead botanist Ivan Mackenzie Lamb\u0027s account of the expedition provides a fascinating insight into the top secret military operation.He was a member of the naval party that established three manned bases and remained in the field throughout the operation\u0027s two-year duration as he took part in all three major sledging expeditions.Russian warplane swoops in uninvited to spy on NATO\u0027s...Vikings conquered treacherous seas and created a formidable...At the going down of the sun, Tower of London Beefeaters...Share this article    Surveying at the foot of the Wall Range, Wiencke Island. Operation Tabarin was the first of a series of British Antarctic naval expeditions, later known as the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey and subsequently the British Antarctic Survey.Operation Tabarin had its origins in the territorial tension that had been mounting since the beginning of the 20th Century.Britain’s indifference to the loss of the Scottish Antarctic Expeditions’ meteorological station, built in 1903 and given to Argentina in 1904, led to increasing challenges to Britain’s claims of sovereignty over the Falkland Islands Territories. This had been exacerbated as the whaling industry took off in Antarctica, when Britain had begun charging for whaling licences to the dismay of Argentina and leading to several Argentinean diplomatic notes being sent to Britain asserting their territorial claims in the area. Operation Tabarin was led by Lieutenant James Marr, a Marine Zoologist. Determined to make the most of this naval operation, Marr recruited scientists from the armed forces to expand on research that had been carried out in Antarctica before the war, mainly in survey, biology, geology and meteorology, and formed the 14-man expedition team that was to set off for Antarctica.HMS Bransfield left Tilbury Docks in November 1943, but the ship had to be abandoned at Falmouth. However thanks to the Highland Monarch, a luxury passenger liner now transporting troops to the Falkland Islands, the expedition finally set sail on 14 December and arrived at Stanley in the Falkland Islands on 26 January 1944. By the end of 1944, plans to establish the main base of operations at Hope Bay early in 1945 were well underway, with Marr now also planning to establish a base on Stonington Island.On 14 January 1946, after a frustrating and ill-informed wait, the men were unexpectedly relieved and, after loading up themselves and their supplies, and leaving members of the new team to settle in, arrived at Deception Island the next day. By 16 January they were back at Port Lockroy to relieve the team there, and left the next day with stores including penguins bound for London Zoo. On 21 January 1946 the men arrived back in the Falkland Islands, and by 11 February were on their way back to Britain. On arrival in London on 9 March 1946, and with their request for a salary advance ignored, three of the men with no friends or family in London were forced to sleep rough that first night. With little mention made of their return, the men submitted their reports and then went their separate ways. Source: The UK Antarctic Heritage Trust                                                              Andrew Taylor and Lamb. Taylor, a surveyor from the Royal Canadian Engineers, led the second year of the expedition, establishing Hope Bay (Base D) as the centre for dog-sledge-based fieldwork on the mainland          The buildings at Port Lockroy were unoccupied for over 30 years until 1996, when they were restored to their original 1962 condition by the British Antarctic Survey.

And it has endeared her to him even more.’Those closest to Charles draw a parallel between Meghan’s dignified forbearance in the face of hurtful comments from relatives, and how the Prince stoically endured public criticism from Princess Diana.‘Whatever they felt inside, they’ve both put on a strong public face and not hidden away,’ said another source.The Prince’s close rapport with Meghan, whom he walked down the aisle in place of her absent father, has delighted Prince Harry and senior members of the Royal Family. It is an understanding that has been further strengthened by a shared love of art, history and culture, with Charles describing Meghan as ‘incredibly smart’.Charles and Meghan’s bond is revealed in The Mail on Sunday’s Event magazine today by Royal biographer Angela Levin, who spent a year following the Prince ahead of his 70th birthday later this month.    The Prince’s close rapport with Meghan, whom he walked down the aisle (pictured) in place of her absent father, is said to have delighted Prince HarryCamilla has also warmed to Meghan. ‘Not least because both of them have joined the Royal Family from the outside,’ said a source. ‘Camilla goes out of her way to find time to spend with her, to get to know her and make her feel welcome.’As the tour of Australasia demonstrated, The Duchess’s transition from actress to high-profile Royal has been seamless – something that has gladdened Charles, who believes her Hollywood training has enabled Meghan to withstand intense scrutiny.In addition to the Event profile, The Mail on Sunday has learned from separate sources of a Scottish holiday enjoyed by Charles and the newlyweds over the summer.Charles entertained Harry and Meghan at the Castle of Mey, the late Queen Mother’s remote home in Caithness, telling friends he was ‘tickled pink’ when they agreed to join him. He also invited the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, but they declined.Sources said Charles told a member of his family that the week with his son and daughter-in-law was ‘joyous’. There were coastal walks and a spot of bird watching.‘I think it’s fair to say that Meghan has brought Harry and Charles closer, and Charles is thrilled to have a new daughter-in-law.‘Camilla wasn’t there, she was enjoying a bucket-and-spade holiday with her own children and grandchildren, so I think that made it even more special for Charles.’Meanwhile, Levin paints a portrait of a man who is settled, content and happy – more so than he has been for years. Marriage to Camilla - whom he frequently describes as ‘my darling wife’ – arrested his tendency to melancholy, particularly evident in the bleak period following the death of Princess Diana when his popularity plummeted and many said he was not fit to be King.  As Prince Charles prepares to turn 70, Event reveals a stunning photo album packed full of remarkably intimate pictures documenting his life from a royal baby to his life today as a doting grandfather Event brings you a colourful insight into the life of a prince with photos of Charles in his mother\u0027s arms, on tour around the world and  sharing tender moments with his wife Camilla          Princess Anne holds a bunch of daffodils as Prince Charles stands guard over a plant in 1954          The eight-month-old Prince makes an early play for the Crown Jewels as Royal mother and son share a tender moment in the garden of Windlesham Moor, Surrey, in July 1949, where the family lived for two years as they waited for a major refurbishment of Clarence House to be finished          Elizabeth counts her blessings as a parent while the baby Prince counts the balls on his abacus in an outdoor playpen in the grounds of the rented Windlesham Moor, a five-bedroom country house in Sunningdale with two guest rooms combined to make a nursery          Charles reaches for his rabbit which, along with a teddy, some yellow ducks, a submarine and an elephant on wheels called Jumbo, were his favourite first toys.

Each night, about a hundred of them have the task of illuminating half a mile of grass-covered moat.          A Beefeater walking amongst the thousands of flames in a lighting ceremony in the dry moat of the Tower of LondonSome turned out to have been volunteers who helped with that great poppy display four years ago. Some had simply read about this venture in the Mail and wanted to be a part of it.Each pair consists of a ‘leader’ with a magnetic wand who lifts the metal cover off each torch followed by a ‘lighter’ who carries a blowtorch on the end of a rod. Despite the scale of the exercise, it took only about 20 minutes before the whole moat was ablaze.‘There’s the same sort of buzz that there was with the poppies,’ said Charlotte Howard, a cook from Hampshire.‘It’s a wonderful atmosphere but it does make you remember all those who lost their lives.’          Yeoman of the Guard lights the first torches in the installation \u0027Beyond The Deepening Shadow\u0027 at Tower of London this eveningFirefighters tackle huge Nottingham blaze as explosions are...¿There are so many people in the House!¿: Trump dials back...Share this articleSeveral torch-lighting pairs turned out to be husband and wife, such as Dean and Kerry Rockall, from Bedfordshire.All have been issued with a flame-retardant grey boiler suit (to blend in with the Tower’s stonework) and have undergone several hours of training – not just to tick all the health and safety boxes but to ensure they light their designated ‘zone’ of torches in the correct order. It has all been planned in minute detail by Tom Piper, the designer of the installation.‘We want the flames to spread in “fingers” of light until the whole moat is ablaze,’ explained Mr Piper, a theatre designer who also oversaw the great poppy display of 2014 called Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red.He has arranged the torches at different heights to create a more dramatic effect.

The entire project has been funded by HRP and private sponsors.           A Yeoman Warder stands amongst the first of thousands of lit flames which form part of an installation called Beyond the Deepening Shadow: The Tower Remembers, in the dry moat of the Tower of London, to mark the centenary of the end of First World WarSince the arts establishment and the National Lottery refused any financial support for the poppies proposal in 2014 (the Guardian even attacked it as a ‘Ukip-style’ memorial), the Tower has not asked for arts funding this time.The whole experience takes place to the sound of a haunting specially-commissioned choral work recorded by sound artist Mira Calix. Called ‘One Lighted Look For Me’, it is based on a line from the war poem, Sonnet to a Soldier by Mary Borden, who wrote it while working in a field hospital on the Somme.Smoke wafted over the scene, though this turned out to be dry ice for theatrical effect (the torches use smokeless fuel so do not emit any smoke, fumes or smell).          Beefeaters lighting the first of thousands of flames in a lighting ceremony in the dry moat of the Tower of London as part of an installation called Beyond the Deepening Shadow: The Tower Remembers, to mark the centenary of the end of First World War           The ceremony was accompanied by a specially commissioned sound installation featuring choral music, as well as words from war poet Mary Borden\u0027s Sonnets To A Soldier           The ceremony, named Beyond The Deepening Shadow, will be repeated each night until the final showing on Remembrance Sunday          Spectators gathered on vantage points around the tower to witness the spectacle and a minute\u0027s silence was also observedEven those who have seen plenty of ceremonies found it profoundly stirring. ‘We had remembrance parades every week in Afghanistan in honour of our fallen comrades but I found this very emotional too,’ said Lt-Col Cathy Braddick-Hughes, 50, formerly of the Adjutant General’s Corps, who was one of last night’s special guests. Finally, at about 9pm, the torches ran out of fuel at the allotted time and, on cue, began to flicker and fade.Another team of volunteers will arrive this morning to refill each canister, as they will each day until Sunday. Unlike the poppies – which are still on display around the country – the torches will then be taken away for recycling.This mesmerising homage to the fallen will not be repeated.

The British managed to advance seven-miles but failed to break the German defence.On the first day alone, 19,240 British soldiers were killed after \u0027going over the top\u0027 and more than 38,000 were wounded.But on the last day of the battle, the 51st Highland Division took Beaumont Hamel and captured 7,000 German prisoners.The plan was for a \u0027Big Push\u0027 to relieve the French forces, who were besieged further south at Verdun, and break through German lines.Although it did take pressure off Verdun it failed to provide a breakthrough and the war dragged on for another two years.                          "},{"url":null,"title":"Unseen pictures lion cub bought Harrods 1969","story":"    Christian the lion having lunch with model Emma Breeze and friends at the Casserole restaurant on King\u0027s Road, London. the lion cub was bought in Harrods’ pet department  in November 1969‘I’ve already named him,’ replied Ace, nodding in agreement. ‘He’s called Christian.’Our visit to Harrods’ pet department that fateful day in November 1969 had been prompted by simple curiosity.As two young Australians newly arrived in the UK, we’d heard crazy tales about a London store where you could buy not just the usual clothes and household goods, but tapirs, snakes, monkeys and even pumas and lions as well.It sounded incredible, but when I saw the beautiful lion cub for sale that day — alert, trusting and magnificent — I was smitten. David Attenborough says too much alarmism about climate...Lion is found emaciated and left to die with its paws...Lion love triangle!

Anthony Bourke and John Rendall take Christian for s spin in their convertible  on the King\u0027s Road. The pair would take the lion in a ride in the car to the churchyard to get exercise and to playPatiently, the staff answered our excited but naïve questions before asking their own: where, exactly, did we think an energetic three-month-old lion cub might actually live?It was a problem. But, as luck would have it, I’d newly started a job in a pine furniture store, Sophisto-Cat, on the King’s Road, whose owner had grown up in Africa. How might he feel about having a lion on the premises?It was an outrageous request, but I didn’t have any better ideas. Surely, I argued, a lion was the ultimate ‘sophistocat’ — the perfect mascot?There was a huge basement which Christian could have to himself, and we’d be on hand to look after him, as Ace and I were living in the flat above the store. Amazingly, the owner enthusiastically agreed. To our delight, the Harrods staff approved we would collect Christian in three weeks’ time.A few days later, we had a call. ‘Can you collect Christian tomorrow?’ It transpired that our new acquisition had escaped the night before and all but destroyed a display of goat-skin rugs in the carpet department, whose manager was less than pleased. What had we let ourselves in for?It was a thrilling time to be in London. Among Sophisto-Cat’s close neighbours were Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren, whose boutique later became the birthplace of the punk movement, and opposite was ultra-fashionable clothes store Granny Takes A Trip, where The Beatles, Who, Cream and Jimi Hendrix were customers.           Pampered: Christian gets a blow dry. The lion lived in a huge basement in a pine furniture store, Sophisto-Cat, which Christian had to himselfPerhaps it wasn’t totally outrageous that a lion should be living among such a bohemian set.Christian’s new home was everything we had hoped for: airy, with plenty of natural light and lots of space for a little cub to race around in, often dragging his favourite plastic pig.With bedding, bones, toys and a large litter tray which he used assiduously after only a few days of encouragement, it was the perfect lion’s den.Harrods supplied a detailed diet sheet: a liquid meal with raw egg and vitamins for breakfast, then raw meat — usually chopped beef or rabbit — for lunch and supper, and, as a special treat, a delicious marrow-filled bone at night.Local restaurants and butchers offered steaks that were past their sell-by date, and cut-price meat.Exercise soon became a concern. But where could we take him? The problem was solved by the vicar of the nearby church, who agreed to let us use its grounds just a few hundred yards from the shop. This sanctuary made an ideal playground, with a high entrance gate and brick walls. Residents of the flats that overlooked it would watch from their balconies and shout encouragement, waving and cheering as Christian raced around chasing footballs and — if we allowed him — us. We never received a complaint.Friends would often come to join in. If Christian ever became too rough, we would just stand still and stop the game, and he quickly got the message.Fleet Street photographer Derek Cattani became a regular visitor, and documented Christian’s Chelsea life.We soon settled into a regular routine. The shop opened at 10am. By then Christian had been fed, enjoyed a ride in the car to the churchyard and returned home for a nap, leaving us to get on with running the shop.At lunchtime he would be wide awake again and ready for his first meat meal. Then it was playtime in the den with anybody who was free to spend time with him. By the end of the afternoon Christian was ready for tea.          Christian attracts young admirers as he heads out in the Bentley. Celebrities began turning up. Diana Rigg had no qualms cuddling Christian, but her co-star in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, Australian George Lazenby, did not live up to his 007 image and refused to enter the shopHe would then come up into the shop and wander happily around, often opting to sit on a table or chest of drawers in the window where he had a good view.Celebrities began turning up. Diana Rigg had no qualms cuddling Christian, but her co-star in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, Australian George Lazenby, did not live up to his 007 image and refused to enter the shop.We were bombarded with requests to hire him for parties, premieres, publicity shots. To most of these we said no, though we did agree to a photoshoot with Vanity Fair, and one with racing driver James Hunt.It was an invitation to appear on Blue Peter that brought an end to Christian’s career as a model. During a rehearsal, he behaved impeccably but by the time of the live appearance, he was bored.Instead of a nice calm chat on the sofa with Valerie Singleton, the whole thing turned into a wrestling match as we tried to stop Christian from running off.Ace and I decided such events were too stressful for him. He was not comfortable away from Sophisto-Cat or his churchyard. Christian was also now a year old and growing rapidly. Heartbreakingly, he would need a new home.We began considering Longleat Safari Park. This was where some of the lions used in the hit movie Born Free — which told the story of how conservationists George and Joy Adamson had reintroduced Elsa, a hand-reared cub, into the wild in Africa — had been relocated.Then a totally unexpected alternative arose. Actors Bill Travers and his wife Virginia McKenna, who had played George and Joy Adamson in the film, were visiting Virginia’s dressmaker, a neighbour of ours in Chelsea.          Christian tackles John during a game of football in the Moravian Close. Residents of the flats that overlooked it would watch from their balconies and shout encouragement, waving and cheering as Christian raced around chasing footballs They came to meet Christian, and asked what we were planning to do with him. We admitted we were still searching for the best solution.A few days later, Bill rang with an idea. He had contacted George Adamson in Kenya to ask whether he would consider rehabilitating Christian there. The great lion guru had provisionally agreed.It was a wonderful opportunity, but a challenge too. Take a fifth-generation captivity-bred lion, born in a zoo in Devon and then sold to us in a department store, to Africa? Could he adapt? And if he did, would he survive?On August 12, 1970, Christian marked his first and last birthday in England. Two weeks later, with photographer Derek Cattani who had come to document the first stage of Christian’s rehabilitation, we touched down in Nairobi, on African soil. His ancestral homeland.George Adamson was there to meet us. This was the man in whose hands Christian’s destiny now lay.Together we set off in George’s jeep for the Kora reserve 250 miles away — Christian’s new home. When we stopped en route at a camp and took Christian for his first walk in Africa, an event of overwhelming significance occurred.Christian spotted a lost cow in the bush and immediately crouched and froze. We watched as Christian stalked his prey — creeping slowly forward and using the low bushes to conceal himself. George was worried, though: the beast’s substantial horns could be lethal. We tried to grab Christian and, for the first time ever, he snarled at us. The episode shook us, but George was hugely impressed at his stalking instincts.That night in camp Christian was wonderfully affectionate. Perhaps it was the excitement of his first stalking, or perhaps he was trying to make up for his earlier aggression. Either way, he dozed off with his head on a pillow and his paw on my face.But we had learned what we most needed to know: our young lion was wild at heart. Everything would be all right.In the summer of 1971, a year after Christian had become a wild animal, Ace and I returned to Kora to see George and, we hoped, glimpse our beloved lion.When we called George from Nairobi he told us not to get our hopes up. Christian was now the head of a small pride — three females and a young male. George hadn’t seen them for weeks.But when he met us at Kora he was grinning. ‘The lions turned up this morning,’ he said. ‘Christian must have known you were coming.’At his camp, George identified a spot for a reunion. He told us he would lead the lions to the brow of a rock, from where they could see me, Ace and a cameraman friend, Simon Trevor, who had been making a film about our story. After that, nobody knew what might happen.As Christian crested the brow he stopped and stared at us. After a few minutes, he walked slowly down towards us, staring the whole time. He looked superb: taller, leaner and less thickly coated, but strong and confident.His body language was self-assured as he approached. ‘Call him,’ George said, unable to wait any longer.And that did it: the moment he heard our voices Christian began to run down the rocky hillside, grunting with excitement. A 300lb lion was now bounding towards us at about 20 miles an hour. We braced ourselves for the impact and suddenly there he was, jumping up to greet us, rubbing our heads, moaning with pleasure and running backwards and forwards between us as he tried to embrace us both at the same time.          Wild at heart: A 300lb lion was now bounding towards us at about 20 miles an hour. We braced ourselves for the impact and suddenly there he was, jumping up to greet us, rubbing our heads, moaning with pleasure and running backwards and forwards between us as he tried to embrace us both at the same timeToday I look at the photos of that meeting and realise how overwhelmed I was by the powerful emotion. At that moment, the gulf between humans and lions had been blurred by sheer euphoria.But that was not the end of the story. In 2006, the film of our reunion was spotted by an English actor named Marc Bolton, who was inspired to add a written narrative and a soundtrack using the Whitney Houston song I Will Always Love You.Today there have been a staggering 100 million YouTube viewings of that brief clip, with interest showing no signs of abating. Christian is one of the most famous lions there has ever been.It’s 45 years since, in 1973, Christian disappeared into the wild for ever, but some time later George heard him mating and was confident that he had established his own pride. Philip Mason, manager of a safari lodge near the Adamsons’ camp, often sees big-maned iniduals that strongly resemble Christian. Could these be his descendants? Philip thinks so.When Ace and I took Christian to Kenya in 1970, there were 400,000 lions in Africa. Today there are fewer than 20,000.As the threat to Africa’s lions increases, we have much to be grateful to Christian for. The video gains him ever more fans and I pray it will continue to help raise awareness among new viewers, and the fight to save Christian’s descendants will gain momentum.There could be no better legacy from a remarkable animal who continues to hold a unique place in our hearts.Adapted from Christian The Lion: The Illustrated Legacy by John Rendall and Derek Cattani (Bradt, £14.99). © John Rendall \u0026amp Derek Cattani 2018. To order a copy for £11.99 (offer valid to November 15, 2018, p\u0026ampp free on orders over £15), visit mailshop.co.ukbooks or call 0844 571 0640.

Stock photoClaim: Earwigs like to lay eggs in your earsFalseThe belief that earwigs like to burrow into our ears dates back to the writings of Roman author and naturalist Pliny the Elder, who made the claim — but it is false nonetheless.Earwigs do like moist, dark places, but they prefer natural habitats, such as in soil and under tree bark, to ears.Thankfully, an earwig has never been reported to have laid an egg inside a human\u0027s ear canal.Lion of London snaps back: Stunning unseen pictures...David Attenborough says too much alarmism about climate...Share this articleClaim: You can get high from licking a toadTrueUndoubtedly one of the strangest things people have done to elicit a recreational high is to lick a toad — in particular, the cane toad and Colorado River toad, which produce the chemical 5-methoxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine.While this chemical makes the toads unpalatable to predators, in humans it triggers the release of serotonin, a feel-good substance in the brain, which can also produce powerful hallucinations.Claim: Cutting in half an earthworm creates two earthwormsFalseIf you\u0027ve ever seen an earthworm split in two by a shovel, you\u0027ll have noticed that one wriggling body is replaced by two. But they don\u0027t both become a new worm. While earthworms can regenerate tissue, a tail will only grow back from the half that contains the head.The other half may wriggle for a time due to nerves in the tissue still firing, but it will not regenerate into a new worm.Claim: White sand is made of fish wasteTrueYes, the white famous beaches of the Males are one giant accumulation of fish excrement. But not just any old fish — this sand is formed by the bumphead parrotfish, which feeds almost entirely on coral that contains a tasty type of algae. The coral is chewed into dust and excreted as a fine sand. One fish can produce 90kg of sand a year.Claim: Wasps target human beingsFalseIt may seem like wasps are out to sting you and ruin your picnic, but there\u0027s an explanation for their actions. Worker wasps spend their lives seeking high-protein foods, such as insects, to feed the colony\u0027s young. But, when the last brood has been raised and the worker\u0027s job is done, they look for sugary foods to sustain themselves.    Undoubtedly one of the strangest things people have done to elicit a recreational high is to lick a toad. File photoClaim: Flirty monkeys soak their fur in urineTrueCapuchin monkeys found in forests in Central and South America go to great lengths to woo a mate. One method used by males is to urinate into their paws and rub it into their fur.Females can sniff out the testosterone levels in urine to identify sexually mature males — as well as determining the male\u0027s status in their group\u0027s hierarchy. High levels of testosterone often correspond to a high social status.Claim: An anteater uses its nose to suck up antsFalseThe anteater\u0027s long snout in fact contains both its mouth and nose. If an anteater used its nose to inhale ants, the insects would bite and sting the inside of the nasal canals. Instead, anteaters use their long tongues of up to 60cm, which can be flicked up to 160 times per minute, to lap up the ants before swallowing them.Claim: Octopuses have detachable penisesTrueWhen a male argonaut octopus spots a mate, it launches its \u0027penis\u0027 — a sperm-filled tentacle — in the direction of the female.This appendage \u0027swims\u0027 towards the female, attaches to a mantle behind her head and is stored in a cavity. Females can store the sperm of multiple males in these cavities to fertilise their eggs.Unfortunately for the male argonauts, they die shortly after detaching their appendage.Claim: Male seahorses can give birthTrueMale seahorses are equipped with a stomach pouch resembling that of a kangaroo. After a courtship dance, the female will deposit eggs in the pouch to be fertilised.The male is able to regulate the temperature of the pouch — as well as transfer nutrients through its skin to the eggs. While the male is incubating the eggs, the female produces more to replace those that will hatch from the pouch.Claim: Camels store water in their humpsFalseCamels can survive for more than ten days without water, but it\u0027s not because they carry fluid in their humps.The hump is where the camel accumulates fat. Distributing fat around the body would, in desert climes, raise the animal\u0027s body temperature to dangerously high levels.So how do camels stay hydrated? In addition to having coats and nostrils that have evolved to limit sweating, they drink very quickly, gulping down 200 litres of water in just three minutes.Claim: All birds are monogamousFalseApproximately 92 per cent of the nearly 10,000 species of bird on our planet exhibit a form of monogamy — but a minority do not.For instance, DNA analysis of blue tits suggests that up to half of eggs in a nest belong to a male other than the one tending them as part of the pair.          The belief that earwigs like to burrow into our ears dates back to the writings of Roman author and naturalist Pliny the Elder. File photoClaim: Polar bears eat penguinsFalsePolar bears eat seals, rodents and fish, but not penguins.This is not because polar bears don\u0027t like the taste of them. It\u0027s just that polar bears are found in the Arctic Circle in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas penguins are almost entirely native to the Southern Hemisphere.Claim: Vulture excrement kills bacteriaFalseVultures defecate on to their legs. Some ornithologists claim this kills any bacteria that the birds may have picked up from standing and feeding among dead and decaying carcasses.However, this is not true. Vultures don\u0027t have sweat glands, so they need another way to cool off. Their legs are well-supplied with blood vessels lying close to the surface of their skin and, as the liquid waste evaporates, it helps them lose heat and remain cool.Claim: Horses are unable to vomitTrueWhen human beings vomit, our stomach is squeezed between the organs in our abdomen and diaphragm, therefore expelling its contents.However, horses can\u0027t do this because they have a powerful valve at the bottom of the oesophagus that prevents food rising up through their gastrointestinal tract.Claim: Some newts stab themselves to deter predatorsTrueIn 1879, Franz Leydig, a German zoologist, observed an unusual trait in the Iberian ribbed newt. When startled, he noted, sharp spines suddenly appeared along its sides.In fact, they are the newt\u0027s ribs, which force their way through the skin to make it harder for predators to swallow them.Fortunately for the newt, it also has a remarkable ability to repair the broken skin afterwards. From True Or Poo?

On the last leg of the visit, the Prince of Wales will speak at the International Conference Centre at the invitation of President Nana Akufo-Addo.While he will mainly use it to pay tribute to Ghana’s role in the Commonwealth, Charles was keen to reference the slave trade in Ghana and Britain and Europe’s role in it.He also wanted to use the occasion to highlight Britain’s determination to tackle modern slavery.The prince was visibly moved by a visit to Fort Christiansborg in Osu, a suburb of the capital Accra, during which he was told of its chilling history.Built in 1661, the fort – also known as Osu Castle – was used by the Danes to hold slaves before they were sent to the New World.In the 19th century, it became the headquarters of the local British government.Colombian star of Royal Ballet reveals he used...How the nation will remember next week: Hour-by-hour what\u0027s...Share this article    The Prince of Wales will mainly use his speech to pay tribute to Ghana’s role in the Commonwealth (pictured being greeted by dancers at Fort Christiansborg in Accra, Ghana)    Meghan and her mother Doria RaglandIn an unprecedented step, the Duchess of Sussex’s mother is expected to fly in from the US to spend Christmas with the Queen.Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland, 62, is said to have been invited to Sandringham to join her daughter and the rest of the Royal Family.The honour was not extended to Carole and Michael Middleton, parents of the Duchess of Cambridge.A royal source said it was ‘a very thoughtful gesture’, adding: ‘It’s a mark of the Queen’s respect for Meghan and an acknowledgement that she doesn’t have any other relations in this country – unlike Kate, who has a very close family.’The Middletons have joined the Queen at church on Christmas morning, but stayed with William.                                                     At the bottom were dungeons in which enslaved Africans were kept for up to six months as they awaited transportation.During a sombre moment in searing heat, Charles paused at the foot of the stairs, known as ‘the door of no return’, to reflect on the fort’s horrific past.In his speech today, he is expected to say: ‘The histories of our two nations are closely intertwined, and while today we enjoy shared opportunity, we can never forget that our past has sometimes borne witness to tragedy and loss and, at times, profound injustice. At Osu Castle, it was especially important to me – as indeed it was on my first visit there 41 years ago – that I should acknowledge the most painful chapter of Ghana’s relations with the nations of Europe, including the United Kingdom. The appalling atrocity of the slave trade, and the unimaginable suffering it caused, left an indelible stain on the history of our world.‘While Britain can be proud that it later led the way in the abolition of this shameful trade, we have a shared responsibility to ensure that the abject horror of slavery is never forgotten, that we abhor the existence of modern slavery and that we robustly promote and defend the values which today make it incomprehensible, to most of us, that human beings could ever treat each other with such utter inhumanity.’Charles will also pay tribute to the strength of the relationship between the UK and Ghana.He is keen to highlight the country’s role in the Commonwealth and stress how, by acting within the organisation, it can play an important role over environmental issues and rapid urbanisation.He will also acknowledge Ghana as an example to the region and to the world of a stable democracy, a beacon of tolerance and ersity.In his speech, the prince is expected to say: ‘The Commonwealth should strive for renewed relevance in the lives of its citizens and should draw upon its unparalleled networks of professional expertise, to offer practical solutions to some of the most pressing challenges of our time, many of which are increasingly deep seated and deeply integrated.‘No issue is more pressing than that of climate change.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Schoolboy aged 30 told pupils married father two","story":"    Parents complained after a photograph of the pupil was posted online.

Operation Tabarin, which lasted form 1943-1945, was a Royal Navy undertaking to occupy British Antarctic Territories and to deny access to enemy ships and submarines          Operation Tabarin is without doubt one of the most significant expeditions of what might be described as the ‘post-Heroic’ phase of Antarctic exploration ultimately it would develop into the British Antarctic Survey, arguably the most important and enduring of all government-sponsored programs of research in the Antarctic.

Operation Tabarin was a monumental event in UK Antarctic history, paving the way for the scientific excellence that has made the UK a world leader in Antarctic science Operation Tabarin was an expedition to secretly establish bases, keep a watchful eye on German and Japanese activities, and curb opportunistic Argentinian incursions.Lead botanist Ivan Mackenzie Lamb\u0027s account of the expedition provides a fascinating insight into the top secret military operation.He was a member of the naval party that established three manned bases and remained in the field throughout the operation\u0027s two-year duration as he took part in all three major sledging expeditions.Russian warplane swoops in uninvited to spy on NATO\u0027s...Vikings conquered treacherous seas and created a formidable...At the going down of the sun, Tower of London Beefeaters...Share this article    Surveying at the foot of the Wall Range, Wiencke Island. Operation Tabarin was the first of a series of British Antarctic naval expeditions, later known as the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey and subsequently the British Antarctic Survey.Operation Tabarin had its origins in the territorial tension that had been mounting since the beginning of the 20th Century.Britain’s indifference to the loss of the Scottish Antarctic Expeditions’ meteorological station, built in 1903 and given to Argentina in 1904, led to increasing challenges to Britain’s claims of sovereignty over the Falkland Islands Territories. This had been exacerbated as the whaling industry took off in Antarctica, when Britain had begun charging for whaling licences to the dismay of Argentina and leading to several Argentinean diplomatic notes being sent to Britain asserting their territorial claims in the area. Operation Tabarin was led by Lieutenant James Marr, a Marine Zoologist. Determined to make the most of this naval operation, Marr recruited scientists from the armed forces to expand on research that had been carried out in Antarctica before the war, mainly in survey, biology, geology and meteorology, and formed the 14-man expedition team that was to set off for Antarctica.HMS Bransfield left Tilbury Docks in November 1943, but the ship had to be abandoned at Falmouth. However thanks to the Highland Monarch, a luxury passenger liner now transporting troops to the Falkland Islands, the expedition finally set sail on 14 December and arrived at Stanley in the Falkland Islands on 26 January 1944. By the end of 1944, plans to establish the main base of operations at Hope Bay early in 1945 were well underway, with Marr now also planning to establish a base on Stonington Island.On 14 January 1946, after a frustrating and ill-informed wait, the men were unexpectedly relieved and, after loading up themselves and their supplies, and leaving members of the new team to settle in, arrived at Deception Island the next day. By 16 January they were back at Port Lockroy to relieve the team there, and left the next day with stores including penguins bound for London Zoo. On 21 January 1946 the men arrived back in the Falkland Islands, and by 11 February were on their way back to Britain. On arrival in London on 9 March 1946, and with their request for a salary advance ignored, three of the men with no friends or family in London were forced to sleep rough that first night. With little mention made of their return, the men submitted their reports and then went their separate ways. Source: The UK Antarctic Heritage Trust                                                              Andrew Taylor and Lamb. Taylor, a surveyor from the Royal Canadian Engineers, led the second year of the expedition, establishing Hope Bay (Base D) as the centre for dog-sledge-based fieldwork on the mainland          The buildings at Port Lockroy were unoccupied for over 30 years until 1996, when they were restored to their original 1962 condition by the British Antarctic Survey.

It is flat, agricultural country, a landscape of straight lines: ploughed fields, a wide horizon, overhead wires, the long trundle of the old Roman road, the Via Aemilia, and the parallel rush of the A14 motorway. It is the landscape of his photographs, too, in which he has summoned up not the picture-postcard version of Italy, with its pretty countryside and medieval towns, but the peripheral, the overlooked and ordinary: the hastily built agricultural building by the highway the straggle of buildings at the edge of town that the visitor usually rushes past. Even when he does venture into the centre – as in a series of images of Cesena from the early 1980s – he offers it up to the viewer as defiantly ungrand, shabby, a place like any other.A new book, Per Strada (On the Roads), which is accompanied by a small exhibition in London, draws together more than 200 photographs from the 1980s and 90s of this closely observed territory. He might show the corner of a rather plain church with a municipal rubbish bin shouldering into the shot or heaps of blackened, weeks-old snow in front of a dingy palazzo with a bricked-up window or the shuttered, blinded facade of a tobacconist’s with a shadow playing delicately over it.For many years, eschewing digital technology, Guidi has mostly used a large-format, 25 x 20cm camera – the biggest and bulkiest he can carry on his own, he says, its negatives the same size as the resulting print. The detail is vast. In a photograph of an ordinary glass-fronted door there is such a material density to the cracked paint on its frame, the brass fittings of its lock, that the fact of the print’s shiny flatness is almost overwhelmed. Reflected in the glass of the door is the image of a tree, slightly distorted by the faint curvature of the pane, and beneath it the ghostly faces of two children flanking the enigmatic black blob of the camera itself.Guidi is a small, neat man in Le Corbusier-style black glasses who speaks in immensely quiet, allusive sentences. He often quotes other photographers – Walker Evans, Lee Friedlander, Stephen Shore or his fellow Italian, Luigi Ghirri – or refers to the artists of the 15th century, such as Brunelleschi, Uccello and Fra Angelico, of whom he has an encyclopedic knowledge. We speak in his studio – in his house which he shares with his wife, Marta over dinner at a nearby restaurant and finally, over lunch in a local citizens’ club. In these places he is greeted affectionately and sometimes teasingly by other elderly men, most of whom he has known his entire life.He relates his scrutiny of his territory’s edgelands and peripheries to the facts of his own life. “I was born in the countryside,” he says. “There was not yet this ‘edgeland’, but biography and geography are bound together.” Gradually, the margins of Cesena crept outwards and enveloped his home. The motorway was built close by you can see its slip-road arching away, only 100 metres or so from his driveway.“The history of the city is like an egg,” he says. “The ancient city was like a boiled egg, with clear edges bound by walls. Then the city became a fried egg, its edges spread out. Nowadays, it is a scrambled egg, with no form.” When he was a student, studying design and architecture in Venice in the 50s, “we used to talk about this non-shape of the contemporary city. We were thinking about how to represent this city without form in art.” Anyway, he points out, the periphery is not an objective point: one person’s periphery is another’s centre, and “the centre is where you are”. He adds: “If you want, there is a subtle political message – though I would put it no more strongly than that – in my choosing to photograph this room, or one of my neighbour’s houses.”In this age of the scrambled-egg town, the centre is where the old monuments are, but not, for the most part, people’s lives. And, while he acknowledges the importance of photography that captures great historical dramas – political speeches, wars – his work insists on the importance, even transcendence, of the apparently unremarkable. He mentions a recent exhibition in nearby Ravenna devoted to the work of Magnum photographer Alex Majoli, who was born and studied in the city he is known for his work in conflicts such as the Afghanistan war. “There wasn’t a single photograph of Ravenna in the exhibition,” says Guidi, in wonderment.The photographs are often grouped in sequences, so that turning the pages of Per Strada you see a procession of similar shots following one from the other, or sometimes a single building shot from slightly different angles. (One series of his photographs, not part of this latest book, consists of 16 images taken in an empty room in Treviso during a single day all that changes is that the square of light thrown from the window travels around the room). These sequences partly reflect the rhythm of his work. With his heavy camera it takes time to set up each shot, and his process is measured and slow compared with the speed at which photographers shooting digitally can work. “Many times I’m not looking when I press the shutter,” he says. “Chance is very important.” He doesn’t crop: there’s a kind of rigorous honesty to the pictures.Above all, the photographs argue against the idea of a “decisive moment”, to quote the title of Henri Cartier-Bresson’s most famous book – they refute the notion that the photographer’s job is to capture a turning point, a denouement, to depress the shutter at the moment that captures the essence of an event or scene. According to Guidi: “All moments are decisive – and none.” His work is not about the decisive moment but the “provisional moment” – the idea that this moment is one of a procession of many. Very often, they show some kind of aperture – a doorway, a window, the arches of a portico, even the edge of the lens itself. “It’s part of the game,” he says. “After all, a photograph is a frame, and if you put a frame in the picture, you are suggesting that this is not the whole world, that there is something outside.” It’s another form of honesty. With these gentle reminders that the picture is just a picture, he is showing his workings and hinting at his own subjectivity.One of the photographs in the book and exhibition stands apart from the others. It’s not a landscape, but a still life: a dish of impossibly scarlet cherries sitting on a copy of the newspaper La Repubblica. You can’t see the date on the paper, deliberately (though in fact the photograph was taken in 1985, and one of the headlines refers to that year’s Italian presidential election). At one point, Guidi says that he considered using the image as a kind of frontispiece for the whole book. The image is a memento mori: those cherries will rot, that paper will be out of date tomorrow. That effect is all the more accentuated because, like all of the photos in the book, it was taken several decades ago: these other things too have passed, long ago. It’s a reminder that memory and the photographic image are inextricably bound together. As Susan Sontag once wrote: “To remember is, more and more, not to recall a story but to be able to call up a picture.” Guidi says: “All photographs are monuments. If you photograph this cup on the table, for example, it gives it importance. And over time, photographs become more and more like monuments.” In the case of Guidi’s pictures, modest monuments to the dignity of the everyday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d33e2cbb6d2170cd0fb88496f5b4cd7976117b98/77_152_1267_760/master/1267.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dbfd6b6c4405e911ccd5106b46d1258","title":"the fashion photography of marilyn stafford in pictures","story":"As a freelance photojournalist based in Paris in the 1950s and early 1960s, Stafford covered fashion assignments from the established haute couture houses of the 50s to the birth of prêt-à-porter, moving to London in the 60s -where as one of a small number of female photographers she helped to pave the way for future women working on Fleet Street"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe4ef1f6f78424cae43ce48f395858bf6998a3a3/0_5_1803_1082/master/1803.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84aeb4f05c0409960a8870576dbbb363","title":"crawshaw butcher jobs administration stores","story":"Yorkshire-based business closes distribution centre and two-thirds of its storesMore than 350 jobs have been lost at Crawshaw Group after the Yorkshire-based chain of butchers went into administration and shut two-thirds of its stores.It is the latest high street retailer to go bust after Evans Cycles, House of Fraser, Toys R Us and Maplin, while a string of other well-known names have shut dozens of stores via an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement.Crawshaw, which was founded in 1954, said it appointed Ernst \u0026amp Young as administrators on Friday. It shut 35 stores and its distribution centre at Astley, with the loss of 354 jobs.The remaining 19 stores and Crawshaw’s other distribution centre at Hellaby remain open and continue to employ 261 people. The firm is continuing its trial of three butcher’s counters in Spar stores.The administrators have put the business and assets up for sale and have begun talks with interested parties “with a view to agreeing a sale over the coming weeks”.Crawshaw was forced into administration after several years of losses and the failure to raise more money from shareholders to fund a revamp of the business.Along with other high street retailers, Crawshaw has been hit by rising rents, higher business rates and fragile consumer confidence in the run-up to Brexit. It has also been under pressure from the rise of the discount supermarket chains Aldi and Lidl, which have forced other supermarkets and Crawshaw to cut prices.The company has 42 high street shops and 12 factory outlets across the Midlands and north of England. Of the 19 stores that are still trading, nine are factory stores.Its new chief executive Jim Viggars, who took over in May, had plans to open more of those larger out-of-town shops, with parking, that sell big packs of fresh meat.

He will also travel to Jaywick Sands in Essex, the UK’s most deprived neighbourhood, which last week was used in an political advert for the Republican party in the US midterm elections as an example of extreme social decay.His inquiry will assess whether government policies introduced in recent years breach international human rights standards to which the UK is a signatory, including the rights to food, housing and decent living standards. He will also try to assess the impact of Brexit on poverty.“The United Kingdom is one of the richest countries in the world, but millions of people are still living in poverty there,” he said.A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions said it was “committed to upholding the rule of law and rules-based international systems”. It insisted that on an absolute measure of poverty a million fewer people and children were living in hardship compared with 2010.Alston has received nearly 300 submissions from charities, poverty experts and iniduals living on the breadline – a record for a UN poverty audit – and said they “make clear many people are really struggling to make ends meet”.The visit comes at a time of rising political concern about the effects of years of public spending cuts. Last month Theresa May pledged to end a decade of austerity, in part a response to increasing public disquiet over the rollout of universal credit, rising homelessness and destitution, and relentless cuts to social care, council services, schools, police and prisons.Alston said it was important to track the human rights consequences of the UK government’s economic decisions. “Policies of austerity are commonly executed only in response to requirements by the International Monetary Fund or an external source,” he said. “They haven’t been adopted by governments as a concerted and deliberate economic policy.”Ministers will be braced for criticism from Alston, although his recommendations are not binding. His presence in the UK is likely to provoke outrage from right-wing media and politicians. Five years ago criticisms of the bedroom tax after a visit by the UN’s then housing rights envoy, Raquel Rolnik, were aggressively dismissed by ministers as a “misleading Marxist diatribe”.Alston sparked a furious reaction from Donald Trump’s administration earlier this year when he published a withering inquiry report accusing the US president of pursuing policies that deliberately forced millions of Americans into financial ruin while lavishing vast riches on the super-wealthy.He described policies introduced or proposed by Trump – including cuts to food stamps, social housing subsidies, and healthcare – as “a systematic attack on America’s welfare program that is undermining the social safety net for those who can’t cope on their own”.The UK government formally accepted Alston’s request for an official visit in December 2017, but it is not yet clear which – if any – UK government minister he will meet. He is scheduled to meet Welsh and Scottish ministers in Cardiff and Edinburgh.Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said Alston’s tour would reveal an affluent country with a growing child poverty crisis. “It is important to shine a light on child poverty in the UK and there is plenty of evidence to keep him busy during his stay,” she said.Food banks and an increase in rough sleeping on the streets of Britain have made rising destitution more visible. Destitution is extreme poverty defined as a regular lack of food, adequate clothing and shelter. About 1.5 million people, including 350,000 children, experienced destitution in 2017, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1c1289f53d79f91d8286718f6ad8a1a4ed4ff47/0_0_5049_3030/master/5049.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfb849bb7f488dd526632d91ab0a6e68","title":"andrew marr arron banks bbc brexit","story":"Among his many skills and talents, Andrew Marr does not count that of forensic accounting. That was obvious – unfortunately – to anyone watching his interview with Brexit financier Arron Banks. As predicted by myself, by Carole Cadwalladr and by many others the interview failed to land a punch. Instead, it provided Banks with a platform from which to attack his accusers and muddy the waters. This was not public interest journalism, it was carnival. And it did a great deal of damage.There are those who find such criticism of the BBC, and of its editorial decisions, distasteful. “Careful, Andrew,” they say to me, even as more often than not they agree with the substance of my case, “you don’t want to damage Auntie, we could end up with the Beeb being run by Murdoch!” Well I certainly want no such thing. But recently, and particularly on the issues surrounding Brexit, it has frankly been hard to see what difference it would make.The Banks broadcast is far from being an anomaly. The BBC is consistently manipulated by Brexiteers into providing them with false parity in arguments where their views add nothing, represent nobody and are demonstrably and factually wrong. Nigel Farage – the former leader of a party that polls in single figures and has no MPs – has appeared on Question Time disproportionately often. Brexit campaigners are paraded constantly across the airwaves to spout nonsense and lies about the single market, the customs union and – most unforgivably – the Irish border. Day after day BBC Radio’s flagship show – Today – descends into surrealist farce as John Humphrys seems to bark inanities at anyone presenting an evidenced argument against Brexit.On top of these errors – made by taking the name of balance in vain and not unlike the practice of inviting climate-change sceptics to debate Nobel-winning scientists – is the BBC’s institutional determination to declare the existential questions of Brexit answered.The BBC political editor’s immediate reaction to an investigation into allegations of criminal offences by Banks – which he denies– was to write that it was “unlikely” to affect Brexit. A tad premature, to say the least. And it is because of this instinct – to get it “over and done with” – that the BBC has so consistently failed in its coverage of the campaign for a people’s vote. Farage gets more coverage for a stunt throwing fish out of a boat – accompanied by a couple of fishermen and an entire school of journalists – than the People’s Vote campaign does for any of our many regional events and action days that attract volunteers in their hundreds.These blind spots are undermining the BBC as an institution. They have deformed its news output and led to catastrophically bad decisions – which have normalised fringe politics and given false weight to outright lies. I don’t criticise the BBC lightly or with any joy. I do so because it is getting it badly wrong – for itself and for us all. If the BBC expects to continue to enjoy public funds and public trust it needs – urgently – to examine its conscience and its output. It is not “balance” to invite contributors to mislead your audience. It isn’t “public interest journalism” to offer Banks a platform to attack his accusers and investigators. And it is not the responsibility of progressives and liberals to keep quiet in the face of such terrible judgment – either out of loyalty or from fear of what might replace the beloved BBC. It is our job to call it out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c555b01b6c8f21124bca393d582e629c4a41599/81_173_4726_2835/master/4726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94f203e22901ac1fb560a9d4dc496381","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of miniature","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘miniature’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment in the Observer New Review is ‘miniature’.

I hope that the principles and advice we have provided for schools will help them to question their current practice to change this.”The report recommends that the DfE should not request regular attainment data from schools other than its statutory requirements, while Ofsted inspectors should examine if a school’s data collections are efficient.In its response, the DfE said it “accepts all of the recommendations in this report in full. We have acknowledged that data management is a cause of unnecessary workload in schools.”Damian Hinds, the education secretary, signalled his commitment by signing a joint letter alongside Amanda Spielman, the head of Ofsted, as well as leaders of the Association of School and College Leaders and the National Association of Head Teachers.The letter, to be sent to every school leader in England, has “a straightforward message” that headteachers and managers who want to cut back on unnecessary workload will be supported. “None of us wants staff in schools to feel like they are drowning in unnecessary and meaningless data,” the letter states.Tackling excessive workload is a key plank in the government’s drive to improve teacher retention. But it came under attack from Labour for continuing cuts to school budgets, including a failure to fully fund the recent pay rise awarded to teachers.Labour said analysis of research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies revealed that annual spending on schools would be £1.7bn higher in 2019-20 if funding per pupil had been maintained in real terms since 2015.Angela Rayner, Labour’s shadow education secretary, said the cuts made a mockery of chancellor Philip Hammond’s “little extra” for schools in the recent budget.“Instead of offering a sticking plaster to schools this government should be genuinely investing in them, reversing their unjustifiable cuts,” Rayner said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a458788a3fcbf3011a9061549c45c34a7925099a/24_0_3453_2072/master/3453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ca3a77f12f9ed34922e1fa1abeaa338","title":"childhood obesity linked to air pollution from vehicles","story":"Research suggests first year ‘critical window’ in which toxic air can increase weight gainEarly exposure to air pollution from vehicles increases the risk of children becoming obese, new research has found.High levels of nitrogen dioxide, which is emitted by diesel engines, in the first year of life led to significantly faster weight gain later, the scientists found. Other pollutants produced by road traffic have also been linked to obesity in children by recent studies.Nitrogen dioxide pollution is at illegal levels in most urban areas in the UK and the government has lost three times in the high court over the inadequacy of its plans. The pollutant also plagues many cities in Europe and around the world.A large recent study found toxic air significantly increases the risk of low birth weight, leading to lifelong damage to health. Others linked air pollution with birth defects, cot deaths and the first direct evidence of pollution particles in mothers’ placentas has also been revealed.The new research, published in the journal Environmental Health, followed 2,318 children in southern California and built on earlier work which had identified traffic pollution as a major risk factor for the development of obesity in children.The research investigated the impact of air pollution from busy main roads, where diesel trucks are common, in the crucial first year of life. They found that by age 10, children suffering high early exposure were almost 1kg heavier on average than those with low exposure. The scientists took a series of other factors into account, including gender, ethnicity and parental education, and think it is unlikely that variations in diet could explain the strong link found.Other pollutants emitted by vehicles have also been linked to childhood obesity. A 2017 study in Boston implicated particulate pollution, while a 2012 study in New York City found the same for children exposed to polyaromatic hydrocarbons while in the womb.The new research was not able to examine how air pollution increases weight gain in the children, but Kim said inflammation was a possibility: “The most common thought is inflammation of body systems like the lungs which may spill over into the entire body – the brain which regulates appetite and changes in fat metabolism.”“This study showing an association between increased body mass in children and exposure to air pollution from roads is important since it is compatible with previous studies showing an association between type 2 diabetes and air pollution in adults,” said Prof Jonathan Grigg, at Queen Mary University London and not involved in the research.“However, more research is needed to explain how toxins inhaled into the lungs affect fat cells throughout the body,” he said. In mice experiments, brain inflammation caused by air pollution has been shown to result in anxiety-induced overeating.A separate new study on asthma, a disease long linked to air pollution and that is the most common chronic respiratory disease in the world, has estimated that between 9m and 33m emergency visits to hospital result from dirty air every year."},{"url":null,"title":"air pollution everything you should know about a public health emergency","story":"It isn’t just car fumes that fill our urban centres with particles. Why is air pollution on the rise, who does it affect most – and what can we do about it?Nothing is more vital to life than breathing: in a lifetime, about 250m litres of air passes through your lungs. Yet walk along a busy city street and you will inhale something like 20m particles in a single lungful.Toxic air is now the biggest environmental risk of early death, responsible for one in nine of all fatalities. It kills 7 million people a year, far more than HIV, tuberculosis and malaria combined, for example. Dr Maria Neira, the World Health Organisation director with responsibility for air pollution, is blunt: “It is a global public health emergency.”The lost lives and ill health caused are also a colossal economic burden: $225bn in lost labour income in 2013, or $5.11tn per year (about $1m a minute), if welfare losses are added in, according to a 2016 World Bank report, which called the figure “a sobering wake-up call”.Air pollution is getting worse in the developing world and, while it is getting better in some developed nations, our knowledge of how comprehensively it damages our bodies and minds is growing even faster.Dirty air has been with us for centuries – previously, we simply lived with it – and no one has yet had air pollution as a cause of death on their death certificate. It is only in recent decades that the damage to health has become clear, and in recent years that the health crisis has received widespread attention, thanks to research revelations, government legal defeats and the Volkswagen diesel scandal.But there is a silver lining to air pollution’s cloud of smog: action to cut it not only brings immediate benefits but also helps fight climate change in the longer term.India has almost half of the top 50 most polluted cities in the world, China has eight and Iran has three. Africa is highly polluted but little measured: in 2015 Paris had three times more monitoring stations than the entire continent.Children’s developing bodies are uniquely vulnerable, but 300 million live in places with extreme air pollution, where toxic fumes are six times higher than international guidelines.Yes. The most damaging but best understood are tiny particles. These not only damage the lungs, but enter the bloodstream. They are increasingly thought to enter vital organs, including the brain and have been shown the reach the liver, spleen, kidneys and testes in lab animals.The particles can be made of black carbon, nitrates, sulphates, ammonia or mineral dust. Most are produced by burning fossil fuels or wood, for driving, heating, power plants and industry.While improvements have been made in some countries, for example, to coal-fired power stations and cars, other sources have lagged behind. Farming is one such source of pollution, with ammonia from livestock manure and fertilisers blowing into cities and forming particles, particularly in spring time when crops are sown and muck is spread.Nitrogen dioxide, produced by diesel vehicles, not only forms particles but is now known to cause harm when breathed as a gas. It is still illegally high in much of urban Britain, for example, where it results in about 23,500 early deaths.There are some natural sources of outdoor air pollution, such as dust storms and smoke from forest fires, but human-caused pollution far exceeds these. Outdoor air pollution causes 4.2 million early deaths, according to the WHO.This is also a huge killer, causing 3.8 million early deaths. (Some people are exposed to both indoor and outdoor pollution). Half the world’s population cook on open fires with dirty fuels such as wood, dung and charcoal, and kerosene in wick lamps also produces dangerous smoke.Increasingly, it is easier to ask what harm does air pollution not do. Research is now linking toxic air not only to almost every part of the body, but also to the mind.The dangers of toxic air are a surprisingly recent discovery. The landmark research linking air pollution to lung diseases, heart attacks and strokes – the Harvard six cities study – was first published in 1993. Since then dirty air has been linked to many other conditions, such as diabetes. Air pollution contributed to 3.2m new cases of this illness in 2016, according to one study. Kidney disease appears to be influenced by air pollution, as does Alzheimer’s disease. The skin is affected too, ageing more rapidly in dirty air.The research on babies and children is particularly worrying. A large recent study found toxic air significantly increases the risk of low birth weight, leading to lifelong damage to health. The doctors involved called this finding alone “something approaching a public health catastrophe”.Millions of premature births may be linked to air pollution another study makes the connection to birth defects and another to cot deaths. The first direct evidence of pollution particles in mothers’ placentas has also been revealed. “It is a worrying problem – there is a massive association between air pollution a mother breathes in and the effect it has on the foetus,” said the lead researcher.As children grow, asthma and stunted lung growth is a serious issue linked to air pollution, as is the ability to learn in school and the risk of teenage delinquency.The estimated annual death toll of 7 million is certain to be an underestimation, as it only includes particle pollution and the five most firmly linked causes of death, such as heart attacks. Early estimates using improved models suggest a total figure of 9 million from particle pollution.But even this is only “the tip of the iceberg” of harm, according to researchers. That is because the ubiquitous exposure to air pollution is likely to damage the health of almost everyone in some way, even if it doesn’t lead to a visit to the doctor.The rise of concern over air pollution has prompted a plethora of protection products. Masks are now commonly advertised, but experts say they are of limited use unless they have an airtight seal on the face, which is rare.Giant towers, street-side benches and living, green walls have all been proposed to filter dirty air. A new bus aims to filter the air in Southampton, UK, as it travels. Trees can help too, unless they block the breezes that blow pollution away, in which case they make things worse.Other suggestions are pollution-monitoring apps, so people can choose to avoid the worst times, and alternative city walking routes that keep pedestrians away from the filthiest roads.People in cars are often exposed to more pollution than those outside, as fumes become trapped in the cabin. Closing the air circulation in your car before hitting the city centre is certainly a good idea.There is also some evidence that omega oils and vitamin B may offer some protection against the damage caused by air pollution.Yes. The only practical way to tackle the global health emergency is to cut levels of pollution at source. There is an ethical angle too, says Dr Gary Fuller, at Kings College London: “Morally it is not right to make the victims change their behaviour, instead of the culprits.”Poorer people are also most exposed to air pollution. “There are huge injustices at the heart of the air pollution problem,”’ says Fuller. “By using our air to dispose of their waste, polluters are destroying a shared resource and avoiding the full cost of their actions.”The solutions are simultaneously perfectly possible and incredibly hard, because they require little new technology but involve action across many areas, and are usually neither politically palatable – yet – or very profitable to implement.“There are two big transitions we need to have,” says Neira. “One is a healthy energy transition and the other is the healthy urban planning transition. We need to stop the use of coal, to stop the massive use of private cars in cities and make our buildings more efficient.”Coal burning is declining globally and China has shown how industrial pollution can be rapidly curbed. Particle pollution is down by a third, just four years after a “war on pollution” was declared, and eight after Beijing’s air was labelled “crazy bad” when pollution leapt off the charts. But cities around the world are expanding rapidly, with 4.2 billion urban dwellers set to swell to 6.7 billion by 2050.How those expanded cities are constructed is vital, say experts like Fuller: “We will pay a heavy price if we get it wrong now.”. Mobility should focus on walking, cycling and public transport - even electric vehicles throw up particle pollution from road abrasion and brake dust. The remaining cars and lorries need to be set - and stick to - much stricter pollution controls.Buildings ought to be heated and cooled using renewable energy and waste should not be burned without stringent controls.Progress is being made in some places. Some Dutch and Danish towns have turned their back on cars and Seoul in South Korea has demolished 15 expressways in favour of bus lanes and a new river. But some motoring lobbies and car manufacturers remain obstacles to citizens breathing clean air.Neira, a former health minister in Spain, says politicians should play the health card to win the argument: “If you reduce cases of asthma, everybody will love it.” Other reasons for action are the climate change benefits of cutting coal, oil and gas burning and the reduction in obesity that follows more active travel, such as cycling.What must be done to end the air pollution emergency is not the issue, says Neira, it is the lack of serious political will: “There are plenty of ideas and solutions. It takes leadership.”The Lancet Commission on pollution and health (2017) The Cost of Air Pollution Strengthening the Economic Case for Action, World Bank and University of Washington, Seattle, 2016* This article was amended on 5 November 2018 to correctly state the title of Dr Gary Fuller."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fd26645e1a00b2b637181af08e3003449ed8563/0_75_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5484cded5bf114ea6ce43308c64bd53e","title":"how to eat chicken soup","story":"As autumn begins to bite, How to Eat is cooking up a hearty, rugged broth with, of course, bread and butter on the side. Is there any other way to enjoy it?The big coats are out and the nights are drawing in. Winter is coming. It is time to seek comfort in warming, hearty one-pots – and, in particular, the restorative power of chicken soup.The jury is very much out on whether the subject of this month’s How to Eat (HTE) might “do stuff” to you medicinally – the so-called Jewish penicillin likely exerts a strong placebo effect – but as we shiver through chilly commutes, hacking and coughing our way towards Christmas, arriving home to a steaming bowl of chicken soup indisputably lifts the soul.That bone broth warms the marrow. But only if it is done properly, which is where HTE – the series examining how best to eat Britain’s favourite dishes – comes in. So what is the ultimate expression of chicken soup?For sanity’s sake, this piece will limit itself to chicken soup prepared in a broadly European and North American style. Not out of chauvinism, much less xenophobia. But simply because exploring the full panoply of Asian, African and Latin American chicken soups in a way that does them justice would make this article balloon into an unmanageable, indigestible sprawl. An epic so vast it would make War and Peace (that “loose, baggy monster”, as Henry James put it) look like an offhand tweet.Bits. It should have bits in it. This broth should be dense, with visible pieces of chicken, vegetables, pulses and pasta. You may not be able to stand your spoon in it, but your spoon should definitely encounter some firm resistance. That heft, that ruggedness is central to this soup’s ability to banish the blues – both in the solidity and safety it suggests, and in the textural and flavour variation it provides in each mouthful. You need to chew here. Think of it as rewarding work. Eating chicken soup should feel like you are taking on a hot, generously filling fuel, laying down essential fat and protein for the cruel winter ahead (hence a gelatinous bone-broth base, speckled with globules of fat, is preferable).Chicken soup should never be smooth. Cream of chicken soup, that pallid, sweet concoction – that looks more like a milkshake and in which the chicken meat has invariably gone AWOL – is utterly childish. It may sound more sophisticated, but chicken soup given the velouté treatment is similarly vapid. A velouté might be a smart way to showcase a single vegetable (say, Jerusalem artichoke), but its silky mouthfeel is jarring in a context where you want body, chunks, meat. Similarly, there is something eerie about clear chicken consommés. That is an awful lot of cheffy work for a soup that will leave any right-thinking diner asking: where’s the rest of it? It is as if someone has stolen, if not chicken soup’s soul, then its crown jewels.Soup served in a cup will always, as Danny Dyer might put it, leave you feeling mugged off. The idea that all soups should be blended into a smoothly drinkable texture is infantile, and there is something about hurriedly slurping down gulps of warm, viscous savoury liquid (in contrast to the way a spoon moderates the pace of consumption) that is actively nauseating.Ideally, chicken soup should be served in a wide, deep bowl and consumed with a round soup spoon (using an oval dessert spoon, on the basis that it is more elegant, is a real Hyacinth Bucket move). Such a bowl retains its heat, acts as a reassuring visual representation of how thoroughly your hunger will be sated and gives you plenty of space to root around.Likewise, there is no practical reason to tilt the bowl away from you as you finish the last dregs of your soup, other than as some coded middle-class signalling to people around the table that you too unthinkingly adhere to petty bourgeois niceties. It is awkward nonsense. Ignore it.Apart from the chicken, which is firm enough that it can overhang the edges slightly, everything should be chopped into small enough pieces that a few of them can comfortably nestle together in each spoonful. Including long, floppy strands of difficult to control ingredients (spaghetti, flat noodles, cabbage etc) will likely leave you wearing half of your soup. In a noodle soup, you sign up for that it is a different proposition. But in chicken soup, keep it tidy. For instance, use smaller pastina (orzo, anelli, sorprese).Real pieces of chicken This may sound obvious, but it is a suggestion widely ignored by many commercial manufacturers of canned and fresh soups. Get some darker meat in there for additional flavour and do not shred the chicken. In a soup, shredded chicken becomes waterlogged and woolly. Instead, cut it into firmer chunks.Vegetables Onion, sweetcorn, celery, carrot, cabbage (darker, challenging varieties, for example, kale), celeriac, parsnip. Feel free to char or part-roast some of those vegetables first to build in further layers of flavour.Chorizo Used sparingly as a seasoning (this is not chicken and ham soup), a small amount goes a long way.Bulking agents A scattering of chickpeas, rice, redyellow lentils, pasta or barley (perhaps even a mix of several of these) will add textural variety, a satisfying bottom-end weight and further nutty, iron-y flavours.Cream Just a drop or two, swirled through.Turkey The most disappointing meat on the market: accept no imitations.Bacon Unless safely marooned on a central island of ingredients, above the waterline and used strictly as a garnish, bacon becomes curiously mealy in soups. Likewise, chicken crackling: if immersed in all that liquid, it ends up not crisp and salty, but unedifyingly soggy and slimy.Mushrooms In a chicken pie, all good, but in a hot soup, the flavour of mushrooms is muffled and, like leeks, they achieve an altogether unpleasant level of slipperiness. Needless to say, even before we get to the issue of including prunes in a savoury soup (ye gods!), HTE is not a fan of cock-a-leekie.Potato In a soup, chunks of potato are always either undercooked or mush. There is no in between. Moreover, in a soup in which you need to work hard to avoid blandness (see flavour boosters, below), potato is a noncommittal shrug of an ingredient that adds body without flavour.Broccoli Water gets trapped in the heads of the florets and superheats so that, even as the soup cools, those pieces of broccoli maintain a thermonuclear temperature that could strip fire-resistant paint from a garage door, never mind the roof of your mouth. Not that you are likely to use them here, but as a general warning, tomatoes pose a similar danger.Peas Pointless, in this context.Egg Which came first: chicken soup or the idea of gently cooking strands of egg through it? HTE cannot say, but it is an ineffectual and unnecessary addition.It is rare that HTE strays into the realms of seasoning specifics. The how-to-cook nitty gritty is Felicity Cloake’s domain. But is worth reiterating that from salt, pepper, garlic and white wine upwards, chicken soup benefits enormously from some added va va voom to lift its somewhat beige ingredients. The more obvious herbs (parsley, thyme, bayleaf) can be too domineering, but if judged correctly, a little heat (ginger, chilli) can bring everything into sharper focus. Masala spices, harissa or ras el hanout can also be effectively deployed, but that is to take chicken soup on its travels in a way that HTE promised to avoid at the top of this piece.Even when stuffed to the gills, wiping your bowl clean with a piece of thickly buttered bread is the pinnacle of the chicken soup experience. Mopping up every last drop of those magical savoury juices is a must – like an impromptu roast chicken sandwich at the end of your meal. Who could say no to that?Remarkably, many people swear by chicken soup as a hangover cure. In a fragile state, and certainly before midday, HTE could think of nothing worse. Even the thought of it makes HTE bilious.Chicken soup is even wasted at lunch, arguably. It is best eaten after dark, in deepest winter, when rain is lashing against the windows and, if only for a few hours, you are determined to hibernate from the world and its endless horrors. Self-care starts with chicken soup.So, chicken soup: how do you eat yours?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7af17c0929e454ddb5b7bc88af1cdd1632838eb8/0_468_8018_4813/master/8018.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fa0e4033997202521d7de9c1e614ef4","title":"rachel roddy recipe milk buns","story":"These slightly sweet, creamy buns demand to be eaten straight from the oven, split and filled with anything you fancyMum remembers her auntie May buying milk loaves from Hough’s Bakers and Confectioners on Moss Road in Stretford. I remember Great Aunt May in her bib apron, slicing bread in the kitchen of her sister’s (my granny’s) pub in Oldham. The white tin loaf was usually so fresh that the insides hadn’t firmed up, so May would stand it on one end, cut the crust off the other, then butter the end of the loaf. Dad says she then tucked the loaf under her arm like a newspaper and sawed off a ready-buttered slice, while Mum says she kept it end-up on the board and sliced like that. We have similar discussions about how May fried chips, and her stew with half a cow’s heel. Humdrum conversations that are full of important bits: May, who was always “our May”, is not just remembered, but seems alive when we talk about how she sliced bread.I also remember May and Granny slicing oven-bottom cakes in the pub kitchen. These were not cakes at all, but saucer-sized bread buns with firm, flat bottoms because they were cooked at the bottom of the baker’s oven. They also had floury tops, which meant you got floury fingers, which you inevitably wiped on your trousers, so got floury trousers. At the pub, oven-bottom cakes were split and filled with bacon, flash-fried steaks or slices of cheese. As kids, my brother and sister and I would sit on high stools up at the bar, shuffling beer mats or rumpling beer towels, then squashing the two halves and the filling of our lunch together so the bacon with its fat, the hot beef or slices of cheese sank into the crumb. As we ate, the floury tops would stick to the roofs of our mouths, until we washed them down with lemonade.It is the same stickiness with the brash and satisfying boiled beef panini at Sergio’s Mordi e Vai stall on Testaccio market, which you wash down with Peroni (if that is not your thing, you take your own beer). Or with Sandro’s mozzarella and tomato ciabatta at his Fraschetta – the last in Testaccio, which you wash down with half a litre of functional vino. The same kind of sticky comes with every three-cornered, white-sliced, tuna-and-tomato tramezzino in every bar all over Italy. In fact, I have come to the conclusion – and you may not agree with me – that all sandwiches should stick to the roof of your mouth, even if just for a moment.Then there are the panini al latte – milk buns – from the perennially good Roman bakery Passi.The Italian cousin of the English milk loaf May bought from Hough’s, these buns are slightly sweet and creamy inside – undoubtedly childlike, but not just for children. Like the tin loaf, they demand to be eaten fresh from the oven, split and filled with anything you fancy – which for me means a slice of prosciutto and some cream cheese or a spoonful of strawberry jam. At Passi, the panini are the size of a doorknob – arguably bite-sized, which means you can eat four in one go, 10 at a children’s party. If what looks like a small door knob rises into a big bun in the oven, then two is probably enough for a meal, which might just stick to the roof of your mouth.300ml whole milk10g fresh yeast500g plain flour2 tsp salt2 tsp sugar1 egg, lightly beaten, plus 1 egg yolk, to glaze2 tbsp milk, to glaze1 tbsp honey, to glazeHeat the milk until it is just warm, then dissolve the yeast in it and leave it to sit for 10 minutes.Sift the flour into a large bowl, add the salt, sugar, the whole egg and the milkyeast mixture and bring everything into a soft consistent dough.

That happened twice at the Emirates on Saturday, but rather than an outfield player felling a forward, it was a goalkeeper. In the space of a few minutes both Alisson and Bernd Leno sprinted from their lines and attempted to punch clear a cross, but failed and took out Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Virgil van Dijk respectively. Different rules apply to goalkeepers, awarded fouls when given the slightest touch and forgiven when they commit pseudo-assault. Both incidents were more serious and dangerous than a standard foul from an outfielder: two well-built, 6ft 3in-plus athletes charging at an opponent at speed, and in Leno’s case smashing Van Dijk in the face with a forearm. It is a serious flaw in the rules that neither were penalised. Nick MillerCallum Wilson’s only previous appearance in an England shirt came in 2014 when he came off the bench to replace Harry Kane in an under-21 friendly against France but after adding to his impressive start to the season with another goal against Manchester United the former Coventry striker deserves another chance to impress Gareth Southgate up close. The 26-year-old was selected by the England manager for that match four years ago when he was still in charge of the youth side so Wilson is clearly on his radar and would certainly offer a different option in attack for the Nations League tie with Croatia next week. The international retirement of Jamie Vardy has created a vacancy in the squad for a striker with genuine pace and Bournemouth’s leading man has shown over the past three seasons that he has the tools required to make an impact at a higher level if he is given the opportunity. Ed AaronsManchester United’s first-half performance took standards to the lowest point of the season. Their excellent second-half revival to seize a deserved three points showed a way forward, with the pace and directness of goalscorers Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford to the fore. Control of midfield was gained once Rashford and Ander Herrera arrived in the 56th minute in place of Juan Mata and Fred. The latter was United’s key signing of the summer but threatens to go the way of Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Alexis Sánchez, Eric Bailly, Victor Lindelöf and Paul Pogba: expensive signings distrusted by José Mourinho. Herrera added bite and haste where previously a trio of Pogba, Fred and Nemanja Matic, costing a combined £187.8m and all bought under Mourinho’s watch, had been hopeless. John BrewinThe outcry about Lee Probert’s decision to book Demarai Gray, who had removed his shirt to reveal another garment paying tribute to Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha after scoring Leicester’s winner, seemed a bit much given that there were far more important things going on. Yes, the law might be ill-conceived and yes, it was unfortunate given the emotion of the occasion, but Probert was doing his job and his body language upon seeing Gray’s actions – visibly wincing and then making as low-key a show of the yellow card as possible – should be enough to assure anyone that he was acting against his own instincts. Claude Puel and his players agreed afterwards that, much like them, Probert needed to remain professional and that is where it should end. It is not worth the fuss and it is certainly not worth opening Probert up to unnecessary fury in an age where too many idiots have licence to pour invective and sometimes worse. It is far more appropriate to take strength from an ultimately uplifting afternoon than abase oneself over an inconsequential refereeing call. Nick AmesThere is an inevitability about how the focus is drawn towards Eden Hazard’s brilliance at Chelsea. Or, when a striker who once appeared broken scores a brace, the praise is duly dished out for Álvaro Morata. Yet it was the energy in the hosts’ ranks which saw them eventually overwhelm Crystal Palace, and the likes of Willian and Pedro who personify that dynamism. The Brazilian has now started 11 games in succession, a sequence that surely has to be curtailed for a breather in Belarus this week, and is a player relishing life after Antonio Conte. He would make way for Hazard, but few players have unsettled Aaron Wan-Bissaka as obviously in recent times. Pedro, industrious as much in defence as in attack, is a truly unsung hero, a player whose tireless running eventually grinds opponents down. His finish for the third was emphatic, and reward for an afternoon of endeavour which sums up this side’s approach. Dominic FifieldGoodison Park was purring after the best Everton display under Marco Silva so far and three quality goals brought an emphatic end to Brighton’s winning run. The only reservation was criticism of Séamus Coleman’s recent form and the angry response it prompted from the Republic of Ireland captain following his important goal against Chris Hughton’s team. By his own admission Coleman has not hit his usual high level in recent weeks, which is hardly surprising given he was unable to train for over a month due to a stress fracture in his foot. That injury against Wales, coming after last year’s double leg fracture against the same opposition, clearly affected the defender’s fitness but the 30 year old impressed even without his goal on Saturday. Coleman is gradually rediscovering the rhythm that is crucial to his game. If any player deserves a show of that rare commodity in football – patience – it is the team captain who embodies commitment to the Everton cause. Andy HunterThere is no disgrace in losing at Manchester City but there must be serious alarm in Southampton’s failure to win a Premier League game since 1 September. Despite suffering a 6-1 trouncing at the hands of Pep Guardiola’s men there is hope in the way Saints managed to go at the champions for periods. As Mark Hughes said afterwards: “We have come up against City, we have created a number of chances again. Our shots on target are right up there in comparison to how clinical Manchester City were today. That has been our story this season. We pick the wrong option or don’t finish the chances we create. We need to improve that and at the back end we need to improve.” Next up are Watford and then a trip to fellow strugglers Fulham. If Saints fail to win either of those then Hughes can expect scrutiny. Jamie Jackson“It’s common sense, no?” Mauricio Pochettino said, pointing out that when you play on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday it is prudent to rest players such as Dele Alli, Christian Eriksen, Son Heung-min and Davinson Sánchez before PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League adds a fourth game in nine days. Less easy to explain is why Spurs needed to send on three of these players – Alli was not on the bench – to see out a game they were winning 3-0 after an hour. It would be a mistake to imagine it was simply the naive defending of the debutant Juan Foyth that led to the two Wolves penalties. Kieran Trippier was at fault too and the whole Spurs backline was at full stretch to resist a pummelling in the closing minutes. Wolves were unlucky, particularly with a wrongly disallowed goal in the first half. Which has to mean Spurs were lucky. They played well but they must still feel they got out of jail.

I know it’s only modern history – the WSL started in 2011 – but it is still a landmark achievement. She’s a wide player first and foremost, who has played most of her career for City and England on the wing, which makes it more of an achievement. She did play as a No 9 with me for Everton, and she has been used in that position again by City this season. In her last game against Reading she was not as influential as she normally is from a wide position, but she is learning a new role and I think she would admit that she is not at her peak yet. She has contributed massively for England in qualifying for next year’s World Cup – she was her country’s top scorer with six goals – and just keeps growing as a player. She has always been tenacious and aggressive, and I think the ferociousness of her style of play is something that young players can really look at and learn from.• Nikita Parris: you’ll still find me shouting at refereesYeovil’s 1-0 win over Everton was their first top-flight victory ever, ended a 41-game winless run and is great not just for the ision’s outsiders but for the league as a whole. Nobody wants to see a team languishing at the bottom, uncompetitive and helpless. Yeovil have kept fighting, they have never given up, they are obviously improving and they should relish this moment and kick on from here. They finally have something to build on and can look to the future with optimism. On Sunday Yeovil took their chance, and Everton didn’t take any of theirs. The visitors had enough of them – 28 shots in total, 12 on target – and it wasn’t the first time this season that they have had more shots than the opposition but come away with nothing. Everton’s performances have been below par, given the quality of their squad and their own expectations.• In the Women’s Super League, look down for the tensest actionAfter beating Liverpool last week Chelsea went to Fiorentina on Wednesday and won 6-0 and, after their recent struggles in front of goal, that was exactly the kind of convincing victory they needed. On Sunday they scored more than once in a league game for the first time this season when they beat West Ham 2-0. They have been creating plenty of chances, but they have not been displaying the kind of attacking polish that took them to the title last season, and have been failing to put them in the back of the net. Now they have the kick-start they have so badly needed. They have found another gear, and will hope to be more competitive from now on. It could already be too late for them to retain their title – they are eight points behind Arsenal, who have a game in hand – but if they can get on a run you never know where it might take them. The quality is certainly there, they just need to not look too far ahead. They have more internationals than any other WSL team, and are the only English side still in the Champions League, but having qualified for the quarter-finals they don’t play again in that competition until March and now have a bit of breathing space, and the chance to fully concentrate on domestic competition.• Chelsea hammer Fiorentina to reach Champions League last eightEngland play friendlies against Austria and Sweden over the next week, and will do so without Fara Williams, who Phil Neville omitted from the squad he named last Tuesday. Whatever his reasons, Williams will not have taken it lightly. She has been in the squad since the late 1990s and wants to be involved every time she is fit and available. Certainly the snub would have given her extra motivation when her Reading side played Bristol City on Sunday, a desire to prove that she is still fit enough, strong enough and fast enough. Nobody has ever doubted her strength of character because that girl has been through a lot, both on and off the pitch, but if anybody was doubting her she came up with the perfect answer by scoring twice in a fantastic inidual display. Her first goal in particular was fantastic, trademark Fara Williams. She is a magical player, a genuine legend of the game, and for me she is still an integral part of the England squad. She turns 35 in January and has 170 caps to her name, and you can’t leave that kind of experience at home when you go into a World Cup, certainly not when she remains on top form.• Fara Williams: the big interview• Arsenal 3-1 Birmingham City – as it happened"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b2e182ee8c06e5fb8129be8bd79104de72589be/0_125_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e8724d9879a80b75b4291f2818db976","title":"xherdan shaqiri left out liverpool red star belgrade","story":"Xherdan Shaqiri has been left out of Liverpool’s squad for Tuesday’s Champions League match at Red Star Belgrade because of the reception that might await him after his World Cup goal celebration against Serbia.Shaqiri reacted after scoring for Switzerland against Serbia in Russia in June by performing an Albanian nationalist symbol.

On Saturday, he was at the heart of their 5-0 winJoão Mário sounded so certain. Interviewed by Gazzetta dello Sport at the start of June – just after he had completed a successful six-month loan at West Ham, and shortly before the start of a World Cup in which he would feature in all four matches played by Portugal – the midfielder insisted he would not return to Inter.“I do not want to try again,” he said of life at his parent club. “I would not have the right motivation. That experience is over now. Zero doubts.”You could understand the sentiment. Despite splashing out €40m to sign João Mário in 2016, the Nerazzurri had never found him a steady role. Constant changes of manager during his first season with the club did not help but even Luciano Spalletti, after taking charge last summer, only gave him five starts in as many months before packing him off to the London Stadium.Inter were happy to grant the player’s wish to be sold. The problem was finding a buyer. Sevilla were reported to have an interest but wound up taking Maxime Gonalons on loan from Roma instead. Their neighbours Real Betis, likewise, preferred Giovani Lo Celso. When more concrete offers arrived from Turkey, João Mário turned them down.And so he stayed at Inter, a situation which seemed to please nobody. For the first two months of this season, he disappeared from view – popping up only for a Sky Sports interview in which he acknowledged supporters who jeered the reading out of his name among the subs before kickoff at San Siro.“I think it’s a body language problem,” he said. “Every now and then it can seem like I’m not present. That’s a thing I need to improve.”It is hard to prove much of anything, though, when you never set foot on the pitch. João Mário did not get so much as a minute off the bench before suddenly being thrust into the starting XI for the visit to Lazio on 29 October. Fans and journalists scratched their heads. There had been little to indicate such a move was coming.But he played well, and Inter won 3-0. This was their eighth win in nine matches across all competitions, and easily the most convincing. Better was yet to follow against Genoa on Saturday. João Mário started again, and had a hand in four out of five goals as Inter obliterated opponents who had drawn with Juventus last month.The opener ought not to have stood. Lautaro Martínez’s attempted through-pass for Roberto Gagliardini was blocked and ran to João Mário. His initial control was clumsy, and he pulled out of a second touch as a pair of defenders closed in. This became an accidental dummy, all three players leaving the ball to run to Gagliardini, who had been in an offside position when it was last touched by his teammate.What came next was more impressive. Inter’s second goal was glorious in its simplicity, the ball played out from defence to Marcelo Brozovic, who immediately squared it to João Mário. He released Matteo Politano with a first-time 30-yard ball, and the latter finished coolly.Inter had gone from the edge of their own area to the back of the net in seven touches. Gazzetta called it “an anthem to vertical football”. The hope in Milan is that it might prove a potent counter to the patient lateral movement of the Barcelona team they will face at San Siro on Tuesday.Spalletti’s team were well beaten at the Camp Nou in their previous Champions League outing, yet these last two league games have offered encouraging signs. Inter are finally starting to look like the team that Spalletti has always wanted them to be: using aggression and physicality to dominate the pitch as well as the ball.A tactical shift has helped. With Radja Nainggolan sidelined by an ankle injury, Inter abandoned plans to play with a No 10, opting instead for a 4-3-3. The formation has offered Brozovic more support – giving him options when pressed, as he was on Politano’s goal.It has seemed to suit the players alongside him – the extra cover allowing all midfielders to become runners, taking turns to get forward and break the lines. Gagliardini followed up that opening goal with another just after half-time. João Mário, along with two assists, scored one of his own in injury time. So did Nainggolan, an 87th minute substitute.There was an awkward truth to confront here, in that neither João Mário nor Gagliardini, Inter’s two leading men on Saturday, will be available for selection against Barça. Both were excluded from Inter’s Champions League squad, which has been restricted to 21 players as a result of their breach of Financial Fair Play regulations.How greatly they will be missed remains to be seen. Nainggolan’s return is a boost, though it may tempt Spalletti to revert to his previous formation. That could be a mistake. Matias Vecino was rested against Genoa, but had been excellent against Lazio on the right of a midfield three.The specific terms of the FFP ruling, which limits Inter’s ability to include new signings made during the assessed period of overspending, means that João Mário and Gagliardini would likely remain excluded even if they do make it through to the Champions League knockout stage.Yet if there was another positive note for Spalletti this weekend then it was to be found in the collective spirit he can see developing. Despite knowing he could not feature, Gagliardini spoke in his post-game interview about “turning our thoughts to Barcelona”.“We’re Inter,” he continued, “we have all the right cards to give ourselves a chance.” Spalletti will not have the full deck at his disposal, but João Mário’s re-emergence has shown us that he knows how to keep a trick or two up his sleeve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c832b58192cd4bb231ae7cede403f60958d2af04/107_549_7161_4296/master/7161.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d2e0a0cbe8575b4237e2eeeb20182e7","title":"meet the disruptors shaking up the legal world","story":"From crowdfunding litigation to documenting court cases online, here’s how three startups are using technology to transform the sectorFounder and CEO, CrowdJusticeIn 2015, lawyer Julia Salasky gave up the security of her “job for life” to launch CrowdJustice, a platform that provides people with a means of raising funds for their legal matters. It’s based on a crowdfunding model, similar to the way Kickstarter and Indiegogo help founders raise funds for growing businesses, and enables its users to find a community of support as they move through the legal system.Salasky had always felt that the traditional legal career path wasn’t necessarily for her in the long term. She began her career as a commercial litigator at Linklaters, where she did a lot of pro bono work, including a six-month secondment to a legal aid centre.“There, I saw first hand how difficult it was for ordinary people to access legal services,” she says. “Then I left to be a lawyer at the UN, where I led a project that was intended to give people better access to justice online.”Although she felt the project didn’t have enough of an impact on the ground, it did plant a seed: the idea that behind its opaque, expensive facade, the legal system houses a fascinating trove of stories, and that iniduals might just get behind those stories to try to create change for people or social issues they care about. From there the idea for CrowdJustice took shape.You can raise funds for any cause, from those with a national profile, like victims of black-cab rapist John Worboys, to those affecting iniduals, including that of a 12-year-old trying to ensure that deaf children can take a GCSE in their first language – British Sign Language.But CrowdJustice is about more than just raising money. It’s about democratising the system, says Salasky. “That might mean getting access to a lawyer, but it also means knowing that other people are using the law, knowing that rights exist in the first place, and raising awareness around the legal issues that can, for better or for worse, cause seismic shifts in society.”Following its US launch last year, CrowdJustice has had some high-profile cases, including that of adult film actor Stormy Daniels, who has raised nearly $600,000 (£450,000) to challenge US president Donald Trump. Her lawyer has also recently taken on and is crowdfunding a new case to challenge the policy of removing immigrants’ children from them at the border.“Five years from now we’d love to be a trusted resource and legal destination for consumers – a place where you can not only pay for your case, but where you can also learn about the law and get more transparency over the process,” she says. “We think we’re just scratching the tip of the iceberg in pursuing our mission to make the law more accessible for everyone.”Co-founder and CEO, LexooTiming is everything when starting a new business, and when Daniel van Binsbergen founded Lexoo, a digital marketplace for legal services, he definitely spotted the right trends at the right time.It was 2014 when the former lawyer, then a senior associate at a large firm, working mainly in finance and mergers and acquisitions, had his lightbulb moment. Van Binsbergen saw an opportunity to create a digital marketplace that collated specialist practitioners in one place, to eliminate the stress typically associated with hiring a lawyer.The model is simple. A client submits their job, and then lawyers can express their interest in the work, with Lexoo selecting three or four of the most suitable lawyers to quote. Finally, the client picks the one they like the look of.“I was struck by the inefficiencies of the legal market and realised that the hourly rate model was partly to blame,” he says. “By having their lawyers bill by the hour, partners at the largest firms can earn huge sums, so there’s no incentive to make things more efficient.”The platform takes advantage of a shift in mindset in the legal profession, with growing numbers of senior lawyers rejecting the traditional goal of making the position of partner and instead opting to pursue meaningful careers by working independently.“Working from home or for small boutique practices, typically they were able to charge half their former rates but still make a very decent living,” says van Binsbergen. “More importantly, they could work flexibly and take back control of their lives. If that trend continued, it was clear we’d have lots of highly qualified specialist lawyers who were hard to find, because they were no longer tied to the big firms.”Initially focusing on connecting small businesses with lawyers in the UK, Lexoo’s client base now includes large multinationals. Without the overheads of the bigger firms, Lexoo’s more cost-effective services have helped it gain traction with major companies like Travelodge, which has appointed Lexoo to its law firm panel.Co-founder and CEO, CourtsdeskTo do his job, journalist Enda Leahy relied on authentic sources of information available in the public domain. One area he always had difficulty accessing, however, was the courts, and as a legal and securities correspondent, that presented a huge problem.He set out to solve it by digital means, giving up his job at the Irish Mail on Sunday to launch Courtsdesk, the Ireland-based legal reporting and data startup behind the first publicly accessible database of court cases in the UK and Ireland.“The legal aphorism ‘justice must be seen to be done’ is widely bandied around, and while one can walk into a courtroom, very little information is made available from there. With Courtsdesk, we set about changing that in a number of ways,” he says.Leahy and his co-founder, Alan Larkin, a software engineer, began work on Courtsdesk in October 2015. The plan was to develop a digital platform that would not only improve access to legal information, but also integrate and process it in a way that would create efficiencies of time and knowledge.Since its launch in 2017, the response from the legal and business worlds has been positive. Current users include organisations from the financial sector, and almost every national news organisation in Ireland. Two of Ireland’s top five law firms have already signed up, and many other large firms are trialling the service. In a sector not known for readily embracing change, some practices are being changed radically.“Lawyers need the knowledge to make a legal argument and train long and hard for that,” says Leahy. “However, they also spend a lot of time on manual processes that can be automated, and that’s where most of the opportunities have arisen. In some instances, doing an update for a client on hundreds of cases can literally take 1,000 hours. We can do that now with the click of a button.”In less than a year Courtsdesk’s capabilities have already evolved.Leahy says: “We can now do detailed sectoral analysis, for example, of every single case involving the top 20 law firms in the country, as well as things like timeline analysis, and relationship analysis, looking at which protagonists are linked to which entity or which company. What started off as a Google-type search of the courts has evolved into something closer to truly big-data analytics.”Courtsdesk is now preparing to launch in the UK, while its founders also have their sights set on markets in Europe and North America. Over time, Courtsdesk will be made available to academia and the general public.“Do I miss journalism? A little bit,” says Leahy. “There’s nothing like having a great public interest story that you feel passionately about, but we view what we are doing as a different type of journalism. In fact, we had a joke at the beginning that nobody should come and work for Courtsdesk unless they’ve watched All the President’s Men.”Photography: Camilla Greenwell and Shane Lynam for the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/506297209a4162d709e333963dd883d9450f288d/0_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bc145bf48cb343c7701a05dfe419e71","title":"exploring case law where the rulebook meets reality","story":"Case law is needed to clear up the ambiguities of the law. Here, three experts from Thomson Reuters reveal their favourite cases and explain their impact on the way we live todayWhen written in plain black and white, laws may seem like simple things: you can do this, you can’t do that. But when the theory comes into contact with the real world – a messy place filled with complicated human behaviours and interactions – that clarity can deteriorate fast.To correct for such ambiguities, we have case law. In case law, disputed legislation can be clarified by a senior court, setting a precedent by which other cases can be decided.Such clarifications are made in all manner of scenarios – from clearing up tax legislation to defining what’s lawful or unlawful in the bedroom. Here, we ask three legal minds to name their favourite cases from the archives.Jessica Brown, director of client training at Thomson ReutersBefore this case, judges could only use the text of the statute – words on a page – without any additional knowledge. Written in very generic terms, this text can be vague and ambiguous and therefore very difficult to apply.The Pepper v Hart case entailed looking at tax legislation to decide whether a teacher at a private school had to pay tax on the perk he received in the form of reduced school fees. What was important in this case was that the particular point about whether something was a tax benefit or not had been debated – it wasn’t specifically covered in the Finance Act 1976. Those on the case wanted to enter this parliamentary debate as evidence.The judges ruled that when primary legislation is ambiguous, then, under certain circumstances, the court may refer to statements made in the House of Commons or House of Lords. In other words, look at the debates or presentations made in parliament when the act was being created, to get a better understanding of the reasoning and justification to interpret the meaning of the legislation.For the first time, judges had more than just the words on the page. It saved a lot of court time, because any ambiguities could just be resolved by looking at what had been discussed in parliament.Take Anti-Slavery Day, for example, which was created by an Act of Parliament to raise awareness of modern slavery and to inspire people to eliminate it. It was a fantastic idea, however, the act was incredibly badly drafted. All it said was “we shall specify a day that shall be observed each year as Anti-Slavery Day”, with no definition of what should be done. Did it mean a day off, a minute’s silence, specific activities to mark the day? It was almost impossible to comply with. It’s only when you look at the debate that you can see there was a discussion over when it should take place and how to mark the day.With Brexit on the horizon, there is likely to be a raft of new legislation that will be passed in a bit of a hurry, and that’s where ambiguities and vagueness can slip in. Being able to look at additional materials and understand what the law is actually getting at will save time and create that certainty in the law that wasn’t really available up until this case.Kerrie Lloyd-Dawson, specialist editor and court reporter, Westlaw UK (above)The case involved five men who had willingly engaged in sadomasochistic acts, resulting in the infliction of actual (ABH) and grievous bodily harm (GBH). Although none of the men had reported anything to the police, the Crown Prosecution Service acted on a video of the encounter and charged them under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. The issue was whether they could consent to the harm, and the House of Lords decided that their consent was not a defence, and that the consensual infliction of harm on another for sexual gratification was not an act the law should permit.Some commentators of the time expressed the view that had the facts been different, and involved heterosexual sadomasochistic activity, it would have been found lawful. Others insist that if it were made today, the decision would be different.Where do you draw the line? With Brown, the judges decided that it wasn’t in the public interest that a person should cause ABH to another person for no good reason. However, there are established exceptions, the sport of boxing for example, or tattooing and body piercing, which cause ABH but are not considered a crime.What you can consent to and at what point the law should intervene is a fascinating and complex subject that will continue to spark debate and ide opinions for many years to come.However, currently, I am particularly interested in the cases concerning the employment status of people working in a myriad of creative business structures, the so-called “gig-economy” companies. These are structures that enable businesses to be flexible, classing people as self-employed rather than employees, so they are not entitled to the statutory rights afforded to employees and workers (for example the national minimum wage).All of these cases have their roots in a case from 2011 (Autoclenz Ltd v Belcher), involving 20 valets who worked for the car cleaning company Autoclenz. Their contracts described them as self-employed, on the basis that they were under no obligation to accept work and they had a right of substitution (they could send someone else to do the job). However, these contracts didn’t reflect reality. The valets were required to turn up for work every day and to notify Autoclenz in advance if they were unable to work.The group took Autoclenz to the employment tribunal, claiming that they were employees and the case eventually went to the supreme court, which upheld the tribunal decision. Importantly, it held that when determining an inidual’s employment status the relative bargaining power of the parties must be taken into account in deciding whether the terms of any written agreement represented what was agreed. The reality was that an inidual applying for a role to valet cars did not have the power to negotiate the terms of the contract.The decision means that employment tribunals may disregard the terms of a written agreement that do not reflect the actual agreement between the parties. The focus of the tribunal’s enquiry should be on the “actual legal obligations of the parties”. This has far-reaching implications, not just for employment status cases currently before the courts and tribunals, but in ways that we don’t yet appreciate – who knows how people will be working in another five or 10 years from now?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9db9e9e6d73882029a9d454e0b9da7ad452a0794/0_2_1960_1176/master/1960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6ebcde3149a1cd01d6a4c5bb8a41950","title":"can blockchain shake up the legal sector for the better","story":"Blockchain – one of the buzzwords of the year – could help the legal system run more smoothly and efficiently. But data privacy and regulations may limit its impact In 2008, Apple’s creation of the app store led to the introduction of apps for everything. More than a decade later, it now seems there’s a blockchain for everything. The technology that’s best known for underpinning the Bitcoin cryptocurrency has spawned a new raft of ambitious startups looking to make the most of it.The blockchain has a simple underlying premise: to allow people to share digital assets with another internet user. The transfer is carried out securely and can be seen by all users of the network it is shared upon, using a public record of all transactions. Blockchain networks can be open to anyone or act as a private system that’s only accessible to those granted permission.Despite analysts at Forrester predicting that 2018 will be the start of the downfall for blockchain proposals that have been too optimistic, the technology’s combination of transparency and security has led to blockchain being developed for almost every industry – having branched out from its cryptocurrency origin. Many blockchain efforts are in their early stages, with developers still attempting to get wide rollout, but blockchain applications are being developed to track food safety information, distribute movies and store electronic medical records.But how could blockchain be applied to the legal profession and regulatory environment? “Blockchain technology can affect the legal practice in two significant ways,” says Primavera De Filippi, a researcher at the National Center of Scientific Research in Paris and faculty associate at Harvard University. First: it has the potential to act as a secure database where documents, such as evidence, can be stored and then referenced later on if arguments arise.The second potential application, De Filippi says, is in creating a way for contracts to be created and transferred digitally, reducing the need for legal instruments. Smart contracts can remove the need for a middle-party in deals and reduce overall costs. “Blockchain definitely has the power to create more efficiency, with secure and transparent transactions,” adds Richard Anderson, product management director, legal risk, at Thomson Reuters Legal.One industry in which this is already happening is shipping. IBM and Maersk have started to use smart contracts at more than 20 ports around the world to track the movement of containers and share shipping documents. The firms say more than 154m shipping events – including arrival times, customs forms, and invoices – have been recorded in the system and it has reduced costs to the industry.Anderson adds that the transparency around the document sender and creator within blockchain applications may also help banks prevent fraud. In particular, it could help easily identify people involved in financial transactions and prevent money laundering. Financial groups have to understand – through regulations referred to as “know your customer” – who owns accounts and is making transactions. Anderson says the blockchain can be used to verify the identity of those completing transactions. When it is used, it has the potential to disrupt the entire industry. “There is a significant chance that blockchain being heavily used by financial services reduces the ‘know your customer’ burden to the degree that certain regulatory solutions are cannibalised and no longer needed,” he adds.However, most of these technologies aren’t in place yet. “People have seen this massive explosion of cryptocurrency and assume there must be a significant use of blockchain,” Anderson says. He likens the hype around blockchain to the recent surge in artificial intelligence. But AI has reached the stage where businesses now understand how they may be able to take advantage of it, Anderson says. “I don’t think that maturity has happened with blockchain.”Primarily, for blockchain, there is one significant hurdle to overcome before it can be widely deployed. “The legal profession should ensure that uses of blockchain technology actually comply with the law and do not tamper with fundamental rights, like the right to privacy,” De Filippi says. Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which started to be enforced in May 2018, strengthens the rights of iniduals and increases the safeguards on their personal data. It may also have a stalling impact on the adoption of blockchain tech.Around the world, regulators are currently creating plans covering how blockchain and cryptocurrencies should be regulated. The UK parliament has created a cross-party working group to look at the impact of the blockchain, regulators in Canada are drafting regulations due to be published in 2019, and analysis from PwC has suggested the biggest barrier to blockchain adoption for businesses is the amount of regulatory uncertainty around the tech.In the short term, blockchain has a difficult future. “When you look at a hardening regulatory environment around data privacy – whether you think that’s right or wrong, it is definitely happening with GDPR – it’s clear that blockchain is going to come up against regulation,” Anderson says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84d9f2185faa8456b7b84589d76935db8b8211d8/0_250_6450_3872/master/6450.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e08e2f332dd71aa568b8b02e4a1c1eda","title":"seven ways to address insomnia","story":"From ditching curry and booze to keeping your eyes off the clock, here is a guide for anyone suffering sleepless nightsYour bedroom is for sleep, right?* So stop using it as your living room. It is your sanctuary: keep it tranquil and dark. Your body needs darkness to release melatonin, which in turn helps you sleep – so invest in blackout blinds or an eye mask. Switch off mobile phones and computer screens, as their LED screen blue light is particularly unhelpful for melatonin production. If you need a new mattress, spend time choosing one that is appropriate, and make sure your duvet is the right tog for the season.*Sex is also good. An orgasm last thing can help you nod off.The buzz phrase is sleep hygiene, meaning don’t do anything during the day that might inhibit your sleep later on, and slow down at bedtime. So avoid naps, and go to bed and get up at roughly the same time each day. Enjoy your night-time routine: have a hot bath (it raises your body temperature, which helps you nod off), switch off your devices at least 40 minutes before you turn in, read a book, play soothing music or listen to a “nodcast”.Alcohol can interfere with your sleep cycle – it helps you sleep initially, but wakes you up a few hours later. Avoid big meals in the evening, especially rich, heavy or spicy foods that can cause heartburn and stomach trouble. Don’t drink coffee after lunchtime – 2017 research found caffeine reduces your sleep time and quality.Part of what keeps us awake at night is stress about being awake. So resist the temptation to clock-watch, which can make you anxious: instead, luxuriate in feeling comfortable, safe and warm. Revisit happy memories and tell yourself that you will still function fine tomorrow.If you often lie awake for more than half an hour, either when you first go to bed or if you wake in the night, get up and make yourself comfortable somewhere else with a book or some music. Return to bed when you feel tired – this will help you associate bed with sleep and not with wakefulness.Record your sleep habits over a fortnight: when you go to bed, how long it takes you to sleep, whether you wake in the night. Look for patterns you can change – maybe you sleep best when you’ve exercised. A sleep diary can also help a doctor pinpoint what’s wrong. If all else fails, get checked out: insomnia is linked with depression, and for some people sleep disruption is an early sign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03e5039f82b0f8b0333a7ad0fe9c86a4e002d77e/430_653_4841_2904/master/4841.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b1e3c343d70ee5e906718f13277e14c","title":"should i dress more smartly for work","story":"We live in an image-obsessed world, says Sharmadean Reid.

It’s an island nation, there’s a lot of fog and cloud coming off the sea. More recently, your summers have been more like ours – hot and sunny and dry. Now, when you have a hot, sunny and dry summer and a cloudy, dark winter, that’s when the seasonality of the problem becomes more apparent.” The further north you go, the gloomier it gets. In the winter, there are parts of northern Scotland that get an average of just 64 minutes of sunlight a day, according to the Met Office.Perhaps a quarter of those with winter blues develop the extreme form known as seasonal affective disorder, or Sad. “This is characterised by the typical features of depression – poor sleep, low mood, irritability, social withdrawal and perhaps overeating, too,” says Sally Norton, a consultant surgeon and weight-loss expert with an interest in Sad. “It is probably, in part, related to hormonal changes around those chemical messengers such as serotonin and melatonin involved in regulating our body clock.” Mark Winwood, a director of psychological services for Axa PPP healthcare, adds that people with Sad “may find it very difficult to wake up in the morning and can often feel sleepy during the day. You may crave chocolate and high-carbohydrate foods, such as white bread or sugary foods. And you probably won’t be doing as much physically, so it’s easy to put on weight.”Sad and the winter blues are sometimes described as separate conditions, but Rosenthal prefers to talk of a “spectrum”. “Some people are really laid low by it and some people are just hampered by it. Let’s say your wife has Sad and you’ve got a little bit of winter blues. You get up in the morning and you don’t feel as good as you do in the summer, but you get yourself together and by the middle of the morning you’re not feeling so bad. But your wife can’t get out of bed at all. And you say: ‘I don’t know what’s the matter with you, dear. I get up, I go to work …’ It’s important to realise that a person isn’t fixed in a category. They can move to and fro depending on what they do and how bad the winter is.”So, what can you do about it? “‘Take it seriously’ is always my first piece of advice,” says Rosenthal. “You Brits are famous for your stiff upper lip and just getting on with the job, but that is the philosophy of minimising and denial. If there was nothing you can do about it, fine – but there is.”The worst cases may call for antidepressants or cognitive behavioural therapy. Otherwise, you could try spending a few hours every day in front of a lightbox, like the one Rosenthal uses. He recommends the specialist suppliers Lumie and the Sad Lightbox Company, and a box that will put out at least 10,000 lux. (By way of comparison, a sunny summer’s day might deliver 100,000 lux.) If you don’t spend much time at home, there are portable versions that are barely bigger than an iPad. “Morning treatments are best,” Rosenthal says. “The earlier the better.” He is also a fan of dawn simulators, which gradually light up your bedroom in the morning. Although winter’s late sunrises feel less oppressive than its early sunsets, that does not mean they don’t affect us.Most of the advice for dealing with Sad or the winter blues boils down to: “Get more light.” You can start by making at least one room in your home as bright as possible, by adding artificial light, opening curtains, rolling up blinds, cleaning your windows and trimming any plants that obscure them. Then, even if it is raining, snowing or blowing a gale, get outdoors as much as possible. As Winwood says: “Natural daylight supports our circadian clock and helps us sleep at night. So, even if you seem to go to work when it’s dark and also go home when it’s dark, get out in the lunch hour. Even better, use it as a time to do your daily exercise.” Exercise, after all, is known to improve your mood, whatever the time of year.Even – especially – if you don’t think of yourself as a winter person, it is worth investing in warm clothes so the weather can’t keep you cooped up. While you are out, the sunlight will encourage your body to produce vitamin D. Although Norton says there is only “limited evidence” for vitamin D improving mood, “there is no doubt that many of us are deficient in the winter months”.When the night falls, don’t fight it too hard. “Our tendency to turn on blazing lights as soon as the light drops is bound to confuse our body,” Norton says. “Try to keep lights dim in the evening and let your body clock tell you when it’s time to sleep. Getting to bed early enough to get a good eight hours will help your mood and so much more.” And stay away from screens for at least two hours before you go to bed. “They suppress the sleep hormone melatonin, making it more difficult to drift off and reducing sleep quality.”You should also watch what you eat, she warns. “While low mood and poor sleep has many people reaching for high-carb, sugary food, this is unlikely to help in the long term, with weight gain and yo-yoing blood sugar making sleep more difficult and worsening mood further.”The important thing, Rosenthal repeats, is to realise that you are not powerless. “I find people who say: ‘I can’t deal with it!’ And I think to myself: ‘Let’s just put everything in place for you to have the best possible winter.’“It’s not just about managing winter,” he says. “I think you need to enjoy it. Life should be embraced.”Norman Rosenthal’s Winter Blues is published by Guilford Press."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5eed03ce0bea31284b8917846a9053e1df7a576/0_309_2161_1296/master/2161.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31967f81fb7acfe81f21be3d7730691b","title":"paul dacre ex daily mail liberal brexit hating media speech","story":"Former editor defends paper’s ‘enemies of the people’ headline in speech at Society of Editors conferencePaul Dacre has used his first major public appearance since stepping down as Daily Mail editor to defend his decision to describe high court judges as “enemies of the people”.Dacre, who left the job this summer, said the decision to run the front page after the judges ruled that parliament would have to vote on Brexit helped push the issue of judicial involvement in politics on to the national agenda – and that his critics missed the fact that the headline was a reference to a play by the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen.He admitted the front page could perhaps have been phrased better, saying: “But what the hell. The point needed to be made.”The former Daily Mail editor was making the lecture at the Society of Editors conference in Salford, where he was awarded the society’s first lifetime achievement award.Dacre used a lengthy part of his valedictory speech to criticise the “liberal Brexit-hating media” who “almost always regard with contempt the mass-selling papers which have to appeal to large audiences to survive commercially”.Among other predictions, he said the UK would soon the see the rise of rightwing TV broadcasters to fill the gap left by the BBC, that Theresa May would lead the Conservatives into the next general election, that tech companies that provide “succour to terrorists and paedophiles” would soon be broken up, and that print newspapers would be here to stay for some time.Dacre said there was an ever-growing gap between London-based journalists and the views of the general public. He said: “They aren’t obsessing over #MeToo, or transgender rights, or equal pay for BBC journalists. And they do like Mrs May and think she’s doing a job in difficult circumstances.”He saved particular anger for the , spending 15 minutes of the speech criticising the organisation and its views. However, he later accepted that it was “still a great and important paper” and part of the tradition of a British free press, which ensures rival papers are allowed to make contradictory editorial calls, such as over the Edward Snowden leaks – which Dacre strongly opposed.Dacre said: “I don’t agree with the ’s decision to publish Snowden, who now skulks in the murderous kleptocracy that is Russia. The man was a traitor who should have been arrested and not sanctified. But I also passionately believe the  must have the freedom to carry such stories.”He criticised “leftwing” professors of journalism and said it was a ludicrous topic for academic study, with journalism degree programmes “churning out graduates for non-existent jobs”.Ian MacGregor, the ’s editor emeritus and president of the Society of Editors, said Dacre “has been, without doubt, one of the most successful and influential newspaper editors of his generation”.“The British media would be in an awful lot weaker position without him and his enormous contribution,” said MacGregor, presenting him with a cut-glass bowl.Dacre, who ended a 26-year stint as editor of the Daily Mail this summer, made no mention in the speech of his successor, Geordie Greig.Before leaving the editor’s chair, Dacre gave repeated public warnings to Greig about the risk of moving the Daily Mail’s editorial line away from a hard Brexit, advice that Greig has happily ignored – instead turning his newspaper’s anger on the likes of Iain Duncan Smith for attempting to disrupt Theresa May’s negotiations with the EU.Despite speculation that Dacre would continue to exert power over the paper, Greig has made it repeatedly clear that he answers directly to the Daily Mail owner, Viscount Rothermere. The new editor was not in Manchester to hear the advice from his predecessor.Dacre, who turns 70 next week, is understood to have signed with a literary agency and is working on his autobiography. Asked about this, he said: “Every editor thinks about writing his memoirs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c289800d231c155c43823a0c1b4566fc93b24b5f/0_869_7725_4635/master/7725.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a926150510e1a9750a8368e7a633661e","title":"firms switched four day week increase efficiency health happiness","story":"British people work some of the longest hours in Europe, but are among the least productive. Now some companies are shortening the working week to increase efficiency, health and happinessI meet Rich Leigh for a coffee in Gloucester on a Friday, his day off. In fact, his entire company has the day off, because Radioactive PR, the firm led by Leigh, 30, has adopted a four-day week.It is one of a handful of UK businesses that now operate like this: staff still get paid their previous five-day salary, but they work a day less. The company began with a six-week trial and found that they achieved just as much – and there were even signs of growth. The key to the scheme’s success, Leigh says, is how happy his employees now are. “There are two ways to make money in my line of work,” he says, “retain clients and get new ones. Miserable, tired staff can’t do either.”The four-day working week is being touted by some as the answer to Britain’s “productivity problem”. British people work some of the longest hours in Europe: the average British worker takes only a 34-minute lunch break and works 10 hours overtime each week (more often than not, this is unpaid). Yet UK productivity lags seriously behind our European neighbours, who tend to work fewer hours. France recently made it illegal to expect workers to answer emails out of hours, and the average French worker produces more by the end of Thursday than their UK counterparts do in a full week.The EU working time directive sets a limit of 48 working hours a week. Britain is the only EU member that allows workers to opt out of this and work longer hours, a practice that trade unions have argued has been subject to “widespread abuse”.For campaigners, now is the time for a change. There is both opportunity and need, on health, happiness and business grounds. Those who have called for the introduction of a four-day week include the Green party and Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress. O’Grady argues that where businesses have increased their profits as a result of automation, that success should be shared with workers in the form of reduced hours: “It’s time to share the wealth from new technology, not allow those at the top to grab it for themselves,” she says.It is thought that a four-day working week would have a particularly big impact on women, given the caring responsibilities and unpaid domestic labour they often end up undertaking. At the very least, it would be one less day of childcare for families to pay for. “It’s made me feel less stressed about coming back after maternity leave,” says Planells. Could she ever go back to a five-day week? “Honestly, I don’t see myself ever leaving,” she says. “Did I mention how many CVs we’ve had in since people found out we went four days?”The four-day week doesn’t mean working 40 hours over four days, nor is it about shift patterns. Rather it is about working a 28- to 32-hour week but being paid for a 35- to 40-hour, traditional full-time job. In Edinburgh, workers at the tech firm Administrate are also four days a week, although the office is open five – some people work Monday to Thursday others Tuesday to Friday.Administrate introduced the four-day week in 2015. “It was an experiment,” says John Peebles, the CEO. “We wanted to see: if we invest in our people, will the financial outcome be better than if we pinched every penny?”Efficiency has made up for the loss of working hours. “In a lot of tech companies, time is lost to overly long meetings,” says Peebles, “or having beers in the last hour. But what if we just worked really hard for 32 hours a week and didn’t have any downtime?” Administrate has rules on keeping meetings short and encourages team bonding to take place in set spaces (regular team lunches, for example).Price is also concerned by the sentiment behind the movement, which he says is, in part, “the assumption that work isn’t good, so you should do less of it”. He points to the phrase “work-life balance”, which “implies that life is not work”, and argues that rather than concentrating on the quantity of work we do, we should focus on the quality.“We should be thinking about workplace happiness and engagement,” he says. “I know there is a lot of awfully dull and repetitive work that would be great for computers to take away. But then there’s other work that is stimulating, and the question is how we create those jobs into the future.”At the heart of this discussion are some very complex questions: what is work? Is there a difference between good work and bad work, and why is some work paid well and other work less so? Commutes in the UK are getting longer as housing prices in city centres rise, and it is becoming increasingly common for people to answer their emails while commuting. Should that count towards our overall tally of hours?Aidan Harper is the founder of the 4 Day Week campaign. He wants to ensure that a shorter working week is universally guaranteed for all workers, either by legislation or trade union bargaining.“In the UK, we have growing numbers of overworked people,” says Harper, “but we also have a growing number of underworked people, namely gig economy employees looking for more work. So one question is whether the redistribution of time, of workload, might help this.“And there is a more potent question about what the economy is for. Surely the purpose of the economy is to create a good life within it, and have a material basis from which you can be housed, have an education etc. But something our economy is not providing for us is time, which we need. The next stage in economic development should not be to generate more stuff, but to create the conditions in which we can live good lives.”Harper points to the role campaigners and everyday workers have in pushing for positive change. The five-day working week was itself the result of negotiations by unions in the early 20th century – observing technological advances in factories, they negotiated for a formal weekend rather than just a single Sunday off.For Peebles, the time is right to reassess. “Business is different today than 30 years ago, when I couldn’t send an email, couldn’t shop online, had to use a fax machine. So why are we working the same way?”In Gloucester, Leigh is keen to beat the commuter traffic and enjoy the rest of his day off. “Most businesses in the UK are like mine, fairly small,” he says, “one to 10 employees and working in the service industry. So all I’m saying is: why not try it?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/466b3c605acc5ff9cb1ba0fb5e30d15474486cbb/0_816_4441_2664/master/4441.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ac7215f89eb98acd3f405de3c6149a5","title":"her randb star her i wanted to be anonymous","story":"Her songs are streamed in the millions and her music is beloved by Janet Jackson. But who is HER, the songwriter who hides her identity with a pair of sunglasses?Interviewing HER isn’t quite as odd as it should be. Even though the anonymous-ish slow-jam queen doesn’t remove her mirrored sunglasses throughout our meeting. Even though this means for a whole hour I’m basically looking at my own reflection as we sit in the sweet breeze of an air-conditioned hotel lobby in Midtown, Atlanta. Even though I kind of have to go along with the idea that I don’t know the real identity of HER, despite the fact that the most rudimentary Google brings up her full name, age and detailed career history.HER is in fact Gabi Wilson, a singer and multi-instrumentalist from Vallejo, California, who was discovered, aged 10, performing on daytime TV in the US, scooped up by Alicia Keys’s management company and signed to RCA at 14. Although it doesn’t seem to have turned her into a Kids from Fame brat, it isn’t hard to work out that this semi-retreat from the spotlight is about her regaining agency over her identity.Like Sia, Daft Punk and pre-mega fame the Weeknd, HER is as much about the commodification of mystery as she is the music, and like Clark Kent, sunglasses are always worn. This is despite the protestations of her 1.2 million Instagram followers, who are constantly flooding her comments with pleas to “show your face!”. “I wanted to be anonymous,” says HER, dressed down like any other 21-year-old on a Saturday afternoon in jeans, a black T-shirt and trainers, the only concessions to her ludicrous streaming stats and star status apparent in her huge glossy curls and aforementioned sunglasses. The decision certainly wasn’t due to a lack of confidence on HER’s part – just check YouTube for clips of Gabi Wilson performing on telly to millions as a kid, as relaxed as can be. Instead, she says it was down to how open her lyrics were. Though not especially candid, there’s a lot of gloomy heartbreak here: there’s wasted emotions, plenty of “if I can’t be with you what’s the point, really?”. This is music to mope to. Music to dump and be dumped to. This is in no small part down to the first two HER EPs being written from the ages of 14 to 18, a time when even an ignored WhatsApp message can result in weeks of sobbing into a pillow.“Living my truth was very hard – I felt vulnerable,” she says of her reasoning behind releasing music as HER. “Some people ask me: ‘Is it an alter ego, is it another version of yourself?’ But it’s just my inner self. It’s all the thoughts and feelings that sit in the back of my mind and I’m afraid to say.” With this approach to privacy and self-protection, then, it seems strange that HER would want to speak to journalists at all. In fact, it’s only in the past year or so she’s actually felt comfortable talking to the press. “It took me a while to want to do interviews,” she explains. “People always make me uncomfortable when they ask me: ‘Who’s this song about?’ I feel like I let you read my diary and now we have to have a conversation about it! I already let you read it, let’s just leave it at that.”So what is HER’s life like beyond the music? She has three pet snakes that live with her in her apartment in Brooklyn (she shows me pictures on her phone of her favourite, Mike). She’s all grins when she recounts the tale of how her mother wooed her father by cooking him meals from her native Philippines when they lived in opposite apartment buildings in the Bay Area. And she practically floats when speaking about taking her 12-year-old sister on tour. “When I mean private I mean I don’t have a clique,” she says, positioning herself away from the Justin Biebers of the world. “You won’t see me out with so and so. All the gossip – I’m not about that at all. The drama.”Yet, despite HER’s commitment to being low-key, the big names can’t keep away. An invaluable co-sign from Rihanna bought her tune Focus to the attention of millions Alicia Keys has been coaching her for the past decade and she’s here in Atlanta to pay tribute to her latest fan, Janet Jackson, at a glitzy industry ceremony. It was backstage at KOKO after a sold-out London show earlier this year that HER found the 52-year-old pop icon waiting in the wings to say how much she loved her music. “I’ve had many big sisters in the industry and it’s a beautiful thing to have so many mentors,” says HER, reverentially. “It’s easy to feel pressures being a female artist – pressure to look a certain way, to act a certain way, to conform. And having that support from another woman is confirmation that you’re doing exactly what you’re supposed to be doing, which is to stay true to yourself.”But there is a contradiction here. She may be outspoken about how her music can empower women, but she also went on tour with Chris Brown, the man who pleaded guilty to violently assaulting his girlfriend Rihanna in 2009. “He has a past … We’re all human, we’re all imperfect – not excusing or justifying anything – but he admires my art and I admire his, and that’s what it’s about, the celebration of art,” she says of the rapper. Adjusting her glasses, she pauses to reflect on her own approach as soberly as she does on Brown’s. “I don’t focus on the controversy. I don’t focus on anything other than the art.”That “art” is part of a new wave flooding R\u0026ampB. Indie and dance have always had a place for the loners – James Blake, Burial, Aphex Twin et al – but it’s a stance that seems at odds with soul’s more boombastic roots. Yet since the Weeknd uploaded his first tracks to YouTube in 2011 under the cryptic username xoxxxoooxo, confusing and delighting music bloggers in equal measure, the genre hasn’t been as reliant on star power as it once was. More recently, there’s been the shy, almost reclusive Bryson Tiller, who guests on HER’s latest EP, I Used to Know Her: The Prelude EP, and SZA, who’s less about TMZ headlines and more about making you cry about your ex from sixth form.She chuckles throatily when I ask if she’ll ever remove the glasses. Is it part of a marketing plan? Are there meeting rooms filled with label interns figuring out tactics to launch a star? “Eventually you’re gonna have to see my face. But there’s no PowerPoint presentation involved.”I Used to Know Her: The Prelude EP is out now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cd1e39b69c544fd910d309169c84c21d7ffe8f9/185_238_2523_1513/master/2523.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e48518a54b5003860ec9892d429d055","title":"spice girls announce reunion tour without victoria beckham","story":"Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton, Geri Horner and Melanie Chisholm will tour the UK in 2019When five become four (again): the Spice Girls are set to announce a 2019 tour without founding member Victoria Beckham.Beckham – who has often displayed a self-awareness about her lack of natural musical talent – is said to be concentrating on her fashion label, a career that has arguably given her the greatest post-pop success of any Spice Girls member.Melanie Brown recently attended a Halloween party dressed as Beckham, holding up a sign that read: “No I am not going on tour.” She was joined by boyfriend Gary Madatyan dressed as David Beckham, who held a sign that said: “Please, please, please do it for the Spice Girls fans.”It will be the second time the band has toured with a reduced membership.

He said he also enjoyed certain columnists in the Times.Asked five times to name a female columnist he enjoyed reading, he named the Daily ’s Allison Pearson.Wright, a former lawyer who is also responsible for digital industries and regulating social media, has faced questions about his understanding of the media industry. He did not have a Twitter account before taking up his new job in the summer.In an appearance at the annual Society of Editors conference in Salford, he said quality British journalism was “not sufficiently rewarded” but any proposals on a new government-supported funding model would have to wait for the conclusion of the Cairncross review of the British newspaper industry.“I’m confident that the review will show that there are ways for quality journalism to go from strength to strength,” he said, suggesting there could be a particular provision for the funding of struggling local newspapers.“Our press has a level of trust and freedom that is rightly envied across the world, but a free and trusted press must also be a sustainable press,” he said.Wright said the “transfer of trust from generation to generation can no longer be taken for granted” and news outlets needed to invest in investigative journalism and authoritative reporting of politics.“We need to persuade the public of the value of this kind of journalism to help the public to rediscover the difference between the things you see online that just aren’t true and good quality journalism.”He also said newsrooms must ersify the social and geographic background of their employees in order to remain relevant and attract readers: “Ask probing questions about the make-up of your own organisations, not simply because it’s the right thing to do but because it makes good business sense.”He spoke out against politicians using parliamentary privilege to break court injunctions, such as when Peter Hain identified the Topshop boss Sir Philip Green as the subject of a series of articles in the Daily .“It’s a matter for Peter Hain but as a former attorney general it is very important to respect what the court has decided,” said Wright. “I wouldn’t have done it if I had been in his position but I’m not going to criticise him for what he did. I don’t think it’s sensible of us to push the limits of parliamentary privilege too far.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f7f2c7986e36a7985e2bb5cd6640643ce47df02/0_82_2486_1492/master/2486.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50397708133b5f284a6b9d66d50f8c94","title":"uks top lawyers urge theresa may to back second brexit vote","story":"More than 1,500 sign letter calling on PM to let British people have final say on EU membershipMore than 1,500 of the UK’s top lawyers have urged Theresa May and MPs to back a second Brexit referendum, saying that “democratic government is not frozen in time”.Labour peer Helena Kennedy QC, former court of appeal judge Konrad Schiemann, and David Edward, a former judge at the court of justice of the European Communities, are among those who have called for a “people’s vote” on EU membership.In a letter to the prime minister, they say parliament should not be bound by the 2016 vote any more than it should be by the 1975 referendum that took Britain into the EU, especially when there were question marks over its validity.They write that “voters are entitled to know what they are voting for”, adding: “There was a key difference between 1975 and 2016. The earlier referendum was held after negotiations were complete, so voters knew what they were voting for.“In 2016, the nature of the negotiation process and its outcome were unknown.

We represent people from across industry and society and we see every day the way the prospect of a catastrophic Brexit deal is already causing real harm.“This letter to the prime minister has been signed by over a thousand of my colleagues who are convinced that not only is a people’s vote the right thing to do, it is the most democratic thing to do as well.”The letter follows a similar one from more than 70 business leaders who have backed a second Brexit referendum, warning that the UK faces “either a blindfold or a destructive hard Brexit” that would be bad for firms and jobs.Meanwhile, more than 1,000 people in the north of Ireland – from the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland – including representatives from the arts, business, education, sport, law and medicine have written an open letter to the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, asking him to defend the rights of Irish citizens in the region.“We collectively seek to give expression to a deep sense of fear in respect of the current Brexit negotiations,” said a spokesman. “We urge the taoiseach and the Irish government to stand firm in these negotiations, to stand up for the Good Friday Agreement and a rights-based society, and to ensure that rights enjoyed in Donegal will continue to be enjoyed in Derry.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc487dfc4b1ae6d27ad443170aeeb18aef77255c/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f290d31985bfdbef8b318e14816d589","title":"tell us has your company adopted a living wage policy","story":"We want to hear from readers working for companies paying Living Wage Foundation rates as an increase is announcedStaff of some 4,700 employers who have adopted a voluntary living wage policy are in line for an inflation-beating pay rise.The foundation’s figures are £1.17 higher an hour than the national living wage imposed by the government for workers over the age of 25.

Buoyed by their narrow win over the Springboks – the history books will not record that Owen Farrell’s last-gasp hit on André Esterhuizen should have been a penalty – England’s new defensive system under Mitchell is being tipped to cause New Zealand problems. “I worked with Mitch a lot at the Bulls and he is going to make a massive difference to them,” predicted the South Africa centre Jesse Kriel. “They had a lot more line speed, which is what Mitch likes.

Should the second-string New Zealand side be lauded for scoring 10 tries or criticised for conceding five? Perhaps best just to celebrate the return to the international stage of Dane Coles, for whom it had been a long time coming. Coles had been sidelined for 12 months after requiring two operations to a knee injury sustained against France last autumn. He has admitted to having doubts as to whether he would return at all and all this after missing out on the 2017 British \u0026amp Irish Lions series due to series of injury problems. At the peak of his powers he was the world’s best in his position and we can only hope his comeback continues. Gerard MeagherJordan Larmour will come up against tougher opponents than Italy this autumn but when compared to “a young Christian Cullen” by the Azzurri head coach and fellow Irishman, Conor O’Shea, it must be considered high praise indeed. Larmour has had to wait in the wings for his first start, winning his first six caps off the bench, but he faced Italy from the off on Saturday in Chicago and crowned the occasion with a hat-trick. He beat 12 defenders in total, making 249 metres, and his third try is well worth a watch. Larmour, still just 21, has been tipped for big things for a while now and he appears poised to deliver this autumn. GM• Larmour overwhelms Italy with Chicago hat-trickRight. This time. Surely. We’ve said it before, but if Wales don’t beat Australia this weekend one has to wonder what it will take. Warren Gatland made the reasonable point that they usually start their autumns against a match-hardened southern-hemisphere team. It is also true that there must be something about the way Wales look at the Aussies, because they always seem to encounter them at their best. Or maybe there’s just something about the way Wales play that allows it. Either way, Wales are No 3 in the world. They have had a game under their belt. If not now, when?

If he has a bad day – and he does have them – so do Scotland. Duncan Weir may be mounting a comeback at Worcester, but for now Scotland are invested in Adam Hastings as an alternative. He started poorly, missing one penalty to touch and scuffing another loose kick downfield but Gregor Townsend, his coach and predecessor, was most pleased with the way he rode those wobbles. He looked confident at the tee and plays with an elegance more reminiscent of John Rutherford than his father.

Her only competition is herselfWe observers have long since exhausted the well of superlatives when it comes to Simone Biles. The 4ft 8in, 105lb sprite from suburban Houston had emerged as a once-in-a-lifetime talent even before her star-making coronation at the Rio Olympics, where she fulfilled her long-held promise with four gold medals in seven unforgettable days. Turns of phrase, margins of victory, records broken: these languages are entirely ill-suited for translating her unique physical genius, which, truly, must be seen to be believed. That Biles is the best athlete in America today, which she is, feels like an undersell.Take her showing at last week’s world championships, where the 21-year-old became the first woman to win a fourth all-around world championship and the most decorated female gymnast ever. The outcome itself was unremarkable: Biles has won every major team and inidual all-around competition she’s entered since her senior career began in 2013, a dumbfounding run of consistency that prompted the sport’s cognoscenti to declare her the most talented gymnast in history before she’d competed in an Olympics.What stood out was that Biles, one could reasonably argue, was having the worst big competition of her career – and she still won a medal in every single event.What can you say about that?Last week’s championship in Doha marked Biles’ first international meet since winning the Olympic all-around championship, the sport’s most coveted title. Maybe it was the rust of a two-year layoff, which included more than 14 months away from the gym and those famous six-hour-a-day, six-day-a-week training sessions. Or that she’d spent the night before the competition began in an emergency room with a kidney stone that was too big to pass, and was left with no alternative but to soldier through the pain since doping regulations precluded her from prescription medication that could have alleviated the discomfort.Whatever it was, Biles was not herself in Thursday’s all-around. She sat down on her vault in the opening rotation, marking her first fall in more than 60 career routines at worlds or the Olympics. The shock only redoubled when Biles fell off the beam in the third rotation, prompting a look of consternation that not even her outstanding performances on the uneven bars and floor exercise could fully erase.Yet Biles not only won but won by a record margin, outpacing Japan’s Mai Murakami by 1.693 points. Even not at her best, she was the best. And it wasn’t particularly close.“It doesn’t show who I am,” a disappointed Biles said afterward, the gold medal dangling from her neck. “And that’s kind of disappointing.”The American’s two falls might have proven fatal under the perfect-10 judging system that governed the sport until 2006, where maximum scores were capped and falls were a mandatory half-point deduction. But the current open-ended system includes a difficulty score that accounts for more than one-third of the final tally – and Biles’ “d-score” for the all-around was 2.7 points greater than any of her competitors (compared to 0.6 higher in Rio).Falls under the present rules are an automatic full-point deduction, but the start values for Biles’ routines give her a cushion that’s practically insurmountable. For years the most common refrain underpinning Biles’ greatness was that she could fall multiple times and still win, but after a half-decade of metronomic consistency the theory was finally put to the test on Thursday – and it passed comfortably. She could have fallen a third time and still taken gold. “Instead of thinking I could win,” said Murakami, whose score would have earned the gold in Biles’ absence last year, “I was thinking: ‘Oh, Biles can fall.’”Thursday’s result might have been controversial if Biles’ supremacy, her ability to perform skills no other woman in the world could even credibly attempt in competition, wasn’t plainly evident. The fact is, Biles is so far ahead of everyone else it’s almost embarrassing. She’s performing elements an entire generation of competitors will struggle to approach and it’s hard to recall having seen anything like it before in any sport.Where the old system rewarded competitors for downgrading their routines, the current rules incentivize the sort of boundary-pushing athleticism that, it must be said, elevates gymnastics as a spectator sport. There’s no room for playing it safe. Say what you want about it, but open-ended scoring encourages competitors to push their craft forward, the purest distillation of the Olympic spirit: Faster, Higher, Stronger.Biles’ uneven routines in Qatar weren’t limited to the all-around, but there were far more peaks than troughs during the week. She managed a silver medal in the bars after a 14th-place finish on the apparatus in Rio, showing off a dramatic improvement in her weakest discipline. The overall haul of four golds, a silver and a bronze makes her the first American to medal in every event at a major competition – team, all-around, vault, bars, beam and floor – and the first woman of any nationality to do it since Romania’s Daniela Silivas at the 1988 Olympics.She capped her record-breaking week with a gold in Saturday’s floor exercise final. It’s long been Biles’ favorite discipline, not simply because it offers the broadest canvas to showcase her uniquely brilliant physical skills, but because it scarcely feels like a discipline at all. (As her former coach Aimee Boorman told me in Rio, that’s where “she just plays”.)There are few analogues in sports for the slack-jawed wonder that Biles elicits on the floor. To behold her spacetime-cheating routine to clinch her fourth gold on Saturday was like watching Vince Carter flouting gravity in the NBA dunk contest or Maradona slaloming through half the England team at Azteca Stadium. After the most trying competitive week of her life, it offered the clearest callback to her Rio breakout and, perhaps, a glimmer of what’s to come.The records will only continue to topple in the run-up to the 2020 Olympics. Biles is now level with Russia’s Svetlana Khokrina as the most decorated female gymnast in world championships history with 20 career medals and will almost certainly eclipse Vitaly Scherbo’s all-time mark for either gender (23) at next year’s worlds in Stuttgart. And then Tokyo, where she can become the oldest woman in more than five decades to win the Olympic all-around title and the first repeat champion since Vera Caslavska did it for the former Czechoslovakia in 1968.The greatest champions are defined not by winning when they’re peaking and all the tumblers are aligned in their favor, yet by how they persist and problem-solve and pull it from the bag when they’re not at their best. But for Biles, who remains so far ahead of everyone it’s going to take the sport years to catch up, the stakes of those gut-check moments are notably subdued. Her only competition is herself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4bf88358ef51f073e739a7adf8cd97cbbdb305f/0_277_2000_1199/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35f3852fff3de57b8404f64f4e59fe0f","title":"pret a porter marliyn stafford 1960 paris montmartre","story":"In 1950s Paris, photographer Marilyn Stafford was commissioned to capture the glamour and elegance of a new fashion concept – prêt-à-porter.She took models out of the studios and into the gritty working-class areas of the French capital, where they attracted the attention of curious children playing in the streets.The result was a collection of black-and-white photographs showcasing the likes of Chanel and Givenchy that reflect both the style and the darker, dirtier side of the City of Light.In this shot, a pouting child in a well-worn dress and scuffed boots sits perched on railings on the Montmartre steps, in stark contrast to the designer-clad model who is gesturing theatrically.“I loved the streets. I wasn’t so interested in the clothes – I was looking for interesting places, backgrounds, passageways and alleys,” Stafford says.“And in those days if you were a woman out in Paris with a camera, you had kids following you.”Stafford, who was born in Ohio in 1925, initially worked as a singer after arriving in postwar Paris, performing at a club near the Champs Élysées, where she met Edith Piaf, Charles Aznavour and Bing Crosby, as well as the French photographers Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert Capa.After her voice failed, she took the Rolleiflex camera she used for “casual snaps” and sought advice from Cartier-Bresson – who let Stafford watch him while he worked – and Capa, who suggested that she join him in documenting the war in Indochina (where he was later killed).Shunning the battlefields, Stafford, who turns 93 tomorrow, went on to report from around the world, including for the Observer.Today, Stafford admits there was another reason for using the street as a fashion backdrop: “I had no studio.

Love Without Limits (BBC Two), the first episode of Louis Theroux’s new documentary miniseries, Altered States, took him to Portland, Oregon, the epicentre of polyamory, or ethical non-monogamy, as it is now called. It is centred on the facility of “compersion” – taking pleasure in seeing your significant other(s) happy in whatever way it takes. If you’re exhausted already, I’d advise you not to read on.Theroux gently interrogates three poly groups. Joelle, Mattias and AJ live and love together on an eco-homestead (I told you not to read on) and have other partners, too. Or in Joelle’s case: “‘Sweeties’ ... I tend not to use hierarchical terms in my polydynamics.” AJ is pregnant by Mattias and takes on another “metamor” (another non-hierarchical term used by the poly community) during filming. Mattias is surprised to find this testing his compersion capacity.Then there are Bob, Nick and Amanda, who live as a “thruple”. The latter pair were college sweethearts, but when Amanda developed feelings for Bob, she proposed inviting him into their relationship rather than breaking up. Nick – after a year of discussion – agreed. He remains monogamous with Amanda. They used to have threesomes because “we thought we had to”, but that didn’t work because “Bob lasts a really long time in bed and I don’t. So I’d have to go first or I’d fall asleep. Or go down and play video games or,” he added with a grin, “have lunch. But I’m better at foreplay, I enjoy it more.” Now they take it in turns. It seems to be working quite well. Not least, one suspects, for Amanda. “Is there a part of you that wishes you were enough for Amanda in the same way as she is enough for you?” Theroux asks the men in his patented tone of careful interest. “A little part of me wishes I could make her completely happy,” says Bob. At least one little part is working as hard as it can at that already.And then there is the married couple Heidi and Jerry her lover, Joe and his wife, Gretchen. To the casual observer, Heidi and Joe seemed to be stretching the definition of ethical non-monogamy. Gretchen said she was happy that Heidi was having the sex with Joe that she had lost all interest in having while they worked on other problems in their marriage. Jerry had a thousand-yard stare and a very soft voice while he insisted that everything was fine, after his period of “adjustment” when first an old friend of Heidi’s and then Joe inserted themselves into his marriage. “It was hurtful,” he remembers with a dreadful smile. “And anxiety-producing.” He has not yet found a partner. “But when I do it will be awesome.”Theroux presses both women on Jerry’s – self-evident, to Theroux and us – loneliness. Echoing other polys he has interviewed, they are both very clear. “I am not responsible for Jerry’s happiness,” says Heidi. “You are responsible for your own happiness,” says Gretchen. Jerry suggests he could join Heidi and Joe one night. Or at least watch. Heidi’s face tells you all you need to know about who their setup is benefiting. She slams the lid down hard on the idea. Compersion is a one-way street, apparently.Theroux, as ever, treads his tightrope without a wobble (unless you count the unnecessary stunt of sending him to a borderline-orgy, even if it did provide a little light relief). He asks just enough and just hard-enough questions to challenge his interviewees and force them (and us) to think, without alienating them, and hangs back enough to let the answers’ openness or person’s defensiveness, body language, pauses and silences say at least as much again. By the end, the issue is complicated rather than simplified and your own questions fill your head as the credits roll.Is polyamory a new way of dealing with ancient problems or just a new way of trying to avoid them? Is infidelity immoral, or only when it produces the look Jerry has on his face between determined smiles? What if it always, always does, somewhere along the line? Are we hardwired to betray or feel betrayed, or are these only constructs? If we’re not hardwired then why did we construct them in the first place? Is being responsible only for your own happiness a better basis on which to build a relationship or a society, or selfishness of the highest order that will sew the seeds of its own destruction? Are the polyamorous denying their essential humanity, indulging it or evolving beyond it?Answers on a postcard please. I am truly exhausted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69c41a4784d96f9f4140797452c8495adc366268/0_145_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=928097b33bb4253c284e962cc936f298","title":"2018 midterm elections why do they matter","story":"If Democrats win control of Congress, they could hamper Trump’s agenda and begin impeachment proceedings Americans head to the polls on Tuesday for their first chance to pass judgment on Donald Trump’s presidency since he took the White House in 2016.Will Republicans will be able to keep control of both chambers of Congress?

To win a majority in the house, they need a net gain of 23 seats.Republicans also currently hold 26 of the 36 governor’s seats that are up for grabs. If the Democrats can increase the number they hold, it will offer them more opportunities to frustrate Trump’s agenda outside Washington.Historically, voter turnout for midterm elections tends to be lower than for general elections, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t important.With a Senate majority, the Democrats would be able to block cabinet and supreme court appointments. With a House majority, Democrats can significantly hamper the Trump administration’s ability to implement its programs and could also begin impeachment proceedings against Trump, though they would need a two-thirds majority in the Senate to remove him from office.According to polls, Democrats are currently forecast to win the House but not the Senate.

They say the citizenship question will discourage immigrants from participating and dilute political representation and funds for states that tend to vote Democratic.The trial is proceeding on schedule despite the Trump justice department’s invitation to the supreme court to block it.US district judge Jesse M Furman last week harshly criticized the federal government’s efforts to delay or stop the trial.He called them remarkable, given that the federal government insists a speedy resolution of lawsuits is necessary because of the need to finalize census preparations.The justice department insists Furman should decide the case based only on the administrative record rather than evidence gathered by the plaintiffs, which includes the deposition of commerce department officials and others.Furman said he will allow evidence to be submitted during the trial before he decides whether it is appropriate to consider it when he issues his opinion.Supreme court justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas essentially invited justice department lawyers to request to stop the trial. When the high court ruled that commerce secretary Wilbur Ross did not have to submit to an immediate deposition, Gorsuch wrote a partial dissent. Joined by Thomas, Gorsuch suggested that Furman delay the trial and await further supreme court guidance.Furman struck back in a written decision giving the trial a green light: “It is the government’s conduct in this case, not the court’s review, that is ‘highly unusual, to say the least’,” he said, highlighting a partial quote from Gorsuch, who had written that the trial would probe the commerce secretary’s “mental processes”.“This is all highly unusual, to say the least,” Gorsuch said.Three days after Furman ruled, the justice department returned to the supreme court, seeking to block the trial. The request was met with silence until late on Friday, when the court issued a brief order letting the trial proceed. Gorsuch, Thomas and Samuel Alito said they would have blocked it.It was not known how the six other justices voted, including newly sworn-in justice Brett Kavanaugh. But five of the six must have agreed to let it take place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4d3ade5e5451e360b1bf2f2a293ed360f135124/666_848_6054_3632/master/6054.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67c13d5a6ce0e86a559cec16a3457375","title":"tell us about the things you do that represent non capitalist living","story":"From freecycling to volunteering, we’d like to hear about the things you do that go against the capitalist and consumerist grain“Most of us would say, if asked, that we live in a capitalist society, but vast amounts of how we live our everyday lives - our interactions with and commitments to family lives, friendships, avocations, membership in social, spiritual and political organisations - are in essence non capitalist or even anticapitalist, full of things we do for free, out of love and on principle.”The positive flipside of the internet age, of course, is that such things are now comparatively easy to get going, and then publicise.

This year, I heard my wife giggling ... that led me to the dailyportalz site. They seemed so clever, and many were a great reflection of the way Japanese people can be keen observers of tics, foibles, and minor social dilemmas,” he said.Not surprisingly for a country with a long tradition of cosplay and an appetite for American culture, Japan has embraced Halloween with an enthusiasm matched in few other countries.While the US tradition of dishing out sweets to trick-or-treating children seems to be confined to police officers and yakuza gangsters, for many young Japanese, wearing a costume – from the macabre to the playful – and comparing their handiwork in bars, clubs, and on the street has become an unmissable annual event.Japan, though, is less prepared for impromptu gatherings of costumed hordes at popular spots like Shibuya’s scramble crossing, where more than a dozen people were arrested last week for groping and theft.One group overturned a small truck, while volunteers spent the early hours of morning cleaning up huge quantities of rubbish left behind by their fellow revellers. For businesses, residents and the police, Halloween Japan-style may be more trouble than it’s worth."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3684334.1541183727!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"families feel the pinch as cost of living rises to over 50 000 a year","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Those who bought a property at the height of the boom might find themselves spending €52,593 a year. Those who bought this year could spend a total of €47,623 over the next 12 months. Photograph: iStockWhen the cost of groceries, mortgage payments, utility bills, motoring, phones, the most modest of social lives, home insurance, car insurance, school and childcare and all the other things that most of us consider essential to live are totted up, a typical family who bought even a small home during the boom years are likely to spend more than €50,000 over the next 12 months.That is an after-tax figure and goes some way towards explaining why two adults earning an average wage still struggle to keep their heads above water despite the fact the economy has recovered in recent years.According to independent figures compiled by this newspaper, coupled with the seventh annual cost-of-living survey published this morning by AA Home Insurance, prices in key areas have climbed over the last 12 months and have largely wiped out any savings that people can expect as a result of tax changes rolled out in last month’s budget.According to the figures from the AA, the annual cost of owning and maintaining a family home now stands at €16,374, an increase of over €350 compared with 2017. And that figure does not include food, entertainment, education, clothes or any of the other things people need to stay alive.The AA carries out a detailed calculation each year which looks at the total cost of owning a house and subsequently running one in Ireland. Mortgage and property tax are calculated based on the current average property price. All other expenditure – from broadband and heating to the cost of domestic appliances – is researched and calculated according to prices as of October 2018.Looking at the figures going back several years suggests Irish consumers have been on a real rollercoaster of costs over the past decade.In 2007, when the average cost of buying a home was €344,000, the annual cost of servicing that home – including mortgage repayments – was €21,344.08. In 2014, with average house prices at €193,000\u0026nbspthe cost of running a home fell to €15,891.67.In 2015, with the average house price nationally at €205,000, the AA put the cost of running a home at €15,156, while in 2016 with average house prices at €215,000, the cost was €15,876.45. Last year, the average house price was €228,000 and the AA yearly figure was €16,006.62.This year it is €16,374.45 as the average property asking price climbed to €243,000.Increases in mortgage repayments and a jump in energy costs are the key drivers behind the €350 per annum increase in the annual cost of owning and maintaining a family home – the third successive year the costs have climbed, the “Cost of Running a Home” analysis suggests.That figure is a key reason why many of us are not feeling any real impact from a sustained economic recovery.The increase in the cost of running a home comes following a rise in the national average price of a second-hand home in Ireland. Values increased from €224,500 during the third quarter of last year to €243,000 in the third quarter of this year.Those who took out a 90 per cent mortgage this year are likely to pay €10,069.08 per annum – an increase of 1.86 per cent on last year.“Another year of rising household costs is the last thing that homeowners would have wanted to hear but it is, unfortunately, the situation that we find ourselves in,” says Conor Faughnan, the AA’s Director of Consumer Affairs.“While the continued climb of house prices has been one of the major stories of 2018, it’s not just the cost of mortgage repayments or getting your foot on the property ladder that have risen in the past 12 months,” he adds.“Home heating and electricity costs have also surged in the past year, meaning that even those who were fortunate enough to acquire their home when property prices were a little lower have seen their wallets take a significant hit.He says “urgent action in terms of the available housing stock is needed” if the issue of rising house prices is to be tackled “but questions also need to be asked of what supports can be made available to those struggling to meet these costs”.While the AA bases its calculations on those of a new buyer, there is also the “negative equity generation” – homeowners who bought their house at the peak of the boom. And the picture painted for this cohort is bleaker still.According to the AA figures, the group who bought a house in 2007 at the very height of the boom, pays €5,605.44 more on their mortgage repayments than their counterparts who purchased their homes in the third quarter of this year.Maintenance, repair and contingency funds is the second single most expensive bill for Irish householders and has increased by 0.7 per cent on 2017. The AA estimates that the average homeowner is likely to spend or set aside €1,255.56 each year to keep up with wear and tear. This figure equates to almost 8 per cent of the overall estimated cost of owning and running a home.Taking annual average usage figures of 11,000 kWh and 4,200 kWh for a three- or four-bedroom detached house respectively, the AA estimates that the average homeowner will spend €785.90 – an increase of 11 per cent – heating their home this year and a further €1,047.33 on electricity – also an increase of 11 per cent.Among the variables that remained the same as or close to last year were television licence costs at €160, property tax at €405, and AA Home Membership at €125.88.Other costs included in the AA Home Insurance study were: home insurance which is calculated at about €566.98, telephone and broadband bills at €434.62, household appliances at €550, household cleaning products at €311.03 and domestic refuse collection at €306.07.Last year the price of home insurance was put at €547.81 while telephone and broadband bills were averaged at €468.66. The cost of household appliances was said to be €573.82 while the cost of household cleaning products was put at at €281.85 and domestic refuse collection, which costs an average of €304.51.The AA figures, while comprehensive, only look at the costs of keeping a roof over your head and don’t factor in fairly important elements such as food, transport and all the other things that most people would struggle to live without.To work out how much a typical family of two adults and two children will need to spend over the next 12 months, we used the standard financial statement that banks ask customers to fill in if they are trying to restructure debts. Among the costs covered are health insurance, transport expenses, food, clothes and grooming, entertainment, childcare, education and mobile phones. So, how are those costs bearing up this year?There is a huge number of plans and a huge number of variables when it comes to health insurance. We compared three broadly similar family-friendly plans. Laya Healthcare’s Essential Connect Family plan will cost two adults and two children €3,081 compared with €3,052 last year. The VHI’s Family Plan Level 1 will cost €2,537, down from €2,805 last year. A Family Focus plan from Irish Life Health, meanwhile, is €3,673 – the same as last year. The average comes out at €3,097, compared with €3,176 in 2017.The average motorist drives 16,000km (9,900 miles) every year and the average price of petrol is €1.44 a litre. Driving the average family car, which does 12.4km per litre (35 miles per gallon), the average Irish driver will spend about €1,857 on petrol compared with €1,755 last year – and €1,664 in 2016.The cost of comprehensive insurance for two adults depends on many factors – notably location, driving history, no-claims bonus and type of car – and although prices have fallen back slightly compared with last year’s highs, our notional family can expect to have little change out of €1,150 this year.The average annual motor tax is €408 per motorist while at least €400 will have to be put aside to cover servicing and maintenance. If you spend €10,000 on a car, keep it for five years and then sell it for half the price you paid for it, the annual cost is €1,000, which takes the total running costs to €4,815 – last year we put that cost at €4,545.There has not been much movement in supermarket prices over the last year – either up or down so if the average Irish household spends €175 a week on groceries, the total bill will come in at €9,100 compared with €8,840 last year, although that doesn’t factor in a Christmas blow-out of any kind.According to the Insolvency Service of Ireland expenditure guidelines, the minimum an adult needs to cover the cost of “social inclusion” is €28.97 a week – and that is to cover the cost of “sports activities and social events such as visits to the cinema”. That seems somewhat mean to us so it we give each adult an extra tenner a week to blow on themselves and an extra €10 to cover each child each week, the annual spend on social inclusion for a family of four will come to €5,092.Education and childcare: €7,745According to the annual school costs survey published by Barnardos in August when the cost of clothes, shoes, books, stationery, classroom resources and the voluntary contribution are totted up, a child going into senior infants will cost €360, while the cost of sending a child into secondary school climbs to €765. If we allow a further €500 to cover costs for trips and extra-curricular activities and assume our notional household has one child in senior infants class and one in first year, then the annual cost of a free education climbs to €1,625 – down slightly on last year’s figure.Schools in Ireland are obliged to open for 183 days a year, so if both parents are working, then after-school childcare costs will have to be added to the bill. Our notional family have found themselves a childminder who charges €170 a week for the school year of 36 weeks, which is a total each year of €6,120. Combining that and the education costs, the total spend rises to €7,745.Assuming the man in our notional household visits the barber eight times a year and his partner visits a hairdressers once every 10 weeks (plus once for a special occasion), the total cost of haircare alone will reach €800. If the family then spends just €50 a month on clothes, the amount needed rises to €1,400.When you put it all together, that means the average person who bought a home at the average price in 2018 could easily spend a total of €47,623 over the next 12 months. Those who bought a property at the height of the boom might find themselves spending €52,593. And that is without taking any holidays or factoring in Christmas, birthdays or anything that could be classified as a significant treat over the course of a year.Given that there aren’t very many households where the combined pre-tax income tops €100,000, is it any wonder so many people are still feeling the pinch?"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3684184.1541167032!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no more buck passing or dithering dublin needs a new boss","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIllustration: Fuchsia MacAreeThere’s a classic trope in horror films where the protagonist sets aside the norms of rational behaviour and goes down into an unlit cellar, or gets into a car with an obviously unhinged stranger, while the audience can see the terrible event about to unfold and are willing the victim to retreat.It’s a feeling that will be familiar to any long-time observer of Dublin local authority proceedings. Impending disaster is painfully apparent and yet, time and again, councillors willingly and wilfully hurl themselves lemming-like over cliffs to lose their limited powers in the ravine at the bottom.In 2001, councillors – all councillors not just Dublin ones – lost their powers over waste collection and disposal, following their failure to ratify plans for waste disposal facilities, or any form of waste charging. As a result this power was transferred to council management, hugely unpopular bin charges were introduced, and the Poolbeg incinerator, which all parties opposed, was built.More recently, the failure to agree a route for the Liffey cycle path, which had been six years in the planning, resulted in the scheme being removed from the control of Dublin City Council and handed over to the National Transport Authority.In this case it wasn’t just the councillors (who couldn’t agree traffic ersions past their constituents’ houses) who were to blame, but also council officials, who produced endless iterations of the scheme, one of which saw double-decker buses rerouted through an existing apartment block.The most recent, and one of the most damning failures or officialdom to get to grips with decision making, is the College Green plaza refusal farce. The council tip-toed around the issue for a decade, tinkering with selective traffic restrictions, musing over fountains and statuary, but never really grasping the problem, which required getting buy-in from Dublin Bus before the project went to An Bord Pleanála for approval – a step which itself should have been taken years before.Surely there’s a better way of getting things done in the city. Could this dithering, bottling, buck-passing and procrastination be solved by Dublin having a directly elected mayor?“The central power, the most important point, of having a directly elected mayor, is that they have a ‘bully pulpit’,” Dr Deiric Ó Broin, DIT academic and co-author of the upcoming book Mayoral Governance in Dublin, argues.“The elected role gives them the authority to argue for more investment in the city, for keeping a more appropriate share of the money generated in Dublin. And they have to deliver their job is on the line. If they don’t deliver they may not be re-elected. That concentrates minds.”However, the concept of a mayor is one thing, the reality of the role and its functions is quite another, Ó Broin says.“The big issue is what powers the mayor would have and where would they come from. There is no point if the mayor is just a lord mayor, as in they have significant ceremonial but minor functional role, but who lasts for a five-year term.”Dublin city chief executive Owen Keegan agrees. “If it is to be successful the directly elected mayor has to have real powers, but he or she can only have real powers where the powers are taken from somewhere else. This notion that there’s some unallocated power that you can give to the mayor has no basis in reality – all power is already allocated.”And there isn’t much power within the hands of the council to give to a new mayor, Keegan says. “Since local government is weak here, the power and functions would have to come from central government, and that is a real issue because if there’s a directly elected mayor who is responsible for energy, and communications and transport in Dublin it doesn’t leave very much for the central Government to do.”Another vexing issue is what physical area would be governed by the mayor. “Culturally and politically we are obsessed with counties and county boundaries. I could see an argument for a city-only directly elected mayor and that gets away from that problem, but I don’t see how a city-based mayor could have responsibility for transport in Dublin, which crosses local authority boundaries,” Ó Broin says.This issue of boundaries played a large part in the collapse of the last mayoral plan. In 2013, then minister for the environment Phil Hogan decided, despite there being no legal requirement, that the councillors in all four Dublin local authorities would have to be in favour before Dubliners would get a chance to vote in a plebiscite on whether or not to have a mayor.The following year Dublin City, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, and South Dublin voted overwhelmingly in favour of the proposal but it was vetoed by Fingal, whose councillors felt they would be the poor country cousins, largely ignored by a city-focused mayor who would only be after their airport.As Gerry McGuire, a Labour councillor at the time, said there would be “no chance of getting a pothole fixed in rural Fingal”.Hogan showing great fortitude in keeping a straight face said he was “disappointed” as he was “the greatest proponent of devolution probably in the history of the State”.Last year the Government revived the mayoral proposal, making provision for a plebiscite this year, but it has recently kicked the can down the road, and kicked it out of the capital, determining that regional cities would vote at next year’s local elections on whether to have a mayor, but in Dublin it would first be referred to a citizens’ assembly for the capital.It seems like another unnecessary hurdle given that a similar forum spent five months formulating proposals for the mayor’s role in 2013, and, at that time surveys showed public support for a Dublin mayor was up to 80 per cent.Even if Dublin does get a mayor, what the Government appears to be proposing is a toothless role, either a mayor with the same powers as the current lord mayor, except elected, or an “executive mayor” who would take on some of the functions of the council chief executive.A plebiscite to decide whether there should be a mayor is unnecessary, Lacey says. “If the Government is serious about making progress let them legislate for it now. There is no need for a plebiscite. Successive governments never sought permission as they systematically dismantled local government in the past, so let them just repair it.”However, Lacey does not believe it’s necessary that the mayor would be all-powerful from the outset. “Calling for the full range of powers to be set out in advance is misguided. This is a position and a role that needs to be established and then given space to evolve.”But he says he can see particular areas where a mayor could make achievements straight away which might seem minor, but would be significant.“A mayor could initially have responsibility for natural resources. For example there isn’t much point in Dublin City Council cleaning the river Dodder in Donnybrook, if it’s not being cleaned first in Tallaght. Or sports capital grants – it makes no sense for a civil servant sitting in an office in Kerry to decide what local sports organisation in Dublin gets a grant.”Then, he suggests, other powers could be added such as waste and traffic policy, which should be “brought back under control of the council anyway”, he said.Ó Broin cites the system in Copenhagen as one where the mayor having control of these services works well. “The mayor has responsibility for education, welfare, labour services, welfare, climate change and a range of municipal services – Denmark, and Scandinavian countries in general, have very good, empowered local government.”Further afield, Boston and Toronto are recognised as good examples of mayor-led cities, he says. While our nearest neighbours have had some successful mayors, in some British cities, including Stoke-on-Trent, they have scrapped the office.The London model, Lacey believes, is not the system that should be copied in Dublin. “I don’t think the London model is a good one, with an all powerful mayor and a fairly toothless assembly. I’d like to a see a mayor working in partnership with a much smaller council – 24 or even 18 councillors. We should reduce the four councils to a manageable size, and give them more responsibility.”Keegan thinks the London model has worked well, particularly in relation to the mayor’s transport and policing supervisory functions, but he is with Lacey on the reducing in numbers of councillors from the current 63 in the city.“I am impressed by cities that have a small number of full-time councillors. In many cases they have executive functions. I think these councils, with a large number of councillors, make everything very difficult. Dublin City Council is too large. We are twinned with San Jose, where there’s a mayor, and I think they have eight or nine council members.”Keegan, however, remains unconvinced of the merits of having a mayor in Dublin. “I am a little bit concerned that the next ‘big idea’ is the directly elected mayor, and we’ll all lorry into that with great enthusiasm, but I have seen very little convincing analysis as to why this is such a good idea.“It’s been presented as a panacea to everything that’s wrong in Dublin, that will automatically be made right the day after we have a directly elected mayor.”Dublin doesn’t get credit for its success he says. “I don’t accept the notion that Dublin is a basket case. On many parameters Dublin is a very successful city. A good litmus test is the multinationals. They come here because they can attract people to live here. Of course it has problems with transport, and housing but these are problems of success. There was no housing affordability problem when we were in the depths of recession.”The “mad rush” towards the directly elected mayor idea reminds him of the “mad rush” to set up Irish Water. “Water supply was and is a major challenge but there was a notion that if you set up a separate utility everything would be hunky dory, but its implementation left a lot to be desired.”If the implementation of the mayor is poor, Dublin could find itself losing more than it gains, Keegan says.“There are strong arguments for a directly elected mayor, and I’m not saying there isn’t scope for improvement in the city’s governance, but there is a danger if we rush into this it won’t achieve any of its objectives, we’ll lose the things that work, and we’ll be worse off.”Each of the proposals in this Capital Ideas series has been put to a group of three experts for an initial “back of an envelope” evaluation. They are: Frances Ruane, former director of the Economic and Social Research Institute Caroline Spillane, director general of Engineers Ireland and Cliff Taylor, economics columnist with The .Caroline Spillane I have reservations about this plan, particularly due to the size of Dublin relative to the country as a whole. One person would have responsibility for 40 per cent of our population. The powers of this office would need to be carefully defined.The proposed mayor would be in a position of power for only five years, which could lead to short-term thinking.Cliff Taylor This proposal has surfaced in various forms over the years and fits into a common theme that restructuring institutions or posts can fix problems. This could be a good idea, but the job spec, powers and budget are key. The benefit depends on how it is structured – and who is elected, of course.It is a useful proposal but to work it requires a new vision for local government, something talked about for years and years but never delivered.Frances Ruane Cities with elected mayors seem to work well. However, in Ireland, this would have to be set up as part of a rebalancing of central and local government, if it is to work. If the city itself does not have decision-making power, then adding a mayor will not solve the problem.Meanwhile, Dublin City Council should work on its governance and adopt an integrated problem-solving planning approach. This must involve all four authorities working together. That would involve no serious resource costs.How can we improve Dublin city\u0026rsquos infrastructure, services and daily life?

Savour that moment because this may well be the very last time this particular ritual will ever happen.If all goes according to a plan laid out by the European Commission, the last-ever mandatory clock change in the European Union will take place in 2019. Member states must notify the commission by April of next year on whether they want to opt for permanent summer or permanent winter time. Whether all 27 states are prepared to go along, however, is not yet clear.This weekend, the Department of Justice (which has responsibility for everything to do with timekeeping) is announcing plans for its public consultation here on the proposal.A recent European Commission online public consultation across the EU found 84 per cent of citizens were in favour of ending the changing of clocks in spring and autumn.The commission trumpeted the fact that it had got 4.6 million responses, the highest number ever received in an exercise of this sort, and that 84 per cent of those backed the change to a single year-round time.Less loudly advertised was the fact that engagement varied significantly from country to country three million of those responses came from Germany, representing almost 4 per cent of that country’s population. In contrast, less than 0.25 per cent of Irish people bothered to respond.The question now is whether inidual member states will agree to proceed along the lines advocated by the commission, which has stated a preference for summer time to be applied universally. There is potential for chaos, with a patchwork of time zones emerging across continental Europe.Initial polling, for example, suggests people in the Netherlands and Denmark would prefer permanent winter time, while Germans want summer time.“We are not proposing that the whole EU either switches to summer or winter time,” said transport commissioner Violeta Bulc at a press conference last month. “All we are proposing is that we do it together.”But clock-switching on the Dutch-German border is hardly the desired outcome.An intriguing twist from the Irish perspective is whether the UK, at a moment of heightened political tension, will view this as a symbolic opportunity to flaunt its newly acquired independence.Brexiteers’ enthusiasm for such a stance may be dimmed when they realise it would mean Britain sharing a time zone with Brussels and Berlin for almost half the year.But understandably, media coverage here so far has focused on the prospect of travellers from Dundalk to Newry having to adjust their watches – or of people nipping across from Lifford to Strabane in search of an extra hour’s drinking time.For geographical and historical reasons, Ireland and the UK have been on the same clock since Dublin Time was abolished in the wake of the Rising in 1916.We moved in lockstep with the UK when it experimented with year-round summer time in the late 1960s, and any recent proposals for change, such as one mooted in a Private Members’ Bill rejected by then minister for justice Alan Shatter in 2013, have been contingent on decisions made at Westminster and, more recently, in Brussels.So what would the changes mean? If Ireland opts for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, then dawn won’t break in the west of Ireland until almost 10am in mid-December. However, if “winter time” is maintained throughout the year, sunrise in Dublin will occur well before 4am in June, and the stretch in the evenings will be a lot less grand, with sunset happening before 9pm even in midsummer.Those are the extremes, but where permanent summer time offers real gains is in the “shoulder months” of November, February and March, when the majority of people will have much more daylight at the end of their school or working day without too much negative impact in the mornings.There has been a broad attempt across the world in recent decades to do away with annual time-shifts, based on data about their negative health effects and on a more general sense that an additional hour of daylight in the evening is more valuable than one in the morning.Meanwhile, the main rationale for the current system – reduced electricity usage – has been rendered less important by the introduction in recent years of energy-efficient electric lighting. Lifestyles have also changed enormously since the current system’s introduction a century ago, and even since the last experimental change 50 years ago.Flexible working time, increased leisure opportunities and longer retail opening hours all have an effect on how we spend our day.The main impediment to change, it seems, is institutional. In the US, legislators in California and other states are also pushing for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, but they need to persuade the federal government before they can proceed. As in the EU, American legislation allows each state to decide its time zone but forbids inidual states from choosing when or if to change their seasonal clocks. Whether the gridlocked US political system can respond remains to be seen.Here, the Department of Justice’s public consultation asks three questions. Do you want to stop changing the clocks twice a year? If the clock changes stop, do you want to remain on summer time or winter time? Is staying on the same time as the UK more important than your choice of summertimewintertime?“It is very important that as many citizens as possible respond to this consultation and express their views so that the Government may take account of public opinion when considering this proposal by the EU,” says Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan, clearly implying that the Government will take account of public opinion without being bound by it.Ultimately the success or failure of the proposal may come to be seen as a test of the EU’s ability to act quickly and decisively on a simple issue which will have an almost immediate effect upon people’s lives. The process so far has been startlingly fast, but the national consultations may be a different matter, depending perhaps on the views of the people who get up early in the morning."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Taoiseach says a three month time limit on Brexit measure \u0026lsquonot worth paper it\u0026rsquos written on\u0026rsquoOliver Berry (61) convicted of 104 incidents which took her \u0026lsquoinnocence and childhood\u0026rsquoCouncil announces illuminations at 12 locations as part of \u0026lsquoWinter Lights Dublin City\u0026rsquoDes Sullivan (59) died after he sustained serious neck injuries at his homePeople who \u0026lsquohave answers\u0026rsquo when they come before committee \u0026lsquoget on well,\u0026rsquo Fleming saysPedestrians distracted by phones are \u0026lsquomore likely to walk in front of tram,\u0026rsquo Transdev saysState\u0026rsquos first health-related alcohol legislation will restrict cinema and outdoor advertisingHSE has offered new talks with INMO in an attempt to avert industrial actionWomen more likely to receive higher compensation than men in damages for whiplashDrugs worth \u0026euro135,000 discovered in rented house in Bishopstown area of the cityThe building could go to market early next year, says Dublin City CouncilDesign changes \u0026lsquoplaced responsibility on designers\u0026rsquo to certify work under new rulesGuarantee\u0026rsquos specific application to NI may be replaced by Britain-wide customs controlLeft-leaning bloc may serve Labour as bargaining chip in future government formationCollapse of builders Sammon behind 15 of the stalled construction projectsData shows rise in number of deportations from Ireland to Pakistan but fall in numbers sent back to ChinaDraft audit highlights flaws in controlling factories and mackerel and herring fleetFunds had been earmarked for the provision of additional hospital beds"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3686169.1541360498!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"old public toilets on kevin st for redevelopment as cafe","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe toilets are on a traffic island in Dublin’s Liberties. Photograph: Dan GriffinThe former public toilets on Kevin Street, the last vestige of Dublin’s “Four Corners of Hell”, will be brought back into use as a cafe “as soon as practical”.The toilets sit on a traffic island at the junction of Kevin Street and New Street South and have been out of use for about 20 years despite being relatively intact.The council’s development department is “very keen to put the former public toilets to the markets”, an internal email said this year. “We have had a lot of interest in it,” the email, released under the Freedom of Information Act, added.The Liberties crossroad junction of Kevin Street, New Street South, Dean Street and Patrick Street famously had a pub on each corner. It became particularly rowdy at closing time when Kenny’s, Quinn’s, O’Beirne’s and Lowe’s disgorged their customers onto the streets, earning the junction the nickname “The Four Corners of Hell”.An article on Come Here to Me website describes how the pubs, along with the area’s vitality, were lost during the street-widening mania of 1970s and 1980s when Dublin Corporation ran a dual carriageway through the heart of the neighbourhood, transforming a vibrant community intersection into a soulless traffic junction.In 1979, in an article in The , Frank McDonald lamented how Dublin was being “sacrificed to the insatiable demands of the motor car”. He despaired at the transformation of the corner into a major traffic interchange but he noted that the toilets were to be saved because of their outstanding civic design character. “But there’s no doubt that it will look somewhat incongruous in its new surroundings,” he said.The toilets, now listed on the record of protected structures, are shaded by hornbeam and London plane trees and share the traffic island with a small park which the council has recently tidied up.The council receives a lot of interest in the disused facilities. In correspondence released under Freedom of Information Act, one person involved in the restaurant business said they wanted to refurbish them because it “would make an extraordinary addition to the streetscape”. Another asked if it could be turned into a residential development. “You see the thing is, I’ve fallen in love with the building and the idea of making a home out of it.” One person who wanted to turn the building into a café even prepared a booklet based on what he thought was inside the building.In a draft advertisement prepared by the council in 2017, proposals were sought from people interested in leasing the 65.8sqm premises as a caférestaurant. The ad was never published, however. The council wanted more time to consider their options around the small park as well as the best way of refurbishing the toilets.This month an official in the council’s planning and property development department said “a final decision has not been made whether to refurbish the building ourselves and go to tender for someone to operate it or to place it on the market ‘as is’.“Irrespective of which route we go down the plan is to bring the building back into use as soon as is practical bearing in mind the challenges presented by its historical status. If it goes to the market it is likely to be advertised early next year.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3686784.1541422692!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"well known dublin sites to be lit up for 30 days over christmas","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA look down Dublin’s Grafton Street at Christmas.

Dublin City Council has announced Winter Lights Dublin City, which will see 12 sites in Dublin illuminated for 30 nights using customised projections from early December to early January. The project is building on similar projections and light displays in Paris and Sydney. A spokeswoman said Winter Lights is a “totally new concept for Dublin city”. Among the buildings due to be lit up are City Hall, Liberty Hall, the civic offices on Wood Quay, the Mansion House and the Customs House. New seasonal lighting will be installed at locations including Samuel Beckett Bridge, Millennium Bridge and Parliament Street.The council says the illuminations will use 157,900 low light LEDs and 15,780 metres of cable. One of the bridge illuminations will use less electric power than a domestic iron or 10 household light bulbs. A council spokeswoman said: “We have created Winter Lights Dublin City to bring Christmas lights and building projections to more locations and people than ever before. “This means that it is not a single event but takes place over thirty nights to give everyone the opportunity and space to experience the lights and projections, at a time that suits them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"halloween celebrations costumes around world pictures","story":"Around 2000 people gathered on the streets of Kawasaki, Japan, to watch the country\u0027s largest Halloween parade on Saturday 28th October.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

California, the most populous state, has 53 representatives while seven states - Alaska, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming have just one representative.The Republican Party currently controls the chamber with a 43-seat majority, but it is widely expected that the Democrats will gain control in tomorrow\u0027s election. The current House has 236 Republicans and 193 Democrats, with six vacant seats.  The Democrats need a net gain of 24 seats to win a majority, which is no small accomplishment, but the president\u0027s low approval ratings have given the party reason to hope. Historically, the president\u0027s party routinely loses House seats in midterm elections. Indeed the University of Virginia\u0027s Centre for Politics points out that the president\u0027s party has lost seats in all but three of the 29 midterms held since 1900.  The US economy is booming, with low unemployment rates and rising wages. However some Republicans have been unnerved by Donald Trump\u0027s spending .While Mr Trump\u0027s tax cuts for corporations was popular among business owners, the country\u0027s deficit has increased by 33 per cent in the past year to $895 billion.Donald Trump has been intensively campaigning for Republican candidates across the countryMr Trump\u0027s approval rating is around the 40 per cent mark - a figure which will not encourage Republicans standing for re-election.  Moreover, a liberal base hoping to derail Mr Trump\u0027s agenda has energised Democratic activists in key races, out-fundraising and out-polling a host of Republican incumbents.Political website FiveThirtyEight, has given Democrats an 82 per cent chance of taking control of the House and gaining 38 seats.If Democrats win the House, they get to decide which bills come to the floor - meaning President Donald Trump\u0027s domestic agenda will struggle to make its way into law. The party with a majority in the chamber also controls its committee chairmanships and has the power to issue subpoenas - so a Democrat-controlled House could enforce aggressive oversight of investigations of the president\u0027s administration, including alleged Russia collusion, Trump\u0027s business dealings and sexual assault allegations against him.Pundits predict Democrats will launch controversial investigations into things like Mr Trump\u0027s tax returns and his previous business dealings. They may also seek public hearings with members of the Trump family, including his son Donald Jr who is a key figure in the Russia investigation. Rep. Elijah Cummings during a church service with Bill ClintonDemocrats on the House oversight committee, the chamber’s main investigative panel, have already suggested they are prepared to issue subpoenas if they gain control.Representative Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the oversight committee, said: “If Democrats win the majority in November, we would finally do what Republicans have refused to do, and that is conduct independent, fact-based, and credible investigations of the Trump administration.Mr Cummings said their investigations would address issues like the security clearance process, conflicts of interest, the numerous attempts by Republicans to strip away healthcare from millions of Americans, postal service reforms, prescription drug pricing, and voting rights”.But if Republicans hold on to the Senate, they will continue to approve Mr Trump\u0027s cabinet nominees and appoint conservative judges to US courtrooms. Donald Trump won West Virginia\u0027s 3rd district by 30 points. But it is the Democratic candidate running in the district, which has a long history of coal mining, that is gaining national attention. Richard Ojeda says he voted for Donald Trump in 2016, opposes universal background checks for gun buyers, and is pro-coal.Mr Ojeda is running against Republican Carol Miller in the open-seat race after the incumbent Republican Evan Jenkins vacated the seat to run for the Senate. Polling suggests it will be a tight race between the two candidates, but analysts are keeping a close watch to see if a populist Democrat in a pro-Trump area is a winning formula.Republican Representative Mimi Walters is battling to keep hold of her seat against Democrat Katie Porter in the state\u0027s 45th district, Orange County. The number of registered Republicans in the county has consistently declined as its population becomes more erse.Ms Walters is one of seven Republicans representing districts in California which Hillary Clinton won in 2016. The Democrats need to take several of these in order to have a chance of regaining a majority in the House.Pundits are viewing a win in this race as a sign they will do well across Southern California - picking up crucial Republican-held seats. Professor Larry Sabato from the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics has changed his prediction from \u0027leaning Republican\u0027 to a \u0027toss-up\u0027.Minnesota\u0027s 8th district is considered one of the Democrats\u0027 most at-risk seats in November. It is a traditionally Democrat area - former president Barack Obama won the district twice but it swung heavily to Donald Trump in the 2016 election.The seat is currently held by Democrat Rick Nolan but the 74-year-old is not seeking re-election. The party\u0027s candidate Joe Radinovich, a former state legislator, is facing a tough battle against Republican Pete Stauber, a county commissioner.The race in Texas\u0027 23rd district will largely focus on one of the Trump administration\u0027s main concerns - immigration. The district contains a third of the US-Mexico border and has the second highest population of \u0027Dreamers\u0027 - the term given to undocumented migrants who arrived in America as children and have been granted temporary protection.The incumbent, Republican Will Hurd, is a former CIA agent who has chosen to distance himself from Mr Trump. His Democratic rival, Gina Ortiz Jones, is a Filipina-American, openly LGBTQ and an Iraq veteran. Mr Hurd, who became the first African-American elected to Congress from Texas when he was elected in 2015, is tipped to win by a narrow margin in the swing district. He has distanced himself from the national Republican party and even wrote an op-ed for the New York Times in July stating that the president had been manipulated by Russian intelligence.Moderate Republicans will be looking to Florida\u0027s 26th district to see whether they can keep hold of a largely Hiic area in the Trump era.The incumbent, Carlos Curbelo, is well-liked but Republicans still fear his Democrat opponent, Latin immigrant Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, could sweep to a surprise victory.

Both these options will further depress investment. They will be bad for business and bad for working people.“Given that neither was on the ballot in 2016, we believe the ultimate choice should be handed back to the public with a People\u0027s Vote.”Lord Myners, who was appointed as city minister by Gordon Brown in 2008 but now sits as a crossbencher, said: “Any deal will be made from a position of weakness where we have surrendered our principal negotiating cards.“It will be half-formed, casting a long shadow over business confidence, damaging investment and hurting both enterprises and their employees for years to come.”A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said: “The people of the United Kingdom have already had their say in one of the biggest democratic exercises this country has ever seen and the Prime Minister has made it clear that there is not going to be a second referendum.“We remain confident we will agree a mutually advantageous deal with the EU, that works for business and the economy.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sometimes you just have to get yourself expelled from school. Cleo Rocos, chief executive of tequila company AquaRiva, went (briefly) to a convent school. She didn’t take to the nuns because they had a habit of smacking her over the knuckles with a ruler. One sister had a pronounced moustache. So naturally the young Cleo, aged 11, bought her a pack of\u0026nbsprazors for Christmas. An inspired and kindly thought which probably had the\u0026nbspdesired effect of getting her booted out of the convent. She has never looked back. Ever since she sailed to our shores from Rio, aged 6, and discovered to her shock and horror that the sea was grey (she had never seen grey water before) – chilly too – she has taken it as her life’s mission to inject more colour and warmth into the world. “Tequila,” she tells me, “makes everything seem more wonderful.”Sitting in Cafe\u0026nbspPacifico in Covent Garden on a Friday afternoon sipping margaritas with her, I’m inclined to agree. Note the sipping. “You should only sip tequila,” she says, “unless you’re having something removed without an anaesthetic.” The tradition of throwing it down your throat – possibly with some ancient worm lurking at the bottom of the bottle (which is unfair to worms too) – is “strictly for cowboys”. Cleo Rocos doesn’t just make a very pure and clean-tasting tequila, she is a flame-haired evangelist, a passionate believer. She has even written a book on the subject, one that I doubt her old convent teachers will be putting in the school library: The Power of Positive Drinking. How to drink tequila and actually enjoy itThe surprising health benefits of tequilaFive of the best cocktails for National Tequila DayDrinking tequila is good for your bones, science saysShe was recently stuck on a Tube train in a tunnel on the Central Line, somewhere between Tottenham Court Road and Bank. An announcement came over the PA: “Please stay calm. We should be moving in about 20 minutes.” Cue general gloom and consternation. Then Rocos stood up and made her own personal announcement: “I have two bottles of tequila with me and 20 glasses – anyone care to join me?” The train was magically transformed into a party venue. “Everyone was jolly by the end,” she says. Rocos must like Tube trains: she discovered the young art student who designed her label (a couple dancing on the wing of a plane) on the politan Line.Tequila is now the fastest-growing category among spirits in the world. I think I have just become a convert too. To AquaRiva anyway. What is surprising is that Rocos ever became so keen on tequila herself. She started off with a bad experience during school, post-convent. “It’s like you’re on a bobsleigh to hell. For years I hated tequila,” she says. Tequila in those days was often only 51 per cent agave with a load of raw alcohol and additive on top. “That’s the reason why people try to swallow it without tasting. It was the only way.” She started to swing around to liking tequila\u0026nbspin the late 1980s. Back then Rocos appeared in the Kenny Everett Video Show. After filming, she and Kenny would frequently slope off and have a predominantly liquid lunch, then take a taxi to Heathrow and jump on the first plane to wherever, without a suitcase or even a toothbrush, just for the craic. She came to the conclusion that “wonderful things happen after you’ve had a few drinks”.In her acting career she has inhabited roles ranging from “exotic dancer” to producer, but she defines herself as a comedian. “The last thing I’d want is to get run over without having had a good laugh, or without my lipstick or earrings – I expect to get run over in a moment of mindless glee.” Some years ago she hosted her own TV show for Channel 5, Cleo Worldwide, in which she took “lovely people to lovely locations and we had\u0026nbspcocktails together”.But the real turning point occurred some 16 years ago when she came across a woman in Mexico who “looked like the editor of Mexican Vogue. An older woman but sensational”. She was drinking tequila from a long\u0026nbspfluted glass. “That was when I fell in love. To think I’d spent all those years at the BBC drinking warm white wine, which might just as well have been used to suck the stains out of carpet tiles. And it gave you a headache.”She made her mind up to go into the tequila business. Wise men tried to put her off. Don’t even think about it, they said. It takes eight years for the agave plant to become viable, you need huge investment, etc. But she ploughed on regardless. “If you listened to other people, you’d never do anything. I knew nothing but I learned everything I could about tequila.” She also wants\u0026nbspto give a shout-out to HSBC. “I know banks come in for a lot of flak, but they were with me every step of the way and I couldn’t have done it without them. I didn’t have a lot of money behind me to begin with.” The name “tequila” is owned by the Mexican government. It can only be produced in\u0026nbspselect areas of Mexico. Rocos spent 11 months up in the highlands experimenting and concocting and fine-tuning, communing with a blender guru, and finally creating her own brand. The key is to use only 100 per cent pure organic agave syrup and volcanic spring water, and allow the brew to “rest” – hence “reposado” – in old bourbon barrels for a few months. She still likes to go to Arandas, east of Guadalajara, and get up early in the morning to go up to the agave fields, walk across the deep red earth and join in the harvesting.Tequila makes us into our favourite versions of ourselves – like edited highlightsAquaRiva recently won the “Best of the Best” blind-tasting competition in America. It’s won so many gold medals over the last few years that Rocos says she can’t pin them all on the bottle, otherwise “it would look like some mad dictator”. Her brand is now the “house pour” at TGI Fridays and can be found in many restaurants. The AquaRiva brand of agave syrup is sold in Waitrose and Sainsbury’s. India is likewise opening up to AquaRiva. Bollywood has embraced tequila. The next frontier is the United States. \u0026nbspAquaRiva is sugar free, low on calories and “good for dieting”, Rocos assures me. She is her own living, breathing advertisement for the power\u0026nbspof tequila. When she stands up to go and find another bottle, she doesn’t walk, she dances. “Tequila makes us into our favourite versions of ourselves – like edited highlights.” She is critical of a lot of bad wine, full of additives. “You wake up feeling like you’ve been floating in a chlorinated swimming pool, face down, all night.” Rocos hates to see people bingeing and getting paralytic. On the other hand, she is very much in favour of dancing on tables, or, for that matter, on plane wings. Her slogan is: “Drink wisely, drink AquaRiva.” Of course, the president of the Tequila Society would say that. But there is a funny line of hers that sticks with me and which echoes my own brief, slightly inebriated, totally unreliable experience in Cafe\u0026nbspPacifico. “It should taste like you’re drinking the first day of your holidays – you open the door and you want to run into the sea.”\u0026nbspAs I walk\u0026nbspdown Langley Street and on to Long Acre, I can swear the blue sky looks\u0026nbspsomehow bluer than before, and the sun\u0026nbspjust a little bit sunnier.A View from the TopShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It also benefits employers, as those which have signed up to the voluntary Living Wage scheme regularly testify\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentHeathrow Airport: One of the 4,700 employers that have signed up to pay the Living Wage Good news for 180,000 workers in Britain: The Living Wage is rising.\u0026nbspBy that I mean the real Living Wage, the one calculated by the Living Wage Foundation that is designed to provide a decent basic standard of living, rather than what the Government calls the ‘National Living Wage’, which is the rebranded minimum wage, and doesn’t come close to doing that.The real Living Wage is going to £9 hour, up from £8.75, for employees at the more than 4,700 organisations that have signed up. It’s £10.55 in London, up from £10.20, to reflect the capital’s higher cost of living.\u0026nbspMore than 6 million UK jobs ‘pay less than real living wage’Minimum wage failing to give families a basic \u0027no frills\u0027 lifestyleAccredited employers not\u0026nbsponly have to pay it to all members of staff, and to ensure their outsourced suppliers do them same. They also have to include their younger workers, who get significantly less under the Government’s minimum wage. It only fully kicks in for those aged 25 and above.\u0026nbspThe gap between the two now stands £1.17 an hour, which adds up to a shade under £50 over the course of a 40 hour working week.\u0026nbspAccording to KPMG, more than one in five British jobs that pay less than the\u0026nbspLiving Wage. The people in them\u0026nbspdon’t really make enough to live on and that\u0027s\u0026nbspchilling\u0026nbspif you think about it.\u0026nbspIt might help to explain why food banks are doing such brisk business.\u0026nbspAt this point those on the right will wag their fingers and say that while paying the Living Wage might be affordable to the likes of Barclays, KPMG, Heathrow Airport, and some of their peers, that’s not true of all business, and particularly small businesses.\u0026nbsp“It\u0027s a\u0026nbspjob killer,” will be the cry.\u0026nbspThe evidence says otherwise. Firms who have signed up to the scheme report economic benefits including improved staff retention (important at a time when Britain is suffering labour shortages in some areas) better quality work, lower rates of absenteeism.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s a superb\u0026nbspidea, and better still,\u0026nbspit pays for itself, which ought to be enough in itself to get a sane and sensible government to take note. But I’ve raised these arguments in the past.\u0026nbspMore is apparently necessary to get through to the thick and empty heads around the cabinet table and the and benches where sit the members of this country’s governing Tory Party.\u0026nbspSo how about this: Consider how many policies would be enhanced if the ‘National Living Wage’ was closer to, or even matched, the real Living Wage.\u0026nbspTheresa May might finally\u0026nbspbe able to talk about a country that works for everyone with a degree of honesty if that country provided its low waged workers with enough to live on.\u0026nbspThere would be less need for the state to subsidise poorly paid work, and perhaps less pain caused to the Government via its Universal Credit, a policy that is turning into this generation of Tories’ poll tax.\u0026nbspThe Living Wage movement has put over £800m million back into the pockets of more than 180,000 low paid workers, £200m this year alone, most of which has gone back into the economy because those on lower incomes spend a high proportion of what they earn.Think, for a moment, about the potential economic impact were the number of workers on the real Living Wage to be doubled. Or trebled.\u0026nbspThe boost that this would provide would be most obviously be felt in the northern parts of these islands, where wages are generally lower. If ministers want to make their ‘Northern Powerhouse’ a reality, giving low earners a pay rise would be a damn good start.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Both these options will further depress investment. They will be bad for business and bad for working people.“Given that neither was on the ballot in 2016, we believe the ultimate choice should be handed back to the public with a People\u0027s Vote.”Lord Myners, who was appointed as city minister by Gordon Brown in 2008 but now sits as a crossbencher, said: “Any deal will be made from a position of weakness where we have surrendered our principal negotiating cards.“It will be half-formed, casting a long shadow over business confidence, damaging investment and hurting both enterprises and their employees for years to come.”A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said: “The people of the United Kingdom have already had their say in one of the biggest democratic exercises this country has ever seen and the Prime Minister has made it clear that there is not going to be a second referendum.“We remain confident we will agree a mutually advantageous deal with the EU, that works for business and the economy.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

When Margaret Thatcher more or less put an end to council house building in the 1980s a great deal of their stock of homes was transferred to housing associations to be managed and maintained. Housing associations have also been able to access grants from government to increase their supply of new homes. But the volumes of new homes they have built each have never matched those built by councils in the 1960s and 1970s, mainly because the government grants have never been large enough to enable them to do it. Their grants were cut severely by George Osborne and David Cameron. In recent months Theresa May’s government has been saying that they will get more resources. But this revelation that some of their grants will be erted to councils to build will come as another blow to the sector and may undermine trust in ministers’ promises.The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said the news was “concerning”.“If lifting the cap on council borrowing comes at the expense of housing association delivery, that would be concerning,” said\u0026nbspJames Prestwich, the NHF’s\u0026nbsphead of policy.\u0026nbsp“However, we’re confident that more council building shouldn’t have to mean housing associations will build fewer homes. This isn’t a zero-sum game, and there is a lot to be gained from cooperation between housing associations and local government.”“Ministers should reset funding for low-cost homes to the £4bn it was in 2010, as Labour has long argued. This scale of investment could see both housing associations and councils building genuinely affordable homes at scale again,” said shadow housing secretary John Healey.Government figures show that between 2015 and March 2017 the AHP distributed just over £1bn of funding to create 42,878 affordable rent and affordable home ownership homes in England.The government says a total of £9.1bn in capital grants is available under the current AHP\u0026nbspover the next three years. Ms May announced a further £2bn of funding for the AHP in September, but this is reportedly\u0026nbspto be money for the next phase of the programme, which doesn’t begin until 2022.Councils were significant house builders between the 1940s and the 1970s. Margaret Thatcher brought that to an end in the 1980s and transferred much of the stock of council housing to be managed and maintained by housing associations.The latest official data shows the housing association sector started construction on 23,890 new homes in the year to June, with annual new starts of all new homes running at 160,020.Ministers have said that they want to deliver 300,000 new homes a year in England.More than a\u0026nbspmillion households\u0026nbsphave been on social housing waiting lists for at least a decade.In her forward to a green paper on social housing in August, Ms May said: “We need to get back to the scale of new social housing that will deliver a real difference to communities.”An HMT\u0026nbspspokesperson said: “We’re committed to increasing the housing supply by 300,000 homes a year on average. Removing the cap on how much councils can borrow to build houses is vital to ensuring there is a variety of homes available. Councils are likely to use their own land and resources for development, which is why we do not expect the removal of the cap to affect other types of development.”Dan Wilson Craw of the Generation Rent pressure group said: “Lifting the cap on councils’ borrowing is just one part of the strategy we need to boost the building of social housing. Providing more grant funding is another, as it pays for itself in the long run in lower housing benefit payments.”Josh Ryan-Collins of UCL’s Institute of Innovation and Public Purpose, said the biggest obstacle for the provision of new council housing was the land market.“Ongoing austerity means local authorities still face strong incentives to sell off their land – or what’s left of it following years of privatisation – \u0026nbspto fund vital services rather than use it to build affordable housing.

The number of jobs paying below the threshold has actually increased by 1.2 million since 2012, which really hammers home the magnitude of in-work poverty in the UK. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp“Clearly such a sizeable challenge requires a collective societal effort. For businesses, it’s critical to look beyond the bottom line, instead of focusing on non-monetary aspects like improved staff morale, rising service standards or increased productivity.” \u0026nbspLWF director Tess Lanning said:  “The living wage campaign is about tackling the rising problem of people paid less than they need to live. “Responsible businesses know that the government minimum is not enough to live on, and today’s new living wage rates will provide a boost for hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the UK.” \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspShe added: “Employers that pay the real living wage enable their workers to live a life of dignity, supporting them to pay off debts and meet the pressures of rising bills. We want to see local councils, universities, football clubs, bus companies and the other major public and private sector employers in every city commit to become real living wage employers. “When they do, thousands of people get a pay rise, but other local employers also follow their lead. If more of these institutions step up, we can start to build true living wage places.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In Europe, the encouraging momentum that we saw in quarter two accelerated further, with online revenue up 15 per cent.This momentum, which was evident in both Paddy Power and Betfair, is driven by enhancements in product and good execution in promotions and marketing.In the US, the exciting potential of the sports betting opportunity and the strength of our strategic positioning has been evidenced by our experience to date in New Jersey.In the UK, bookies have also been warning about the impact of a recent Government move to slash stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals.Paddy Power said the new £2 stake limit would result in a 33 per cent to 43 per cent decrease in machine gaming revenue, or £36m to £46m revenue impact.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret.

Created by David Angell, Peter Casey, and David Lee, the comedy was widely celebrated during its eleven seasons, winning 37 Emmys. The sitcom ended with the eponymous character leaving Seattle for Chicago.Doctor Frasier\u0026nbspCrane, played by Grammer, first appeared in beloved Boston-set sitcom Cheers which ran on NBC from 1982 to 1993. The actor has gone on to enjoy\u0026nbspbig-screen success, starring in Hollywood sequels such as X-Men: The Last Stand, The Expendables 3 and Transformers: Age of Extinction.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The move has been driven largely by higher transport costs, private rents and council tax.Workers in London will see a rise of\u0026nbsp35p\u0026nbspto £10.55 per hour for their real living wage. The LWF\u0026nbsprates\u0026nbspare\u0026nbspadopted voluntarily by businesses, while the government\u0027s living wage is £7.83.Research from KPMG has revealed that one in five jobs still pay less than the real living wage –\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspthe number failing to meet the threshold is growing.

The number of jobs paying below the threshold has actually increased by 1.2 million since 2012, which really hammers home the magnitude of in-work poverty in the UK. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp“Clearly such a sizeable challenge requires a collective societal effort. For businesses, it’s critical to look beyond the bottom line, instead of focusing on non-monetary aspects like improved staff morale, rising service standards or increased productivity.” \u0026nbspLWF director Tess Lanning said:  “The living wage campaign is about tackling the rising problem of people paid less than they need to live. “Responsible businesses know that the government minimum is not enough to live on, and today’s new living wage rates will provide a boost for hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the UK.” \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspShe added: “Employers that pay the real living wage enable their workers to live a life of dignity, supporting them to pay off debts and meet the pressures of rising bills. We want to see local councils, universities, football clubs, bus companies and the other major public and private sector employers in every city commit to become real living wage employers. “When they do, thousands of people get a pay rise, but other local employers also follow their lead.

Sean O’Grady prepares for the worstClick to followThe IndependentWith the best will in the world, and there may be a remarkable shortage of that in the coming months, a chaotic Brexit will make reliable delivery of a huge variety of items more trickyIn the\u0026nbsptwo and a bit years\u0026nbspsince the EU referendum, successive waves of optimism and pessimism have crashed across the nation as hopes for an acceptable outcome\u0026nbsprise and fall. We still don’t know what will be decided at upcoming “crunch” European Union summits –\u0026nbspand the possibility remains that, even if a healthy dose of\u0026nbspgoodwill enables some kind of agreement to be cobbled together, Brexit will be messy.Whatever else, undoing a half-century of integration is bound to cause some distortion. So to be prudent, you might want to “Brexit-proof” your life, just in case. Here is my\u0026nbspfar from exhaustive\u0026nbspguide to some of the things you might (or might not) want to consider as departure day approaches.1. Stock up on loo rollWhat could be more essential to civilised life? Right now your local supermarket will happily sell you as many multipacks of Andrex (other leading brands are available) as you can transport home – but after 29 March\u0026nbsp2019\u0026nbspthere is a risk\u0026nbspthey may need to ration the supply. You see, some 50 per cent of the wood pulp used to make toilet rolls in UK factories comes into the country on lorries from Sweden,\u0026nbspan EU member state. When the lorries get stuck on some ferry somewhere, the factories will soon run out of raw material. They could make up the shortfall with the wood pulp that comes in from Brazil, although apparently that stuff isn’t as comfortable to use. You have been warned.Raab: Those fearing Brexit hit to car industry should show ‘mettle’2. Order your new car nowAround 85 per cent of the UK’s new car market is accounted for by imports,\u0026nbspand there are few vehicles you can buy that don’t have at least some European Union\u0026nbspcontent – including some famous British brands. The Mini, for example, has a crankshaft that crosses the Chanel more than a dozen times as it reaches completion. The Jaguar E-Pace, an excellent sporting SUV, is made in Austria, while only the Astra from the Vauxhall range is made here –\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspagain, it\u0026nbspcontains EU parts. On the other hand, all of BMW’s four-cylinder engines for the likes of the 3 Series are made in Birmingham…Disruption to such automotive supply chains will make delays inevitable for virtually any brand.\u0026nbspTariffs on new car imports, if imposed by the UK, may add to the list price – if you can source the vehicle in the first place. Order now from stock and relax.By the by, if you own a Fiat, Kia, Volkswagen, Nissan, Toyota, Skoda, Seat, Renault, Peugeot, Citroen, Vauxhall, Ford or virtually any other brand with parts from the EU, which includes “British” brands such as Mini, Bentley and Jaguar, then you might also want to buy a few spares. Just in case.3. Apply for an international driving permitThis is fairly crucial if you want to be able to drive legally “over there”.If you are fond of a proper brie, to offer a further random example, you know what to do...One of the main benefits of EU membership we take for granted is the Europe-wide recognition of national driving licences. This could conceivably end if we “crash\u0026nbspout” of the club. An international driving permit will allow you to drive legally throughout\u0026nbspthe EU you’ll need to\u0026nbspapply\u0026nbspfor it personally at a post office, for a reasonable fee of £5.50.4. Lay down some French wines, German salami, Italian pasta, Polish vodka, Belgian chocolates, Spanish manchego, Greek olives…With the best will in the world, and there may be a remarkable shortage of that in the coming months, a chaotic Brexit will make reliable delivery of these sorts of treats more tricky. There are British alternatives to many of them\u0026nbspbut\u0026nbspnot all, obviously. The commercial British olive, for example, is yet to make its appearance. If you are fond of a proper brie, to offer a further random example, you know what to do (no offence Somerset). You can\u0026nbspfreeze\u0026nbspharder cheeses and stick\u0026nbspsome pickled or “brined” cheeses in the pantry. The delicatessen then – such a continental word – is your next shopping destination. You’ll at least enjoy it, but try not to eat it all at once. Get stockpiling.5. Make sure your health insurance covers trips to the EU or EEAThe European Health Card and smooth reciprocal arrangements across the EU for member\u0026nbspcitizens in need of care could disappear. The safest solution might be to apply for some health insurance\u0026nbspthat will cover you in the EU for holidays and business trips.6. Review your investmentsNever a bad idea in any case. If you’re lucky enough to own some, including a (money purchase) pension pot, then be ready for the volatility a chaotic Brexit will bring. Currency movements will probably mean dollar, euro and other foreign currency assets will rise in value you may also find changes in the tax treatment of your stocks, shares, bond and real estate as the UK and EU settle down to their new, less convergent relationship.Fears of a collapse in sterling may be exaggerated but it is something you need to be aware ofWithout going full Project Fear II, there may also be sharpish trends in inflation, interest rates and tax that you might not have foreseen. A change in the Bank of England bank rate, for example, will influence gilt and, thus, annuity rates for people who purchase one with their retirement pot (though of course\u0026nbspyou don’t\u0026nbsphave to go down the annuity route under the newish “pension\u0026nbspfreedoms”). This could be favourable, or not, depending on what happens, but you need to understand what might happen, so far as you can. As ever, do your own research and seek independent financial advice.7. What, the gîte has to go?The timeshare pad in Spain, the cute little conical cottage in Puglia, beach apartment in Cyprus, bolthole in Paris… all favourite British property investments, and hitherto unthreatened by discriminatory taxation or property laws –\u0026nbspbut perhaps no longer.\u0026nbspThere might also be some effect on the popularity of your place if you let it out to UK holidaymakers, many of who will obviously be stuck\u0026nbspin Blighty\u0026nbspeating the cheese and wine reserves they’ve built up (see point 4).Post-Brexit, there may be less certainty that British citizens, resident or not, will enjoy the exact same property rights and tax equality they do now. On the other hand, if the euro, Bulgarian lev or Croatian kuna strengthens against the pound, other things being equal, then the sterling-equivalent value of your real estate may go up.\u0026nbspThere again, fears of a collapse in sterling may be exaggerated\u0026nbspbut it is something again you need to be aware of.8. Double-check the family treeYour ancestry, and one or two other conditions, might help you apply for a passport of another EU member state, should you want one.Don’t forget that although dual citizenship is permitted in the UK, it isn’t available\u0026nbspin all EU states, so you need to check if necessary, make a choice.Usually some form of parentage qualification can deliver a new passport from an EU nation – though a substantial investment can also secure one (see point 6). You will usually need to register your birth, even if it was in Britain, with the country you wish to become a citizen of. Here are a few of the basics to get the ball rolling (though there is much devilish bureaucracy in the detail so beware)...Surge in British people obtaining EU citizenship, new data revealsItalian citizenship: by being born\u0026nbspto an Italian parent and, in some circumstances, via an Italian grandparent. Or by naturalisation – at least 10\u0026nbspyears’ residency.Irish citizenship: yours if\u0026nbspsome of your parents or grandparents were Irish\u0026nbspor, under some circumstances, by marriage to an Irish citizen.\u0026nbspNaturalisation by residency will also get you an Irish passport.Spanish citizenship: for British expats it is possible\u0026nbspto obtain Spanish citizenship via residency, but you will have to surrender your\u0026nbspBritish citizenship – toss a euro\u0026nbspfor it. Alternatively, once you have lived in Spain for five uninterrupted years, you can apply for an “EU long-term residence permit”, which enables you to work and live in Spain on the same basis as Spanish citizens. You can\u0026nbspalso apply if you have a Spanish father or mother.Cypriot citizenship: been married to a Cypriot for at least three years? Time to celebrate!\u0026nbspCypriot parentage will also do the trick,\u0026nbspas will\u0026nbsp“citizenship by investment” – a property worth at least €500,000.\u0026nbspIt might be prudent to make sure your next prescription gets filled in good timeMaltese citizenship: naturalisationresidency for five years should do it. But here too there is a chance of flashing the cash via the Malta Inidual Investor Programme – at least €500,000 in various combinations of Maltese government bonds, and the National Development and Social Fund. Five years of marriage to\u0026nbspa Maltese citizen is another route.\u0026nbspMost EU and EEA countries (eg Norway, Switzerland) are members of the Schengen scheme, meaning no border checks in any case for EU citizens.9. Order your European-made fridge, washing machine, dishwasher…Much the same arguments apply to consumer goods as they do to cars, though the prevalence of Chinese-made products (sometimes with European brand names) means that the possible delays and inconvenience are somewhat less for this class of goods. However, if you really desire a German-made Miele washing machine you might be wise to make a move on one now.10. Buy your foreign currency\u0026nbspnowI don’t have a Brexit crystal ball any more than anyone else but it seems reasonable to conclude that a\u0026nbsphard Brexit, the nearer it gets, could well bring about a hefty depreciation of sterling – as happened the morning after the 2016 referendum, when the pound lost about 15 per cent of its external value (though it did gradually recover). Then again, whenever there is a wave of optimism about the talks, sterling tends to rise. The pound would be expected to slide against all the major currencies in an unexpectedly chaotic scenario, so\u0026nbspif you wish to be cautious\u0026nbspyou could get your euros, dollars, roubles and rupees in now.11. Stock up on medicinesAssuming they have a long shelf life, that is. This is one of the most vexed of all the post-Brexit questions, about which we have heard a lot from politicians. All one can say now on the question of imported medicines is that they will, under UK law, be OK to use\u0026nbspin Britain if they’re already EU approved, as we will adopt all the European Union regulations from day one\u0026nbspof Brexit. However, like so many other goods, there may be delays in transportation, and it might be prudent to make sure your next prescription gets filled in good time. The UK has a competitive pharmaceuticals sector, for now\u0026nbspthere is a reasonable chance that your pills and potions can be sourced by the pharmacy. Keep a weather eye\u0026nbspopen for updates.12. Au pairs, tenants and employees: let\u0026nbspthem go now or hang on for dear lifeWithout a legally sound withdrawal agreement, the rights and status of EU citizens living and working in the UK will need to be clarified, and there is no sign of that yet. Some may decide to leave the UK, even after many years here, which will inevitably\u0026nbspcause great disruption.\u0026nbspYou may therefore\u0026nbspwish to make some contingency arrangements of your own if, say, you rent a house to a Slovak family, have a French au pair or employ workers from Poland. The short story is that they may be hard to replace.13. Take advantage of “the exciting opportunities” offered by BrexitJoking aside, there will be some potential benefits for the new “global Britain”. If you’re the entrepreneurial type, you might well want to seek out new trading opportunities in China or India, as (or\u0026nbspif) tariffs and other restrictions that are now levied on goods and services in either direction are lifted. That could happen as a result of unilateral UK action or, in the longer run, through the kind of ambitious trade deals ministers talk so frequently\u0026nbspabout.All in all,\u0026nbspnow may be a good\u0026nbspmoment to start that business advising Indian students about how to get a visa and apply for a course at a British university. Provided of course the government finds such an arrangement with India that is compatible with its migration targets.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Engage in some cross-border arbitrageNot smuggling, you understand, but legitimate trade exploiting anomalies in inidual markets.If the Troubles return post-Brexit, it won’t just be due to the borderThis may be of especial interest to people living near the Irish border, who will have to make the most of whatever is coming their way this\u0026nbspspring. On the one hand, the prices\u0026nbspof various goods will erge because of movements in the exchange rate,\u0026nbspas well as duty, taxation\u0026nbspand regulation. The opportunities will be obvious. On the other hand, the EU or UK may decide to instal more stringent customs controls than before it’s\u0026nbspa sensitive subject. Or they could just forget about Ireland and leave things as they are, tolerating a certain amount of cross-border economic activity. Let’s be honest, no one knows.15. Watch your phone billOne of the greatest of the positive practical differences the EU Commission made in recent years was to cut mobile phone roaming rates among EU states.\u0026nbspIt is not yet clear whether\u0026nbspthat regulation will survive the Brexit process, although it may be caught by the UK withdrawal legislation.16. Check your flightOpinions, even at this relatively late stage, differ on how easy air travel will be post-Brexit. There are many EU regulations that govern passenger air transport\u0026nbsp(and freight for that matter). These\u0026nbspmay be overcome by UK-based\u0026nbspairlines setting up subsidiary companies in the EU\u0026nbspbut carrying on with business as usual – or not. Once again, confusion is the most likely outcome, and you may wish to exercise caution about booking your next flight.17. Learn to love your local uniThe future of European educational projects such as the Erasmus exchange scheme is under active discussion. More broadly, EU students can come and study in Britain at UK tuition fee rates, and that may not be so in future. By the same token, British students going to study in the EU may find themselves facing new fees and charges,\u0026nbspas well as having to factor in the impact\u0026nbspon their living costs of potential shifts to the exchange rate.18. Beware the expat lifeJust as there will be much uncertainty about the future of EU citizens in the UK, so there will be for those Britons living happily in EU countries, working or retired. There will be many issues to consider, some covered above: the cost of healthcare taxes on\u0026nbspproperty and income the payment or uprating of the UK state pension payment of local social security benefits gyrations in the exchange rate,\u0026nbspand the value of real estate across borders\u0026nbspremitted income from the UK the right to bring other family members to come and live with you voting rights and much else.19. Watch out for the RockSounds sinister – but not meant to be. Many Britons have links to Gibraltar, not just for financial reasons. Thus far\u0026nbspan under-discussed aspect of Brexit, Gibraltar is another UK territoryEU land border that raises an awful lot\u0026nbspof questions. The situation is made trickier because the EU has\u0026nbspgranted Spain a veto on future arrangements on Gibraltar. Nothing could change, perhaps\u0026nbspor “concessions” may only amount to the Spanish police having a role at the airport or the Spanish could decide to make life at the border more difficult, even though many Spanish workers rely on Gibraltar for their livelihoods.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march20. Don’t count on future working visits to the EUBy analogy with the US, if things really do get nasty\u0026nbspthen visa-free EU travel may be restricted to holidays and leisure. “Work”, even on a temporary assignment, may be treated differently, as it is by the\u0026nbspStates. Thus a special visa from the EU Belgium\u0026nbspmay be required if, say, a journalist wishes to go to Brussels, ironically, to report on the EU’s activities.\u0026nbspLikewise, an architect who wants to go Prague to supervise some construction work may need\u0026nbspan EUCzech permit. That’s because\u0026nbspif the UK\u0026nbspleaves the single market, British qualifications will not necessarily be recognised by EU states, as they tend to be now. Once again, a “worst case scenario” possibility that has\u0026nbspnot been much discussed.\u0026nbspSo there we are then. With luck, Britain won’t leave the EU at all certainly the pressure for a Final Say referendum is growing by the week. Or maybe we will do so in name only, or perhaps\u0026nbspacross a smooth, seamless transition that will take many months. Then again, Brexit hasn’t enjoyed much luck so far…\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But its high street outlets in the UK suffered a 1 per cent decline and fell by 6 per cent in Ireland.Paddy Power Betfair chief executive Peter Jackson said: Quarter three was a good quarter for the group. In Europe, the encouraging momentum that we saw in quarter two accelerated further, with online revenue up 15 per cent.This momentum, which was evident in both Paddy Power and Betfair, is driven by enhancements in product and good execution in promotions and marketing.In the US, the exciting potential of the sports betting opportunity and the strength of our strategic positioning has been evidenced by our experience to date in New Jersey.In the UK, bookies have also been warning about the impact of a recent Government move to slash stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals.Paddy Power said the new £2 stake limit would result in a 33 per cent to 43 per cent decrease in machine gaming revenue, or £36m to £46m revenue impact.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

weeksClick to followThe IndependentAn overlooked contributor to the discovery of the DNA double helix and the world’s most famous cosmologist are among those in the running to be the new face of the £50 note.The Bank of England has invited the public to submit the names of\u0026nbspscientific figures they’d like to appear on the new banknote, with a decision set to be announced in six weeks.A shortlist will be drawn up by an expert committee including space scientist Maggie Aderin-Pocock and physicist Simon Singh, with the final decision to be made by the Bank’s governor, Mark Carney.But who are the favourites to\u0026nbspadorn\u0026nbspthe new £50 notes, and what have been their contributions to science and UK society?Many people’s favourite to win will undoubtedly be the recently deceased Hawking, a true scientific superstar whose contributions to science extended far beyond his own discipline.Particle physicist and TV presenter Professor Brian Cox expressed his support for Hawking on the new note,\u0026nbsptweeting: “He made invaluable contributions over half a century to our understanding of cosmology, the early universe and black holes.”Professor Cox added that the former Cambridge academic has inspired thousands of scientists and millions of people through his books and lectures, “me included”.Hawking gave his name to the radiation emitted by black holes, advanced studies of the universe’s origins\u0026nbspand penned the bestselling popular science book A Brief History of Time to transmit ideas from his discipline to more than 10 million readers.Franklin’s work as an X-ray crystallographer at King’s College London produced images that contributed to James Watson and Francis Crick’s identification of the DNA double helix.In the years following her death in 1958, her crucial work has been recognised by many including Watson and Crick themselves, but Franklin was not included in the Nobel Prize the duo went on to win four years later.Franklin’s story is now seen as a cautionary tale about the ways the contributions of women have been ignored over the course of scientific history.A place on the £50 note would be seen by many as a fantastic way to honour a scientist who was never given the recognition she deserved in her lifetime.Katherine Mathieson, chief executive of the British Science Association, mentioned Franklin along with palaeontologist Mary Anning as potential faces for the new notes.“They were both underrecognised in their lifetime and now we could set the record straight and recognise the huge achievements they made,” she said.Another figure seen as an overlooked\u0026nbspscientific pioneer from a time when women were not traditionally included in science, Lovelace is often described as the world’s first computer programmer.The daughter of poet Lord Byron, Lovelace was a mathematician who worked on Charles Babbage’s proposed computer, the Analytical Engine.Lovelace translated an article by an Italian military engineer concerning the engine, adding an elaborate set of notes that contain what some have described as the first ever computer program – an algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine.Like Franklin, Lovelace has only recently been recognised for her contribution, and her addition to the new £50 would therefore be a fitting tribute for someone who was not recognised in their lifetime.In his role as a codebreaker during the Second World War, Turing played a major part in helping defeat Nazi Germany by providing the allied forces\u0026nbspwith information that gave them the upper hand in key operations.His work at Bletchley Park during the war cracked the German messages sent by the Enigma machine, and is regarded as making key contributions to the fields of computer science and artificial intelligence.Turing was convicted in 1952 under anti-homosexuality laws, leading to him accepting chemical castration and ultimately taking his own life two years later.Though he was posthumously pardoned in 2013, many will surely see a place on the currency as a way to honour his legacy.As the only British woman to become a Nobel science laureate, Hodgkin would be another perfect addition to the UK’s currency, and one who many people are perhaps not familiar with.The chemist won the prize in 1964 for her pioneering work that helped unravel the 3D structure of important substances such as insulin.Her nomination was backed by Royal Society president Venki Ramakrishnan, who said: “I would personally pick Dorothy Hodgkin, the only female Briton to have won a science Nobel Prize.”“We can thank Dorothy for revealing the three-dimensional structures of many biologically important molecules such as penicillin, insulin and vitamin B12, as well as inspiring several generations of leading crystallographers.“She was also a remarkable inidual who championed science in developing countries.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the

The\u0026nbspcap has now been raised to 1,350 a year and of those 1,000 will be hired by the Army, 300 by the Navy and 50 by the RAF.Those from outside the Commonwealth will still need British citizenship to apply, apart from Nepalese Gurkhas and applicants from the Republic of Ireland, who can enrol under a special arrangement.The five-year residence requirement had previously been waived in 1998\u0026nbspand the UK\u0026nbspalready employs 4,500 Commonwealth citizens in the armed forces.Minister for the Armed Forces Mark Lancaster said: As an outward-looking nation, Britain has always counted on the dedicated service of our friends from the Commonwealth to keep this country safe.From Australia to Jamaica, to Fiji and South Africa, Commonwealth recruits are already playing a key role in our Armed Forces.So we’re stepping up the numbers of recruits from the Commonwealth, knowing that they will bring key skills and dedicated service to our military.Their different perspectives will also help us to enhance our cultural understanding, giving us an operational advantage over our adversaries.It follows the announcement by the Ministry of Defence that\u0026nbspwomen would be allowed to apply for all roles in the British military including the Royal Marines.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Leicester City team with Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha (centre in white uniform) son of Leicester City\u0027s Thai owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha while they pay their respects during the second day of the funeral ceremony at Wat Thepsirin Buddhist temple in Bangkok.

This means a public vote on any deal or a vote on a no deal, alongside the option of staying in the EUIn June, however, Mr Banks told\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspon the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee\u0026nbspthat Rock Services was “just a service company” and “just delivers the cash”. He said the “actual loan came from another one of my companies”.Asked repeatedly by Mr Marr\u0026nbspwhat the other company was, the businessman insisted the money had come only from Rock Services.\u0026nbspHe rejected the Electoral Commission’s suggestion that some of the money could have come\u0026nbspfrom Isle of Man-based company Rock Holdings, which owns Rock Services. This would be potentially illegal because, under UK law,\u0026nbspcampaign donations can only be made by firms\u0026nbspregistered in the UK.Mr Banks\u0026nbspsaid the probe into Leave.EU’s funding was “politically motivated” and came after pressure from “a group of vicious Labour MPs who have grouped together with  and the Financial Times to try to undermine Brexit”.The BBC’s decision to host\u0026nbspMr Banks on\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspshow\u0026nbspprompted outrage from other political figures.In a typically aggressive performance, the Brexiteer\u0026nbsplashed out at DCMS\u0026nbspcommittee chairman Damian\u0026nbspCollins, who has\u0026nbspbeen highly critical of him.Asked why he had written to Mr Collins’ constituents in Folkestone and Hythe calling the MP a “snake in the grass”, Mr Banks replied: “Well, he is.”Claims have been made that Mr Banks misled\u0026nbspMr Collins’ committee\u0026nbspin relation to whether staff at another of his insurance companies had worked on the Leave.EU campaign.According to The Observer, leaked emails suggest\u0026nbspemployees of Eldon Insurance worked on the campaign without this being declared as official\u0026nbspspending.Mr Collins suggested the emails appeared to “flatly contradict” what Mr Banks had told his committee in June.\u0026nbspAsked about the matter, Mr Banks told Andrew\u0026nbspMarr: “That was reported to the Electoral Commission. People that\u0026nbspdid work from Eldon were transferred over on short-term contracts\u0026nbsplegally and it was reported through the Electoral Commission in the right way.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The earlier referendum was held after negotiations were complete, so voters knew what they were voting for.“In 2016, the nature of the negotiation process and its outcome were unknown. Voters faced a choice between a known reality and an unknown alternative.“In the campaign, untestable claims took the place of facts and reality.”Human rights specialist Jonathan Cooper, a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers, said: “The current state of the Brexit negotiations is worrying people throughout the UK and the legal profession is no exception to that.“We represent people from across industry and society and we see every day the way the prospect of a catastrophic Brexit deal is already causing real harm.“This letter to the prime minister has been signed by over a thousand of my colleagues who are convinced that not only is a people\u0027s vote the right thing to do, it is the most democratic thing to do as well.”A Department for Exiting the EU spokeswoman said: “The people of the United Kingdom have already had their say in one of the biggest democratic exercises this country has ever seen and the Prime Minister has made it clear that there is not going to be a second referendum.“We remain confident we will agree a mutually advantageous deal with the EU.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There may yet be a Brexit agreement on the Irish border. The latest whispers out of meetings in Brussels are that the EU is preparing to offer a compromise solution on the so-called “backstop”. Whether it will be enough for the UK remains to be seen.But let’s suppose it is, and a withdrawal agreement is signed. Does that prevent a no deal? Not exactly.There are two things that could still cause a no-deal Brexit. Both bring a huge degree of uncertainty.EU plans compromise on customs union to solve Irish borderThe first is the parliamentary vote. Theresa May, you may remember, has no majority in the House of Commons and needs help. How the DUP, Labour, and Conservative Eurosceptics\u0026nbspvote will determine whether a deal passes parliament, even if it has been agreed between\u0026nbspnegotiators.The second uncertainty is over the future trading relationship. An outline of this was supposed to have been agreed by now, but the timetable has slipped because of a lack of progress on Northern Ireland, which the EU insists must be dealt with first.\u0026nbspIt is not widely understood that UK law states that this outline of the future relationship has to be presented to MPs before any vote on the withdrawal deal. But it is simply not clear how this will be possible.\u0026nbspTheresa May’s Chequers plan has been dismissed, and she has rejected the EU’s options of a loose free trade agreement or Norway-style single market participation.

It’s possible the issue of the trading relationship could make a comeback and sink the whole thing.And yet, if we cannot sign a deal, Britain may still avoid heading over the cliff edge.\u0026nbspThe government says emphatically it is prepared to go ahead with a no-deal Brexit, but the truth is the country is simply not prepared. The physical infrastructure needed is not in place and will take years to build, at ports, airports, and elsewhere.\u0026nbspThere is certainly not a majority in the House of Commons for a no-deal, and the political damage to the government of going ahead with one far outweighs any benefit.However, there remains the option to revoke Article 50 – even temporarily – before March 29.\u0026nbspEmpty supermarket shelves, grounded flights, and queues at ports are a prime minister’s worst nightmare.

The taoiseach indicated an openness to consider proposals for a review, provided that it was clear that the outcome of any such review could not involve a unilateral decision to end the backstop.\u0026nbspHe recalled the prior commitments made that the backstop must apply \u0027unless and until\u0027 alternative arrangements are agreed. They both expressed the hope that the negotiations could conclude in a satisfactory manner as soon as possible.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDowning Street has also announced that Theresa May will be appointing a new sports minister later today - after Tracey Crouch resigned from the position last week in a row over highly-addictive fixed odd betting machines.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTheresa May’s spokesman has refused to say whether the UK has privately demanded the right to pull Britain out of the EU\u0027s proposed Irish backstop after just three months.He also declined to recognise an unofficial deadline of this week to make progress in the talks – before hopes of a special summit this month to agree a deal have to be abandoned.Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, has angered the Irish government by saying the UK must have the unilateral right to pull the plug on the backstop – the guarantee of no return to a hard border – and, apparently, put the demand in a letter to Theresa May.Asked about the reports, the spokesman said he “would not comment on any private correspondence between the prime minister and ministers”.And, on the right to end the backstop after as little as three months, he said only: “We don’t want the backstop to be in place indefinitely and are looking for a mechanism to achieve that.”The Cabinet will discuss Brexit tomorrow, but it appears unlikely that any key decisions will be reached that would clear the way for the prime minister to strike a deal by the end of the week.No 10 insists that whether the EU calls a special summit in November is a “decision for them” – saying only that the UK wants to reach an agreement “as soon as we can”.Remain-backing Conservative MP Dominic Grieve said reported proposals for the UK to remain in a customs union following EU withdrawal made clear that the whole Brexit process was questionable.The former attorney general told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: At the end of the day it highlights why the entire enterprise is questionable, because in fact what we are likely to end up with is leaving the EU but staying in a relationship of sufficient dependency on it without influence as to call into question the whole project.I don\u0027t accept that rejecting the deal would necessarily mean it is no deal at all, said Mr Grieve. Of course it would provoke a political crisis ... but there comes a point where you have to look to the long term.If the long term is that we are simply going to be continuing this argument long after we\u0027ve left the EU on March 29 next year as to what our future relationship with it is going to be, then, quite frankly, it would be better to have that argument now and let the public decide what they want and if they are content with the arrangements the Government has come up with.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It will serve as an opportunity for businesses to reach people, he said.WhatsApp update finally brings stickers to messaging appThe status feature is something like the stories tool that appears in Instagram and Facebook, as well as WhatsApp. It allows people to post updates that will appear to all of their friends, letting them share photos or text and then letting it disappear afterwards.WhatsApp has struggled to come up with ways to show its users ads: without a feed, like Instagram or Facebook, there are few places for them to be injected.When it dropped its subscription fee in 2016, the company posted a blog post making clear that ads would never interrupt your communication, further adding to the issues about how advertising could be shown within the app.But the status feature appears to have solved that problem, allowing WhatsApp to slide marketing posts in between updates from friends, like it does with Instagram stories.As well as serving as something like a feed, WhatsApp\u0027s status feature has quickly become a huge part of the app. It now has a huge number of users, and is more popular than many major apps like Snapchat.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

UK weather forecast: 48 hour STORM ASSAULT to smash BritainFreakishly warm but unsettled weather will hold out until the middle of November as the nation enjoys a late Indian Summer, according to the Met Office.Meteorologist Marco Petagna said: \u0026ldquoThe main theme for this week will be the very mild temperatures due to a southerly airflow bringing air up from southern Europe.\u0026ldquoParts of Greece are seeing some very high temperatures for the time of year and although we will not get as high, we are in the same flow of air hence the very mild conditions.\u0026ldquoThis is due to a very active jet stream which is coming out of America at a high speed, it will pull low-pressure systems in from the Atlantic which will drive this southerly air flow but also bring some unsettled conditions.\u0026ldquoWe expect it to remain mild but unsettled really right through the first half of the month.The mercury will rise through the start of the week with southeastern England likely to touch 17C (62.6F) or 18C (64.4F) by Tuesday with double-digit temperatures forecast through until the end of the week.UK weather forecast: Supercharged 180mph jet stream will trigger a 10 day tropical blast and storms (Image: NETWEATHER)Thermometers will hover widely in double figures with even Scotland and the north likely to lift 12C higher than normal.Western Britain will be in the firing line for bouts of stormy weather through the week with a drier, calmer outlook for the east, Mr Pegagna added.He said: \u0026ldquoThere will be a bit of a nationwide split through the week with the rain and strong winds out towards the west and the chance of brighter weather towards the east of the UK.\u0026ldquoCoastal regions could see gales and there is a chance of some quite heavy and persistent rainfall, but then towards the east of the country it is a different picture with much more settled conditions expected.\u0026ldquoThe weather is being driven by a powerful jet stream which thanks to high pressure to the east of the UK had become split, and this is helping to pull air up from the south.\u0026ldquoThis high to the east is also blocking air from that direction, although even over eastern Europe temperatures are much higher than average for the time of year.Thermometers could nudge 18C (64.4F) in parts of the south on Tuesday with warm breezes making it feel close to 20C (68F), according to feel-like temperature charts.Britain could be about to bake in one of the warmest November spells since 1977 when the mercury hit 18.5C (65.5F) in Hereford on the 9th.

and he believes there could be hundreds more.The extended donor family - which also includes three grandchildren - now try to hang out several times a month - meeting up for dinner, bowling and even going on family holidays.And the number keeps growing - with a new kid getting in contact with Peter every month.It was a shock at first, but now when I look around at all these kids I feel giddy, he told Sun Online.I cant believe I was a part - even a small part - of creating all these wonderful kids.I dont know for sure how many kids there might be - the sperm bank doesn’t have complete records.Peters situation raises worrying ethical concerns about donors in the States.While in the UK donors can only legally father  children, across the pond there are no limits and regulations.This is something some of Peters donor kids are concerned about.Sun Online joined Peter and seven of his kids on a family outing in Los Angeles, where they played an Escape Room game and went for a vegan Italian meal.Peter and the children have a designated Facebook group and spreadsheet to help them keep in touch and plan meet-ups.Many of the kids have similar physical or personality traits, and bizarrely they all seem to get on like they’ve known each other for years - even though some of them have only met in the past month.Theatre director Peters donor children live all over the US and the world - including France and China.Theyve not managed to get all  together at the same time but hope to one day.Sidney, is the youngest of the siblings at  and had no idea who his donor father was until he took a DNA test on the website andme, which matches people with their genetic relatives.“I have two moms so I always knew I had a donor father but he was completely anonymous,” Sidney explained.“Then I took the test and got connected with my sister Rachel and brother Peter and we kept growing.“It’s weird to say that you have become friends with your siblings because usually you grow up with them, but in the past year that’s what’s happened to me.“It’s great for me because I’m an only child so I haven’t grown up with brothers or sisters so it’s nice now to get to go out and hang out with my siblings.“It’s funny when I tell people that I have  siblings because they don’t believe me - they think I’m lying.”Peter’s donor daughter Rachel was the first one to reach out to Peter.She had already managed to locate  of her donor siblings using the donor register and andme.Pooling together dferent information they had been given from their parents, they figured out that their dad was an actor from Los Angeles and they knew his name.She put the name into a movie database and found a “Peter Ellenstein”, then managed to track him down on Facebook.Musician Rachel, , said she was most interested in seeing a picture of her biological father and learning a little bit more about “where she came from and how she got here”.Rachel and Peter hit it off and became very close - now they speak to each other most days and even enjoyed a holiday to France together, where they visited another donor sibling.Peter described meeting Rachel for the first time - via video chat - as “dferent than anything Id ever felt before.”He said: “It was a profound feeling looking at someone who so clearly resembled me and some of my mannerisms and it turned out we had all kinds of things in common.“We actually met the next day in person and we hugged for a long time and cried and talked.Rachel told him she had made contact with  other siblings and over the course of the year Peter began meeting them.Another  kids then came forward over the next year - with the most recent two coming forward just three weeks ago.Peter said his friends and family have all reacted dferently to the news of his new family - but his -year-old mother is delighted to suddenly have so many grandchildren.“The reactions of everybody have been all over the map,” he said.My mother is thrilled she says, the more, the merrier’.Peter, who donated sperm for about six years - sometimes as often as five times a week -says he tries to let each of his children decideand how they want to meet - and they also decide what they want to call him.Some call him “DNA dad”, “donor father”, “lab dad” or just plain old Peter. Others refer to him as father or dad.Alana, , who has a twin sister Bridget, said she was more interested in meeting other siblings - than gaining a new dad - but is glad that she has met Peter.“We were raised by a mother and a father so we already had that father figure,” she said.“For us we wanted to know about our other siblings and find outwe had anything in common with them, were there were any similarities  Do we look like each other “My mother told me when I was  that we had a donor father and I was always curious but it wasn’t until  that we tracked down any siblings.”And although Alana and Bridget are “super excited” about suddenly acquiring so many siblings - they do think there should be more regulation on how many children can be created from one man’s sperm.“I think there should be a cap - we are probably going to be hitting  soon in the next year - it’s a lot,” she said.“There’s so many of us that live in Calornia too - whatwe fell in love with someone and they turned out to be a sibling  That would be terrible.“Some of the siblings have already figured out that they knew each other from before - from being in the same classes - but they didn’t know they had the same donor dad.“I sometimes wonder when I’m looking at people walking down the street or on the bus - whatthat’s my sibling Peter says he says he is careful not to try and replace anybody’s actual parents.Most of the real parents have been supportive - some have felt a little concerned but theyve soon come around when theyve seen the benefits for their kids having so many siblings, Peter explained.“I feel like I get to be a part of  dferent adventures.“I didnt have any children of my own. I had a step daughter with my ex we but Id never raised my own kids.“And when I first saw Rachel, part of my brain and a part of my heart opened up that I didnt know that I had before. And I cant really explain what it is.“It was a mixture of sort of a sense of longevity, of purpose, wonder. Im really just feeling things that Id never experienced before.”Peter and his donor kids are now eagerly waiting to seemore of his children come forward.And its clear thatthey do, they will be welcomed into the unique donor family with open arms. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Which is why Leave’s support fell dramatically in polls when Leave.EU unveiled its toxic anti-migrant poster. Many waverers reluctantly opted for Remain to avoid siding with Farage and Banks. And Vote Leave still won by ,,.Imagine how much greater the margin would have been, in a nation staunchly Eurosceptic for decades, had Banks not been involved. Greater still had the Government not blown £million of our cash, outside of campaign spending, leafleting every home on Remain’s behalf.And it would be even widera second referendum was somehow brought about.To suggest that .million Leavers were swayed by dirty tricks and allegedly dodgy spending is utterly absurd.THE Government simply cannot afford to betray the DUP’s red lines on Brexit.They must not under-estimate unionist resolve.

The Netherlands and Spain were the only other EU countries in the top ten.That is some achievement for the UK. And demonstrates that the people who know where to invest, know it should be in the UK.They know we live in a dynamic nation, brimming with potential.So as we leave the European Union, we should remember the many reasons investors choose to put their money here in the United Kingdom, which is one of the world’s largest and most successful economies.We are at record levels of employment. Our success is underpinned by a legal system whose reputation is second to none. We have a skilled workforce and a low tax and a well-regulated economy.We are home to some of the finest universities, our research and development capabilities are cutting-edge and our financial institutions world-leading.We are in the right time zone to trade with Asia in the morning and the United States in the afternoon — and, of course, we speak English, the language of global business.Plus, there is serious global momentum behind businesses in the UK. We continue to attract more Foreign Direct Investmentthan anywhere  in Europe. And we are the number one choice in Europe for key strategic investments, such as headquarters. So it’s easy to see why more than , new businesses start up here every day.And it isn’t just small and medium-sized businesses. The UK has created  of Europe’s  companies valued at more than billion.Only this week Monzo, the British bank which operates through an app on your phone, secured £million of investment in order to double its workforce. This raised the company’s value to the £billion mark just three years after its formation.This is a fantastic vote of confidence in the UK and yet another sign that we have plenty to be optimistic about after we leave the EU.Investment creates jobs across all parts of the UK, pumps money into our communities and improves the lives of millions of people.Last year, FDI created , new jobs in the UK as well as safeguarding another ,.One reason we are seeing so much success is that this government has built an environment that makes investment and job creation easy.We are champions of free trade and we actively encourage businesses of all sizes — from start-ups to large corporations — to build trading links in all corners of the world.This weekend I’ll be representing the UK at the China International Import Expo in Shanghai where we are a “country of honour”.Over recent months, China has started to open up its market for UK goods and services, including dairy products, potatoes and petrol stations.And, this weekend, we intend to build on these achievements and create even more exciting opportunities for British companies.We also possess world-class talent. For example, we excel at research and development, which means that overseas companies want to tap into British expertise to advance the quality of their products. In last week’s Budget, we announced a further £.billion to strengthen the UK’s global leadership in science and innovation — that brings the total to £billion invested in research and development since .We want a partnership with business to make our country prosper.The Government’s Industrial Strategy includes innovative deals agreed with inidual sectors to attract investment. We are already reaping the rewards.The global marketplace never slows and we, too, must never stand still.Building on our impressive investment success, I have implemented the High Potential Opportunities scheme, which will deliver growth where it is most needed, often to previously overlooked areas.The success of the AgriTech programme in the West Midlands town of Telford and Leicestershire’s leading space sector cluster are proof the benefits of global investment are being felt in every part of the country.Over recent months, the Department for International Trade has led a series of investment roundtables, promoting UK industry to a global audience and driving foreign direct-investment into the UK as we prepare to leave the European Union.So far, these events have centred on tech, le sciences, automotive and agri-tech sectors and will soon start to focus on areas such as the creative industries.Initiatives such as this are going to be key in the coming months as we develop the UK’s own independent trade policy for the first time in more than  years.Working with businesses in the UK and overseas, I am determined to continue generating this flow of good news.But the facts tell a dferent story: Confidence in Britain is riding so high around the world that foreign investors are betting on it like never before.New UN figures show that in the first six months of  we were second only to booming China in attracting investment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We want to see vibrant hubs where people live, shop, use services, and come together.I recognise that these challenges are linked. Empty shops and decreasing footfall on the high street can contribute to social problems such as crime, unemployment and loneliness, while successful high streets can make communities stronger.That is why this week I am launching the new Open Doors project to help regenerate the high street and support community groups.The scheme will match landlords of vacant commercial units with community groups offering vital services to younger and older people. The aim is to reduce loneliness among our most vulnerable members of the community, whilst increasing footfall in town centres.We know that there are already some really successful examples of landlords working with community groups to provide premises on a temporary basis, to the benefit of both parties.However, we know that landlords may not be aware of the benefits of these arrangements, and community groups may not know who to approach or how to negotiate a temporary contract.This Open Doors scheme will help to overcome these barriers and bring vital services, as well as footfall, to local high streets.This announcement follows the Chancellor’s Autumn Budget which confirmed a new £. billion plan to support and transform the high street.In July this year, we asked Sir John Timpson, a businessman with more than three decades’ experience of what makes our high streets tick, to look at what’s needed to respond to issues currently affecting the high street.He recommended we set up a national body to strengthen local leadership and establish a new fund to support the renewal and reshaping of town centres.So, in this Budget provided a new £ million Future High Street Fund to help local areas adapt to changes and to prepare long-term strategies.The money will help improve transport links, redevelop empty shops, and restore historic properties, keeping our high streets fit for generations to come.We’ve also established a new High Streets Taskforce to help local leaders prepare and implement new strategies for their town centres.Small retail businesses will see their business rates bills cut by a third, saving them up to £ million over two years.These actions will help create a more level playing field for all retailers.It’s against this optimistic backdrop that I will outline my vision for communities at next week’s Locality Convention.I have been clear about my department’s priorities – building the homes this country needs, supporting and strengthening communities, and boosting local growth.Our resolve to deliver on these commitments has been bolstered by a bold budget.Our communities and our high streets will not be left behind.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing.All  passengers and  crew on board the Boeing  are missing, presumed dead.Vance told the Daily Star: The passengers ended up in the Southern Indian Ocean, and are at the bottom of the sea inside the sunken and intact fuselage.The Canadian-born investigator slammed the official investigation and expressed regret about how authorities in Malaysia hadnt gone back to the Southern Indian Ocean to follow his advice.He went on: I honestly believed that once the official investigation team saw the physical evidence that we discovered, and how we interpreted it accurately, they would change their minds about what they thought happened to MH.Unfortunately, and disappointingly, I was wrong.I am not sure why they continue to cling to their incorrect theories and analysis.He also dismissed the theory of Ian Wilson, an amateur investigator who claimed to have found the missing plane in the middle of the Cambodian jungle on Google Maps.Vance said there was no way the plane could have survived a crash into the jungle intact.Images from Google Maps show the outline of a large plane – which could simply be an aircraft flying directly below the satellite which photographed it.But video producer Ian is convinced of his findings and says he  intends to visit the sight to solve one of the greatest mysteries in aviation history.He told the Daily Star:

Wednesday as a monster pressure vortex covering virtually all of the Atlantic Ocean barrels up to Britain.Simon Partridge at the Met Office said: There’s an upper trough over the Atlantic which will maintain low pressure and push in from the West through the week.“The thing is, we’ve got high pressure just to the East of us over northern Europe as well so these systems get pushed in from the Atlantic during the week and bump up against the high pressure.“So some of them will fizzle out over the West, but some of them will make their way all the way over to the East.“So it’s a fairly unsettled week ahead with the western UK in particular seeing the brunt of the wettest and windiest weather.And after this week, The Weather Company has forecasted that five more named storms will crash into the UK as Christmas nears, The Mirror reports.The powerful storms will be called Deirdre, Erik, Freya, Gareth and Hannah.If they do arrive, the additional five named storms will take s total to eight after Ali, Bronagh and Callum wreaked havoc earlier in the year.Leon Brown, head of meteorological operations at The Weather Channel, said: Four more named Atlantic storms are expected by early December, plus the risk of a fth named storm before Christmas.Travel disruption and wind gusts over mph in parts of the North and West are expected.Meanwhile, forecasters have predicted perfect weather conditions for Bonfire Night this evening, with clear skies for most parts of the country.But while some areas will be dry with plenty of clear skies, theres a risk of rain across Northern Ireland, north west Scotland and the east coast of England.Met Office forecaster Simon Partridge said: This evening is the big event for Bonfire Night.For most of us dry, fine, plenty of clear skies around. Winds not too strong either.We will see rain across Northern Ireland and the far north west of Scotland and down across the east coast.As the evening goes on you will see a little more in the way of low cloud and hill fog starting to edge its way inland later in the night.Northern Ireland will see the worst of todays weather with a cloudy day and patchy rain this evening.Tuesday is looking like a split picture, with dry conditions in the east and a wetter day in the west.Itll also turn a little bit more breezy before winds really start to pick up towards the end of the week.Wednesday well see heavy, locally thundery, rain and showers with strong winds while Thursday and Friday will probably be showery with some bright or sunny spells.It comes after fireworks displays were called off across the UK on Saturday night as ex-Hurricane Oscar battered the country.Celebrations everywhere from Shropshire to Scotland were cancelled over fears of mph gale force winds.Torrential downpours blasted Scotland, with mm of rain falling in North West Scotland and a yellow weather warning was in place until midnight.But the respite wont last long, with stronger weather conditions to lash the UK later this week.Mark Wilson of the Met Office told the Sun Online: Its a quiet start to the week, but unsettled weather will kick in from Tuesday.We could have gale force winds from Wednesday in exposed areas, particularly in the South West."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000446318166-e1541362517674.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"queen mary saved wilfred smith from the trenches","story":"They believe they would not be alive to do it were it not for an act of generosity by the Queen’s grandmother in one of the most moving tales of World War One.For these  men, women and children, aged two to , are the descendants of Wilfred Smith — a real le British version of movie character Private Ryan.In the war, which ended  years ago next Sunday, Wilfred’s mother Margaret saw all six of her sons go off to fight on the Western Front.As she waved goodbye to her youngest, -year-old Wilfred, she poignantly told women on the  at Barnard Castle station in County Durham: “Don’t have boys, they’ll only end up as cannon fodder.”That very day, in February , two of her sons were already dead, killed at the Somme.And by the following summer, mill worker Margaret and her husband John, a chimney sweep, had received five black-edged telegrams from the War Office, each one confirming that one of their boys had died in action.Three of them were never found and today their bodies still lie under the ploughed fields of Northern France and Flanders.But in August that year Queen Mary, we of King George V, read of Margaret Smith’s terrible story in a letter sent to Buckingham Palace.She vowed there and then that Wilfred would be ed home safe to his mother from the front line.Wilfred’s granddaughter Amanda Harrison takes up the story: “Vicar’s we Mary Bircham used to visit the slums of Barnard Castle, where the Smith family lived.“She befriended Margaret, who had  children. After her fth son, Alfred, died of his wounds in a hospital near Boulogne in July , Margaret was terried that Wilfred, her last boy, would also be killed.“So Mrs Bircham took the brave step of writing to Queen Mary and begging her to help save Margaret from any further sadness by bringing Wilfred home.”Amazingly, just days later, the Queen’s private secretary, Edward Wallington wrote back to say Her Majesty had contacted the War Office to find Private Smith in the trenches and order him home.The extraordinary events happened  years before Steven Spielberg made his World War Two film Saving Private Ryan, which echoed Wilfred’s story.Margaret and John Smith’s two years of hell had begun in September , when their -year-old son Robert was killed in the Battle of Flers-Courcelette, on the Somme.He had given up his job as a labourer to join the sixth battalion of his local regiment, the Durham Light Infantry, soon after war broke out in .Robert died just  weeks after arriving in France. He had been among  men who had wrongly been told the Germans were retreating from their position, known as the Starfish Line.At . on the morning of September , , in pouring rain, he was hit by enemy machine gun fire. He was taken to a casualty station where at first he and elder brother George, , who was in the same battalion, joked together. But three days later Robert died from his wounds. He was buried near the town of Albert.After his death, four brothers — George, John, Frederick and Alfred — came home on leave and posed for the photo above that would turn out to be their last together.Wilfred, then working as a mill hand, was not in the picture as he had not yet been called up.On Bonfire Night  George was in an attack on the Butte de Warlencourt, a ft prehistoric burial mound on the Somme, when he was shot through the head by a sniper as he waded through waist-deep mud.His body disappeared under the surface to be lost for ever.His name is carved into the wall of the Thiepval Memorial, along with , other British victims of the Somme who have no grave.Frederick, , was wounded on Christmas Eve  and was sent to recover at home, where he remained until February, .The following week, Wilfred joined up. Five months later, on the opening day of the third battle of Ypres, Frederick was killed.He and his comrades in the th Durham Light Infantry went over the top into a hail of machine gun fire.After driving the Germans from Imperfect Trench they pushed on but dozens, including Frederick, were mown down as they attacked a German fortication. Frederick has no grave but his name can been seen on the Menin Gate in Ypres, where every day since  the Last Post has been played.Margaret’s eldest son, John Stout, , who was married with two daughters, had been born out of wedlock.His name is carved in the Tyne Cot memorial in Belgium after he was killed on October ,  at Passchendaele and his body never found. The Smiths’ nightmare continued the following summer, when their fth son, -year-old Alfred, was wounded in battle on the Ardre river.He died of his wounds at a military hospital in Wimereux, near Boulogne, on July , .Just three weeks later, Queen Mary received the letter begging her to end Margaret Smith’s heartache and bring her last son home.By then Wilfred was a -year–old, battle-hardened Tommy who had fought the Germans hand-to-hand in the trenches south of Ypres.Queen Mary sent Wilfred home where he became a stonemason and chimney sweepHe had survived mustard gas attacks and was training for the final skirmishes of the war at Terdeghem, on the French-Belgian border, when a messenger arrived with orders from Army headquarters to pack his kitbag and go home.Military historian John Sheen, an expert on the Durham Light Infantry, said: “Mrs Smith’s story must have touched the Queen’s heart because taking a man from the line for personal reasons is extremely rare.”Wilfred ed home to Barnard Castle and became a stonemason and chimney sweep, like his dad John, who died in .Despite suffering chronic chest problems from the mustard gas attack for the rest of his le, he lived until he was  and raised five children with his we Hannah.Granddaughter Amanda, , says: “As children we knew a little bit about Wilfred’s amazing story. My mum would tell us some of it but Grandad did not really talk about it.“I think it was probably hard for him in some ways, as he was lucky to leave the war behind — though the people in Barnard Castle didn’t see it that way. Few people can imagine what it must have been like for him to lose five brothers.”On Sunday Wilfred’s daughter Dianne, , Amanda and her daughter Charlene, , son Craig, , and grandson Tommy, two, will plant poppy crosses at Barnard Castle’s war memorial, where the names of the tragic brothers are remembered.Sergeant Fritz Niland – Private James Ryan in the film – was part of the Allied D-Day operation to take back mainland Europe from the Nazis.But when the US military were led to believe that all three of Fritz’s brothers had been killed in action, they sent him home so the family would have one son left.The film, starring Matt Damon as Private Ryan, tells how heroic Captain John Miller, played by Tom Hanks, leads a group of soldiers to track down Ryan amid the chaos of war and send him home.But the real-le twist for Fritz Niland was that while his brothers Preston and Bob had both died fighting in France, his other brother, Edward, had wrongly been listed as having been killed.Edward had in fact been captured by the Japanese after parachuting into Burma in  and held as a prisoner of war.He was freed when the prison camp was liberated in May  and ed to live in the US until his death in  at the age of .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He said: “If this legislation comes into place, it’s the airports that are going to be losing out on a heck of a lot of money.I’ve just spent £ on a round of  beers and a little bit of breakfast. It’s chucking money into the economy.”For some travellers, drinking helps with their fear of flying.Worried advertising boss Chris Andrews ordered his first beer at am before a flight from Manchester airport to Malaga. Chris, , from Cheltenham, said: “I’m a nervous flier so I want a beer to steady my nerves.”Nurse Michelle Nowell, , was also drinking at Manchester Airport with her mum Ann and pal Jane Bennett before flying to Tenere.Michelle said: “They shouldn’t be trying to spoil the start of people’s holiday just be- cause a few people can’t control themselves.”Bridget Kizza, , was having a cocktail at .am at Glasgow Airport on the way to Lanzarote. She said: “Alcohol can be more of a problem on the streets but it’s not as bad in airports.”The proposed crackdown would apply to duty free shops and restaurants, as well as the bars. So there would be no carrying on a bottle of booze ready for the first night of the holiday or having a quick glass of wine with breakfast.At Luton Airport the early fliers didn’t want their party spirit dampened.Champagne-swigging account manager Tracy Waldron, , of Peterborough, Cambs, who was heading to Lithuania with her pal Vicki, said: “I haven’t seen any rowdiness today but last time I was here there was a drunk man and that was at . in the morning. His we was really annoyed at him.”Punishments are already strong. Passengers who disrupt a flight can be jailed — andthey cause a flight to be erted they might be forced to pay up to £,.But not everyone thinks that planes and pints are a good mix. Ryanair has called for am to be the earliest that alcohol can be served because the number of booze-related disruptions on planes has doubled in two years.Oliver Bynon — who was flying to Amsterdam from Bristol to celebrate his st birthday with his brother Alex and two friends — agreed.He said: “You wouldn’t drink anywhere  this early. I’m only doing it because we’re celebrating my st. But I think the new law is a good idea.”Dad-of-two Brian Corrway, , travelling to Ireland from Glasgow with his we Linda and their three-month-old baby Oliver, also agreed that time should be called on early airport drinking.Accountant Brian said: “I’m in favour of it. It doesn’t really affect us but we have been in flights with people who are drunk and it’s not very good at that time in the morning.“I guess you do get a small number of people who spoil things for everyone and I don’t see another way of changing it other than limiting the amount people drink before they get on a flight.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Most blame him for Brexit.But his really unforgivable error was to see “Thatcher” as a dirty word and dodgy Tony Blair as The Master.As a result, he failed to win an outright majority in  and happily shacked up with treacherous Lib Dem Nick Clegg.He bet on another cosy coalition in , only to land a majority and the unwelcome obligation to deliver his promised referendum.Keep chillaxing, Dave.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He then menacingly warns cops:You are pushing me into a corner.He then steadfastly refuses to answer police questions despite them pointing out he has just offered to help the Lamplugh family - he even attacks Diana, who died in  by saying she had surrounded herself with people who do her no favours.Diana went to her grave convinced Cannan was involved in the  abduction and murder of estate agent Suzy who vanished after going to meet a mystery man called Mr Kipper at a house she was selling in Fulham.Cannan told cops Diana had already convicted meof murdering Suzy and even after three jail interviews where he is serving le for the murder of Shirley Banks in , the attempted kidnap of Julia Holman the previous night and the rape of a woman in Reading a year earlier continues to deny any involvement.At one point in the tapes Cannan confesses: I have committed crime, I have done many things wrong in my le, things that believe me I am genuinely sorry for, one or two things I havent even been caught for. Well spoken Cannan even jokes with cops recording the interviewsthey can make him a Genesis tape.After Operation Phoebus ended, the Crown Prosecution Service decided there was insufficient evidence to charge Cannan. But in November  the Met took the unusual step of naming him as their prime suspect for Suzys murder. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

ButPrime Minister David Lloyd George had his way, that shyunforgettable time and date  years ago this Sunday would not have been so evocative. Worse, it would have cost thousands of lives. A century ago Admiral Sir Rosslyn Wemyss, First Sea Lord – and “Rosie” to his family – was picked as the British delegate at the signing of the Armistice.  The agreement would bring an end to four years of the most bitter and bloody fighting Europe had seen. In a rickety railway carriage, a former dining car turned makesht office, parked up in woodland in Compiegravegne, in northern France, Sir Rosslyn joined the Supreme Allied Commander, Frenchman Marshal shyFerdinand Foch, and the German delegation. After much shuttling between that carriage and the Germans’ own – parked a few metres along the track – the shyArmistice was signed at .am and the ceasefire announced at am.  But today, Sir Rosslyn’s great-great-nephew, Michael Wemyss, , reveals Lloyd George wanted the shyceasefire at .pm, rather than the famous th hour. It would have a been a costly choice... He says: “He was instructed by Lloyd George to ensure the Armistice took effect at .pm. “The story is, Rosie rang King George V and between them decided there was no point holding off, so they brought it forward to the th hour, am.  “Lloyd George wanted to announce it in the Commons and take the glory. George V announced it and Lloyd George had the rug pulled out from under him. “Every hour saved lives.” But siding with the king against the prime minister cost Sir Rosslyn, , dear. “Lloyd George was furious, and shywithheld Rosie’s pound, grant – all the service chiefs got a thank you. They all got earldoms too!” says Michael.  “Rosie was furious. He felt what he had done was to everyone’s benefit other than Lloyd George personally and this was a vendetta.” Sir Rosslyn’s shydecision, backed by George V, a cousin and friend, with whom he had served in the navy, wasn’t his only shyleshyshysaving action during the First World War. He was responsible for getting all the British and Australian troops out of Gallipoli in Turkey in , after their campaign failed spectacularly. “When the army decided to retreat he managed to get all the soldiers off the peninsula without a single death,” says Michael proudly. Alongside him was Captain John Peter Ralph Marriott – and it was to Marriott that Sir Rosslyn turned to assist him at the momentous signing of the Armistice.  Today, his grandson Charles Marriott, , says his ancestor was also always hugely proud of his presence that day. And it was he who phoned the King’s personal secretary to reveal the shydocshyshyument had been signed. “It took him half a day desperately trying to get through,” Charles reveals.  Then only , Charles was gted the blotting paper that was used to dry the ink of the signatures as a memshyento. He always recalled the tense shyatmosphere in the carriage – and the aggressive exchanges between the rather cocky Allied contingent, and their crushed enemy. The Germans had been forced to hand over all their artillery, machine guns, naval fleet, and air force.  “There was quite a lot of rudeness in the carriage,” says Charles. “The German delegation said, ‘We need an Armistice, our people are starving’ – the Navy had blockaded the German ports. And Wemyss told them, ‘You look fat enough!’ “The German replied, ‘As you well know, Admiral, we are the people who don’t suffer in these situations’.” On the French side Eacuteric Beacutecourt-Foch, great-grandson of Marshal shyFerdinand Foch, says his ancestor had a very personal reason for relishing his signing of the Armistice. Foch lost his own son, as well as his son-in-law, Eacuteric’s grandfather, on August , , during the Battle of the shyFrontiers when , French soldiers were killed in less than  hours.  “He did not learn of their deaths for a number of months, the armies were in retreat and it was a great mess,” says Eacuteric, . “News didn’t get through.” Movingly, family man Foch, in deep mourning, wrote to his we nearly ever day during the conflict. “It must have meant all the more to him to finally sign the Armistice,” says Eacuteric of that incredible moment. It was Foch’s carriage where the signing took place – and  years later it was also the location of another historic moment.  When France signed an armistice with the Germans in  during the Second World War, Adolf Hitler ordered that it take place in the same carriage in Compiegravegne, so the Germans could lord it over their enemies. Then the carriage was taken to Berlin and exhibited – until in , as the Nazis realised defeat was coming, they blew up it up in one final act of revenge.

The mum-to-be impressed fashion-lovers with her incredible looks - covering everything from comfy casual to red carpet glam from high street names, as well as designer brands. And communication coach Robin Kermode believes the pregnant duchess, , used her strategically picked attire to signal her strongly held beliefs. In total, it is estimated Meghans Down Under tour wardrobe cost pound,. The items of clothing with signicant meanings behind them include her pumps created out of recycled plastic water bottles, and jeans made by female victims of human trafficking and sexual exploitation. With the world of the eyes upon her, some of Meghans outfits have unsurprisingly sold out as fans rush to snap them up. The jeans made by female victims of sexual exploitation  On several occasions during the overseas tour, Meghan opted to wear jeans from Outland - including the Harriet pair, pictured above. The Australian brand was founded by James Bartle after he saw first-hand how human traffickers prey on vulnerable young girls in order to service the sex industry. Determined to making a change, James learnt that once a girl has been rescued and supported through her recovery, a sustainable career path is vital for securing her future. He created the Denim Project, to enable those girls who demonstrated an interest in sewing to put their new skills to use. Outlands team of seamstresses offer positions to those at risk of falling into poverty, and has broadened its mission to set a standard for the treatment and remuneration of young female workers in the garment manufacturing industry. It also sources ethically and environmentally sound raw materials, from organic cotton pocket linings to recycled packaging. After the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their engagement, they asked people who wanted to mark the occasion to donate to charities they had picked instead of giving them wedding gts. One of these charities included the Myna Mahila Foundation, which empowers women in Mumbai’s urban slums, by providing them with a trusted network, where they are supported professionally and personally to help them grow as iniduals and businesswomen. Thus Meghans Outland jeans reflect her desire to help vulnerable women which she has spoken so openly about. The vegan leather trainers  Meghan went comfy and casual as she donned white Veja V trainers while on a boat trip in Sydney during the Invictus Games. The trainers got everyone talking as they are environmentally friendly, and made from raw materials sourced from organic farming and ecological agriculture. Some of the shoes also use recycled plastic bottles and many have soles made from wild Amazonian rubber. The French fashion brands founders, Seacutebastien Kopp and Franccedilois-Ghislain Morillion visited clothing and food factories in South America, Asia and Australia while running a nonprofit group — and were appalled by what they saw. So in , they founded Veja in France with the vision of making trainers using the most ecological materials and ethical suppliers they could find. Fashion fans were delighted when they saw Meghan wearing a pair and the duchess is keen on environmental and conservation causes. The recycled plastic bottle pumps  Meghan wore Rothys flats twice on tour, including during a beach clean-up in Melbourne. The pumps are made from recycled plastic water bottles that would otherwise have been destined for landfill - and have been dubbed the most politically correct shoes on the planet by Vogue. The insoles on all of Rothy’s shoes contain recycled foam the rubber soles are made without environmentally stressful black carbon. The yarn comes from plastic and even the packaging’s made from post-consumer recycled materials. Meghan supports charity Surfers Against Sewage, which is a national marine conservation and campaigning charity. It inspires, unites and empowers communities to take action to protect oceans, beaches, waves and wildle. Hugo Tagholm, chief executive of the charity said: Our work as a national marine conservation charity empowers tens of thousands of volunteers annually to protect beaches for everyone. We are currently focused on tackling plastic pollution and this support will help us move towards our vision of Plastic Free Coastlines.” So it is very fitting Meghan wore the pumps during the beach visit - signalling her passion to protecting the sea from plastic. The sustainable brand  The Duchess of Sussex wore a stunning custom-made silk wool cocktail dress in dark navy by Gabriela Hearst at Government House in Wellington. The sustainable luxury brand is based on a less is more approach. Gabriela is a notable feminist designer and political activist. She wanted to create a brand that reflects a slower pace and process: where things are made with care and detail, where tradition is more important than trend, where there is a purpose to every piece, according to her website. She takes into consideration where materials come from and who is making them. Meghan wore the dress to deliver a speech to honor the th anniversary of female suffrage. The empowering dress  Meghan looked sensational when she wore a beautul white Theia dress for dinner with the King and Queen of Tonga. The label is inspired by the Greek Goddess Theia, who had an incredible power to turn everything that she gazed on to light. The Theia dresses are designed to make women feel confident – similar to Meghan’s beliefs. The website explains about their collection: Inspired by the Greek Goddess Theia, this evening wear, bridal and day dress collection was created to bring out every womans inner goddess. One of the original Titans, Theia, who ruled during the Greek Golden Age, possessed the incredible power of light which radiated from her sparkling eyes. All that she gazed upon glittered, becoming luminous and radiant. She imbued gold and silver with their shine. She gave diamonds their fire and rubies and emeralds their sparkle. Her three children Helios the sun, Celene the moon, and Eos the dawn, all continue to bring light in to the world everyday. The woman who wears Theia will be filled with confidence knowing her dress fits wonderfully and looks beautul on her, thus naturally allowing her inner goddess to shine.

Amaral claims Portuguese prosecutors felt ‘intimidated by the United Kingdom’ and claims the McCanns were given special treatment by British authorities because they were doctors. The ex-policeman refuted claims his officers’ probe was shoddy and says interference from the UK hindered the process.

The man came close to falling from a bridge over the M but was saved when an ambulance crew spotted him as they passed underneath it. Police arrived moments later, shut the motorway and spoke to the -year-old, who has asked not to be named, until he came down. He later went on social media and was shocked by some of the insensitive comments from drivers who were outraged over the traffic disruption and unconcerned about his well-being, he told the Manchester Evening News.  They included Just jump I need to get home, Make sure he gets carted away before I start work and Tell him to get a move on. The man was taken to hospital after he was talked down from the bridge but was left alone in a room and went back to the bridge just hours after. The same police officers brought him back down and stayed with him in the hospital room overnight.Months on, he said he feels awful that police officers were taken off the streets that night and that traffic disruption was caused by the incident. But some of the comments he saw on social media made him feel much worse. Now, he wants to appeal to social media users to think twice before making an off-hand comment - in a bid to raise awareness of the devastating consequences it could have.  He said: To those posting on social media, just think - you never know that could be your mum, or dad up there. Whatthat person looks at the article, reads all of these comments and then goes back out there  It a shame that society feels like that. There is still a lot of stigma about mens mental health and mental health in general. Last week I saw two friends and I was talking to them about when I came out of hospital. They were with a girl Id never met before and she said oh you are a psycho as well. Whatthat was somebody   It could go and set them back. I am thick-skinned, but when I see the comments made about other people I get upset about it. He also explains there is one phrase that he finds particularly damaging, often said to men in his situation. The man said: When it is men people say man-up. My girlfriend at the time kept saying that. It really grates, it hurts inside. It feels like my stomach drops, it makes you feel worse. As a man you are supposed to be one type, but I am a bit feminine - I like things tidy. Saying it to someone suffering from mental health doesnt help. Since he tried to take his own le the man has received treatment at a mental health unit and is now living in supported housing. During his first week out of the hospital he says support workers visited every day, but since then no-one has been to see him.  He was diagnosed with emotionally unstable personality disorder at a young age. Those with the disorder can experience very intense emotions, feel deeply about what others think and can behave impulsively. The man has been told by medics he needs to undergo intensive therapy, but it has never materialised. He said: I have never had therapy. I have spent six years waiting for it. There is that many people getting sectioned daily you just get lost in the system. There is no support, they wont help people until you are suicidal. I am on a mixture of tablets for my mental health and Codeine pain killers. Sometimes I am that knackered I dont go out a lot. I cant work. I was working before, full time. While theres been a lack of mental health services and support since, the dad is hugely grateful to the emergency services who attended the bridge that day. He credits the police officer who spoke to him, and the ambulance crew that first spotted him, with saving his le. The man said: If people hadnt come out I dont think I would be here. I am grateful, especially to the police woman that talked me down, who was really nice. She came back and got me again. She was really lovely, came to check on me as well after to seeI was alright. It couldve been a dferent storyit was a man, she was softly spoken and calmed me down. Its not the first time Ive attempted to take my le, but its the first time I have in three years. If you are going through same thing go and get help. But I know myself, its OK saying get help to others, but when you are in that mind frame you are not thinking about your children. All you think about is ending your le. With me it is emotional, I get angry, I dont feel sociable like everybody , making plans stresses me out. There needs to be more information out there, about what to do. Dont judge peopleyou put a comment up on something like that , think whatthat is your own kids  Elizabeth Simpson, Service Director at Manchester Mind, said: Not all suicides are mental health related but the vast majority are - and unfortunately situations like this show that there remains a lack of understanding about suicide. There is still a lot of stigma, but people in crisis need support and understanding, not judgement and impatience. “With one in every four people experiencing a mental health problem each year there has never been a greater need for services, and Manchester Mind’s vision is of a city that promotes good mental health and that treats people with mental health problems positively, fairly and with respect.

Lara Ollerhead piled on the pounds after having her children - Daniel,  and Sienna,  - and ballooned to a size  due to comfort eating. The -year-old says her expanding dress size restricted her from getting involved with family activities as she became out of breath from climbing just one flight of stairs. However, in March  the regional leader decided to make a change and joined Cambridge Weight Plan [CWP] and within eight months she had dropped down to st.  After losing a whopping st, Lara and her husband Simon Ollerhead, , renewed their wedding vows in August and she was able to wear a size  dress. Lara, from Cuddington, in Cheshire, said: “I was a bit of a comfort eater. Losing weight never really felt within my reach. I was just going to carry on le the same way. “I let my weight get away from me. It is shocking to think about the choices I made that I thought were alright and I know that they would have beenthey were in moderation. “I would start diets and just lose one or two pounds and think that it was never going to happen. “I think being told that as a child that we’ve got to clear our plates as a discipline from and that you have to finish, was ingrained into me. “I couldnt join in on the same things that my husband and children were doing. When they went to a trampoline park I would worry whether the trampoline could take my weight. It was embarrassing. “I would get out of breath after climbing one flight of stairs. I was so tired. My husband is very fit and healthy and the kids would ask why is mummy not coming  Your kids don’t understand.”  Lara, who previously weighed st lbs, completed Step  of CWP which involved having three of their products and one  calorie meals a day. After losing the majority of her weight, in October  Lara began Step  and had two of the CWP products a day along with a  calorie breakfast, a salad for lunch, a  calorie evening meal and ml of milk. Lara said: “When I joined CWP I realised that it could happen and you could do it in a controlled way. It taught me good habits and portion control. “There were normal people who had done it so I knew it was possible. “I feel like a completely dferent person and much more confident, you can’t buy this feeling. It has definitely changed my le. “I don’t worry about what people think and say anymore and I feel confident in my own skin. “I can also get more involved and go to the trampoline park and no longer get red-faced and out of breath. It is all of these little bits that the children are noticing.” Speaking of her vow renewal ceremony in Santorini Lara said: “The ceremony was incredible. It was the perfect setting and so relaxed. It was mazing to renew our vows as a family unit. “I felt a incredible in my dress and having the photos taken. I would have hated this and been reluctant to have had photos taken before”.  Lara said: “We had talked about renewing our vows with the children there but I didn’t think it could ever happen until I found CWP. “It was huge for us because I never thought I would have the confidence to do it. For the children to see us and commend us as a couple is incredible. “I wanted to be comfortable and I wanted to be able to get into a dress I always wanted to wear. He has never seen me this slim before and I wanted a really fitted dress. It was so exciting.” As well as renewing her vows, Lara also took on another challenge and climbed Snowdon, the highest mountain in Wales, with Simon in May  and completed it within three hours and  minutes. She also recently completed the National Three Peaks Challenge to raise funds for a local charity and to hopefully inspire others. Lara said: “It was tough going but not as tough as I thought it would be. He’s always wanted to experience climbing a mountain with me. I didn’t think I would ever have the fitness levels to do it. “Simon did the three peaks last year and I wanted to do it but I knew I wouldn’t be able to keep up with them. I wanted to prove that I could do it this time.  “I became really overcome with emotion when I could see the top but then I couldn’t catch my breath so I had to calm down. “It was the reality that I had conquered something that felt so far out of reach. We never imagined that I could do it and as fast. “I was so determined. I was actually running back down. It just seems mad but it felt brilliant. I am very impressed with myself.

But people wont realise exactly how true this is - as the two princes really are fulfilling a dream their mother had for them more than  years ago. In an interview with Martin Bashir for Panorama in , Diana spoke about her two boys and how she was raising them, in response to a question about whether the monarchy needs to adapt and change in order to survive. Diana replied: I understand that change is frightening for people, especiallytheres nothing to go to. Its best to stay where you are. I understand that. But I do think that there are a few things that could change, that would alleviate this doubt, and sometimes complicated relationship between monarchy and public. I think they could walk hand in hand, as opposed to be so distant.  When Bashir asked what Diana is doing to effect change in the monarchy, the princess responded by telling him how she was raising her young sons. She said: Well, with William and Harry, for instance, I take them round homelessness projects, Ive taken William and Harry to people dying of Aids - albeit I told them it was cancer - Ive taken the children to all sorts of areas where Im not sure anyone of that age in this family has been before. And they have a knowledge - they may never use it, but the seed is there, and I hope it will grow because knowledge is power.  Bashir replied: What are you hoping that that experience for your children - what impact that experience will have on your children  And Diana responded: I want them to have an understanding of peoples emotions, peoples insecurities, peoples distress, and peoples hopes and dreams.  Prince Harry has been praised on several occasions in his recent royal tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga. While climbing the Sydney Harbour Bridge, palace aides told him to move on from his conversation with a grieving woman - but Harry refused to do so.The Duke of Sussex had spent  minutes chatting to Gwen Cherne, whose husband committed suicide last year. When his staff tried to move him along to somebody , Gwen said Harry responded: Im in a middle of a conversation, and Im not going to leave this.  Gwen was joining Harry to kick off the Invictus Games - a competition he founded to help wounded military men and women. The Duke also makes regular visits to Lesotho, in Africa, where he first visited on his gap year and made a special connection with communities there.William, too, has been praised for his kindness and warmth towards the public, speaking to them as though they are old friends.Just a few weeks ago, while meeting young people at a Radio  Teen Awards reception in Kensington Palace, Will made them feel right at home.He told a teen who had been bullied for dancing: George is doing dancing as well, he loves it.My mother always used to dance. She loved dancing. Andit’s something you love, you do what you love. Don’t let anyone  tell you otherwise. Keep at it.”  The princes are also carrying on work their mother started.Prince Harry is patron of leading landmine charity The HALO trust, and William is president of the Royal Marsden Hospital - the same cancer institution his mother represented from  until her death in . Dianas visits to homeless charities obviously had a lasting effect on her boys. In  William slept rough on London streets in order to raise awareness of the issue.

Ross, , was joined for the final mile of his ,-mile journey by  other swimmers,  of whom had swum the English Channel. He did his last few strokes of front crawl before coming ashore where he had begun, in Margate, Kent. He said: “I had to put my goggles on. I was getting really emotional.  “I thought I was going to fall over. And then I started running – that was a mistake. I was really wobbly. “It feels a bit weird. Feels a bit too solid for my liking.” He left Margate on June  and then circumnavigated Britain by front crawl in a clockwise direction. He had expected it to take  days and told his family “sorry I’m late” as they greeted him alongside hundreds of others on the beach.

You won’t find many other sports where people will come out in November, at five o’clock in the morning, just to swim out for a mile. “That represented what I love about open water swimming. “Because I’ve had my face in the water for so long now I didn’t know – I thought it was just going to be my mum and my dad with a pizza.” He entered the Guinness Book of World Records on August , on day , for the longest staged sea swim.

The teenager was among five boys who targeted Janice as she sat on a park bench in Suffolk in what a court heard was a despicable attack.An image showing them smiling and pointing at their cowering victim sparked widespread revulsion after being posted on Snapchat and Facebook. Until this week, the boys - all between  and  years old at the time - had had their identities protected because of their age. But Semple turned  last week, meaning he could be unmasked for the first time. Speaking out yesterday, the teenager - who pleaded guilty to threatening behaviour - described how he has received death threats from strangers.He told Sun Online: I’m struggling to leave the house at the moment. Since those pictures have gone on Facebook, I’ve had death threats from random people. Askedhe wanted to apologise for the attack in Bury St Edmunds, he reportedly said he was not ready because of the death threats sent to him online.Semple and his friends faced online abuse and direct threats from people who were sickened by the picture after it was shared online. Yesterday, presiding magistrate Simon Islett told the younger members of the group they could have faced jail termsthey were a few years older. He described the incident as a despicable attack on a vulnerable woman and said it was “terrying” for the mum-of-one.Mr Islett told one boy: “She didn’t know what was going to happen or what the outcome was going to be.  You have got to put yourself in the victim’s place and consider your actions and the effect it might have on them.” Janice was sitting in a park when she was approached by Semple and the group. Ipswich Youth Court heard they began asking questions about drugs before one of the boys spat in her face.

Janice suffered no physical injuries but was left severely distressed by her ordeal. Semple, who admitted threatening behaviour, lives in Bury St Edmunds with his mum. The court heard since the incident he had received death threats, and felt remorseful and sorry for what happened. Declan Gallagher, defending Semple, said: He took the photograph and put it on his own Snapchat. One of his circle then took a screenshot of that, then it went onto Facebook, then it went beyond. He was released on bail, to be sentenced at an adult court on December . Four other boys, aged , ,  and , admitted the same offence yesterday and were sentenced to -month referral orders.

The window had also been blocked with a mattress and there were no lights. Ellie-Mays mum Lauren Coyle, , and her boyfriend Reece Hitchcott, , were cleared of manslaughter, the Liverpool Echo reported. After almost seven-and-a-half hours of deliberations, the jury found the pair guilty of causing or allowing her death, one count of child cruelty by caging the child in her bed, and another count of child cruelty by restraining her in the bed.  Their lodger, Connor Kirby, , of Liverpool, was found not guilty of all of the charges A post-mortem examination carried out by Dr Alison Armour, a Home Office consultant forensic pathologist, concluded the childs death was caused by forcible restraint by ligatures in a face-down position complicated by hyperthermia.

A ceremonial Beefeater guard began the lighting ceremony by bringing a flame down from the tower into the moat, which had been submerged in smoke. Dozens of representatives from the armed forces and volunteers then used the flame to ignite thousands of other torches staked into or placed on the ground underneath the tower, bathing the barren moat in light. Midshipman Balraj Dhanda of the Royal Navy, a volunteer who helped light the flames, described the spectacle as really, really powerful.  I think it creates the right atmosphere for people to have their own personal reflections and gives people time with their own thoughts, he added. It took around  minutes to light the flames, which then burn for roughly four hours. The ceremony was accompanied by a specially commissioned sound installation featuring choral music, as well as words from war poet Mary Bordens Sonnets To A Soldier. The ceremony was amazing, according to Dick Harrold, governor of the Tower of London.  He added: What is so special about it is it means many dferent things. The message with the sound is not focused so much on those that were lost, but those that were left behind, the bereaved and others who were affected by war. The success of the  display of poppies at the tower meant Historic Royal Palaces, who maintain the landmark, were keen to mark the centenary of Armistice. He added: But, of course, we couldnt do poppies again. Spectators gathered on vantage points around the tower to witness the spectacle.  A minutes silence was also observed. The ceremony, named Beyond The Deepening Shadow, will be repeated each night until the final showing on Remembrance Sunday. Members of the public can watch the spectacle for free.

There are lots of things he could be angry about with the people currently sitting above you – fraud, smears, lies, paedophiles, cock-ups, poor mathematics, migrant-bashing – but the thing he hates most of all is the Military Covenant. Not the idea of it, which is to ensure armed forces personnel suffer no disadvantage due to their service and sometimes get preferential treatment because of it. Nor the way it was enshrined in law in  amid much fanfare and the Prime Minister promising to “treat people with the dignity they deserve”. No, he’s angry about the fact that within a year of it being made law Parliament pissed on it. He’s angry that war veterans like him were made redundant just days before they qualied for a pension, while politicians facing reform to their own pensions could get a higher salary to make up for it. Hes angry that veterans who gave their lives and health - and in some cases that of their wives and children as well - have reasonable claims for recognition, supported by scientic research, litigated past the point of their own deaths to avoid a payout. Hes angry at the state of military housing, at the way his family after his redundancy have to go on a council waiting list, at howthey rent privately a grasping landlord will rack up the rent while housing benefit is cut and slashed as politicians call them scroungers. Hes angry about his mates killed for want of proper equipment, at a Prime Minister helping the private defence industry quite literally make a killing with state-funded trips to dictatorial regimes, and hes angry at mealy-mouthed letters from politicians thanking him for his service and telling him theres nothing they can do. As he talks you realise youre angry, too. Youre angry about paying for people on pound, a year to have an extra house, at jobs for their wives and children, at a mooted % pay rise they claim they can’t refuse from a pay body they set up themselves. Youre angry about their dodgy rental agreements, their non-existent mortgages, their invoices, their pitul excuses, at the physical evidence of these historic abuses being shredded on the basis they need their privacy protected. You’re angry about the fact it took two years of appalling allegations about paedophiles infecting almost every institution in British le – the BBC, the NHS, children’s homes, Parliament itself never mind your local kebab shop – before the Government was stirred into organising an inquiry. And then mis-organised it so badly the first two chairmen had to resign over connections to the very people they would have been inquiring into.   You dont like politicians pitting you against your neighbours and saying people who dont draw their curtains in the morning must be on benefits, rather than a night sht. Youre perplexed about new schools with teachers who dont need any qualications, about hospitals rewarded for letting people die, about a minimum wage which isnt enough to live on. You wonder about the worth of parliamentarians who tell the terminally ill to get up and work. You wonder how disabled people will have a better le without the allowances they need to pay for independent living. You question how your already-overworked GP and children’s teacher are going to fit any more hours in. You look at your local postmaster, corner shop owner, launderette, binman, cabbie, cleaner, nurse, teaching assistant, council operative and heaven knows who  and wonder how, precisely, we’d manage without migrants.

There was a manesto which offered you: “The direct power to recall MPs found guilty of wrongdoing without having to wait for a General Election… to cast a vote of no confidence in their elected representative and bring an end to the concept of the ‘safe seat’.” There was also a Coalition agreement promising an elected House of Lords,  open primaries, an end to parliamentary perks, recall, and constitutional reform which would give us “a new politics” we could be proud of. You think about the fact million people who could vote last time didn’t bother. You think about the fact million people have removed themselves from the electoral register since . You think about a House of Lords packed with donors and cronies, the holding of a mere  local primaries, perks that still include free snuff, a recall bill backed by a mere % of Tories, % of Labour and % of Lib Dems, and a politics that seems just as sleazy and corrupt as ever. You stand there, feeling angry, and think about how  years ago today a war veteran with  years fighting behind him who felt oppressed and angry about promises the rulers had broken stood in the undercroft of the Houses of Parliament with  barrels of gunpowder, some coal and firewood, and matches in his pocket. You think about how that veteran was seized and dragged before the king, how he and his fellow plotters were tortured with the rack and other instruments for ten weeks to produce confessions, and how after a show trial they were taken to the yard outside Parliament where the politicians could all watch as they were hung by the neck, cut down while still alive, castrated, disembowelled, and cut into pieces. Perhaps you know enough to remember that despite injuries so bad he could barely sign his own confession, Guy Fawkes was brave and quick enough to jump from the scaffold before the executioner could stop him, breaking his own neck and saving himself the extra agonies the state wanted to visit upon him. You wonder why we still celebrate the capture, torture and death of that man with a bonfire and fireworks, that it was laid down in law we had to do so whether we agreed or not and that it was used to persecute others who shared his faith. You wonder why we all forgot why he was so angry or that after he was gone the oppression for people like him simply got worse, and lasted for more than two centuries. Perhaps youd also wonder what wed do to that Afghanistan veteranhe was caught red-handed with his bomb under Parliament, and how it would compare to what we would dohe turned out to be a Muslim convert. You look over your shoulder at the door, and youre glad no-ones come along yet. Maybe you wish him luck, and tell him that as Fawkes said on the rack a desperate disease requires a dangerous remedy. Maybe you will try to talk him out of it, or go to find a policeman in the hope hell get help and the people who put themselves above will finally listen to those left below. Me, well I think Id quietly turn around, close the door, stick my elbow in the fire alarm and then let him get on with it.

She added: I dont claim the title of cougar because he came after me, with a vengeance.I thought I was just messing around with the neighbour kid when he went there and made it obvious he was interested in me.  Some people do assume that Im his mum but we both quickly let them know that we are together.We have been in funny situations because the people are so embarrassed, or they are just flat out rude and stop speaking to us after we say were together. Thats really their issue and not ours. Love is love. Love is hard enough to find without putting restrictions on it. At first it felt weird because I felt like everybody was judging me, but now we just go about our day and dont worry about it. A common misconception is our relationship is completely about sex. You dont stay together with someone for over seven years and it just be about sex. However, Cree does admit Aaron doesnt know what shes talking about with some references to s and s pop culture.  The YouTube star, who has also been in a long-term relationship with a woman  years younger than her, said: For instance, he didnt know who The Fonz was. He thought it was a band.We have a hard time making friendships because either the men or women we try to befriend hit on him or hit on me. They dont take our relationship seriously. Sometimes I will reference old sayings, I asked himhe enjoyed his time without his ball and chain when I went out for the day without him and he had to Google to see what I meant.  The couple secured their relationship in September last year at a handfasting ceremony, a romantic gesture at which hands are crossed or tied to symbolise love.

Mr Hutt told the NZ Herald: As he floated past I thought he was just a doll. So, I reached out and grabbed him by the arm even then I still thought it was just a doll. His face looked just like porcelain with his short hair wetted down, but then and he let out a little squeak and I thought oh God this is a baby and its alive.  Mum Jessica Whyte said it felt like a nightmare when she discovered her young son was missing and that her heart had stopped beating. She told Stuff that she was woken by the camp manager at Matata Beach to the news her son had been found floating in the sea. Whyte said the news dealt like a sick joke when she was told at .am on October  and it was horrible in between hearing that and seeing him.  I dont think my heart [beat] from hearing that to seeing him. I dont think my heart worked, she said. It was pure luck that Mr Hutt had been fishing there to save the boy. Usually he walks straight out to camp to fish from the beach, but on the day in question he decided to walk  metres to the left.  After ing to check his lines at .am, he saw the seemingly leless baby floating in the water. He was floating at a steady pace with a rip in the water. If I hadnt been there, orI had just been a minute later I wouldnt have seen him, said Hutt. He was bloody lucky, but he just wasnt meant to go it wasnt his time. Rebecca Salter, the co-owner of Murphys Holiday Camp told the BBC: Apparently the baby had been very excited to be on the beach. It was the couples first night staying here. Its the first time theyve been here. Hutt, who is a fisherman and one of our regulars, spotted the baby.

There is no provision for it to be simply opened. There’s a clear way we can resolve this matter through a iation and we’ve been pursuing that for a considerable period of time now.”When asked why the contractor was reluctant to make the changes to the contract, Mr Matheson said: “That’s a question which you will need to put to them.”Throughout the duration of the project, contractors have refused to comment directly to the press due to the “partnering nature” of the project, with all requests instead being put to the government agency Transport Scotland.When pressed on a definitive opening date, Mr Matheson said they couldn’t be “firm” about the time frame but said contractors believe the whole route could be open by December, adding that would “hopefully” be the case. He said: “At this stage it is dependent on a number of factors. The weather could have an impact.”He told MSPs that the Scottish Government’s “primary responsibility” must be to ensure these works are completed safely to the required quality standards.He added the River Don Crossing section would not open until Transport Scotland officials were confident this is the case, with the contractor working hard to repair the defects and ARL working to identy a new date for when the bridge will be ready."},{"url":null,"title":"broch batter inverurie with perfect play in league rout","story":"Paul Young felt Fraserburgh’s - thrashing of Inverurie Locos was the perfect performance.The Broch were emphatic winners at Harlaw Park on Saturday, with the win keeping them two points behind Highland League leaders Cove in second place.Midfielder Young was among the scorers and was delighted with the Buchan team’s display.He said: “From the first minute we controlled it. We had a dficult game at Harlaw Park in the Scottish Cup, when we were - up and let them back in.“But on Saturday we didn’t look back after being - up at half-time.“It was a great result and we know what Locos are like, they are a good technical side. They were missing players, but we had to play to a high standard.“We’ve been on an unbeaten run the last few weeks, but we haven’t played as well as we can do. We have kept grinding out results.“As long as we do that then we are happy and on Saturday it was just about the perfect performance.“We started off the game well and kept it going throughout, unlike previous occasions where we have let teams back in.”Fraserburgh manager Mark Cowie said: “I gave the guys a hard time last Wednesday after our - win over Turrf because I didn’t think it was good enough.“But Saturday was as close as you can get to a flawless performance. Normally we are on top in a lot of games, but there is always a mistake in us or lack of concentration lets us down.“But to a man they were unbelieveable. We broke at pace, we were clinical, we were fitter and stronger than them – I couldn’t fault us.“To go and dominate Locos at home you have to be happy with that. Up front we had every avenue covered, we had pace, aerial threat and we could hold it up.“We’ve shown what we can do and now we have to take that forward, we’ve set the standard for how we can play and I expect that every game.”The opener came for the Broch on  minutes. Willie West outjumped Stuart Duff in the centre circle after Andy Reid’s clearance was held up in the wind.West’s header sent Scott BARBOUR in behind and the attacker got into the box before turning inside Ryan Broadhurst and finishing from  yards.A minute later Barbour almost made it two as he cut in from the right of the area, but his low shot hit the base of the right post.At the other end, Colin Charlesworth headed a Jordan Leyden corner from the right narrowly over.On  minutes it was - when Ryan Cowie’s long ball put Paul CAMPBELL in the clear down the left and the striker slipped the ball past Reid from  yards.Six minutes into the second half, victory was sealed for Fraserburgh when Lewis Davidson’s low cross from the right ran through to YOUNG at the back post and he finished from six yards.On  minutes it was -. Leyden had blocked sub Sean Butcher’s header at point-blank range, Ryan Cowie took the resulting corner on the right and it was volleyed home from inside the six-yard box by Bryan HAY.With  minutes left the Broch scored their fth. Butcher crossed from the right, sub Greg Buchan’s header was blocked, but it broke to CAMPBELL to force home the rebound from close range.Inverurie boss Neil Cooper said: “They thoroughly deserved to win. They were a lot stronger than us and we defended poorly.“In the first half the two goals we lost were balls down the middle and it was basic schoolboy stuff. One centre-back should attack the ball and the other drop, but that didn’t happen.“If we’d got the next goal we were still in it, but we lost another poor goal when they broke on us.

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

The text was taken from a th century poet yet the music was modern and fresh. After three Spanish songs by Joaquin Rodrigo during which the audience was told stories of a youthful girl’s wish to be picked as a companion for the king and a miller#s we staying true to her husband although her offer may be tempting, the two performed three of Granados  Tondillas. This was followed by a sentimental and personal depiction of Spain in Granados ‘Dance Española’s No.’ played by Sasha Savolini.McNeill and her partner finished with two Spanish songs by Turina, the first being an earthy and dramatic prayer to the virgin of hope and the second a feisty scorned woman with underlaying tones of sadness. Yet the audience was surprised to an encore of a beautully soft rendition ‘St Columba’s Prayer’.This was an entertaining afternoon enjoyed by everyone in Ardrishaig Public Hall."},{"url":null,"title":"etive tests loch fyne anglers","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowLoch Fyne Sea Angling Club held its annual #blind pairs# competition out of Airds Bay on Loch Etive recently in testing conditions.The strong wind and heavy rain made it a dficult day for the anglers, but they made the best of it fishing from the small self drive boats.Loch Etive produced the usual species of spurs, whiting and dogfish with a total of  fish caught and ed.

And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13513457.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Silverburn.jpg","title":"big changes set stagecoach bus","story":"NewsBig changes set for Stagecoach bus timetables in Ayrshire as operator ditches Silverburn serviceOperator Stagecoach said new timetables would \"better reflect our customers travel habits\".ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT NewsStagecoachs Ayr base \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSweeping changes are planned for the Stagecoach bus network - and the direct shoppers express to the Silverburn mall is to be put off the road due to lack of trade. Stagecoach insist they have to keep developing the Ayrshire network and fish where the passengers are. And they say: “These changes better reflect our customers travel habits. “A number of these changes will deliver improvements in reliability and frequency, while others will offer a service proportionate to demand.” The switches in service are planned to begin operating in January. The changes were discussed by the Ayrshire Bus Users Group in Troon on Saturday. Watchers are particularly interested in the failed route which served the Silverburn mall in Pollok at weekends. It was launched exactly two years ago with the now departed managing director Tom Bridge crowing: “Shopping habits are changing from traditional high streets.” Ayrshire traders, however, deemed it a slap in the face. But of the X from Ayr, Prestwick and Kilmarnock to Silverburn, they now admit: “Our plan is to remove this service due to very low passenger numbers.”  Stagecoach’s Ayr HQ is wanting passenger feedback on the plans and staged an information day at Ayr Town Hall on Monday. Travellers are now likely to get back their direct Ayr to Irvine number  route via Troon. The last change the company made was to introduce a A which will be scrapped. But this will only be every  minutes. The new  route will take in Barassie, Monkton and Loans. That means Loans will no longer get the  coaster which had erted through the Main Street off the A. Belmont would no longer get the number six which was every  minutes. Instead it will get the number seven every  minutes - andpassenger numbers dont improve it may also be culled. The number two will pull out of Dalmilling and Hayhill, with the areas served by the number one and three. Stagecoach want to sht the X to Hamilton from Ayr away from Prestwick and take it up Whitletts Road. The number  from Ayr to Muirkirk will lose some early and late night services due to some routes shting via the Cumnock depot. The busy X from Ayr to Glasgow is to get extra capacity. The company want new departures from Ayr at .am, .pm, .pm, .pm, .pm. Extra s would be .am, .am, .am, .pm and the .pm to Doonfoot.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnGlasgowAyrKilmarnockTroonPrestwickCumnockAyr NewsStagecoach"},{"url":null,"title":"calls find money build new","story":"NewsCalls to find money to build a new community hub to replace John Pollock CentrePopular facility described as \"not fit for purpose\"ShareByGary Fanning:,  NOV NewsJohn Pollock Centre, South Ayrshire Council.\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCalls have been made to find cash to build a new community hub for people in the north of Ayr. The plea comes as the John Pollock Centre, which has been described as “unfit for purpose”, is facing an uncertain future. And it is feared that the Mainholm Road facility may only have a year left before it is closed. The issue was raised at this month’s North Ayr Community Council that was attended by councillors Ian Cavana and Ian Davis and senior council officer Mark Baker. Robert Green, secretary of the community, insisted there was a desperate need for a community hub in the north of Ayr. And he asked: “Can councillors tell me about the John Pollock Centre being bulldozed ” Tory councillor Ian Davis replied: “I don’t think there is much we can say.” Mr Green added: “How can you guide the community council to get funds for a community hub  “It could be on similar lines as the new one in Maybole.” Mr Baker said a few community groups in the area had been raising the same issue. He revealed that there were a few options to consider but the council would need to engage with the community first. “We need to find out what spaces and places are available and what is required,” he added. “We need to get groups together to find what the solution is.” Mr Green said his preferred option would be to build a new facility in the existing grounds of the John Pollock Centre and that would be an ideal location for people living in Lochside, Dalmilling, Whitletts and Craigie. Labour councillor Ian Cavana said the John Pollock Centre was given a “state of execution” after council’s plans for moving local authority workers into the proposed controversial Riverside development was axed in the summer. “This time next year the John Pollock Centre would really be under pressure,” he declared. “I would love to see a new complex built to the right of the existing John Pollock Centre.” The community council heard that the John Pollock Centre is a well-used community facility for groups including line dancing, netball, keep fit, bingo and other activities. Councillor Cavana added: “It is the hub of the community. But it needs a new build. There is no definite plan just now but time is ticking. “The building is not fit for modern days.” Mr Green asked for the council’s help to access funds to build a new community hub.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartyAyrSouth Ayrshire Council"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13489965.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18066403.jpg","title":"partick thistle 0 ayr united","story":"NewsPartick Thistle , Ayr United  - Three things we learned at FirhillA Michael Rose header secured all three points for United in Glasgow as Ian McCalls men kept up their remarkable title challenge.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsMichael Roses header crosses the line to hand Ayr victory \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr Uniteds title bandwaggon kept on rolling in Glasgow as Michael Roses second half header earned a deserved three points for the visitors.

The former Aberdeen man has formed an impressive defensive partnership with Jamie Adams - and once again the pair were fantastic at Firhill. But Rose proved his threat in the opposition box when rising to bullet home Declan McDaids corner, coming as it did at the end of concerted Ayr pressure. Rose looks to have a bright future in the game and he deservedly gains the headlines today.  Whistler Bobby sends Ayr raving Madden - AGAIN It would be fair to say Ayr boss Ian McCall and ref Bobby Madden arent the greatest of pals. McCall made his feelings on the whistler well known after Ayrs trip to Ibrox earlier this season - and United were on the end of a string of hotly disputed calls here. Madden waved away two first half penalty shouts and angered Ayr with a number of other baffling calls which threatened to send the game past boiling point in the second half.  McCall wins battle of the bosses On a day when all eyes were on the Thistle dugout and Gary Caldwell making his home debut, Ian McCall made yet another triumphantto his old stomping ground. Ayrs wily gaffer made two big calls in starting Craig Moore and Declan McDaid and his men responded in style with another fine performance. McCall is not afraid of the big decisions and appears to be juggling his squad to perfection at the moment, as proven by this display where his team selection and tactics proved spot on.

versatile Anne played Rosemary by Frank Bridge on piano next-quite beautully-this surely must have been a piece about the love of his le.Dick then brought out the bass clarinet and introduced his own compositions - Pontefiore and Tarantella.Pontefiore was composed for a stage production set in the South of Italy in which a Private Angelo finds a little peace amongst the conflict of war.Tarantella is a   time dance which victims dance when bitten by a tarantula!Then it was time for the interval and for Anne and Dick to enjoy a well earned brew.After the tea break the audience were introduced to the saxophone and it was explained that it was invented by Adolf Sax and fully intended to be a very loud marching band instrument.Peqena Czarda by Pedro Iturralde showcased the saxophone wonderfully with its hints of Spanish Tango. Lover Man - a sultry nocturne followed made famous by pianist and composer Ram Ramirez.Then it was time for another of Dicks own compositions on the bass clarinet.In Blues for Jimmy the scene was set in the deep South of America from around  with the deep tones of the bass clarinet echoing the African American blues.A tongue in cheek Stranger on the Shore came next complete with seagulls. Acker Bilk originally composed it as a lullaby for his daughter before being tempted commercially to change its name.My personal highlight of the evening was Lady be Good by George Gershwin - Anne on piano and Dick on clarinet played with verve and swing.Body and Soul by Green and made famous by Colman Hawkins was just that! Jumpinrsquo at the Woodside by Count Basie did indeed jump!The final treat of the evening was Henry Mancinirsquos Pink Panther.Dick wondered whether there was any need for him to work again after composing this particular piece.Next months concert is on Sunday, November  at . pm.

The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness.

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

It had its own castle. It was leased from the local king who once a year would turn up to collect his commission dressed in a kilt. Isatu Smith, the head of museums and relics in Sierra Leone, describes how the Scottish slavers even built their own golf course on the island and dressed their slave caddies in tartan so they could be reminded of home. \"They were serving Scottish masters, so they had to look the part,\" Smith says. \"We have a shared history. It is very important that the Scottish people know about this ndash whether they accept it or not is another question.\"This week, Scotland will finally learn of the horrors of Bunce Island and be confronted by its forgotten role in the slave trade. David Hayman, the Scottish actor and director, has produced a new two-part documentary which begins on Tuesday night. In it, Hayman, through interviews with experts like Smith, lays bare just how central a role Scotland played in the slave trade.The country was \"up to its armpits in slavery\", Hayman says, even though the nation has always presented itself not just as having little to do with the trade in human lives, but also a country which was a leading light when it came to abolition. It is a  history and one that Hayman is hell bent on correcting.Scottish slavers ran Bunce Island from  to . They imported ice from Europe to keep food and wine cool in larders and enjoyed strolls in a private garden just metres away from pens where hundreds of human beings were kept like cattle before making the deadly Atlantic crossing. An estimated  per cent of slaves died on the journey. Eric Graham, a maritime historian, says that the dead were thrown overboard every morning. \"All slave ships were followed by sharks,\" he says. \"There was a dinner every day for the sharks.\"The Atlantic slave trade saw goods from Britain ndash pots and pans, beads, alcohol, pipes, guns, knives, and cloth ndash traded for human beings in Africa. These slaves were then sold in America. The American cash was used to buy tobacco, sugar, cotton, rum and indigo which were then brought back to Britain. It was a trade that made merchants into millionaires.Scotland in the th century was built on slavery. The Merchant City in Glasgow would not exist without the money that poured into the coffers of tobacco lords and cotton kings ndash who now have city streets named after them. These men were made rich beyond their wildest dreams by the profits of slavery. For the human beings traded as slaves existence was a living hell. Rape, murder, torture, abuse, humiliation and degradation almost beyond imagination, were the stuff of daily le. At least  million slaves survived being shipped across the Atlantic ndash with around .m bought and sold by British slavers, among whom Scots stood out as the most efficient and enterprising.Celeste-Marie Bernier, professor of Black Studies at Edinburgh University, says: \"Slavery bleeds in every building, in every brick, in every town across Scotland.\"According to Hayman: \"Scotlandrsquos involvement in the slave trade is a story of uncomfortable truths over how we see ourselves and perhaps that is why it has been forgotten. It challenges the notion that we are all Jock Tamsonrsquos bairns. Scots were plantation owners, slave owners, merchant ship owners. The profits fired Scotlandrsquos industrial growth and in every city in our nation you will find civic buildings and private homes built from the profits of slavery ndash bricks drenched in blood.\"There is now a growing campaign to, as Hayman puts it, \"acknowledge our past\" with an apology and reparations. There is also a campaign to establish a museum to slavery in Scotland, and for memorials and plaques to go up across the country on statues, streets and homes linked to slavery ndash such as the Gallery of Modern Art in Glasgow which was once the mansion of tobacco lord William Cunningham, a man made rich on the backs of slaves in the Americas.Scotland: a canny wee nation when it comes to rememberingProfessor Sir Tom Devine, the nationrsquos leading historian, says the scale of Scotlandrsquos involvement in the slave trade is \"truly mind boggling\". He believes historians have a \"sacred duty\" to tell the truth about it, just as they have with \"that other horror, the Holocaust\".Adebusola Debora Ramsay, of the Glasgow Slavery Legacy Tour which takes visitors around sites in the city linked to the trade, says that whenever the history of slavery is discussed in Scotland the nation appears to suffer from a \"collective amnesia\".Poet Jackie Kay, Scotlandrsquos Makar and a woman of Nigerian descent, once said: \"Scotland is a canny wee nation when it comes to remembering and forgetting. The plantation owner never wears a kilt and Glasgow does not readily admit its history in a way that other cities have done.\" Liverpool has built a museum to its role in the slave trade and Bristol is in the middle of a long debate over what to do about statues to wealthy slavers in the city.Dr Stephen Mullen, an historian and author of the book \"It Wisnae Us\" about Scotlandrsquos role, says Scots view slavery as a \"peculiarly English problem\", adding: \"Scots have got off the hook.\" Slavery trickled down into every part of Scottish le ndash from the docker who brought sugar into the city, to the grocer who sold it, and the families who bought it to sweeten their tea. One major export from Scotland to the Americas was \"slave cloth\" to make cheap clothes for Africans on plantations. Salted herring from the Highlands had its main market in the islands of the West Indies as food for slaves.The Jamaican-born scientist Sir Geoff Palmer, Professor Emeritus of Le Sciences at Heriot-Watt University, saysBannockburn is in the history books, then slavery should be there as well. Scottish academic Michael Morris, an expert in slavery at Liverpool John Moores University, adds: \"Scots like to promote themselves as part of the civilising mission of the British empire, so we glory iniduals like David Livingstone, and we would prefer to talk about our role in abolition rather than our role in chattel slavery.\"Chris Dolan, the Scottish playwright who wrote an acclaimed novel about the slave trade called Redlegs, believes \"we managed to forget about slavery for an awful long time. Now that we are waking up to the part we did play, it is very dficult for us as we have this mythology we tell ourselves that we are less racist people than other European nations, specically England. That is not true. Therefore to wake up and find we are involved in slavery as much as other parts of Europe is dficult.\"As David Alston, an historian who is now chair of the board of NHS Highland, sees it Scotlandrsquos own historic grievances hold us back when it comes to confronting the past ndash specically events such as the Highland Clearances. \"We want to tell ourselves a story that in the Highlands we were victims,\" he says, \"butyou want to portray yourself as a victim the last thing you want to do is be the victimiser.\"In Jamaica there are thousands of Campbells named after the Scots who owned their ancestorsOne need only look through the records of wealthy Scots to find clues which were always staring us in the face over our shameful past. Just look at the ledgers of Sir Robert Cunningham, a slave owner on St Kitts. In a record from  he lists his horses ndash Jack, Beauty, Trooper, Duke ndash and a few pages later, his slaves: Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Whisky, a blacksmith aged  and worth pound.One of the reasons that it has become easy to forget the past is that we helped destroy it. When Sierra Leone achieved its independence in the s, the departing British took all records of slavery with them.Joannes Caulker, an historic archivist in Freetown, says: \"We lost our history. They only let us know what they wanted us to know.\" Joe Alie, Professor of History at Sierra Leone University, is clear that his country is still paying the price of slavery. Millions of young men and women were taken away, robbing the country of human potential, and forced to slave for white masters. \"While we lost, they gained,\" Alie says. He speaks of an inferiority complex in nations subjected to slavery. \"We were dehumanised during the slave trade era ndash that is a lasting legacy.\"Hayman also journeyed to Jamaica with Graham Campbell, a well known figure in Glasgow with his rasta dreadlocks, and now an SNP councillor in the city. Speaking of the rape of African women by white masters he says that is what \"created people with Scottish names like me\".In the Jamaican phone book there are literally thousands of Campbells ndash page after page of them ndash all named after the plantation owner who once bought their ancestors. The book is also full of Mackenzies, Macleans, McLeods and McPhersons. Scotland and its trade in slaves shaped the modern island. \"I have this name because you were over there,\" says Campbell. \"I am the descendant of survivors.\"On Jamaica there stands a plantation once run by the Stirling Maxwell family, who owned Pollok House in Glasgow, now a national treasure. The plantation was called Hampden. It had more than  slaves. The national costume of Jamaica, the quadrille dress, is tartan. The St Andrewrsquos Cross is in the Jamaican flag. The dock in Jamaica where barely alive slaves were taken from ships before being washed, oiled, shaved and given rum so they would appear in good health for the slave market is called Farquharsonrsquos Wharf ndash it was run by Scots.Further south, in British Guyana, a run of coastal towns is testament to how entrenched Scots were in the slave trade there. The towns all have highland names ndash Belladrum, Cromarty, Dingwall, Dunrobin, Golspie, Inverness. The list goes on and on.A legacy in blood, bricks and mortar: Scotlandrsquos shrines to ill-gotten wealthBack across the sea in Ayrshire, the stately home of Auchincruive stands as a \"colossal shrine to ill gotten wealth\", says Hayman. The house was built by Richard Oswald, a merchant slave trader who was an investor in Bunce Island. Oswald owned four plantations in the Caribbean and left a fortune worth poundm.In Clarkston, on the outskirts of Glasgow, stands another National Trust of Scotland jewel, Greenbank Gardens, once owned by Robert Allason. He and his two brothers had the slave trade sown up. Goods would go from Robert in Glasgow to a brother in Africa to be exchanged for slaves, and then another brother with a plantation in Virginia would pick up the slaves and send tobacco back to Scotland. It was a money machine, with human lives oiling the engines.One of Scotlandrsquos most powerful slavers was John Gladstone of Leith ndash the father of William Gladstone who became one of Britainrsquos most famous prime ministers. When Britain finally abolished slavery in  slave owners received millions in compensation which they went on to invest in industries like banking, mills, mining, and railways. John Gladstone had  slaves for which he was paid a sum worth poundm in todayrsquos money.Jean Francois Manicom, curator of Liverpoolrsquos International Slavery Museum, tells a story of an anonymous donor from Edinburgh, who he describes as a Scottish superhero. Once every fortnight the donor posts a Scottish ten pound note to the museum with an apology on behalf of the nation. \"This is very symbolic,\" says Manicom, \"a very powerful story of reparation.\"Another Liverpool historian, Lawrence Westgaph, himself a descendant of slaves and slave traders, believes that the racism which blights the UK today has its roots in the slave trade. \"Racism comes down to the idea that some people are less human than others and slavery helped cody that. What I see today is that anti-black racism has its origins in the slave trade.rsquo\" Confronting the past, helps draw the poison.How does Scotland confront its past  Apology  Reparations  A memorial So how does Scotland deal with the dreadful legacy of slavery  Historian David Alston says, \"acknowledging the past is the first step ndash it is only after that can you get on to the questions of reparations\". Geoff Palmer says that what would repair the wrongs of the past is a \"country which is wealthier contributing to a country that helped make that wealth\".So apology and then some form of compensation are now coming front and centre among those thinking about how Scotlandrsquos deals with its past. Graham Campbell wants to see schools and colleges in Scotland and Jamaica link up through student exchanges, for business connections to be forged ndash real concrete steps that will help improve education and lives in Jamaica, a country still living with the effects of slavery nearly  years after abolition.For Hayman there is no going back and no hiding place. \"We rewrote history to make ourselves look the good guys for abolishing slavery while blaming everyone  ndash well now is the time for truth.\"He adds, \"I like to think I live in a modern Scotland that is open-minded, free-thinking, liberal, tolerant, warm and friendly. Scots are loved the world over, but less than five generations ago our ancestors helped create and sustain crimes against humanity on an industrial scale simply to get stinking rich. This is an uncomfortable truth, but hopefully we can now find the courage and dignity to say we are sorry.\"Slavery: Scotlandrsquos hidden shame begins at pm on BBC  on Tuesday, November "},{"url":null,"title":"slavery-museum-to-be-set-up-in-glasgow","story":"Council leader Susan Aitken said they were poised to make an announcement in the near future about a \"comprehensive piece of work\" that would be regarded as a \"brave thing to have undertaken.\"It is understood that the Gallery of Modern Art in the city has been named as a possible site for a new museum commemorating Scotlandrsquos role in the Slave Trade.Glasgow City Council supports the idea of a museum to slavery ndash although not a specic location. It is understood that the council is on the cusp of taking action.The campaign for Scotland to acknowledge its role in the slave trade will heat up this week as a new two-part documentary, Slavery: Scotlandrsquos Hidden Shame, begins on BBC  on Tuesday night.Campaigners want to see Scotland apologise for its role in the slave trade, and for there to be some form of reparations to counties such as Sierra Leone, from where many slaves were taken, and Jamaica where many captives were sent to work. Millions died as a result of the slave trade, and it is seen as one of the worst crimes against humanity in history.As well as a museum of slavery, campaigners want plaques erected at statues and on streets connected to slavery. Many streets in Glasgows city centre are named after businessmen involved in the slave trade.The ramping up of the campaign for some form of \"reparative justice\" from Scotland came as one of Jamaicarsquos leading voices, the journalist and broadcaster Earl Moxam, warned that Jamaica and other Caribbean nations would likely seek reparation from Scotland in the event of independence.Speaking in the new documentary, produced by actor and director David Hayman, Moxam said the Scottish Government ldquoought to be aware ... thatit were to go the route of independence then I would expect that Jamaica and the rest of the Caribbean would make a direct appeal for reparations formally to Scotland, to the independent Scottish government.Graham Campbell, an SNP councillor in Glasgow who is descended from slaves in Jamaica, is one of the leading voices campaigning for Scotland to make amends for its past role, and for the establishment of a museum of slavery. He said the museum should be at GoMA given the buildingrsquos past links to the trade. \"That is the obvious place,\" he said, adding: \"The city must make a gesture.\"Campbell also raised the question of whether streets in Glasgow named after merchants involved in the slave trade should be renamed.Hayman said: \"The first thing we have to do is apologise. The Scottish Government can say as a nation that we are deeply sorry for the horror we created  years ago ndash there is nothing wrong in saying sorry.\"Hayman also suggested a statue or memorial to the victims of slavery should also erected in Glasgow. He also supports the idea of twinning towns and cities in Scotland with places in Africa and the Caribbean where Scots were involved in slavery.Zandra Yeaman of the Coalition for Racial Equality and Rights , which is also campaigning for a museum of slavery, said there was a ldquogrowing recognition of the need to represent the realities of empire, colonialism, slavery and migration within mainstream heritage and history.She added that ldquocities like Liverpool, London and Bristol have found a way to address this through dedicated spaces ndash museums, archives and learning centres. We think itrsquos time Scotland had a space to fulfil this need.The campaign for Scotland to make amends for the past has gained added impetus following the decision by Glasgow University to publish a report into its own historic links to the slave trade. The university won praise for admitting it had ldquoreceived signicant financial support from people whose wealth at least in part derived from slavery in the th and th centuries.Equalities minister Christina McKelvie said the Scottish Government wants to ldquoconsider how we can reflect on Scotlandrsquos role in the slave trade."},{"url":null,"title":"saving-aviemore-community-buyout-plan-for-cairngorm-mountain-resort","story":"In a race to prevent the resort ndash and the neighbouring town of Aviemore ndash collapsing into terminal decline, local people and politicians are mobilising.Scotlandrsquos largest and potentially most complex community buyout is being compiled in a bid to create a new, all-year-round attraction. The plans, by the Aviemore and Glenmore Community Trust, include building a network of summer mountain bike trails, an Alpine bobsleigh-style coaster, an education centre, and a self-sufficient hydro electric scheme.But, most importantly, it is a way for the community to protect its livelihood amid mounting concerns over the future of the Highlands and Islands Enterprise-owned ski and snowboard resort, which has seen years of falling market share, and accusations of poor management and lack of investment.The resortrsquos prospects for this winter have been dealt a major blow with confirmation that the pound. million funicular railway, which transports visitors from car park to upper slopes, is out of action amid safety concerns for the structure.The funicular railwayrsquos foundations are being inspected by specialist engineers who are due to report on its future next month. However, by then the winter weather is expected to make signicant repair work unlikely until next spring.Concerns over the railwayrsquos future and the impact on snow sports enthusiasts who have already bought   season tickets follows the dismantling of the resortrsquos chairlts last autumn. That move sparked fury among snow sports enthusiasts and raised further questions over the management of the area at a time when rival centres appear to be flourishing.If it was to go ahead, a community buyout would dwarf other land-grab projects in terms of scale and potential financial implications.While numbers visiting Cairngorm for snow sports have fallen, with the resortrsquos market share sliding from . per cent in  to . per cent last year, a buoyant winter season of skiing and snowboarding is estimated to be worth pound million to the Speyside economy.Community buyout campaigners say questions over the funicular railway ndash essential for transporting learner skiers and snowboarders to upper levels ndash plus a surprise decision by the HIE-appointed resort operator, Cheshire-based Natural Retreats, to close its ski school operation for the season, has brought the future of the mountain to a crossroads.Aviemore and Glenmore Community Trust director Mike Dearman said: ldquoThe operatorsrsquo announcement not to operate a ski school seems to say that they have no faith in their own ability to run skiing on the mountain.ldquoPeople are worried, but in some ways it has galvanised them. We believe therersquos a positive future for Cairngorm snow sports, and some relatively small investment could move it forwards.The buyout proposals suggest AGCT could take over ownership of the land and assets from HIE, and inherit the -year lease deal with Natural Retreats. The community trust would then work with the operator to seek fresh funding streams, allowing HIE to revert to its traditional role of supporting the business and sustainable development.It suggests an pound, investment in hydro-electric schemes at Coire Cas and Coire na Ciste which would provide an income stream plus power lts and snow-making equipment.A poundm snow factory would produce cover for lower slopes, while km of mountain bike trails and a year-round Alpine coaster ndash a winding track which would carry thrillseekers down the mountainside ndash would attract summer visitors, bringing much-needed investment and seasonal work.Drew Hendry, MP for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, said he would be ldquodelighteda community buyout were to proceed.ldquoThere needs to be a change, he said. ldquoNatural Retreats has lost the confidence of local people. Communication with the public has been awful. They have shown an inability to engage properly and there has been an unacceptable sequence of events from the closing of the ski school to a lack of information of the problems affecting the funicular.ldquoI would be delighted[the buyout] was brought forward in a desirable timescale. However, we need action now and the community proposal would take some time to get together.He added: ldquoIrsquove contacted [Rural Economy Secretary] Fergus Ewing, and I am asking HIE and Natural Retreats to get around the table to sort something out. We canrsquot go through another season where we have got skiers in other resorts and not coming to Cairngorm.Kate Forbes, MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, said: ldquoThe situation with the funicular has brought things to a head and prompted a lot of concerns. The conversation over who runs the mountain has gone on for over two years. While there is a community proposal, itrsquos one thing saying the current operators are not good enough, and another to come up with an alternative.Campaigners anxious to secure the future of snow sports in the area believe the time is right for the buyout.Alan Brattey, of Aviemore Business Association, said: ldquoI have no doubt that the Cairngorm mountain business will come to local businesses and the AGCT to manage. The plans they have are substantial and will drive forward the need for radical change.Questions have been raised over whether the funicular railway can be repaired and,so, whether the repairs will enable the facility to run reliably for many years to come.Susan Smith, business development manager at HIE, defended the management of the snow sport facility.She said: ldquoItrsquos been hard for the operator in many ways because there was a signicant requirement initially to understand the mountain environment and business opportunity. Running a mountain business is tough and complex and requires signicant amount of resources to get it right. We understand the frustration of the community.Smith added that the issues affecting the funicular railway were not foreseen. ldquoThis came up under a routine inspection. Itrsquos a complex engineering structure and specialist bridge engineers need to look at it.ldquoHealth and safety is paramount."},{"url":null,"title":"from-scots-chamonix-to-community-on-its-knees-the-race-to-save-cairngorm-mountain-and-aviemore","story":"For hardy Scots skiers keen to feel the mountain breeze ndash evenit did sometimes result in being blown off course by gale-force winds or skiing blind through pea-soup fog, all roads led north on the A to Aviemore.Convoys of weekend skiers climbed the winding road through Rothiemurchus estate and past Loch Morlich skis which had been hired or serviced at the bustling Ski Shack in the town centre were strapped to roof racks and an apregraves ski session planned for the Cairngorm Hotel, Skiing Doo or the Red McGregor.They found runs capable of challenging experts and, in the Ptarmigan Bowl, a wide basin of soft snow and gentle slopes which, thanks to the introduction of the pound. million funicular railway in , meant beginners could find their ski legs while savouring the postcard scenery of the valley below.Today, however, storm clouds are gathering over the mountain and what was once Scotlandrsquos premier ski resort. Businesses and locals who rely on it for their livelihoods are asking serious questions over how the snow sport centre is operated and its ability to continue to attract winter tourists.Concern had been already mounting over a recent slump in skier and snowboarder numbers which have seen the resort slip behind its rivals.A controversial decision last year to dismantle the mothballed Coire na Ciste and West Wall chairlts enraged mountain enthusiasts who had already expressed doubts over mountain owner Highlands and Island Enterprise and Cairngorm Mountain operator Natural Retreatsrsquo investment plans.Now technical problems affecting the funicular ndash the only route up for non-skiers and beginners ndash mean it is almost certain not to run this winter.For experienced skiers and snowboarders who do make the journey to Cairngorm, it means they are likely to face long queues for the T-bar and poma tows. Itrsquos even bleaker for beginners, who will be left kicking their boots on lower slopes prone to poor snow cover, hoping new snow-making equipment can help.Itrsquos understood a routine inspection revealed issues with floating bearings on the track which help it cope with extreme mountain temperatures. However, specialist engineers have now been brought in to inspect the railwayrsquos foundations.With the engineersrsquo report not due until early next month and the bitter winter weather expected to curb any repair programme, Natural Retreats marked the day of the first snowfall to deliver bombshell news to more than  ski school workers that their services would not be required.They join staff at the Ptarmigan Restaurant at the top of the funicular who, with no railway to feed tourists uphill, had already been told to stand down at least until the winter season kicks in. That has fuelled concerns over the operatorrsquos commitment to the resort and sparked interest among local campaigners to press ahead with plans to mount a community buyout, to develop their own vision for its future.All of which is cold comfort for local businesses facing the prospect of a bleak winter.Naeela Shahzad of Aviemore Convenience Store on Grampian Road said: ldquoIf you donrsquot get tourists up in numbers, then yoursquore in trouble.ldquoItrsquos not just skiers who use the funicular railway, some people just go up for the view. They take the funicular railway, look around and then spend time in Aviemore.ldquoPeople come to Aviemore at Christmas because they want snow. They want to go up the hill to see the views and the only way they can do that is by train. There is real concern among businesses over what will happen.Already one of Aviemorersquos most familiar names in snowsports, the Ski Shack, has closed, citing the ldquosituation on Cairngorm for its demise.Meanwhile Colin Little, manager of Mamborsquos Cafeacute Bar in the centre of Aviemore, said concern has been fuelled by confusion.ldquoNo one seems to know whatrsquos going on. Therersquos a lot of concern that it will be a dficult season, he said. ldquoThere will be tows and uplt available so wersquore all trying to stay positive.According to local MSP Kate Forbes, the situation gripping the resort is ldquopotentially devastating.ldquoThe impact of this throughout the local economy is signicant. Itrsquos snow sports that brings people to Aviemore in the winter.ldquoTherersquos no question this situation has an enormous impact on not just local hospitality and transport sectors but on the wider economy too.ldquoTo be announcing in late autumn, on the first weekend of snow, that a ski school isnrsquot going to operate, is inexplicable.ldquoEnough is enough.But just why has the former jewel in the crown of Scottish snow sport fallen so dramatically on its face To trace Cairngormrsquos problems means rewinding time to , when Aviemorersquos status as a holiday destination was taking shape in the form of a clunky concrete centre featuring go-karts, ice rink, cinema and its showpiece attraction, Santa Claus Land.The mountainrsquos ski tows and chairlts were the envy of Scotlandrsquos other resorts ndash and, indeed, many continental ski areas ndash when the Scottish Office took the controversial decision to transfer Cairngorm Estate from the Forestry Commission to HIErsquos predecessor body, the Highlands and Islands Development Board.ldquoThatrsquos where the problems began, says Dave Morris, former director of Ramblers Scotland. ldquoBoth HIDB and HIE displayed flagrant incompetency in how they dealt with the mountain. They simply chewed up one site after another, starting with Lurchers Gully and then the funicular railway.ldquoThey were told the railway was the wrong option, and a modern chairlt was a better option. But they would not listen.As well as the current engineering issues, the railwayrsquos tracks are prone to being covered by drting snow requiring staff with shovels to clear them before the trains can run.But even before its construction there were deep concerns over whether it would provide an effective alternative to a chairlt or gondola structure, and over its impact on the stony plateau of the Cairngorm mass, the only place in western Europe where both arctic and alpine habitats thrive.Its lower slopes nurture eagles, pine marten, wild cats and merlin higher up are found dotterel, snow bunting and ptarmigan.The mountain and its surroundings are designated a Special Area of Conservation, and the funicular plans horried the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ndash yet their concerns were thrown out by the Court of Session.The White Lady chairlt was torn down amid claims that the railway would see a boom in skier numbers, bringing , to the hill each year. Many locals scoffed at those figures.English-based Natural Retreats, a leisure and travel business based around eco-lodges and cottages, was appointed by Highlands and Islands Enterprise four years ago to run the centre for a -year period.If the intention was to halt any potential decline, the plan quickly fell flat.ldquoWe will build the best Terrain Park in the world here, and my long-term goal is to host the summer and winter X Games at Cairngorm Mountain, said Matthew Spence, CEO at Natural Retreats, at the time.ldquoWe will nurture, develop and create future British Olympians at Cairngorm Mountain. These athletes will win gold medals at the Winter Olympics in  and the Summer Olympics in  ndash we want to bring a true sense of pride and place to one of Scotlandrsquos most incredible assets.That, points out Aviemore and Glenmore Trust spokesman Mike Dearman, hasnrsquot quite materialised.ldquoPeople have been frustrated, these new operators came in with great promises, and then not a lot happened.ldquoThey came out with a plan for a new day lodge but it wasnrsquot well received. As far as skiers and snowboarders are concerned, they want good uplt and less queues.ldquoThen they came up with a plan for a dry slope which again wasnrsquot well received. Therersquos real frustration that their promises have not been acted upon.With Aviemorersquos reputation as the Scotlandrsquos winter playground in shreds, focus is shting towards radical solutions ndash including calls toownership of the mountain from Highlands and Islands Enterprise back to its original Forestry Commission owners, or for a community buyout.That idea emerged after horried snow sport and mountain enthusiasts witnessed the surprise removal of the Coire na Ciste and West Wall chairlts. ldquoThat cost pound, even though they could have been refurbished for less, adds Dearman.The irony of that decision is now evident. A refurbishment of the Ciste chairlt could have offered a ready-made solution to the funicular railway problems.Alan Brattey of Aviemore Business Association and owner of Avonglen self-catering accommodation said: ldquoHIErsquos long-term strategy with Cairngorm Mountain has been found out to be completely flawed.ldquoThe focus was completely concentrated on the funicular railway to the detriment of the rest of the ski area that thatrsquos been found out.ldquoHaving invested more than poundm in the funicular railway they had the view they need to get as many bums on seats to justy the cost of running it.

Scotlandrsquos first ski lt in Glencoe in , was a game-changer.On  December , Cairngormrsquos White Lady chairlt, the first mechanised uplt on Cairngorm mountain and reputed to be the worldrsquos first detachable chairlt, carried its first skiers on a chilly -minute journey to the top of the hill.Hatched by a group of friends from the Glasgow shipyards, all members of the Creaghdhu Mountaineering Club, it launched Aviemore as a winter sport hub.By the mid-s, Cairngormrsquos network of chairlt, poma and T-bar tows made it one of the worldrsquos most highly developed ski areas, and Aviemore an exciting holiday destination.Lord Allander, of the House of Fraser chain of department stores, poured millions into creating a Highland playground resort.Concrete buildings in the village centre were not particularly attractive by todayrsquos standards, but were ahead of their time combining accommodation, ice rink, go-karts, swimming and Scotlandrsquos first purpose-built retail park in a single location.A generation of Scottish children grew up fascinated by Santa Claus Land. Unveiled in the mid-Seventies, it offered funfair rides, meetings with local man George Swinney, whose feathery white beard and jovial nature sent little ones home convinced they had just delivered their Christmas list to the man himself.But by the late s, Santa Claus Land ndash by then a mismatch of inflatable Father Christmas, funfair rides, a model railway and a plastic dinosaur ndash seemed to sum up an area on its knees.Concerned that jobs were at risk and the area was on a downward slide, pound.m of European money was found to prop it up.At the heart of the rejuvenation plans was to replace the White Lady chairlt with a new funicular railway that would bring income to the mountain all year around.Now, as attention focuses on Aviemores future, it once again appears that the only way to go is up."},{"url":null,"title":"campaigners-plea-to-make-foodbanks-part-of-the-social-security-system","story":"Mark Frankland, of Dumfries-based First Base, which gives out  food parcels a year across Dumfries and Galloway, said: ldquoThere seems to be a complete determination never to treat foodbanks as part of the welfare state. But  per cent of our referrals come from people working for the state ndash from Job Centres, social workers, homeless teams.ldquoPeople say lsquowe want to get rid of foodbanksrsquo. Butthey hadnrsquot been around, you might well have seen people starve.Mr Frankland, who recently gave evidence at Holyroodrsquos Social Security Committee, said with food and child poverty expected to spike over the next five years, the government should consider funding foodbanks. ldquoThat would let us put more items in a food parcels, such as fresh fruit and veg or vouchers for people who run out of power.ldquoIf what is on offer from the DWP isnrsquot enough to keep body and soul together, we are there to be considered, he said. ldquoI donrsquot think the system would be abused. People generally hate walking through our doors unless they absolutely have to. ldquoHe added ldquoWe treat people very dferently from a bureaucrat. Why is it so bad for someone to go and get a bag of food, donated by people who give a damn, rather than turning up at an office to get pound from a grudging bureaucrat However poverty campaigners reject the suggestion that emergency food parcels should become one of the elements of on offer from the welfare state. Peter Kelly, director of the Poverty Alliance, said: ldquoWe support foodbanks, I give to them myself all the time. But no matter how much foodbanks are needed they are not a sufficient response. If our response to poverty becomes less based on security and peoplersquos rights and more to do with charitable giving and donations, that is likely to be stigmatising.Polly Jones, project manager of Menu for Change, which argues for alternatives to emergency food aid, said: ldquoPeople running foodbanks do it out of the best intentions. They are trying to step up and help. But the idea that it should be pulled in as part of our universal social security system is the wrong approach.ldquoWe need to make social security systems work better and fix the holes in the safety net first.ldquoIf foodbanks worked, people wouldnrsquot go back again, but in fact the vast majority using foodbanks do , at least once.Mr Frankland also claimed people on low incomes were being hard-hit by price rises from major supermarkets, which he accused of quietly raising the price of some of their cheapest items.The shopping bill for First Base, which tops up donated food to ensure parcels are nutritionally balanced, has doubled in a year, he said, from pound a month to pound a month.While the charity has seen a ten percent increase in demand, the bulk of the cost has come from price rises on supermarketsrsquo value ranges, he said.ldquoIT seems to be standard policy to limit availability and raise prices in their value ranges. Tesco has got rid of many of its lsquovaluersquo products and replaced them with other brands, while value range longer le milk has disappeared from the shelves. It used to cost us  pence a litre, now the next cheapest option is  pence.ldquoWe are seeing unbelievable price rises on food at the lowest end of the market. It feels asthey are targeting the very poorest customers so they can keep their main range prices the same. ldquo"},{"url":null,"title":"arron-banks-insists-no-russian-money-and-no-interference-in-leaveeu-campaign","story":"The controversial business figure, now the subject of a National Crime Agency probe into the source of payments worth pound million, insisted all the money was legitimate and came from his UK-registered firm, Rock Services.And in an outspoken intervention Mr Banks:*hit out at the elections watchdog, the Electoral Commission, which he accused of being a biased body made up of ex-MPs from the SNP and Labour, claiming it was ldquopolitically motivated*accused the Conservative Government of ldquodisgraceful behaviour in a ldquosell-out of Brexit*described British politics as a ldquosewer, denouncing a group of ldquovicious MPs for seeking to undermine the referendum result*and even suggested it would probably have been betterBritain had voted to Remain in the EU and ldquonot unleash these demons.The investigation by the National Crime Agency was launched after the Commission said it had reasonable grounds to suspect Mr Banks was not the true source of the cash.But the controversial businessman told the BBCrsquos Andrew Marr Show: \"There was no Russian money and no interference of any type.

What tends to happen is that children start school according to their month of birth, which means that they start between the age of four-and-a-half-years-old and five-and-a-half-years-old. It does not have to be this way.There are two very dferent trains of thought about childrens readiness for school, which can be a little confusing. One is that more formal early education is good for children from deprived backgrounds who tend to be further behind in their development when they start school compared to those from more affluent backgrounds.The other argument is that some children are just not ready for school at the recommended age and that a later start would ensure that the early experience of schooling is not uncomfortable.Here, the thinking is thatthe foundations are put in place, their lives being enriched by a longer play-based early years experience, children will be able to accumulate their learning more rapidly in school when they are ready.Presently, we allow local authorities the right to determine local priorities. There is nothing wrong with this in principle, as it can be a means to allow for local needs to be met and for new and innovative practice to emerge. However, it can also lead to unevenness across the country, which is where we are at with funding extensions of early years education.Sending a child to school too early is not necessarily catastrophic because children are resilient - as long as when they eventually start school, they are supported in school in the right way for their age and stage of development. Teachers are already adept at this.Surely, decisions must be made on the basis of what is right for inidual children and therefore it would be progressivewe reached the position that parents were not penalised financially for taking a decision that was in the best interests of their child.

Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Monday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amLonghope Leboat crew had a very speedy response to a pager alert on Sunday morning when, during a pre- exercise briefing, the crew was requested to launch by the UK Coastguard.

The project is supported by Orkney Islands Council’s Arts Development team.It will run on a loop eight times from pm each evening between now and Remembrance Day on November .At around .pm each night it will come to a rest on the final image — a tree, made up of the names of Orcadians who died in WWI, in a field of poppies.Glasgow-based specialists Playdead were engaged to create the film and pupils from Glaitness Primary and Kirkwall Grammar schools were involved in the creation of the work.Kevin McCrae, creative director and founder of Playdead, said: “After speaking to local people and school children about what they’d like to see and seeing what we could draw on from archives as well, we thought it would be good to develop a series of sequences which looked at the war and its impacts in Orkney from a range of angles.“Spectators will see snippets of what soldiers would have experienced, but also there are scenes which explore how farmers and school children would have been affected, as well as a look at what propaganda people here would have seen, and images from after the war of how the end of the conflict was celebrated and how it was commemorated.“There are some big technical challenges associated with projecting onto a surface like the St Magnus Cathedral. It’s such an iconic building in the heart of Kirkwall and we wanted to do justice to it # so we have done a lot of work to take into account the uneven surfaces and to choose a colour palette that would really work with the beautul red stone.The Great War: An Orkney Memorial Experience will run for the final time between pm and pm on Remembrance Day,  November.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now in its seventh consecutive season, the Sanday Sealcam is online once again.A camera has been set up overlooking two small coves in a part of the island that is rarely visited — except by seals, otters, rabbits and birds.Set up with the kind permission of local landowners, the Towrie family, the camera is linked to a radio dish that transmits the signal, by line of sight, to a distant receiving dish, and the apparatus is powered by solar batteries — and this year for the first time, a supplementary wind-generator # at the site.Here, the live action is streamed to the internet and can be watched by anyone who logs on to the sealcam website.Sandra Towrie, Chair of Sanday Development Trust said: “Sanday Development Trust is delighted to work with Triscom as it is a hard task to stream the camera using remote, rural broadband and get high-quality live footage successfully being streamed onto the web. The Sanday sealcam allows visitors a unique opportunity to see Orkney’s amazing wildle up close and personal, and follow the highs and lows of an Orkney seal colony during pupping season from the comfort of their armchair — perfect for those unable to visit the island in person.”In recent years, Northlink Ferries have part-sponsored the Sealcam, while Sanday Development Trust continues to fund repairs, replacements and maintenance of the equipment and the time involved in camera control.Thousands of people, from all over the world, have looked at Sanday Sealcam. From the comfort of your computer-desk, or even your laptop in an armchair by the fire, the website brings you the sights and sounds of seals on an Orkney beach.

We are hopeful however that the Scottish Government will pass on the additional money.\"Over the period   to   the Highland Council has already had to implement budget savings of pound. million and council tax rises of % in each of the last two years in order to deliver a balanced budget.

We do however have the risk of the cost of another harsh winter ahead of us.\"The council is now focusing on income generation, commercialisation and efficiencies to protect essential services.Cllr Mackinnon added: \"There will be very hard decisions to make as we plan for a reduced budget over the next three years and it is vital that we involve the public, our staff and all members in the choices we make.\"Depute budget leader councillor Matthew Reiss said: \"This is an opportunity to listen to what is important to people, to reshape our priorities and to focus our resources on improving lives.\"I strongly encourage everyone to get involved in this and make your voices heard.

She said: \"Our children are subject to appalling conditions. Only today my daughter had to sit in her classroom with her coat and hat on as it was so cold. A classroom that incorporates the staff toilet and staff room. To avoid the staff room, children are having to go in and out of the classroom via outdoors.\"Dingwall and Seaforth ward councillor Angela MacLean invited childrenrsquos minister Maree Todd and the arearsquos MSP, Kate Forbes, to support a push for funding for a replacement. Ms MacLean said: \"I think the staff do a fantastic job and it is incumbent on us to try and get a solution and all work together. Having it on the capital programme with a reduced capital budget has been dficult but everyone who has seen it knows it is badly needing replaced. Whether it be Scottish Government or Highland Council we all have to work together. Given the children that go to St Clementrsquos, it does make it more urgent because they are our most vulnerable young people.\"Mrs Todd, a Ross-shire-based Highlands and Islands MSP, declared the school not fit for purpose when she visited this year.She said shersquod be \"more than happy\" to meet local councillors but added: \"As a member of the ruling administration, Ms MacLean will know that St Clementrsquos had not previously been prioritised by Highland Council in their capital spending plans.\"Since my visit to St Clementrsquos this year Highland Council has now prioritised it. Should they require my support in making further progress, I am happy to help.\"Dingwall-based MSP Kate Forbes previously described the school \"as like something out of Oliver Twist\".She said: \"Highland Councilrsquos plans for school buildings seem to be entirely reliant on additional Scottish Government funding when it is the council who has statutory responsibility for school buildings and their annual budget settlement recognises that.\"Shesaid Highland Council had been the second highest beneficiary of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Schools for the Future funding scheme, receiving poundmillion. The next school buildings funding programme is expected by the end of the year.Renewing an appeal for progress, Ms Ferguson warned of \"promises broken and deadlines long passed\" and accused the council of breaking the law over conditions.

We should have something similar around the Firth. You see people driving past Kirkmichael slowing down to take a look because it looks interesting. People are drawn in and genuinely interested by what they see.\"Irsquom not really all that comfortable with heritage being competitive but this does mean the community, which has been supporting this for close on  years, can be recognised. Five years ago we were at the point of giving up when the roof literally fell in. We had a meeting with the community and they urged us to push on.\"The Federation of Small Businessesrsquo Highlands and Islands development manager, David Richardson, hailed the Trust for \"working wonders\" on the kirk, graveyards and mediaeval stones.\"Visiting old graveyards is not just of interest to locals and those with ancestors buried in them it is also very popular with many visitors interested in soaking up more of the local atmosphere and history and in reading the stories written on the older the stones.\"Including interpretive  that explain more of the history and expand on these stories makes the whole experience even more powerful.\"Dr Mackayrsquos suggestion that a Highland graveyard heritage trail should be created is excellent surely an idea whose time has come  Itrsquos certainly well worth further exploration and discussion.\"Kate Forbes MSP, whose constituency takes in the Black Isle, said: \"I love what the Kirkmichael Trust has done to repair the graveyard and draw in locals and visitors.

We have a whole plan of engagement throughout the year that will do that, starting later this week.\"And at the same time to listen to the public and to hear the views of what the council is doing really well, what everyone believes the council could be doing better in terms of delivering services and the important part of that is that we go across the Highlands to hear those views.\"The first thing is about listening to people, the second most important thing is about going back and saying to people lsquoyou said and we willrsquo or lsquowe are not able to becausersquo.\"The councilis due tostart a \"public budget engagement process\" tomorrow, designed to help the local authority make decisions to balance its books.\"It is really important that we listen throughout the month of November,\" Mrs Manson said. \"Then we will go back and give feedback on what the suggestions are.\"Mrs Manson was upbeat about the local authorityrsquos financial woes that have seen it stumble from one unpopular cutback to another over several months amid a flurry of resignation threats from within the administration.\"I am quite positive about our budget situation here in the Highlands ndash I think we are in a fair place,\" she said. \"There are places where we will be able to make efficiencies and our officer team and our members are working on that all the time, day-in, day-out behind the scenes.\"However, Mrs Manson did accept that \"there are some challenging areas in there, such as what our priorities for resource and for spend are, and I think it is very important to take a transparent approach so that when we do take decisions in February [when the council budget is decided] we can actually evidence it comes after listening to people.\"One of the answers to those challenges, according to the chief executive, is to rely on the \"many talented staff who believe in the values of public service and that we are here to make a dference\" and to capitalise on an upsurge in community involvement.\"I genuinely believe that many, many people that I have been speaking to over the last few months in dferent parts of the Highlands have really good ideas,\" she said. \"They see where the council can become more efficient.\"But equally so, I think that people can be more understanding of the challenges that we face.\"The local authority has made pound. million of savings since  and raised council tax by three per cent in each of the last two years.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \"We have to do more with less money and our costs are rising for things like fuel, pay and cost of living.\"We are working with services to produce comprehensive information on our current spending profiles, to identy where there are opportunities for efficiencies and any commercial opportunities. Our focus will be on directing our resources to those areas which will give us the best outcomes and deliver value for money.\"Depute budget leader Matthew Reiss said: \"It will not be easy to find more savings on top of those we have already made. Income generation, commercialisation and efficiencies become even more vital in this context in order to protect essential services and we do not have the luxury of the signicant reserves we once had to give us any room for manoeuvre.\"It is undoubtedly the case that there will be very hard decisions to make and we will begin a process of engagement to help us make the right decisions and do the best we can.\"Monday  Nov  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The Highland Council appreciate the work by Network Rail to introduce this innovative solution.\"Despite the reducedof daytime closure windows the road will remain shut each night from pm to am.

It has taken many years to reach this pointand is much needed.I wonder what,any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building  If you do have some proof to justy your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion George DicksonI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisationof a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in dferent buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep itfor the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.I also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last  years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.Some parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability..."},{"url":null,"title":"deal to buy vessels as northern isles contract is extended ","story":"A deal has been agreed for the three passenger ferries serving the Northern Isles to be bought outright by Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd , with loan funding from the Scottish government. – previously leased from Royal Bank of Scotland – will be taken into CMAL ownership.An -month extension to the current Northern Isles ferry contract has also been agreed.Transport Scotland says that is to allow further progress to be made with the ongoing review of procurement policy.It means Serco NorthLink Ferries will continue to operate the services until st October  under the extended contract.Minister for Transport and the Islands Humza Yousaf said: “This agreement to buy the three passenger vessels serving the Northern Isles is an excellent piece of business for the Scottish government.“Not only does it secure the future of the three vessels that had previously been leased, but it will also deliver savings to the public purse in the longer term.“We have also agreed an extension to the current Northern Isles contract, which will see Serco NorthLink Ferries continue to run the service until the end of October  under the extended contract.#This is a continuation of the current agreement, so there will be no reduction in services. This will allow us to make further progress with the review of procurement policy for future ferry operating contracts.“Our ferry services are iconic transport links that play a vital role for our island economies. Making sure they continue to support the communities they serve, as well as delivering best value for taxpayer’s money, will always remain at the heart of our ferry operations.”NorthLink#s managing director Stuart Garrett said: “We are pleased to have been awarded this contract extension and we will be working closely with the Scottish government and CMAL as the ownership of the passenger vessels is transferred.“We have a positive history of working with CMAL and look forward to continuing to deliver this service with business as usual during the contract extension.”Excellent that means we can look forward to a lack of cabins and an inability to get in and out of aberdeen with any kind of weather for many years to come. This may be an excellent piece of business for the scoti government but it is bad news for us.Yes, it seems odd that, having lambasted Tavish Scott for his involvement in bringing about the use of these vessels, the SNP Scottish government has now bought them.One of the criticisms made was that the vessels# design causes them to use grossly excessive amounts of fuel, compared to other designs, e.g. Pentland Ferries catamarans.Fuel is a major component of vessel running costs so hopes of cutting costs and hence fares by improving efficiency appear to have been dashed by this move.It presumably also rules out companies like Pentland Ferries who run their Orkney-Caithness operation without subsidy, in competition with NorthLink, from entering the bidding for future contracts, which now have the look of becoming a #shoo-in# for nationalised group Cal-Mac. Very cosy.However, for users and taxpayers, that would be the worst of all possible worlds. Does this mean a reduction in services is being considered in the future  Also, doubtful.Should PO come back, YES..."},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"Marc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27492  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaAt the start of the th century women began to campaign actively against the denial of their right to vote. In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1106582.jpg--.jpg?1540373104000\n","title":"allen s meats moves to larger premises in cullybackey","story":"AFTER  years serving the people of Ahoghill Allens Meats has moved to larger premises to meet the demands of the growing business.The butchers shop has relocated to Cullybackey to take over the former Lamont Butchers at  Main Street in the village.Allens Meats needed to acquire larger premises and decided to make the move to Cullybackey after David Lamont retired.Lamont Butchers has been based in Cullybackey since  and Derek Allen and his team will continue to provide the same excellent customer service and top quality produce.Derek said: “The business is growing and we needed more space to enable us to offer a wider range of products.“We would like to thank all our customers in Ahoghill for their support over the last  years.

A founding member of the Ballymurphy Massacre campaign and member of Relatives for Justice, Carmel will ask for American support for the campaign at public events and Congressional meetings. MPs have called for an end of former British troopers being “hounded and pursued” by murder investigations, while Theresa May praised the “heroism” of British crown forces who “upheld the law”. RFJ believes that while not specically referring to Ballymurphy, such claims may impact an inquest considering whether British forces upheld the rule of law in the case.AOH Freedom for All Ireland Chair Martin Galvin said: “The Ballymurphy Massacre is a fundamental test of Britain#s ability to give legacy justice. If victims cannot get justice where  people, including a Catholic priest and mother of eight children were killed by British troops, how can we expect justice in any killings or collusion murders where British forces were involved AOH National Vice-President Danny O#Connell and National Secretary Jere Cole recently promised the Ballymurphy families that America would stand behind them in their battle for justice.

The De La Salle student will travel to London on Friday and fly out to St Petersburg on Saturday. The preliminaries for the rd FIG Trampoline Gymnastics World Championships take place Wednesday, November  with the finals taking place two days later on Friday, November .Devine came out on top of a high-class field in the senior men’s DMT competition in Birmingham at the end of September to win his first British title and secure his place in the World Championships. His coach, Simon Flannery, was delighted with his performance in Birmingham and is hoping some adjustments to his routines will yield a further improvement in Russia next week. “Each competitor completes two routines and the top eight go through to the final,” stated Flannery.“The routines he did in the preliminaries for the British Championships are the routines he will now in the prelims in Russia. “Those routines would have placed him second in the prelims for last year. “We know he is in around the area he needs to be to make it to the final. “He was brilliant in Birmingham. He had a tough build-up to the Championships. The routines we wanted to do at the Championships weren’t quite there yet, so we had to make a decision not to compete with those. It paid off because he done a modied last routine and he done it really well and won.”He added: “Since then, we have upgraded those routines and he is looking phenomenal. He had a training camp last week with the GB team and he smashed all his classes. “In our sport, it comes down to tenths of points, so every step you take, or wobble, or bend of the arms can cost you. “Every tenth you lose is tripled because the three judges scores are counted.“The last training camp is about fine-tuning the little details to maximise your score.”As British champion, Devine will have high hopes of continuing his rapid rise in the sport by securing a medal. Flannery believes Devine has the ability to progress to next Friday’s finals and is hopeful of another fine showing from the West Belfast prospect. “He is hoping to get into the finals, which is the main thing,” said Flannery.“I think his routines will easily put him into the top five. “We’d love to come away with a medal.“He is excited and a little bit nervous, but he turns that into a real positive. He gets adrenaline from it.” Flannery, who recently relocated Andersonstown Trampoline Club to Mallusk to merge with Flight Gymnastics, also revealed that Devine will be targeting Olympic qualication in the New Year. The -year-old will have a well-earned break from competition after the World Championships in Russia before embarking on a two-year goal to qualy for Tokyo in . “We have got a break after Russia then, next year, the qualication starts for the Olympic Games ,” added the Flight Gymnastic coach. “It starts in February and he has to compete in a run of events over the next two years. Only the top  men and the top  women make the Olympics. “We are working very hard to get him into the top  so he can qualy for the Olympics.“If you take out the Russians and the Chinese, then a lot of dferent counties can make up that top . It comes down to whoever is the most consistent during the qualication events. “He has shown this year that he is very consistent in the top competitions so hopefully he can get a spot.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-02-at-09.52.44.png","title":"last chance to cast your vote for our inspirational youth","story":"WITH just hours to go until voting comes to a close for the Inspirational Youth of the West awards, rest assured – there is still time to cast your vote.With over , online votes so far counted across  categories, our youth and their sterling work and endeavours will be honoured on Friday, November  at the Devenish Complex for the gala congratulatory evening hosted by Pamela Ballantine.

There was never any justication for violence. “Lofty speeches about ato the borders of the s and s are not based on fact and only serve to add succour to men of violence.”She added that placing any new barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain “would be catastrophic for our economy” after it was reported that Theresa May had secured a deal that will see the UK remain within a customs union with the EU.The Sunday Times claimed that preparations for a deal are more advanced than had been anticipated, with a detailed document in the works.Since Brexit talks began the EU has insisted on an agreement which would see Northern Ireland remain part of the customs union and the single market in order to avoid a hard border with the Republic in the event of no deal.Under the latest proposals, the EU would write a UK-wide backstop into the legally binding Withdrawal Agreement, meaning a backstop solely for Northern Ireland would not be needed.Responding to the report, Mrs Foster told the Belfast : “We are seeking an outcome that works for NI, the UK and the EU. “That would be a sensible deal.  “An outcome that effectively redraws the border and moves it to the Irish Sea is not sensible for the Northern Ireland economy or in a political sense, for the Union.“The Prime Minister knows that we have had one red line in this Brexit process. We will not tolerate the economic or constitutional integrity of the UK being undermined by any deal.”Mrs Foster said that “% of all goods leaving Belfast Port are destined for GB and % of goods coming into NI are from GB. To place any new barriers between NI and GB would be catastrophic for our economy”.“We are living through incredibly historic days. The decisions made in the next few weeks will dictate the kind of UK our grandchildren experience,” she continued.Mrs Fosteradded: “I am heartened by the support throughout the UK for our position. Unionists in England, Scotland and Wales recognise that placing a trade border between NI and GB would totally undermine the integrity of the UK single market.” Former Northern Ireland secretary James Brokenshire, appearing on Sky’s Ridge On Sunday, was askeda deal was close. He said negotiations are still very firmly continuing, adding: “We are % of the way there in relation to the Withdrawal Agreement. “Obviously still having this issue in relation to the insurance arrangements for Northern Ireland and Ireland, and that very much remains our focus and attention in getting that deal.”A Downing Street spokeswoman added: “The Prime Minister is clear we are leaving the customs union.“We are making good progress on the future relationship, and % of the Withdrawal Agreement has been settled. Negotiations are ongoing.”Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said the article was written with a British audience in mind and such “running commentary” isn’t helpful.“The EU has been united through the Brexit process. The UK has given written commitments last December and March that the Withdrawal Agreement will give a legal guarantee of noto a hard border in Ireland in any circumstance — this is the backstop,” Mr Coveney said.“In March the UK agreed this backstop will apply ‘unless and until’ a close future relationship eliminates any need for border infrastructure or related checks and controls. “We want the EU and UK to get to negotiating that close future deal but the UK must first deliver on the commitments of leaving. “The EU support to Ireland has been and remains unwavering. The negotiators are working hard and a running commentary isn’t helpful. “However Donald Tusk, Michel Barnier, Jean Claude Juncker and indeed Theresa May herself have all said there will not be a deal without a legal guarantee of no hard border in Ireland. “We hope a deal can be done but we’re not there yet.”The Sunday Times article also stated thatan all-UK customs arrangement is written into the Withdrawal Agreement, the backstop proposed by the EU, which treats Northern Ireland as dferent from the rest of the UK, will no longer be required. It also claimed Theresa May is on course to securing a Canada-style trade deal.A senior Whitehall source told the paper: “The PM will be able to say there’s no more backstop, we’ve got rid of that — success. There’s an exit mechanism — success. “And you’ve got Canada — success. The small print is that Ireland is f*****.”"},{"url":null,"title":"leo varadkar open to review of brexit backstop for border in ireland but dismisses timelimited proposal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Theresa May secures secret Brexit deal to prevent Irish Sea border - reports Brexit talks ongoing, says Brokenshire amid reports of Brussels concessions The article claimed Mrs May had \"secured private concessions from Brussels that will allow her to keep the whole of Britain in a customs union, avoiding a hard border in Ireland\".The article also quoted a \"senior Whitehall source\" as saying \"Ireland is f*****\" in a new deal which the newspaper claims Mrs May will be unveiling soon, and is confident can attract support from parliament.Mr Coveney said the article was written with a British audience in mind and such \"running commentary\" isnt helpful.\"The EU has been united through the Brexit process. The UK has given written commitments last December and March that the Withdrawal Agreement will give a legal guarantee of noto a hard border in Ireland in any circumstance - this is the backstop,\" Mr Coveney said.\"In March the UK agreed this backstop will apply unless and until a close future relationship eliminates any need for border infrastructure or related checks and controls. We want the EU and UK to get to negotiating that close future deal but the UK must first deliver on the commitments of leaving.\"The EU support to Ireland has been and remains unwavering.\"The negotiators are working hard and a running commentary isn’t helpful. Today’s Sunday Times piece is obviously aimed at a UK audience.\"However Donald Tusk, Michel Barnier, Jean Claude Juncker and indeed Theresa May herself, have all said there will not be a deal without a legal guarantee of no hard border in Ireland.\"We hope a deal can be done but we’re not there yet.”The Times article states the EU will write an all-UK customs deal into the legally binding withdrawal agreement from the EU. If this happens, the backstop - designed by the EU and which treats Northern Ireland as dferent from the rest of the UK - will no longer be required.It also claims Theresa May is on course to securing a Canada-style trade deal.A senior Whitehall source told the paper: \"The PM will be able to say theres no more backstop, weve got rid of that - success. Theres an exit mechanism - success. And youve got Canada - success. The small print is that Ireland is f*****\"."},{"url":null,"title":"alan mcbrides letter to the leaders","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

On that day I posted a blog on Eamonn Mallies website challenging both of you to sort out your dferences and to get back into Government..pushI have been encouraged by the response to the blog from right across Northern Ireland, the Republic and GB and I now want to personally challenge you to do the right thing, to show some of the courage that your predecessors demonstrated and end this stalemate. McBrides debate challenge to Northern Ireland leaders I have no interest in the blame game as I believe it to be disruptive and unproductive. The real issue keeping the DUP and Sinn Fein from sharing power is attitude. With the right attitude nothing is insurmountable.In my blog I cited an example of when I moved into a mixed area from a Loyalist housing estate. It was about two years after the bomb and the move was prompted by a desire for my daughter to get to know little Catholic girls.It worked as she became best friends with two sisters that lived across the street. One Eleventh Night as I was getting ready to go round the bonfires in my old area, their parents called over and invited me to a barbecue at their house. I accepted the invitation and called over before going round the fires.What happened next has stayed with me for a long time and has served as a reminder of the kind of Northern Ireland I want to live in. When I arrived at their house they had built a small bonfire in their back garden, just for me.There were no flags on this fire and no effigy to be burned. I sat around the fire, drinking beer and eating a burger. We talked about everything and anything as our kids laughed and played together in the garden. Later on as I stood watching another Irish Tricolour burn on another Loyalist bonfire I thought about what had just happened in my Catholic neighbours house and wondered why it couldnt be like that all the time.Thats the kind of Northern Ireland I voted for in  and its still the kind of Northern Ireland I want to be part of in . But I need you guys to make it happen and you canyou show genuine leadership instead of entrenched opposition.I want both of you to tell those of us who have to live together in this small place what does it mean to be a good neighbour in this society.What could you do for the other that would make them feel welcome and their culture and traditions valued  How much is good neighbourliness a factor in your thinking This is the challenge that I want you to meet - for me, for the people of the Shankill, the people of Greysteel and for people all over Northern Ireland.I challenge both of you to a live debate with me on the issue of being a good neighbour. There is no need to bring a facilitator in from amongst the great and the good, just a live televised interview with an ordinary guy who lost his we in a bomb.I want to hear you explain to the people of Northern Ireland what you are prepared to do to make this country work, in what way will you be a good neighbour. I dont need you to rehash the problems that you face as most of the country is weary with that debate. I need to see how youre going to fix it and when, and I think that will only start when we hear for ourselves that you accept each other as good neighbour."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic updates thick fog on","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This was the first time the legislation for such a petition had been tested.\"It therefore provides an opportunity for lessons to be learnt and highlights improvements that could be made by the UK Government which could help voters, campaigners and administrators at any future petition.\"Areas of improvementWhile signing centres were not identied as an issue, the Electoral Commission singled out other areas for improvement.Feedback from people working and campaigning at the recall petition was that the six week period was too long, and should possibly be changed for future petitions.It was also found there was some confusion among electors about how to get information about the recall petition and how to participate in it.The Electoral Commission also said it had asked the government to explore what can be done to improve the transparency in delivering recall petitions.Secrecy at signing centres was raised, as it is an area where recall petitions dfer from traditional elections.The intention of those signing the petition was clear when entering the centre, and the Electoral Commission identied a challenge in striking a balance between privacy and ease of access at the centres.The campaign saw Sinn Fein and the Alliance party register as campaigners to the Petition Office.It was found the two parties spent a total of £, between them."},{"url":null,"title":"tribunal rules psni owes 30m in outstanding","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It ies at dferent times of the year and in response to dferent political climates.”Lead solicitor on the case, John McShane, of McCartan Turkington Breen , represented nine of the  police officers, for whom the Chief Constable George Hamilton is answerable, and two civilian staff claimants, for whom the Police Authority is answerable.Landmark ruling: John McShane He said: “The Chief Constable’s failure — and continued failure to date — to pay staff in accordance with the legal requirements resulted in the need for police and civilian staff to incur the cost of pursuing legal proceedings to seek redress for their lawful entitlement to be properly paid whilst on annual leave.”Mr McShane explained that PSNI holiday pay had been based on working basic contracted hours and hadn’t accounted for any additional hours required.A high profile case in Great Britain four years ago, however, had determined that pay whilst on annual leave should include an average of overtime and other allowances.“Cases were pursued here because the PSNI had not sought to comply with these legal obligations,” he said. “The cases also addressed to what extent arrears of these unlawful deductions of wages, backdated to , could be claimed.“In England and Wales, legislation was introduced to limit any arrears claim to two years. No such equivalent legislation was passed by the Northern Ireland Assembly.”Mr McShane pointed to Judge Kelly’s ruling that “a failure to provide the right to paidannual leave... is an extremely serious matter going to the heart of one of the fundamental rights of the European Union.”Mark LindsayThe employment judge added: “An employer is not allowed to sidestep or to avoid the rights guaranteed under a European community directive. In the present claims, the position has been clear to all parties since .“Overtime payments and allowances should have been included, on some basis within the calculation of holiday pay.“The present claims appear to highlight a situation where a clear entitlement under the Working Time Directive hasbeen effectively ignored and avoided for a signicant period of time and continues to be avoided. It is particularly concerning that this has been done by a public authority.”Mark Lindsay, chair of the Police Federation for Northern Ireland, praised the ruling saying it “corrects a long-running disadvantage and delivers signicant back payments to officers”.“The Police Federation represented , officers at no cost to themselves,” he said.“A further  were engaged in a private action which they had to fund. The cost to the PFNI was over £,.“Legal counsel was shared with the other officers who pursued the private action.”Mr Lindsay said the ruling “will give officers what they are entitled to” and he called on government “to step in to meet the claim rather than allow it to become a burden on the existing financial allocation”.“The federation is aware of the financial implications of the ruling,” he added.“Paying what officers are due should not be allowed to adversely impact on the PSNI budget which is already under strain.”Deputy Chief Constable Stephen Martin said: “We are considering the findings of this legal judgment which is complex and signicant. We continue to be involved in the legal process and as such it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.”"},{"url":null,"title":"leo varadkar dismisses timelimited backstop","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

was sent on Friday and published in the Irish News on Monday as a two-page advert, has the largest number of signatures and is an all-island endeavour.The letter welcomes Mr Varadkar’s pledge to defend the interests of Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland through the Brexit process but blames the Stormont powersharing impasse, which has seen the region without devolved government for almost two years, for “denying” certain “rights” to people north of the border.It highlights Democratic Unionist opposition to same sex marriage and an Irish Language Act as two key issues of concern.The letter adds: “As you know these rights are now taken for granted by citizens in other parts of these islands.“The British Conservative government has rendered itself unable to effect any progress on these rights issues due to its dependence on the DUP.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Footballer James McClean is among the signatories “Brexit threatens to deepen the rights crisis and there is a real danger of serious erosion of current guarantees.”On Brexit, the letter raises concerns about access to free healthcare in EU countries a potential hike to the cost of attending

that partition could be reinforced, and our country and our people further ided.“This is a source of grave concern to all of us.“We, as Irish citizens, urge you to adhere to your commitment that we would ‘never again be left behind by an Irish Government’ and to redouble your efforts, and the efforts of your government, to ensure that our rights are protected.”Plans for the latest letter were

possibility and one that should never be overlooked but Brexit and a border causing economic chaos is a fact and one that is being totally overlooked by the DUP,” he said.“It won’t make anyone more British, it will just make everyone poorer.”Belfast lawyer Niall Murphy, who has been involved in compiling the letter, said every section of nationalist civic le was represented among the signatories.“That this letter is signed by over a thousand leaders from the nationalist community is a testament to an evolving earthquake in terms of an awakening of nationalist confidence,” he said.“The , names are symbolic, the letter is not a petition, but a representative sample of the views of hundreds of thousands of people across the north and indeed across the entire

The question is where did the money come from “It is a discrepancy because what he told us was that Rock Services really just provides services to other companies that he owns – provides cash, makes payments. It doesn’t make any money itself. It’s not selling products and services and generating cash.“For Rock Services to have money to give to Leave.EU or anyone , that money has got to have been put in that bank account by another company or another inidual.“If Rock Services made the donation, where did the money come from for Rock Services to do that  That is still not clear. No matter how many times he was asked that question, he didn’t answer it.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Damian Collins chairs the Commons Culture Committee, which has been conducting an inquiry into fake news Mr Collins rejected suggestions that the UK’s departure from the European Union should be put on hold while the investigation into Mr Banks and Leave.EU is carried out.Questions over the validity of the referendum result could be raised onlymisconduct was “proven to be true as a consequence of the investigation”, he said.The “unprecedented” involvement of the NCA in the case was an important step because the agency was able to examine all financial records of Mr Banks’s businesses, including in areas outside UK jurisdiction such as the Isle of Man, said Mr Collins.“I want this to be done as quickly as possible,” he said. “But this isn’t a question of what should be done about the referendum. Ultimately that is a matter for Parliament.“It’s important that the investigation goes ahead as quickly as possible and that Arron Banks is investigated. There’s an argument he uses which is to say this is all politically motivated, this is not a proper investigation, it’s about trying to delay Brexit.“There are two issues here. There is the Brexit process which is ongoing and there is what should be a full and proper investigation into Mr Banks and the source of his funds.”The Electoral Commission’s review of referendum finances focused on £ million reported to have been loaned to Better For The Country by Mr Banks and his insurance companies and a £ million donation which he made alone.Mr Banks and Leave.EU chief executive Liz Bilney deny any wrongdoing."},{"url":null,"title":"four in 10 britons back second referendum offering inout brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is particularly worrying as I remain unconvinced that the current site can accommodate an extra  or  students, without this having a detrimental effect on their wellbeing and the quality of teaching.ldquoI also have signicant concerns about the impact the single site option would have on traffic in the Saul Road area, given the congestion issues and poor infrastructure already in the town.He said he was ldquoworried about the impact that moving teachers and pupils, which he argued would be inevitable in the transitional phase, would have on timetabling.Cllr Brown said he was ldquoslightly more enthusiastic about a two-school option, though he claimed there was ldquostill a lack of clarity from CCMS about how this would work in practice.He added: ldquoI hope the CCMS can produce more detail on this during the post-consultation stage. Officials have informed us that they hope to implement this amalgamation as early as September .ldquoIf that is the case, much work needs to be done to assuage the concerns of parents, secure long term capital funding mdash and potentially a new site mdash and ensure the inevitable challenges occurring during the transitional period do not become permanent fixtures of any new school.Mr Lyttle said that while Alliance was strongly opposed to academic selection and believed in the need for integration and rationalisation of schools across the province, ldquothese changes must always be made while putting the wellbeing and educational outcomes of children first.He added: ldquoThere does appear to be practical concerns with this proposal, particularly regarding implementation which will need to be addressedany amalgamation is to be delivered in a way that will benefit all pupils.ldquoIt is vital that the concerns of parents and other stakeholders are considered and the change management process is handled in a way which delivers for everyone in the community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Annsborough school forms community forum group  ","story":"A NEW community engagement forum has been launched at Annsborough Integrated Primary School.This exciting new development will involve parents, governors, staff and past pupils working with officers from the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education, supported by investment from the Integrated Education Fund.Speaking at the launch last Thursday, Lynda Brown, school principal, said she was pleased at the investment and support being offered by NICIE and the IEF.ldquoThere is a great buzz in the school tonight and itrsquos lovely to see so many parents, governors and families attending from within our local community, she remarked.Ms Brown welcomed Tina Merron, Chief Executive Officer of the IEF, Roisin Marshall, CEO of NICIE, and Denise Morgan, Senior Development Officer with NICIE.She said the school community looked forward to working with them to build on the Integrated education being offered at Annsborough IPS.ldquoWe are keen to work with our local community to ensure that integrated provision is available for all who desire it in future, she added.Ms Marshall said she was ldquodelighted to be at the school to discuss the future growth of integrated education in the area.She remarked: ldquoItrsquos always really nice to get the chance to meet people who are committed to working together for their local communities to ensure that children and adults can have opportunities to work together under one roof mdash Protestant,Catholic, other faiths and none.

Little was seen of Ards attack in the first half, but with  minutes gone Nathan McShane had to be alert to head an in-swinging corner from Brian Cabraley off the line.McGrady, Branagan and Telford continued to give the Ards defence plenty to think about and with  minutes gone Downpatrick made it -. Branagan worked his way into a good position on the right and fired over a tempting cross that flew into the top left hand corner of the net, giving the visiting goalkeeper no chance.Downpatrick went in at the break, worthy of their three-goal advantage, but they were unable to kick on from there in the second half.Ards were the more aggressive after the break and Downpatrick were put under a certain amount of pressure, but Anthony Doherty, Conor Moore, Nathan McShane and Caolan Logue all defended superbly and provided resolute cover to captain Kieran Gordon in goal.Gordon was only beaten once and that was in the th minute when McCleary tucked away a cross from Dunlop in a clever move.Ards continued to push and probe, but a hard-working Downpatrick side refused to give way and thoroughly deserved their first three points of the season.Downpatrick FC: K Gordon, C Logue, N McShane, C Moore, A Doherty, J Branagan, C McGrady, Adrian McCoubrey, M McGarritty, Andrew McCoubrey, P Telford.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world.

Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people.

If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Leo Varadkar He was responding to comments made by Mr Varadkar on Saturday, in which he claimed that Brexit is undermining  years of peace in Northern Ireland.Speaking on RTE Radio One’s Marian Finucane programme, the taoiseach said: “Brexit has undermined the Good Friday Agreement and it is fraying relationships between Britain and Ireland.“Anything that pulls the two communities apart in Northern Ireland undermines the Good Friday Agreement and anything that pulls Britain and Ireland apart undermines that relationship.”His comments came two days after Nobel peace prize winner and Conservative Lord Trimble accused Mr Varadkar’s government of “riding roughshod” over the  agreement.   UUP leader Robin Swann Responding to the Irish premier’s remarks, Mr Swann said: “The tone of the language coming from Leo Varadkar at the weekend is, at best, disappointing and, at worst, a deliberate attempt to heighten tensions. “His words and tone are in direct contradiction to the approach adopted by his own Foreign Minister Simon Coveney at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.“If not handled properly, Brexit could undermine relationships between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, but I certainly didn’t expect the prime minister of the Republic to be directly involved in attempting to enhance the deterioration of those relationships. His words have a direct impact in Northern Ireland and not in a positive sense. “Instead of grandstanding to a domestic audience with one eye on an Irish general election, the taoiseach should start listening and taking advice rather than attempting to put his spin on the negotiations.” Backing Lord Trimble’s comments, Mr Swann added: “Whenever a Nobel peace prize winner tells the taoiseach that his government is riding roughshod over the Belfast Agreement, perhaps it’s time he started listening instead of talking. Perhaps it’s time he started concentrating on getting a deal for the benefit of everyone.”Serious assault: Man suffers suspected broken leg Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Inside the bell are the remains of an iron ‘clapper’ which struck the side to make the bell sound, but as it has corroded the bell is now silent. The new display has been made possible through a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, which has also enabled a community engagement programme around the item of shared heritage to take place.Dr Greer Ramsey, curator of archaeology at National Museums NI, explained the bell’s signicance, saying: “Along with religious books and the hooked staff or crozier carried by a bishop, bells became potent symbols of the Christian faith and even feature on stone carvings from this period.“Many hand bells were reputed to have connections to early saints so it was common for people to believe bells like this had miraculous powers.”To mark the recent discovery and display of the Ballyclog bell, there will be a special event at the Ulster Museum on November .Entitled, ‘Early Christian Ireland: Hand Bells, High Crosses, Music and More’, a series of talks will look at le in early Christian Ireland, at the use of church hand bells and at the identity of a mysterious musical instrument.

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. Pic by Brian Lawless, PA Reports at the weekend that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has privately demanded the right to pull Britain out of the EU’s proposed Irish backstop after just three months has been criticised by the Irish government.Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said that their position remains “consistent and clear” that a time-limited backstop will never be agreed to by Ireland or the EU.Speaking on Monday, Mr Varadkar described the UK as a “ided kingdom”, which he said has not helped the negotiation process.“The UK in many ways is a ided kingdom, the people are split   over whether they want to leave the European Union or not,” he said.“The Cabinet seems ided, the Government seems ided, Parliament is ided, and that has made it very dficult to come to an agreement.“I’d much prefer to have a united kingdom, a united country, to be our partner in these negotiations, but we don’t, so we have to work through.“Thankfully in Ireland we have a government that is united, and we have in Parliament as well, that’s largely united behind the Government on this issue.”He said that the Irish Government was working hard to try to reach an agreement by the end of the year but added that it cannot countenance the idea of a three-month limit to the backstop agreement.“A backstop with a three-month limit on it or expiry date of that nature isn’t worth the paper it’s written on and what the backstop the UK Government has signed up to is a legally operative backstop that will apply unless and until we have any agreement to supersede it,” he continued.“I think it’s reasonable for us to expect a country like the United Kingdom and a government like the UK Government to stand by its commitments.”He spoke as he attended an official opening of a newly built development of  social homes in north Dublin.We need to knowattorney-general thinks backstop could tear Northern Ireland out of UK, says David DavisAs I keep saying, the past is still way, way ahead of us Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The new housing features  one, two and three-bedroom apartments and  townhouses and will provide homes for  people.It comes as the number of homeless people living in emergency accommodation increased last month, adding to the country’s housing crisis.Mr Varadkar said the new housing development is an example of the Government’s attempt to sort out the housing shortage.He added: “Of course to some of our opponents, particularly those on the left, this place doesn’t exist because it’s not directly built by a local authority, it’s built through a partnership involving the city council and Oaklee Housing Trust.“I think to the people who live here they will tell you that it does exist and that it provides really high quality public housing.”try catch     .               ..

The former Brexit secretary David Davis, left, with fellow Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg at the launch of the Institute of Economic Affairs latest Brexit research paper in London in September. Photo: Victoria Jones PA Wire In a major intervention on the controversial backstop, amid reports that the government plans to keep Northern Ireland in aspects of the EU trade structures, Mr Davis said it was “pretty clear there is genuine and signicant concern regarding the implications of any fresh backstop text”.Writing in the Sunday Times, Mr Davis said: “It was an unwise decision to accept the EU’s language on dealing with the Northern Ireland border. “I said so back then and I’m still concerned now. Downing Street officials misled ministers at the time. “The Democratic Unionist Party is rightly worried about the future of the Union and many Conservatives are too.   The Housing, Communities and Local Government Secretary James Brokenshire, who was formerly Northern Ireland secretary, speaking to host Andrew Marr, during the BBC current affairs programme, The Andrew Marr Show yesterday. Photo: Jeff Overs BBC PA Wire Mr Davis said: “If the attorney-general has warned — as has been reported — that the UK will not know when the backstop would end and compared it to being stuck in Dante’s first circle of hell, then it’s time to put an end to this nonsense once and for all.”Mr Davis said: “We need the cards laid on the table so we can form a judgment.”The Conservative MP said that Tony Blair’s failure to publish his own government’s legal advice from its then attorney-general on the Iraq war meant that the Labour prime minister’s reputation “never recovered”.In other developments on Brexit yesterday, the former Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire said that negotiations were ongoing,amid reports that major concessions had been made by Brussels.The Sunday Times reported that the EU would allow the creation of a whole-UK customs union that would avoid the need for a Northern Ireland border “backstop” that has been at the heart of the impasse in negotiations.At the same time, it reported that the prime minister was on course to agree a future economic partnership that would leave open the possibility of Canada-style free trade deal sought by Brexiteers.Mr Brokenshire, appearing on television, was askeda deal was close, replying: “Well, we want to get that deal, we’re obviously working hard to see that that happens.“Negotiations are still very firmly continuing, and therefore we are % of the way there in relation to the Withdrawal Agreement.Brexit: UUP ‘disappointment’ over Leo Varadkar’s tone Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Obviously still having this issue in relation to the insurance arrangements for Northern Ireland and Ireland, and that very much remains our focus and attention in getting that deal.”A Downing Street spokeswoman added: “The prime minister is clear we are leaving the customs union.“We are making good progress on the future relationship, and % of the Withdrawal Agreement has been settled. “Negotiations are ongoing.”A spokesman for Ireland’s Tanaiste Simon Coveney said: “The UK has given written commitments last December and March that the Withdrawal Agreement will include a legal guarantee of noto a hard border in Ireland in any circumstance.“In March the UK agreed this backstop will apply ‘unless and until’ a close future relationship eliminates any need for border infrastructure or related checks and controls.“While we too hope the Northern Ireland backstop will never be required to be used, it will be required to be written down in legal text.“This has been committed to by the UK in order to have a Withdrawal Agreement. “We hope a deal can be done but we’re not there yet.”It came as more than  business leaders backed a referendum on the terms of the Brexit deal, warning that the UK faces “either a blindfold or a destructive hard Brexit” that would be bad for both firms and jobs.Waterstones chief executive James Daunt, ex-Sainsbury’s chief executive Justin King, Lastminute founder Baroness Lane-Fox and Innocent Drinks co-founder Richard Reed were among signatories of a letter calling for a People’s Vote on leaving the European Union.The letter argues that both the government’s current plans for Brexit, and a no-deal Brexit, would leave the country worse off than they were being in the EUthe country left in March.Other people who put their name to the letter include Cobra Beer founder Lord Bilimoria, the former Marks and Spencer chairman and ex-Labour peer Lord Myners, Alex Chesterman, the founder of the Zoopla property website, and Sir Simon Robertson, the ex-chairmanof Rolls-Royce.• Morning View: We need to see full legal

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required. This will be used for court fees and to put together a strong legal challenge against the mud being dumped in Wales.ldquoIrsquom concerned because I do not believe enough testing has been done. Wersquore talking about mud being dredged from outside a nuclear reactor.Energy company EDF are dredging the mud ahead of building two new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. The company said the dredging is necessary ahead of drilling that needs to be done ahead of works for the new reactors.       ,params: .pushEnvironmental watchdog Natural Resources Walesgranted the licence for the dumping and insist that it is safe.A spokesman for NRW said: ldquoEvery element of the application was considered thoroughly including testing of the sediment from the dredge sites by independent experts in accordance with international standards and guidelines, and advice from health experts. The results showed the material was suitable for disposal at sea.ldquoWersquove tried to reassure people that the proposed activity will not harm people or the environment.EDF says the dredging of mud from the seabed off the Hinkley Point C site is necessary ahead of drilling six vertical shafts for the cooling water system for the new nuclear power station.However, those against the dredging say it could pose health risks.Max Wallis of Friends of the Earth, Penarth and Barry said: ldquoThe NRW up to recently stated the EIA for dumping had been covered in the EIA for the jetty development in Somerset, covered by the Environment Agency but this was contradicted by CEFASrsquos statement of , Nevertheless the NRWissued the  license.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These ideas are not backstops at all + donrsquot deliver on previous UK commitments ###Brexit pic yAQVjMomdash Simon CoveneyNovember , Speaking on Monday, Mr Varadkar described the UK as a ldquoided kingdom, which he said has not helped the negotiation process.ldquoThe UK in many ways is a ided kingdom, the people are split   over whether they want to leave the European Union or not, he said.ldquoThe Cabinet seems ided, the Government seems ided, Parliament is ided, and that has made it very dficult to come to an agreement.ldquoIrsquod much prefer to have a united kingdom, a united country, to be our partner in these negotiations, but we donrsquot, so we have to work through.ldquoThankfully in Ireland we have a government that is united, and we have in Parliament as well, thatrsquos largely united behind the Government on this issue.He said that the Irish Government was working hard to try to reach an agreement by the end of the year but added that it cannot countenance the idea of a three-month limit to the backstop agreement.Leo Varadkarand junior housing minister Damien English at the opening of a new housing development ldquoA backstop with a three-month limit on it or expiry date of that nature isnrsquot worth the paper itrsquos written on and what the backstop the UK Government has signed up to is a legally operative backstop that will apply unless and until we have any agreement to supersede it, he continued.ldquoI think itrsquos reasonable for us to expect a country like the United Kingdom and a government like the UK Government to stand by its commitments.He spoke as he attended an official opening of a newly built development of  social homes in north Dublin.The new housing features  one, two and three-bedroom apartments and  townhouses and will provide homes for  people.It comes as the number of homeless people living in emergency accommodation increased last month, adding to the countryrsquos housing crisis.Mr Varadkar said the new housing development is an example of the Governmentrsquos attempt to sort out the housing shortage.He added: ldquoOf course to some of our opponents, particularly those on the left, this place doesnrsquot exist because itrsquos not directly built by a local authority, itrsquos built through a partnership involving the city council and Oaklee Housing Trust.ldquoI think to the people who live here they will tell you that it does exist and that it provides really high quality public housing..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Leo Varadkar dismisses time-limited backstop article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

Belfast City Council’s planning committee approved Primark’s listed building consent application for the Bank Buildings. It means the conservation-led works to take down the top two floors of Bank Buildings can now begin. “Once these unstable elements are removed, works can take place to install a facade retention scheme,” the council said. “It will also make it possible to reduce the cordon and restore pedestrian access between Royal Avenue and Donegall Place, subject to health and safety considerations as work takes place.” It also means Primark will be able to open up once again, at the building’s new extension. Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium , said: \"This is terric news for Primark and for the retail hub of Belfast City Centre. Now that planning has been granted they can start the work to bring down the facade and put up the protection that will allow the cordon to reduce and for stores within the cordon to open. “This will be a le line for those traders in the cordon and those without who have seen their footfall drop by over %.

Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
