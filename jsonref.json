Among the scenes from the film that could now be frowned upon is a sequence when Aykroyd’s character ‘blacks up’ on a train and others featuring Curtis’s character Ophelia topless.But the decision to swap the genders of two of the film’s key roles for the stage show will be seen as controversial by many of the movie’s more devoted fans.One showbusiness source, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Everyone is sworn to secrecy about the project at the moment but the plan is to turn Eddie’s character into a woman and to have the character of the prostitute played by Jamie Lee Curtis become transgender. When the film was released in 1983, it was enormously successful yet now it is perceived in some quarters as racist and politically incorrect.

Thousands of \u0027virtuous paedophiles\u0027 who have sexual attraction to children but do not want to act on it, are seeking help online from support groups like VirPed.orgAccording to the American website Association for Sexual Abuse Prevention, sexual attraction to children is a disturbingly common disorder.Studies have shown one in four adult men anonymously acknowledged some level of sexual attraction to prepubescent children, with up to one in 20 adult men qualifying for a formal diagnosis of paedophilic disorder, the association says on it website.Experts believe thousands of teenage boys each year come to the horrifying realisation that they are attracted to children and have nowhere to turn for help.Being born a paedophile does not mean a person will go on to offend or molest children, as many pedophiles don\u0027t want to act on their urges, Dr Cantor said.  Todd Nickerson is one such virtuous paedophile.Aged in his mid-40s, Nickerson is a virgin from Tennessee, USA, who seeks support from others like him in online forums and chat rooms.Mr Nickerson, who says he never acted on his impulses, outed himself as a \u0027virtuous paedophile\u0027 in 2015 and said it was like a great burden had been lifted from him, as people now take him at face value.  He helps to run an online forum to support others who do not act on their desires. Online support can be found on a site called Virtuous Pedophiles which has hundreds of members. Griffith University researcher Danielle Harris from the School of Criminology said there were no services for \u0027virtuous paedophiles\u0027 in Australia - but they were desperately needed.\u0027(There is)  so much more we could do in the prevention space,\u0027 she told Daily Mail Australia on Monday.\u0027We can\u0027t arrest our way out of this and it\u0027s imperative that we focus our efforts further upstream - on onset and the lead up to it.\u0027  Dr Harris said most people who are unfamiliar with the condition may think it strange - but those familiar with the science were strong advocates for services such as the Stop It Now program in the US. \u0027Primary prevention - offering more general intervention before something happens, directing resources to at-risk groups and providing more general education and awareness - is the only approach that makes sense.\u0027 60 MINUTES: \u0027Virtuous paedophiles\u0027 call for greater supports to prevent offendingHelping people with pedophilia 541-891-6168 or 785-231-9748 - Home"},{"url":null,"title":"Labour Tory election pledges Government spending return highest levels 1970s","story":"Share this article This is on top of existing pledges to scrap student tuition fees and renationalise the Royal Mail, train companies and some utility firms.Last night the Resolution Foundation think-tank said that whoever wins the election, government spending as a share of GDP will return to levels not seen for the past four decades.Tory proposals would see the state accounting for 42 per cent of GDP – used to estimate the size of a country\u0027s economy – within four years, while under Labour it would be even higher at just over 43 per cent.         Labour is promising its own spending spree, and yesterday announced a new \u0027warm homes for all\u0027 pledge to install loft insulation, double glazing and \u0027green\u0027 technology in millions of homes       Matt Whittaker, deputy chief executive at the foundation, said: \u0027After an unprecedented decade of austerity, both main parties are gearing up to turn the spending taps back on.\u0027The shared commitments to ending austerity, reversing elements of it, and big infrastructure plans mean that Britain could be heading back to a 1970s-sized state, whoever wins the next election.\u0027The Tories\u0027 spending pledges include a 3.9 per cent rise in the state pension, an end to the four-year benefits freeze, with handouts rising by 1.7 per cent, a rise in the National Living Wage to £10.50 and an extra £155million for sixth forms and colleges.         It was reported yesterday that the Chancellor has privately expressed concern the manifesto will contain the most expensive set of policies in decades, slashing his room for manoeuvre to deliver tax cuts.The benefits and pensions rise alone will cost £5billion a year.Yesterday Rishi Sunak, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, denied claims by the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr that the Tories were \u0027spending money like water\u0027.He said: \u0027I think what you\u0027ll see in our manifesto is it will be fully costed and in that you will see, as you would expect from a Conservative government, responsible economic management.\u0027In its analysis, the Resolution Foundation said that simply maintaining public service spending as a share of the economy could mean overall government spending rising to 41.3 per cent of GDP by 2023 under the Conservatives because of Mr Javid\u0027s plans for a big rise in infrastructure spending.Spending would be well above the average 37.4 per cent recorded in the two decades running up to the 2008 financial crisis, and only marginally below the 42 per cent average from 1966 to 1984.The think-tank said Labour\u0027s manifesto plans would see spending soar to 43.3 per cent of GDP.Spending in the 1970s was higher in part because more was spent on defence during the Cold War and because Britain was still paying off war debts.In addition governments used to react to recessions by boosting state spending – an idea which came to an end under Margaret Thatcher."},{"url":null,"title":"Greggs blasted tempting children pizza pop promotion starts 4pm","story":"Share this article          The £2 pizza deal is one of many (pictured) but is only available after 4pm which has received criticism from Professor Jonathan Valabhji, NHS national clinical director for diabetes and obesity.

It affects how you take pictures, how the camera is held, how you edit work, the immediacy of it.

Or, at least, the fantasy wasn’t mine alone. The escapades were thanks to my compulsive reading of Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials. Northern Lights, the first book in the His Dark Materials trilogy, was published in 1995, when I was four, so it was a few years after it came out that I fell for Pullman’s writing. But when I finally did … boy, did I fall hard. I zoned out of sleepovers with friends, family dinners, and – on one occasion – my brother’s wedding as I joined Pullman’s heroine, Lyra, on thrilling Arctic voyages and skirmishes in parallel universes.If I detailed all the reasons I loved the trilogy, I’d take up the whole newspaper. But it comes down to three things. First, I loved Lyra who, thanks to her daring and mischief, allowed me to glimpse what life would be like were I not such a timid teacher’s pet. Second, there were Pullman’s irresistible “daemons” – a kind of animal self. A companion who could shape-shift from seal to snow leopard seemed an improvement on my drab imaginary friend, Cheryl. And third, it felt … rebellious. I had a cosy Church of Wales upbringing where the history of Christianity was presented as an uninterrupted stretch of benevolence. Pullman’s scrutiny of the authoritarian side of religion was as invigorating as a blast of the Arctic air I’d read about in his books.I grew up, and finally consented to read a few other books – but my devotion to Pullman never diminished. Which is why I’m positively writhing with excitement about the all-star TV adaptation which kicks off on Sunday night on BBC One.The palpable hype among my generation is proof of something I’ve always suspected: that the books we encounter as children are the ones to which we’re most attached. After all, while it’s not inconceivable that one would throw a viewing party for a TV adaptation of the work of a writer discovered in adulthood, it seems more likely to happen with a children’s author. (My flat. 8pm. “Armoured bear” makes a good cold weather costume.)I’d argue, then, that our fondness for children’s books not only comes from the familiarity forged through re-reading but from the reason we re-read, too. As Mangan says, children’s books are where we first encounter myriad aspects of life. Such intense periods of discovery tend to lodge in the memory.There’s also another factor: time. In youth, entire days are spent in uninterrupted stretches of reading. It’s harder when you have a job and WhatsApp. Mangan also notes that higher expectations mean these “days of effortless immersion” are harder to come by in adulthood. “As an adult, your tastes (andor prejudices) are more developed, your time is more precious and your critical faculties are harder to switch off.” Children, on the other hand, are joyously uninhibited when they read – in other words, they’re not fretting about whether the book will fit with their #personalbrand on Instagram.In addition, author Katherine Rundell has suggested that children’s books work on two levels, simultaneously satisfying kids’ thirst for adventure and incorporating the adult author’s awareness of the knottier aspects of life. Indeed, they’re required to operate on two planes if they’re to avoid boring parents who are reading to their offspring. So, in a way, children’s books work harder than books for adults, conveying many-layered meaning with the sort of lightness required to hold short attention s. Such finesse doesn’t go unnoticed by readers.All of this is why, when someone inquires about your favourite book and you insist it’s a toss-up between Bernardine Evaristo’s Booker prize-winning Girl, Woman, Other and Virginia Woolf’s To The Lighthouse, they’ll know you’re lying. Neither of these can be your favourite book – or, at least, the book that has had the greatest influence on you. The books that mark us most profoundly – that burrow into our psyches and shape how we see the world – are the ones we read as children.Of course, some sneer that children’s books are rife with nostalgia. But the nostalgia in question isn’t a “take back control” yearning for a simpler time – but for a simpler way of seeing. Childhood reading overlaps with a period where the future seems wide open. What we’re looking to resurrect through kids’ books isn’t the past, but this beguilingly cheery perspective.Besides, the great gift of Pullman’s stories set in Lyra’s universe is that they’re part of the present as much as the past. Along with the TV series, anyone who’s been in a bookshop recently will know Pullman is still adding to the series – The Secret Commonwealth, the second book in The Book of Dust trilogy (which is interlinked with His Dark Materials) was published last month. It revisits Lyra in her 20s. I’ve already read it twice. Perhaps it’s not only childhood that gets lost to literary escapism, after all.I was addicted to Little Women and the three books that followed it. I adored reading about sensible Meg, Tomboy Jo, ailing Beth and spoilt Amy with her blond ringlets (I envied her those). I am not sure that I identified with any of the Little Women but the narrative escape was as complete as vanishing into another country (Massachusetts, America, to be precise). Nowadays, I think the main reason these books enslaved their readers was to do with Alcott’s virtuoso sentimentality. We are so used to disdaining sentimentality,we forget what a force it can be. Kate Kellaway, Observer writerMy mother gave me Frances Hodgson Burnett’s A Little Princess when I was princess-age, and its story of the suffering of Sara Crewe was once my favourite. But that was because I hadn’t read The Secret Garden yet. Reading it this September, through a depression that was starting to lift, Mary Lennox taming her tantrums in the Yorkshire air and lifting her sadness as the daffodils bloomed felt like the metaphor I needed. Sara Crewe is always good, just tested by circumstances Mary Lennox is spoiled but learns to be good to herself, and to others. It is a very Victorian rewilding – the stiff father repents and returns, and love for nature is elided into love for God – but it gives a girl hope, because it shows that her happiness is in her own hands. Joanna Biggs, writer and assistant editor of the London Review of BooksI’m envious of children who grew up with The Gruffalo or The Amber Spyglass. My juvenile reading lacked such contemporary wonders. We read what our parents had read. The landscape of the postwar child’s imagination was dominated by Victorian classics (Alice), or Edwardian stalwarts (Swallows \u0026amp Amazons). For me, reading was about transgression not fantasy. My favourite was the adventures of 007. Casino Royale was published the year I was born, 1953. James Bond is my Harry Potter. Addicted to reading – the flashlight beneath the bedclothes – it was Fleming’s thrillers (Dr No, Goldfinger, From Russia with Love) that became the literary drug I look back on with longing, shame and regret. Robert McCrum, writer and associate editor of the ObserverI don’t remember when I first read Mary Norton’s The Borrowers. It seems it was always part of my childhood. As with the very best children’s books, it filled my world with magic. In each place we lived I looked for nooks and crannies where our family of Borrowers might live. When small things went missing, I would be convinced it had been ‘borrowed’, and puzzle at how tiny people might use one plastic Barbie shoe (perhaps a soup bowl?). The Borrowers kept my imagination alight and, in a childhood where I moved frequently and often felt lonely, those tiny creatures became secret friends and I, their beloved, watched over, ‘human bean’."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c01b142dcaa51024748cfaec66d92fa2b17ce24c/0_85_4785_2871/master/4785.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de092a3b008d580b6dfa8a09a48a37b4","title":"disturbance surviving charlie hebdo by philippe lancon review","story":"On 7 January 2015, Philippe Lançon was confronted with a freelance journalist’s dilemma. Should he go straight to Libération, the newspaper for which he was a longstanding cultural critic. Or should he drop in on the way to the editorial meeting of the struggling satirical weekly to which he was a more recent contributor. In the end he decided to stop by at the weekly, which was called Charlie Hebdo.What happened at that meeting, and the dreadful personal aftermath it wrought, is the subject of Lançon’s powerful memoir, Disturbance: Surviving Charlie Hebdo (first published in France last year when it was the recipient of several awards). As the world knows, that morning Said and Chérif Kouachi, a pair of Islamist brothers with a record of terrorist involvement, forced their way into Charlie Hebdo’s Paris office, armed with assault rifles, submachine guns and a pump action shotgun, and slaughtered 12 people and injured 11 others, before fleeing in a getaway car.But as the attack unfolded, Lançon knew nothing of these facts. He describes what took place in haunting, fractured detail, as a scene of merriment and intellectual cut-and-thrust is transformed, in a matter of seconds, into one of astonishing carnage. After the first lethal volley of shots, he pretended to be dead on the floor, but some irresistible impulse – journalistic curiosity? A fear of the unknown? – made him open his eyes as one of the killers stood over him.Instead of finishing him off, the killer turned and left the building. Lançon did not know why he was spared. At the time, he thought he’d only suffered a minor injury. In reality, the Kouachis had blown away the lower third of his face. Everything below his upper lip was a gaping hole.The brutality of the attack stands in disturbing contrast to the subtlety of Lançon’s prose. In one sense, it’s a characteristic response of a Parisian intellectual. To the violence inflicted by the deluded jihadists, he offers literary erudition and analytical reflection. He liberally cites the kind of names that are the bedrock of a certain kind of French education: Chateaubriand, Flaubert, Baudelaire, Foucault – though, unusually, there’s also a significant contribution from Orwell. He’s the kind of guy who, to relieve sexual tension, will read a volume of Saint‑Simon.The extremity of his condition brings out a bitter taste for paradox. There are plenty of sentences like this one: “Reality no longer seems to be anything more than a denial of reality.” At times, Lançon can lean towards a kind of parody of the French high style, but it’s essentially a book about a man struggling to make sense of his radically transformed world.He remains hospitalised for over a year, undergoing countless operations to fix his shattered face. And it is this experience – the survival instinct, the desperation, the morphine numbness – that is the focus of Disturbance. Those hoping for a more overtly political book will be disappointed. The attack on Charlie Hebdo was a galvanising event, both for European Islamists and their opponents. In a way, it was savagely clarifying: either you were for free speech or you weren’t.But there was also an influential section of progressive opinion that, while performing the throat-clearance of denouncing the killers, also suggested that the avowedly leftwing Charlie Hebdo brought the attack on itself, by first publishing the Danish cartoons and then a series of caricatures that mocked Muslims (it also mocked Christians, Jews and other religious groups). They were accused of “punching down”, of ridiculing a minority and, indeed, of racism. As a group of celebrated writers put it, in protesting against an American Pen freedom of expression award to the French magazine, “in an unequal society, equal opportunity offence does not have an equal effect”.Such debates don’t really get a look-in here – although Lançon makes an ironic reference to a friend as “a socialist, but of the left – there are still some of those”. He is understandably more interested in his jaw, which continues to leak after several operations, and the social tensions his plight causes among his intimates. At one stage, his Cuban girlfriend accuses him of relishing the celebrity that the attack has brought him. But given that he’s cooped up in a hospital, unable to speak, with a disfigured face, who would deny him the meagre compensation of fame?The book is remarkably free of anger at either the Kouachis or the ideology that inspired them. Without resorting to polemic, it’s an argument in favour of the intellectual life, of ideas as beautiful abstractions, weaponised only as satire, never as terror. It feels reassuringly rarefied, like an old-fashioned French talking-heads movie. But its weakness is that there is little sense of a world beyond the whitewashed hospital rooms in which he’s treated or the book-lined ones from which he was so horrifically torn.• Disturbance: Surviving Charlie Hebdo by Philippe Lançon (translated by Steven Rendall) is published by Europa Editions (£14.99)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e2c666cc5fa4a02f7e0758552ed809e09aa789f/0_283_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aed2b3e5dca00e442507239369f3af4e","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, an admirable post from steevieb, who has had a change of heart about Elizabeth Strout’s Olive Kitteridge:Some time ago (years) I began reading Olive Kitteridge. Just couldn’t get on with it though, got bored with the small town America bit. Last week I decided to give it another go, I am so glad I did, totally blew me away, beautifully written, I loved every page so much that I immediately bought Amy and Isabelle, which to me was even better. How I could have been bored by it (Olive K) the first time around is a puzzle. Moods, I guess.Tom Mooney has also been rereading some classics:Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea, not for the first time. It is wonderful, perfect even. I found some of it a little tougher to read this time, particularly the killing of the sharks (I had been reading a LOT of Cormac McCarthy around the time I read it before so was likely very desensitised!) but it stands up magnificently to repeated reading.I must be in the mood for old stuff as I also recently reread The Swimmer, John Cheever’s glorious masterpiece of a short story. It’s one of my all-time favourites and shows what a sharp writer he was.Night Waking by Sarah Moss has satisfied BobHammond2:Set on the fictional Scottish island of Colonsay, academic Anna is trying to juggle the challenges of motherhood, marriage, her academic career and a fair amount of sleep deprivation - and then a mystery around a baby’s skeleton buried outside her house on the island. Overlaid on top of this is a separate timeline where we see, throughout the book, a series of letters written by a midwife sent to the island back in the late 1800s to improve infant mortality. So, Moss has a lot to juggle but she does it brilliantly and the two separate stories and all the loose threads are brought together at the end of the book for a very satisfying conclusion.fuzzywuzz has enjoyed The Body by Bill Bryson:What a marvellous adventure I have been on, taking a tour of the various organ systems within a human being. Although I studied biochemistry and physiology in my student days, I have learned some interesting new things and revisited already known facts.What I particularly like about Bryson’s style here is that he has taken some complex subject areas such as immunology and transfusion science and distilled them into something which can be mentally digested by those without a scientific background and does so without patronising the reader.ID673795 has enjoyed Caravan of the Lost and Left Behind by Deirdre Shanahan:The story of a woman traveller and her son returning from chaotic lives in England to live on a traveller’s site in Ireland with her father, where she also hopes to find her daughter, left there as a baby. The landscape is beautifully described and the story very sad but in the end hopeful.BanjoGuru has just finished But Beautiful by Geoff Dyer “which I enjoyed a lot”:I was expecting straight biographies of some jazz greats, but it’s an altogether stranger beast - part imagined, part true, full of shifting perspectives and illusions and some really perceptive and evocative prose. I can recommend it if you like jazz, or even if you don’t.Now this is a funny and wise book. The quips and cultural insights are ridiculously true. Especially about the X and Y generations. Professor Chandra himself is a true delight … I found myself asking, “So who IS this smart guy who wrote this fine book?” That’s when you know it’s a good’un. This book is smart, hilarious, and best of all ... kindhearted. Yes, filled with an open hearted way of looking at the people we love and our struggles as well as struggles of our world and culture today.Finally, MarGar65 has just finished Penelope Fitzgerald’s Innocence:I loved it. I am so glad her books have come into my life! What an observant author ... What trust she places in us as she unfolds her stories. She refuses to bend to the expectation of a happy ending. I fear I am running out of To-Be-Read Fitzgeralds ... This is most alarming in a sense because I will run out of new Fitzgeralds, but I am relieved when I think that I can go always go back and reread them all.Going back to reread Fitzgerald sounds like an admirable idea. Just the kind of thing that should get us through winter…If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Leigh Day are acting for nearly 2,000 claimants – children and their parents – and expect that up to 15,000 will join the case.US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on Friday issued a Withhold Release order on tobacco from Malawi, meaning shipments arriving in the United States will be detained at the port of entry. Importers will have to prove the tobacco is not produced with labour prohibited under US law to have the shipment released.Customs and Border Protection said it had issued the order based on information collected by the agency that reasonably indicated the tobacco from Malawi was produced using forced labour and forced child labour. It said it collects information from a variety of sources, including the general public.“CBP wants to ensure the business community is compliant with the law requiring clean supply chains with no use of forced labour of any kind,” said Brenda Smith, the executive assistant commissioner of CBP’s office of trade.The CBP said importers “may offer proof that their tobacco and tobacco-containing products do not include tobacco from Malawi that was produced with labour prohibited under US law”. Experts believe this will force companies to engage with the issue on the ground in Malawi.The big tobacco companies all say they are opposed to child labour and fund various sustainability programmes to work against it. However, the International Labour Organisation of the United Nations has said that child labour in tobacco is increasing, not reducing.The letter of claim sent to BAT by human rights lawyers Leigh Day at the start of their fight for compensation for the families alleges that the company is responsible for the low price paid for the tobacco leaf in Malawi, which keeps tenant farmers in such poverty that they have no choice but to make their children work in the fields before and after school and at the weekend. During the harvest season, few of the farmers’ children go to school at all. found that families are caught in a poverty trap, moving to the tobacco farms in the hope of a lump sum for the crop at the end of the season that will allow them to set up in business and have a better life. But they live on a bag of maize a month, supplied by the landowner, and have to borrow money for school fees, any transport and other needs over the 10-month growing season. According to Leigh Day’s letter of claim, after the crop is sold, they are typically left with £100 to £200 after deductions for the money they have borrowed, which is not enough to return home.Leigh Day’s letter of claim alleges that BAT is guilty of “unjust enrichment”, unfairly profiting from the hard labour of children and their families in Malawi without adequate compensation. If they win the case, which could last for three or four years, it is likely that the price paid for tobacco would have to rise to prevent more claimants taking legal action in the future, which would improve the quality of farmers’ lives and enable their children to get an education.BAT says its core policies “specifically state that we do not condone forced, bonded or involuntary labour and that we do not condone or employ child labour, and seek to ensure that the welfare, health and safety of children are paramount at all times”. It says its leaf operations and contracted suppliers are required to participate in an industry-wide sustainable tobacco programme, aligned with United Nations standards, including on child labour and income for farm workers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cec884a35c7a6e6fc1a34130126a8e70213e8e7/0_191_3979_2387/master/3979.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7da9dc9d1cda71ba5d1f77005dde3c19","title":"call for ban on uk private jets by 2025 as flight traffic soars","story":"Private jet flights to and from UK airports contribute as much to the climate crisis as 450,000 cars per year and should be banned as soon as 2025 to encourage development of electric planes, according to a thinktank with close ties to the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn.The thinktank said the global heating impact of private flights to and from UK airports is roughly 1m tonnes of CO2 equivalent each year – the same as the annual emissions of around 450,000 typical cars on Britain’s roads.It said that one private flight from London to New York was equivalent to driving a typical UK car non-stop for four and a half years. It added that a ban in five years’ time would help spur the development of electric alternatives.Shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said the party would examine the report and “consult with industry on the introduction of a phase-out date for the use of fossil fuel private jets”.Climate targets cannot be met without curbing pollution from air travel, and a passenger on a private jet produces 10 times the emissions of someone on a regular flight. This simply cannot be ignored.”According to the Common Wealth assessment, a typical private jet passenger journey within Europe emits seven times as much greenhouse gas as a flight in business class on a typical airliner – 10 times as much as flying economy class and around 150 times as much as an equivalent journey using high-speed rail.Almost half of all private jet traffic in Britain passes through five airports around London, given its status as the home to the most billionaires in Europe and as one of the world’s biggest financial centres. Luton airport, roughly an hour north of the capital is the busiest, with almost 15,000 private aircraft departures in 2017, followed by Farnborough, Biggin Hill, Stansted and Northolt.Some of Britain’s richest people use private jets. Prince Harry has faced criticism for taking private jets for short-hop breaks while campaigning against global heating. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the chief executive of petrochemicals company Ineos, who is Britain’s third richest man with an £18bn fortune, has four private jets and a helicopter, while Sir James Dyson, the electrical products entrepreneur and fifth richest man in Britain, owns a £55m private jet.The new analysis of private jets in the Common Wealth report, compiled by Leo Murray of Free Ride, a campaign group calling for a frequent flyer levy, and Jamie Beevor of Green Gumption, an environmental consultancy, suggested most carbon-emitting private flights to and from UK airports could be handled by new electric aircraft in future.The study found that as many as four out of five private jet journeys within Europe today cover distances that could be completed by small electric aircraft currently in commercial development that would enter the market in the mid 2020s.The report said: “We believe that an imminent ban on landing at UK airports in a fossil-powered private jet would help to focus the minds of some of the wealthiest people on Earth on the urgent need to develop fully electric planes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ccaa7d99b7368a9596d632272e517934c7d1ae3/34_346_4512_2708/master/4512.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df79d34871d0b8f504ce52eef62e3b4f","title":"worlds largest trade deal rcep faces delay as india pushes back against china","story":"Sixteen-nation Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership will cover half the planet’s peopleThe world’s largest trade deal is unlikely to be signed this year, with a draft statement from south-east Asian leaders suggesting it will be delayed until 2020, despite China’s desire to bring it into operation as soon as possible as a counterweight to its debilitating tariff war with the US.But resistance from India – concerned about a flood of cheap mass-produced Chinese goods hurting small businesses in its economy – appears set to cruel hopes of finalising the pact at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Bangkok, where members of the 10-nation bloc have been joined by the leaders of powerful observer nations India and China for the East Asia Summit.On a bilateral level, the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, has met the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, on the sidelines of the Bangkok meeting, offering to help get the China-Australia relationship “on the right track”.“We are ready to work with the Australian side to keep our relationship on the right track, deepen our mutual trust, and jointly maintain regional and global peace,” Li told Morrison.He said he wanted to expand business links and improve “people-to-people exchange”. “This is to the benefit of both sides. We hope our relations will move in the direction of steady and sound growth.”Sino-Australian relationship have been scarred by a number of long-running issues, including the detention of the Australian citizen Yang Hengjun, human rights abuses inside China, the militarisation of the South China Sea, and allegations of foreign interference in politics, business and education. Inflaming these has been an increasingly uncompromising rhetoric from politicians and ministers on both sides.Morrison told Li that Australia “greatly appreciates” its relationship with China, its largest trading partner. “This is an opportunity, among others, to talk about that relationship,” he said. “Like you, I feel very strongly and am committed to improving that relationship and ensuring we realise its full potential.”The RCEP, of which Australia has been a key supporter over years of uneven negotiation, is essentially complete, save for the objections of one member, understood to be India.“Most market access negotiations have been completed and the few outstanding bilateral issues will be resolved by Feb 2020,” said a draft agreement obtained by Agence France-Presse.The statement said the text of all 20 chapters was now complete “pending the resolution of one” member.But it said all members were “committed to sign the RCEP” next year in Vietnam, which will take over the Asean chair. The RCEP will cover the 10 countries of Asean – Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam – plus India, Japan, China, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.Delhi is worried that small businesses across India would be hard hit by an unrestrained influx of cheap Chinese goods. It is also protectionist by instinct, resistant to the removal of agricultural tariffs impacting upon the country’s small-scale farmers.India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, reportedly repeated his country’s concerns during talks with Asean leaders on Sunday.Speaking in Bangkok, Australia’s trade minister, Simon Birmingham, said the final negotiations on trade deals were always complicated.“Australia goes into this trying to achieve the most ambitious agreement possible but realistic that we have, across the 16 countries, huge development differences, huge population differences, huge differences in the system of government and cultures of those countries,” he said.“Bridging those ides is probably the biggest challenge that’s ever been faced in terms of a trade agreement being signed and sealed around the world.”The RCEP will be negotiated further at a summit on the sidelines of the East Asia Summit on Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/611c54175f9d6d48c1fd20fcefd23a2dfab497ae/0_323_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f8be484e56cac24c9f04c86aef90783","title":"under the wrecking ball london families placed in housing slated for demolition","story":"Local authorities have moved hundreds of homeless families into temporary accommodation on council estates that are planned for demolitionMorrison is one of 189 temporary accommodation residents who have been moved on to Love Lane during the last three years while Haringey council hammers out the details of the scheme with the developer, Lendlease. They have been placed there as a stop-gap as the council struggles to house the 10,000 people on its social homes waiting list, yet as temporary accommodation residents, none of them are guaranteed a home in the new scheme.“You see the brand new stadium on one side, you see the brand new station on the other, and we’re in the middle,” Morrison says. “We don’t fit in and we know they’re going to get rid of us. We’re on edge every minute.”Across London, local authorities have moved hundreds of homeless families on to council estates that are planned for demolition, where they live in limbo in deteriorating conditions. Many report that living in such uncertainty has had an impact on their mental health, citing issues such as sleep deprivation and anxiety, as well as physical health complaints connected to the poor maintenance of such estates, says Peter Elliott, a Green councillor in the Gipsy Hill ward of Lambeth. Green councillors are calling for an immediate halt to such regeneration schemes to give residents certainty, regardless of their status.“There is this gross inequality for people in temporary accommodation,” says Elliott, who lives on the Central Hill estate that has been slated for demolition since 2014. “Years from telling people their estates are getting demolished, the housing has been falling into disrepair, there are faulty electrics and lighting, walkways are treacherous and sewers are backing up. If it was anyone else those responsible would be branded rogue landlords. These are vulnerable people and councils are abusing them.”Lambeth council has 2,376 homeless households in temporary accommodation, including 156 on what it calls “regeneration estates”. Among them are Danielle Montrose-Francis and her 10-year-old son, who were moved on to the Central Hill estate in March. By this point they had been homeless for four years after the landlord of their privately rented home evicted them under section 21, which allows a landlord to evict a tenant without giving a reason. The family were unable to afford private rented accommodation in the area and became homeless, sleeping on other people’s sofas and in B\u0026ampBs.Since they moved to the Central Hill estate, they have faced a severe mouse infestation, antisocial behaviour from neighbours and holes in the door and the walls. The cramped conditions and rodents mean that Montrose-Francis has been sharing her bed with her son, who was so stressed at one point that his hair was falling out.“Since we were evicted it’s been like a nightmare that we haven’t woken up from yet,” says Montrose-Francis, who is working part time in a church while she starts her own chemical-free cleaning business. “It’s a kind of discrimination. One group gets help with housing and their needs are acknowledged, but when you are in temporary accommodation it feels like you are punished for being poor.”Lambeth council says any disrepair on these estates is not related to their use as temporary accommodation. A spokesperson said: “These properties provide low-cost local housing for homeless households who might otherwise have to be accommodated in more expensive accommodation further away. They are entitled to the same services as secure council tenants on the estates regarding issues such as repairs and complaints of antisocial behaviour.”The Green party is calling for the repair and refurbishment of council estates rather than the sale of land to private developers to build private housing. When a building is demolished, energy is used to deconstruct it and remove, process and dispose of the waste. Building a replacement requires a further commitment of energy and materials.“Councils should be maintaining the existing estates as council flats, which reduces the pressure on the housing list,” says Siân Berry, co-leader of the Green party. She wants demands for regeneration on these estates to be permanently halted. “Residents are being moved out to private rented homes or other council flats and temporary residents are being moved in, sometimes for up to a decade, so the whole system just keeps getting worse.”Morrison co-chairs a tenants’ group called Temporary Accommodation Group, which is campaigning for the 189 families in temporary accommodation on Love Lane to be given permanent social homes at social rent in Haringey. “I’m not against regeneration, but people shouldn’t be put on a demolition site on purpose,” she says.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f87a1a612d6928c8e626a4533bc7996cf67c420/0_31_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a2176224747642579ffb00cd14e8d05","title":"election broadcasting rules balance social media campaigning","story":"Superficial measures of ‘balance’ do not account for the reality of social media and how people now campaign nowIn election campaigns attention returns to broadcasting standards. Stopwatches re-emerge to count the airtime the rival parties and candidates receive. A thorough rethink of these mostly pointless rituals is overdue, especially as pressure grows for legislative action to tackle the harms to democratic processes for which social media giants are blamed, though they are not wholly responsible.Lawmakers tend to build new sector-specific regulation on the old, adding to and tweaking a familiar model. But 20th-century broadcasting regulation is not fit for the purposes that regulation, co-regulation andor self-regulation of communication must fulfil if notions such as an “informed electorate” are to survive.Share-of-voice data, as it is sometimes called, superficially offers a way to “measure” balance or impartiality in broadcasting. In practice this data cannot do so, and in some ways it misleads, for at least these reasons:• To equate time speaking with benefit to the speaker neglects the subject matter and context. What was the audience actually hearing? Was the candidate delivering a campaign-wounding gaffe?• Some political voices are effective through brevity, and others lack power despite length.• Share-of-voice data misses a key element of campaigning: knowing when to be unavailable for comment. Parties may decline to contribute their voice on topics they find awkward, or try to shelter novice candidates from media exposure. Their consequent absence from the share-of-voice data says nothing adverse about the broadcaster.• Incumbents naturally tend to get more airtime, partly because they have been governing lately, and partly because they will be called on to comment on domestic and international events during the campaign.Broadcasting laws date from a time when scarcity of spectrum justified licensing and content regulation, both of which the press struggled against during preceding centuries and escaped. Rules for radio and TV mostly predate today’s media, which digital technologies have blended. For example, newspapers pod- and video-cast, and TV networks curate text on websites. Broadly speaking, the online environment has been treated differently by legislators because it was thought that scarcity had given way to abundance. But it is clear now that a familiar regulatory challenge endures: sheer, distorting scale. This time it is not barons permitted to concentrate and deploy the power of media megaphones that reach mass audiences. It is corporations permitted to accumulate and manage the platforms and data that a mass of participants use and generate as they socialise. Not scale, massed and in the open instead it is scale, atomised and to a large extent operating in the dark. Not Beaverbrook, but Facebook.In social media during election campaigns, political players operate as iniduals, as parties, through proxies (overt and covert), and as precision advertisers armed with unknown quantities of highly specific personal data about voters. The past always teaches something, but on the whole, broadcasting regulation as we have known it seems to have very little to contribute to a widely shared and pressing problem: how to create a framework that ensures that both free and fair elections and freedom of expression thrive in our strange new communications environment.• Paul Chadwick is the ’s readers’ editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73f1d8ebcbbe3d3ce814c87e97fca5fea4b41af4/86_222_3142_1885/master/3142.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b09e35cc93630347e0f655819954d10f","title":"the guardian view on indonesias president after the hope","story":"A second and final term can free a leader, as Joko Widodo has acknowledged. The question is how he will use his new liberty. Five years ago, he was widely hailed as “Indonesia’s Obama”. His rise was seen as another step forward for the world’s fourth most populous country and biggest Muslim-majority nation. Its transition from dictatorship two decades ago had already made it an important and much-needed model of democracy in the region and to the Muslim world. But Jokowi, as he is popularly known, was also an outsider, the first president from a humble background. Unconnected to the authoritarian era, he had earned a reputation as a clean politician as governor of Jakarta. Like Mr Obama he stood for hope in a sullied political world.Now he has begun his second term. His campaign slogan was “Indonesia advancing”. But many of those who once cheered him now see a country backsliding on critical issues including human rights, religious tolerance and the general quality of its democracy.Though his progress in building infrastructure and commitment to developing social welfare has been applauded, he has been attacked for failing to tackle corruption and abuses, and for giving ground to hardline Islamic groups rather than challenging them. The president seems to regard getting to grips with such concerns as a hindrance to his economic programme. The new vice-president, Ma’ruf Amin, is a powerful conservative Islamic cleric with a history of intolerance towards religious minorities and LGBT people. Now suspicion and anger have been reignited by his decision to appoint the opponent he defeated twice, Prabowo Subianto, as defence minister. The former general, the son-in-law of the late dictator Suharto, was allegedly involved in the kidnapping and torture of pro-democracy activists in 1998, a claim he has consistently denied.Indonesian politics has always depended on bringing political rivals into the tent – with patronage and related opportunities keeping opponents there. Indeed, one concern is that the ruling coalition now controls almost three-quarters of the seats in the house of representatives, leaving a much-reduced opposition.Nor is this appointment an unprecedented move by the president. In 2016, he chose as security minister Wiranto, a former army chief who was indicted for crimes against humanity by a UN-backed tribunal (though he denies the offences and never stood trial). Nonetheless, this disturbing new appointment has rightly engendered real fear among activists and others in the country, and reinforced concerns about its direction. At the most fundamental level, it has left some voters wondering what the election was for.So has his decision to keep on the forest and environment minister and the justice minister – weeks after tens of thousands of students protested against the government’s failure to tackle the country’s forest fires and against a draconian new criminal code which opponents warned endangered press freedoms and criminalised abortion, and the weakening of an anti-corruption body.The hopes were always unwisely inflated: the president could not have met them all. But it is clearer than ever that he cannot be depended on to defend basic rights. It is also clear that citizens should not expect any one politician to be seen as a saviour. Real pressure for reform, and real opposition can only come from outside parliament. Civil society in Indonesia needs all the help it can get."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bbcbed6f8017284000224cb543a9a3027cad270/0_266_6549_3929/master/6549.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55f9f51510bf9634dbfa939e24a4f5fb","title":"childhood is a whirlwind steve mcqueen on his mesmerising school photo project","story":"The criminal, the banker and the person who may not make it to 21 are all there, says the artist and film-maker of his extraordinary project to exhibit pictures of 76,000 of the capital’s kidsEarlier this year, the actor John Cleese, now 80, repeated his claim: “London is no longer an English city.” In 2011, he had told an Australian audience: “I love having different cultures around, but when the parent culture kind of dissipates you’re left thinking: ‘Well, what’s going on?’” He had previously declared: “I love being down in Bath because it feels like the England that I grew up in.”In May, he doubled down, insisting his foreign friends felt the same way, “so there must be some truth in it”, and describing London (wrongly) as “the UK city that voted most strongly to remain in the EU”.We will leave aside the fact that Cleese lives in the Caribbean. His meaning was clear: in a familiar, wilful and tiresome confusion of race and place, he was disoriented by the multiracial and multicultural nature of Britain’s capital.For his own peace of mind and ossified sense of nostalgia, Cleese should steer clear of Tate Britain for a while. Because next week, the artist and film-maker Steve McQueen’s Year 3 will open there – a display of school photographs from almost two-thirds of London’s primaries. There they stand: more than 3,000 photographs, showing about 76,000 children. The project’s photographers have captured the full range of the capital’s seven- and eight-year-old citizenry: from state, private, religious and special education schools, uniformed, non-uniformed, daffy grins, big ears, long braids, scuffed shoes, ironed headscarves and wild afros.In a sense, that is precisely the effect McQueen, 50, wants the exhibition to have, even if he takes visitors on a different journey from Cleese’s. “It’s a telescope and microscope situation,” he says. “You’re looking through a telescope and seeing all these people, but it’s also reflecting back on you, making you think: ‘Who am I in all of this?’ It’s exciting and dynamic. I hope the people and the powers that be are aware of that potential and reap from it. I find it very inspiring. The future is in those pictures. There’s going to be the criminal, the banker and the person who may not make it to 21. They are all there.”Getting them there was no small feat. “We spent a year and a half trying to work out how to do it,” says Clarrie Wallis, the exhibition’s curator. “Very early on it became clear that you couldn’t just do a callout to all the schools in London. There were issues like safeguarding that came into play. We had to make sure we had in place something that was robust and appropriate.”They needed the consent of every child’s parent or . Some schools had the will but not the wherewithal. As fantastic an opportunity as it was, this was one more demand on a system that was understaffed and overstretched. “Some schools felt they didn’t have the time or the capacity,” says Wallis. “A lot of them are under-resourced anyway and the arts programmes get squeezed.”So the Tate had to work out an “offer”, providing arts-based workshops with the help of A New Direction, an organisation that specialises in creative work within schools. Facilitators and photographers went into schools to do various exercises with children that related to the broader project.Every year 3 class that took part has been invited to come and see its photograph in the exhibition. Again, this is no small undertaking, involving everything from employing greeters to usher the children around, including a small tour of the Tate, to portable buildings in the car park where they can eat their lunch. “It’s an opportunity for us to champion why creativity matters,” says Wallis. “The hope is that they come, they’ll fall in love with us and want to come back again.” When the exhibition is over the schools will be given the framed photographs.There is something about the simplicity of the concept that makes the exhibition mesmerising. Row upon row of classic school photographs, all taken with the same format. The teacher in the centre, set back slightly into the class – embedded into their brood – with the teaching assistants towards the back and to the side. Where the class is larger, the front row sits on the floor cross-legged, the second row is on chairs and all the rest are standing up. “We had the photographers all stand a certain distance away, to allow for the variation in the size of classes,” explains Wallis, pointing out that while some classes could go up to 34 children, others, particularly in schools for children with special educational needs, might number eight or nine. However big or small the class, all the children are shown at roughly the same size. All were shot with natural light.The effect of this rigorous consistency in form is to draw out the difference in content. The pictures were taken wherever the school chose to accommodate them – in gyms and classrooms, under basketball nets, with backdrops of climbing bars, the Virgin Mary, blackboards and artwork. There was little retouching – chipped walls remained chipped.“I love that fact that there’s a similarity,” says McQueen. “Everyone is regimented in the same way. There’s conformity. But there’s inidualism, too. Each one is an inidual. They’re trying to make you conform. But, at the same time, there’s still that spark there, that iniduality, that questioning.”This tension, between the energy of the child at this stage of their development and the demands of the system, at this point in the process, McQueen finds particularly intriguing.“It’s this moment, when things have almost become regimented, just before they have to conform. It’s not that you lose them,” he says. “But it’s a whirlwind and they have to stand up in it. And the ones that can’t stand up often get chopped down and disregarded. And at the same time those that can also try to sustain a bit of themselves within that system. So you see the potential and possibility in these kids’ lives.”The initial idea, he says, came from his own experience of primary school, which he remembers as a time of wonder, boundless energy and fearless freedom. “It was incredible. The friends I had, and the potential, the possibilities. Playing, drawing, the kinship of friends, experimenting, getting wet in the rain. I had the chance to daydream. But then you think of what could have happened and where people I knew had gone to.”The whole thing makes for quite the rabbit hole. You start by looking at a picture, your eye drawn to the biggest smile, the tallest kid, the goofiest look or the teacher at the centre, who collectively offer a less erse demographic than the children (they are mostly women), but are varied nonetheless. You scan that class, then another, then another, thinking of how unlike your own school they are, or how similar, and before long you are reaching back to yourself at that age. To how big things were and how small your world was. Trying to remember who your teacher was, or your best friend, or your arch-enemy. Recalling the more troubled kids and wondering what happened to them. What happened to any of them. Some might be grandparents by now some could be millionaires.I have scant memories of class photo days, but I remember the sequence of events that made them unique to me and my family. The teachers would give us a letter to take home saying the photographer would be in on a certain day. I would lose it or forget it. I would generally be scruffy (that was and still is ‘“my look”), my hair a mass of tangles and knots.When the photos came back, I was always easily identifiable. I am the same age as McQueen but grew up in Stevenage in Hertfordshire and was generally the only black kid in the class. I would take the picture home and this would be the first my mum would know that a picture had been taken. She would hit the roof, pointing out how my dishevelment shamed her, sigh, and then say, “I like this one” and remark on my dimples or say I had my father’s smile. She would buy a ridiculous number to “send home” to Barbados and they would take their place along with the dresses, fabric, trousers and linen she hoarded for the same purpose and that never made the journey.For McQueen, who has two children, it is also a love letter to the city where he was born and raised. He has spent much of the last two decades in Amsterdam, but loves London. “I need this city because it’s given me so much,” he says. “It’s given me my belief system. It’s given me my viewpoint on life.”It hasn’t always loved him back. As McQueen progressed through the secondary system during the early 80s, he felt the walls closing, seeking to bury that sense of possibility under the dead weight of institutional racism. Simultaneously laughing and shaking his head, he mentions Tam Joseph’s painting UK School Report, which consists of three portraits side by side. The first, of a black youth in school blazer and tie, with a neat afro, is captioned: “Good at Sports” the second youth is funkier, slightly older with twists and an earring, and reads: “Likes music.” The last has long locks and an open shirt above the words: “Needs surveillance.” “By the time I got into high school things had definitely changed,” says McQueen.This is partly why he chose year 3. It is at seven or eight, he says, that children start to shed their solipsism and navigate the structures that shape their world. “It’s a limbo. It’s the first time these things are being introduced to them like race, class and gender. How do they grapple with that? I don’t know.”If that is a challenge for the kids, it is also a challenge for London. With the interview over, McQueen – a man of few, well-chosen words – circles back to finish a thought. “This is the future. They have to make it work. They don’t really have a choice.”Steve McQueen Year 3 is a partnership between Tate, Artangel and A New Direction. The Tate Britain exhibition runs from 12 November to 3 May 2020.

Then there’s the beerOttawa is relaxed, but at the same time an adrenaline-seeker’s dream. It’s funky and kitsch and yet effortlessly cool with brewing, dining and arts scenes to rival anywhere in North America – and its absolute best comes in the summer months.Cruising the Rideau canalWhile Ottawa’s Rideau canal plays host to hundreds of daily ice skaters carving across its frozen surface during winter months, the Unesco world heritage site is just as appealing in summer. Jump aboard Rideau Canal Cruises’ fully electric barge – the only vessel of its kind in North America – and savour the perfect vantage point for some of Ottawa’s most scenic spots. You can take in Lansdowne Park and Dow’s Lake to the south and the gothic revival splendour of the Fairmont Château Laurier hotel closer to downtown.Political manoeuvring – with a twistZen can be found in surprising pockets of Ottawa but none more surprising than in its very epicentre – Parliament Hill. Inside the doors of the nation’s halls of power, things may be particularly frenetic with a federal election coming up this autumn, but on the lawn outside the stunning house of commons, things are decidedly more chill every Wednesday afternoon. The free weekly yoga class is an absolute must for yogis and non-yogis of all abilities. Even prime minister Justin Trudeau, an enthusiast himself, has stopped in at a class or two. Just bring a mat – and some sunscreen – and get your downward dog on while the politicians get their debate on inside.Brewing up a stormWhen former US president Barack Obama rekindled his bromance with Trudeau during a visit to the capital earlier this summer, it was pretty fitting that the pair caught up at a brewery. Ottawa is teeming with taphouses pouring out some of Canada’s best brews. Obama and Trudeau opted for Big Rig Brewing where they sampled the Canadian Amber and Alpha Bomb IPA respectively. But there is hoppy goodness to be found across the city. Beyond the Pale in Little Italy is a gem with great eats to soak up even better beers, while Canada’s first Kickstarter-funded brewery, Dominion City, is so worth the trip to the east end. Can’t decide between the options? Then let the experts at Brew Donkey guide you on an always-fun brewery bus tour.The best season? Patio seasonSummer is patio season. There’s nowhere better to enjoy those great local beers or some of the best cuisine in Canada than in the open air. The uber-stylish Andaz hotel in the ByWard Market may lay claim to the city’s best patio, a rooftop escape that offers stunning views. But there are scores of rivals. Tavern on the Falls boasts soothing waterfall views, while Tooth and Nail Brewing Co has a recently opened sun-kissed courtyard to go with great beers. The Brig Pub may have the most Insta-perfect open-air space of all – a canopy of hanging greenery that still leaves gaps for blue skies to pierce through.Sounds of summerThe capital reverberates to music all summer long. Bluesfest is the biggest and boldest festival of the summer and boasts much more than just blues. Headliners this year include the Killers, Alt-J, Wu-Tang Clan and the Backstreet Boys. But from June through to September there really is something for everyone: Escapade sates all EDM lovers’ appetites Chamberfest is the world’s biggest chamber music festival there are five days of fireworks at the Canadian Museum of History with the Sound of Light competition and, yes, there is also a 10-day jazz festival that features some of the world’s biggest acts.Please the palate at a walking paceOttawa’s food scene – a melting pot that bubbles over with flavours and aromas – is as erse as its population. The city ranges from award-winning fine dining to adventurous ethnic holes in the wall, with plenty in between. But there are so many funky new places opening up that wrangling them all in can seem like a challenge. So why not pass the job off to someone else by joining a walking food tour? C’est Bon Cooking offers great guides to the city’s food culture, snaking through the top foodie neighbourhoods. Centretown and The Glebe might be the most happening neighbourhoods right now.Waterways to pass the dayIf the blue lagoon part of the Goliath sounds appealing, but little else, then keep things upright and a little lower on the adrenaline scale by hitting the waterways that course around the city. With temperatures on the rise, the summer months in Ottawa are made for water lovers. You can take to the Rideau canal in your own personal vessel, with kayak, paddleboat, canoe and stand-up paddleboard (SUP) rentals all available at the marina at Dow’s Lake. Venture beyond the canal to either the Ottawa or Gatineau rivers. Urban Ocean may be the pick of some great rental and guide firms, offering the chance to SUP in the shadows of Parliament Hill or SUP yoga by the Ottawa locks.Live the high life … then dropNot everything has to be chill in Ottawa – there are thrills too. Nowhere does the adrenaline flow freer and faster than at the Rock. Just a 20-minute drive from downtown, this stunning limestone gorge is a site to behold but looks even better upside down. Great Canadian Bungee offers the highest fall on the continent of North America — fully 61 metres (200 feet) into the aquamarine lagoon below. Even the 49-metre (160-foot) rebound is higher than the next biggest bungee in the US or Canada! If you’re not feeling the urge, watching others drop below is a thrill in itself!Culture cravings satisfiedOttawa is not just the country’s political centre. It lays claim to being Canada’s museum and gallery capital too. The sprawling National Gallery of Canada finds room for almost 100,000 works, by a distance the country’s biggest. This summer’s highlight sees the world’s first-ever exhibition devoted to the portrait work of post-impressionist master Paul Gauguin. But make time for the Canadian and Indigenous galleries too, where the country’s cultural heritage can be traced back 5,000 years. At the Ottawa Art Gallery’s stunning new home – shared with Le Germain hotel – catch the Wrapped in Culture project, a powerful reclamation project between Indigenous artists from Canada and Australia.Go wildSo many summer visitors eschew Canadian cities and make straight for the great wilderness. Ottawa offers the best of both worlds. Drive even 10 minutes outside the city and you’ll find your natural paradise. Gatineau Park is over 350 sq kms of green goodness and yet its main entrance is just 4km from downtown. Hike to the Pink Lake lookout where the deepest aqua-green waters ensure that no filter is required for the perfect selfie. There are trails for all levels of hikers, and rookies and experts alike should finish up at the genteel 1900s surrounds of the Mackenzie King Estate, where tea and scones at the former residence of Canada’s longest-serving prime minister are just reward for the hike.Explore all Canada’s capital has to offer with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a3f7e5e587883057275ab322ed2a7bab2cb8f88/0_200_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0934396a1fcb20fb5ccb680372b62200","title":"10 unmissable autumn experiences in ontario","story":"Visit Ontario in the autumn and you’ll discover food festivals, migrating birds and a kaleidoscope of foliage colour. Relax at Muskoka or fly to Frying Pan Island for its famous local fish and chipsOntario explodes into colour in autumn as the lush greens of spring and summer give way to the reds and golds and scorched orange and browns that are the hallmarks of the harvest time. The best time to see the autumn colours is from mid-September to mid-October when Ontario Parks publishes a colour report on its site of the autumn colours across the province. As you can imagine, the colours vary, depending on your location. In truth there is no better time to hit the road, get out of the city and soak up the kaleidoscope of change for a true Canadian autumn adventure.The natural heart of the provinceNowhere do the seasons change with as much vivid, coursing colour as in Algonquin provincial park. There are more than 100 provincial parks in Ontario, but none can rival Algonquin for popularity. Why? Because it lives up to the hype … and then some. Almost 3,000 square miles – a bigger expanse of land than Luxembourg – of unspoiled natural wilderness, the park is located between Toronto and Ottawa and is less than three hours’ drive from either city. Camp under the tapestry of stars or rent a ranger cabin for some rustic comfort. But, at first light, get out and catch the rich red maples and blinding yellow aspen trees in all their swing season glory.Pull up a chair in MuskokaIf Algonquin is Ontario’s natural centre, then the nearby Muskoka region is its relaxation hub. When Torontonians speak wistfully of a need to get out of the city to “cottage country” it’s likely that the Muskoka region is on their mind. From Insta-perfect tiny cabins to multi-million dollar lake homes, Muskoka has the full gamut of getaway options, almost all of them carving out a corner of tranquility among the pretty towns that pepper the region. A buzzing food scene, great breweries, spas and golf courses – the area has everything. Most of all though, it’s made for lounging lakeside in a low-slung Muskoka chair and forgetting about city life.Why 1,000 Islands make for a delightful trip …Head upstream from Lake Ontario to the mouth of the mighty St Lawrence River and you’ll reach the 1,000 Islands, an archipelago of more than 1,800 islands that straddle the Canadian and American border. A lazy but so rewarding cruise of the islands from Kingston, Gananoque or Rockport all the way up the St Lawrence is not to be missed, with stunning seasonal views guaranteed. And yes, these same islands are forever commemorated in a condiment – the eponymous salad dressing originating here.… Or up the ante with 30,000 IslandsIf you’re a go big or go home type then please don’t go home. Ontario offers a supersized island experience on the eastern shore of Georgian Bay as speckled out from Parry Sound lie the 30,000 Islands. The largest freshwater archipelago in the world, the islands can be enjoyed on water or, if you’re in the mood to splurge, by air. Georgian Bay Airways offers outstanding tours of the Unesco biosphere reserve, including one that stops in at Henry’s, a fish and chip shop that serves up the local delicacy – battered pickerel – on the quite brilliantly named Frying Pan Island, which can only be visited by plane or boat.Give the Highlands a flingJust three hours north-east of Toronto, the Haliburton Highlands offer some of the most spectacular trails and lookout points in the province – especially during the autumn colour season. In late September the four-day Hike Haliburton festival is the largest annual hiking gathering in the entire country. As the tree canopy really begins to find its best burnt crimson, climb the Dorset Lookout Tower and have your breath taken away by the panoramic visions from the top. Once your trail is finished, rest weary limbs and quench that thirst at the Lake of Bays Brewing Company in Baysville to the west.All aboard for northern exposureThe expanses of Ontario that stretch northwest from Georgian Bay can seem intimidatingly vast. But they needn’t be. Sault Ste Marie, a steel town on the rebound with some real gems among the rebirth, is a great starting point for a northern excursion. The rugged appeal of northern Ontario may be best taken in on the Agawa Canyon Tour Train, a journey into the wilderness on tracks that hug the sides of lakes and traverse rivers on their way through towering rock outcrops. Just make sure to book a window seat.A capital ideaNot the provincial capital – that honour falls to Toronto – Ottawa more than makes up for it as the epicentre of national governance. But better to leave the indoor stuff to the politicians because autumn is arguably when Canada’s capital city is at its most charming. Take a paddle along the Rideau Canal (before it freezes over for the winter) to get the best views of some of the city’s autumn foliage.Feast on the fruits of harvest seasonYou can quite literally wade into the riches of Ontario’s agricultural output as harvest season gets into full swing. Strap up your chest waders and take the plunge in Bala, Ontario’s cranberry capital. Autumn fairs crop up across Ontario as the boundless bounty of produce piles up. From the Pumpkinfest in Port Elgin to Oktoberfests across the province’s south-east, tis the season to e right in. Food festivals are popular across the province, and run the spectrum from sweet to savoury. Anything from blueberries, strawberries, peaches, apples and cherries can be found. Ribfests, garlic, bacon fests or buttertarts also feature.Wine for the winding roadThe Bruce Trail is the longest and oldest trail in the country and winds its way more than 550 miles north from Niagara Falls to Tobermory, Ontario. An entire section of the trail snakes along some of the spectacular cliffs of the Niagara Escarpment and other sections along the route make for nice day hikes. It would be a sin not to visit during the Niagara Grape and Wine festival, a two-week toast to the region’s finest tipples in September. It’s Canada’s biggest wine festival and a Discovery Pass pairs the wines with some of the best of the region’s vaunted cuisine.Heading south before the next seasonAutumn is not just moving season for farmers. Some of Ontario’s native fauna are getting their act together too. Upwards of 300 bird species begin to pack up and head south to avoid the winter, while hundreds of thousands of monarch butterflies do likewise. The great migrations are perhaps best witnessed at Point Pelee national park, less than an hour from the border with Michigan and the best time to catch the birdlife is mid-September.Start planning your visit to Ontario this autumn with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a7b12462f58d578b58360f4db6e4dfb7c47d442/0_0_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ce0bf1e7b7d972a2e08cb3c63c6475d","title":"from fringe theatre to walking on water 10 experiences that make alberta unique","story":"Alberta is a breathtakingly beautiful province. Home to the Canadian Rockies, farmland for miles (and miles and miles), all-season escapades, and a friendly and erse population, it’s a great place to get a whole lot of adventure for your moneyWalk on (frozen) water at Maligne CanyonStrap on your ice cleats and get ready for an afternoon journey through the frozen Maligne Canyon. During the summer months, visitors pass high over the canyon on a series of bridges, but once the river freezes over, the real adventure becomes possible. Trek over the ice and into the frozen depths of the canyon, and witness sheer icy cliffs on either side of the path – you’ll have definitely earned a mug of hot chocolate by the end.Become a fringe theatre fanatic in EdmontonFirst-timers at Edmonton International Fringe Theatre festival are often surprised to learn that Alberta’s unassuming capital city hosts the second-largest fringe theatre festival in the world (after Edinburgh). Those in the know, however, can attest to the massively fun explosion of wackiness and dramatic creativity that add colour and life to Edmonton’s hip Old Strathcona neighbourhood for 10 days each August.See Indigenous history at Writing-on-Stone provincial parkAlberta’s most recently minted Unesco world heritage site, Writing-on-Stone provincial park, is near the southern border in the area known as the Canadian Badlands. Tall, imposing rock formations called hoodoos populate the plains near the Milk River. On the rock walls are carvings and drawings that record the dreams and stories of the Áísínai’pi (Blackfoot) people, who have been in the area for the past 10,000 years. You need a guide to take you out to the art on the stone – book online to reserve your spot.Challenge yourself with the Crypt Lake Hike in WatertonThe trailhead of the Crypt Lake Hike in Waterton national park is accessed by boat, which is the first clue that this is not just going to be a walk in the park. Follow the trail up the mountain (approximately three hours each way) past four alpine waterfalls over a loop that runs roughly 11 miles. Avid hikers are, of course, drawn to the trail for the challenge of negotiating obstacles such as the 60-metre tunnel through the mountain – but it is the thrilling cliffside stretch near the top, which features stunning views down the ravine of the crystal-clear blue Crypt Lake, that truly makes this adventure something special.Photograph ice bubbles at Abraham LakeSometimes nature does some trippy things, like make a lake that freezes with bubbles in it. Decomposing matter forms methane bubbles in Abraham Lake in central Alberta. When it’s really cold, the bubbles get trapped in the ice rather than bursting at the surface. High winds can polish the ice and clear the snow away, making for perfect bubble viewing conditions.Go underground with a Canmore Cave TourJust outside Banff national park is the town of Canmore. It has all the trappings of a charming mountain community, plus a little extra: Rat’s Nest Cave. The name is straight out of a horror movie, but a tour of Rat’s Nest – one of Canada’s longest caves – is a perfectly safe way to get your thrills. Challenge yourself with the four-hour Adventure tour, or for something more moderate opt for the two-hour Explorer tour. If you are feeling extra adventurous you can book a private “solitude” experience.View larch trees in Banff and KananaskisEastern larches, a variety of pine also known as tamaracks, turn a deep golden yellow or rich copper for a short season – generally mid-September to mid-October – before dropping their needles for the winter. Pack a bright coat to pop against the colours in photos and head out to viewing hotspots like the Sentinel Pass in Banff’s aptly named Larch Valley, or the more easily accessible Chester Lake in Kananaskis country outside Calgary.Play palaeontologist at the Royal Tyrell MuseumDedicated to all things dinosaur, the Royal Tyrell Museum is Canada’s home of palaeontology, featuring one of the world’s largest collections of dinosaur displays alongside more than 130,000 fossils and an unbeatable programme of special exhibits and interactive learning experiences. Located just an hour-and-a-half drive out of Calgary, the Royal Tyrell Museum offers a great day trip out of Alberta’s largest city for people of all ages, not just kids.Touch the top of the world in Lake LouiseIf skiing isn’t your cup of tea, or you need a break from carving down the mountain, the Lake Louise Ski Resort offers a different kind of alpine experience – snowshoeing! Book a tour with a guide who will lead you off-piste for a peaceful snowbound hike around the summit, taking in panoramic views of some of the most stunning scenery in the Canadian Rockies from the spectacular vantage points dotted across the trail.Star gaze in Wood Buffalo national parkIn the far north of the province, with an area larger than Switzerland, lies the largest national park in Canada, Wood Buffalo national park. It is also the world’s largest dark sky preserve, making it the perfect spot to escape light pollution and star gaze or hunt for northern lights. With about 18 hours of daylight in the summer months, you will need to be a night owl to stay up for the show, or consider a visit in the autumn, winter or spring.So what are you waiting for? With all these fantastic experiences and so much more, surely now is the time to explore the vast – and vastly beautiful – province of Alberta.

Now teachers have a one-stop shop of high-quality, inclusive assemblies with hundreds of resources to draw upon.“We encourage teachers to make use of this great new hub so that they can offer truly inclusive and welcoming assemblies to their pupils.”In July, Humanists UK announced it was supporting Lee and Lizanne Harris, two English parents bringing a legal case to try to make schools provide a meaningful alternative for those pupils withdrawn from collective worship.They withdrew their children from assembly at Burford primary school in Oxfordshire after their children expressed unhappiness at watching various Bible stories, including the crucifixion, being acted out as part of collective worship.The pair, whose case comes to court on 26 November, welcomed Humanist UK’s initiative for alternative assemblies.They said: “We withdrew our children from assembly after discovering that they were being made to not only say prayers, but were also exposed to evangelical preachers who had some very harmful, isive views.“Ours is a state community school with no religious ethos so we were alarmed to see this level of religious interference creeping into our children’s education. But until Assemblies for All was launched, there was no clear model of what the alternative to religious worship would be. We very much hope many schools and teachers will adopt this excellent model of inclusive assemblies which will make all children feel included and welcome.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63ebf2998a92fca9b653bb9521b69d8e0e2f8ce5/0_36_1134_680/master/1134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b81321f21bc76d63f1792453f5c8d07","title":"a new home could save the mountain pygmy possum from global heating scientists say","story":"Fossil records suggest the species could be relocated from alpine areas to lowland rainforestsResearchers studying fossil records say they have come up with an innovative approach to try to save the mountain pygmy possum, an Australian species under serious threat due to global heating.Scientists from the University of New South Wales have used a new paper to argue for the translocation of the species from its current habitat in the alpine regions of Victoria and New South Wales into lowland rainforests.While lowland rainforest would be a new environment for the current species (Burramys parvus), the researchers say fossil records dating back 25m years show other species in the Burramys lineage always occupied these areas.The paper identifies fossil records found in what is now the Tirari Desert in South Australia, the savannah woodlands of Queensland’s Riversleigh world heritage area, and the savannah grasslands of Hamilton, Victoria.The paper’s lead author, Mike Archer, a palaeontologist and professor of biological, earth and environmental sciences, said these previous populations thrived in these areas at a time when they were lowland rainforest communities.“Until we started doing our fossil work, most people have had no real idea of the history of this endearing animal,” Archer said.“The environment it’s surviving in now is going to collapse underneath them and the expectation from scientists has been they’ll go extinct due to climate change.“The fossil record is saying that a new approach may save these animals.”The mountain pygmy possum is a critically endangered marsupial that hibernates for five to seven months of the year. Just 2,000 of them remain in the wild.Recent crashes in Australia’s bogong moth population, an important food source for the possum, have put pressure on the animal.In the new paper, the UNSW researchers use the fossil records to suggest the current species may be living at the extreme of its habitat.They argue for the establishment of a captive population in lowland rainforest to see if it survives in this environment.“We also want to use this hypothesis to think about consulting palaeontologists about what they know about animals that today are critically endangered,” Archer said.Archer said the team of scientists had raised $150,000 in start-up funds toward the construction of a breeding facility at Secret Creek Sanctuary in Lithgow.They would require more funding to build the facility, as well as government approvals to establish any kind of captive breeding program.But Hayley Bates, a lecturer in zoology and conservation biology at UNSW and a co-author on the study, said the proposed site had some similarities with the type of environment the researchers were looking for.She said the proposal was to breed possums from the NSW mountain pygmy possum population and, once numbers were high enough, study them under different climatic conditions and strategically release them to see if they survive.“If that’s successful we would look at potentially translocating them to lower down,” Bates said.She said if it works they could consider whether similar approaches could be applied to other species.“There’s a lot we can learn from understanding a species’ evolutionary history that ultimately allows it to survive in its habitat now,” Bates said.“It also gives us a lot of information about how a species might adapt to changing environments.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/270db6aa96a7bd0bcbac990c5b2649bf94f2448c/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15a70dcbab103f2cd8f73118abab6046","title":"country diary concrete cavern makes unlikely haunt for grey wagtail","story":"Langstone, Hampshire: The species is in long-term decline, but this little bird is becoming increasingly tameAs I approach the entrance to the A27 underpass, I slow my pace and peer into the gloom. Traffic rumbles overhead, drowning out the burbling Langbrook stream, which runs alongside the footpath. This dank, noisy, concrete cavern seems an unlikely place for a bird to choose to take up residence, but since the end of September it has become the favourite haunt of a grey wagtail.Sure enough, I spot the wagtail bobbing and weaving in and out of the railings at the water’s edge, its ash-grey head and wings contrasting with a sulphur-yellow rump and underparts. Its pale buff-coloured throat and eye-stripes suggest that it is probably a juvenile bird.While they are resident year-round, grey wagtails are a less common sight in Britain than their pied cousins. The species was added to the UK red list for birds in 2015 and scientists are still trying to determine the reason for their long-term decline. While some remain in their territories all year, most are altitudinal migrators, leaving their upland and northern breeding grounds in autumn and overwintering in the English lowlands, where they are joined by migrants from continental Europe.They are colloquially known as “water wagtails”, owing to their strong association with fast-flowing freshwater streams, but at this time of year their habitat expands to include canal towpaths, sewage works, coastal salt marshes, farmyards, gardens and urban rooftops.During the past few weeks this inidual has become increasingly confiding. When I pause just a few feet away from where it is feeding, it continues trotting down the path towards me, its long black and white tail pumping furiously, and head flicking from side to side as it sets its sights on a swarm of midges that is rising up to wreath my head.A cyclist swooshes into the tunnel, ringing his bell. The wagtail takes flight, uttering a single metallic “tchik” call as it flits between the paddles of the replica water wheel that sits in the preserved remains of the old mill race. Settling midstream on a mossy boulder, it dances up to snatch a minute insect out of the air, its tail feathers splaying and wings snapping open like a pair of flamenco fans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b188bbdba2a6ecafeb58beda379c1cddc9d4e8ab/0_0_2280_1368/master/2280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=897ab869cbf269473e3483372f37bd20","title":"restoring jamaicas lost coral reefs photo essay","story":"by Christina Larson. Photographs by David J Phillip and Davis GoldmanAPEverton Simpson squints at the Caribbean from his motorboat, scanning the dazzling bands of colour for hints of what lies beneath. Emerald green indicates sandy bottoms. Sapphire blue lies above seagrass meadows. And deep indigo marks coral reefs. That is where he is heading. He steers the boat to an unmarked spot he knows as the “coral nursery”. Simpson started working as a “coral gardener” two years ago as part of grassroots efforts to bring Jamaica’s coral reefs back from the brink.On the ocean floor, small coral fragments dangle from suspended ropes. Simpson and other ers tend to this underwater nursery as gardeners look after a flower bed, painstakingly plucking off snails and fireworms that feast on immature coral. When each stub grows to about the size of a human hand, Simpson collects them in his crate to inidually transplant on to a reef. Even fast-growing coral species add just a few inches a year.A few hours later, at a site called Dickie’s Reef, Simpson es again and uses bits of fishing line to tie clusters of staghorn coral on to rocky outcroppings, a temporary binding until the coral’s limestone skeleton grows and fixes itself on to the rock. The goal is to jumpstart the natural growth of a coral reef. And, so far, it is working.With fish and coral, it is a co-dependent relationship. The fish rely on the reef structure to evade danger and lay eggs, and also eat up the coral’s rivals. When too many fish disappear, the coral suffers, and vice versa.The delicate labour of the coral gardener is only one part of restoring a reef and for all its intricacy it is actually the most straightforward part. Convincing lifelong fishermen to curtail when and where they fish and controlling the surging waste dumped into the ocean are trickier endeavours.Slowly, the comeback effort is gaining momentum. “The coral are coming back, the fish are coming back,” says Stuart Sandin, a marine biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. “It’s probably some of the most vibrant coral reefs we’ve seen in Jamaica since the 1970s. When you give nature a chance, she can repair herself. It’s not too late.”Sandin is studying the health of coral reefs around the world as part of a research project called the 100 Island Challenge. His starting assumption was that the most populated islands would have the most degraded habitats, but what he found instead was that humans can be either a blessing or a curse, depending on how they manage resources.In Jamaica, more than a dozen grassroots-run coral nurseries and fish sanctuaries have sprung up in the past decade, supported by small grants from foundations, local businesses such as hotels and scuba clinics, and the Jamaican government.At White River, which is only about two years old and where Simpson works, the clearest proof of early success is the return of tropical fish that inhabit the reefs, as well as hungry pelicans, skimming the surface of the water to feed on them.Jamaica’s coral reefs were once among the world’s most celebrated, with their golden branching structures and resident brightly coloured fish drawing the attention of travellers from Christopher Columbus to Ian Fleming, who wrote most of his James Bond novels on the island’s northern coast in the 1950s and 1960s.In 1965, the country became the site of the first global research hub for coral reefs, the Discovery Bay Marine Lab, now associated with the University of the West Indies. The groundbreaking marine biologist couple Thomas and Nora Goreau completed fundamental research here, including describing the symbiotic relationship between coral and algae and pioneering the use of scuba equipment for marine studies. The same lab also provided a vantage point as the coral disappeared.Peter Gayle has been a marine biologist at Discovery Bay since 1985. From the yard outside his office, he points towards the reef crest about 300 metres (985ft) away, a thin brown line splashed with white waves. “Before 1980, Jamaica had healthy coral,” he says. Then several disasters struck.The first calamity was 1980’s Hurricane Allen, one of the most powerful cyclones in recorded history. “Its 40ft waves crashed against the shore and basically chewed up the reef,” Gayle says. Coral can grow back after natural disasters but only when given a chance to recover, which it never got.“There was a tipping point in the 1980s, when it switched from being a coral-dominated system to being an algae-dominated system,” Gayle says. “Scientists call it a ‘phase shift’.”That seemed like the end of the story until an unlikely alliance started to tip the ecosystem back in the other direction, with help from residents such as Simpson and his fellow fisherman Lipton Bailey.The fishing community of White River revolves around a small boat-docking area about a quarter of a mile from where the river flows into the Caribbean Sea. One early morning, as purple dawn light filters into the sky, Simpson and Bailey step on to a 28ft motorboat called the Interceptor.Both men have lived and fished their whole lives in the community. Recently, they have come to believe that they need to protect the coral reefs that attract tropical fish, while setting limits on fishing to ensure the sea is not emptied too quickly.In the White River area, the solution was to create a protected area, a “fish sanctuary”, for immature fish to grow and reach reproductive age before they are caught.Two years ago, the fishermen joined with local businesses, including hotel owners, to form a marine association and negotiate the boundaries for a no-fishing zone stretching two miles along the coast. A simple line in the water is hardly a deterrent however, to make the boundary meaningful, it must be enforced. Today, the local fishermen, including Simpson and Bailey, take turns patrolling the boundary in the Interceptor.On this morning, the men steer the boat just outside a row of orange buoys marked “no fishing”. ‘‘We are looking for violators,” Bailey says, his eyes trained on the rocky coast. “Sometimes you find spearmen. They think they’re smart. We try to beat them at their game.”Most of the older and more established fishermen, who own boats and set out lines and wire cages, have come to accept the no-fishing zone. Besides, the risk of having their equipment confiscated is too great. But not everyone is on board. Some younger men hunt with lightweight spearguns, swimming out to sea and firing at close-range. These men, some of them poor and with few options, are the most likely trespassers.The patrols carry no weapons, so they must master the art of persuasion. “Let them understand this. It’s not a ‘you’ thing or a ‘me’ thing. This isn’t personal,” Bailey says of past encounters with violators.These are sometimes risky efforts. Two years ago, Jerlene Layne, a manager at nearby Boscobel fish sanctuary, ended up in hospital with a bruised leg after being attacked by a man she had reprimanded for fishing illegally. “He used a stick to hit my leg because I was doing my job, telling him he cannot fish in the protected area,” she says.Layne believes her work would be safer with more formal support from the police, but she is not going to stop. “Public mindsets can change,” she says. “If I back down on this, what kind of message does that send? You have to stand for something.”She has pressed charges in court against repeat trespassers, typically resulting in a fine and the confiscation of equipment.One such violator is Damian Brown, 33, who lives in a coastal neighbourhood called Stewart Town. Sitting outside on a concrete staircase near his modest home, Brown says fishing is his only option for work and he believes the sanctuary boundaries extend too far.Back at the White River docking area, Rick Walker, a 35-year-old spear fisherman, is cleaning his motorboat. He remembers the early opposition to the fish sanctuary, when many people said they were trying to stop their livelihood.Two years later, Walker, who is not involved in running the sanctuary but supports its boundary, says he can see the benefits. “It’s easier to catch snapper and barracuda,” he says. “At least my great-grandkids will get to see some fish.”When Columbus landed in Jamaica he sailed into Oracabessa Bay, which is today a 20-minute drive from the mouth of the White River. Oracabessa Bay fish sanctuary was the first of the grassroots-led efforts to revive Jamaica’s coral reefs. Its sanctuary was legally incorporated in 2010 and its approach of enlisting local fishermen as patrols became a model for other regions.“The fishermen are mostly on board and happy, that’s the distinction. That’s why it’s working,” says the sanctuary manager, Inilek Wilmot.David Murray, the head of the Oracabessa Fishers’ Association, notes that Jamaica‘s 60,000 fishermen operate without a safety net. “Fishing is like gambling, it’s a game. Sometimes you catch something, sometimes you don’t,” he says. When fish populations began to collapse two decades ago, something had to change.Murray now works as a warden in the Oracabessa sanctuary, while continuing to fish outside its boundary. He also spends time explaining the concept to neighbours.“It’s people work, it’s a process to get people to agree on a sanctuary boundary,” he says. “It’s a tough job to tell a man who’s been fishing all his life that he can’t fish here.”But once it became clear that a no-fishing zone actually helped nearby fish populations rebound, it became easier to build support. The number of fish in the sanctuary has doubled between 2011 and 2017, and the inidual fish have grown larger, nearly tripling in length on average, according to annual surveys by Jamaica’s national environment and planning agency. And that boosts catches in surrounding areas. After word got out about Oracabessa, other regions wanted advice.“We have the data to show success but even more important than data is word of mouth,” says Wilmot, who oversaw training to help start the fish sanctuary at White River.Morrow, a lifelong water sports enthusiast often seen paddle-boarding with her dog, Shadow, runs the White River Marine Association. She attends fishers’ meetings and raises small grants from the Jamaican government and other foundations to support equipment purchases and coral replanting campaigns.“We all depend on the ocean,” Morrow says, sitting in a small office decorated with nautical maps in the 70-year-old Jamaica Inn. “If we don’t have a good healthy reef and a good healthy marine environment, we will lose too much. Too much of the country relies on the sea.”This Associated Press feature was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s department of science education.

From its very outset, her career has revolved around the trappings of extreme wealth, from the ultra-privileged children of the Los Angeles upper-crusters in her early exhibitions to a pair of nouveau-riche homebuilders for her 2012 documentary breakout The Queen of Versailles. She’s fascinated with the grotesquerie and garishness of new money, watching from a clinical remove as her subjects expose the most tacky, contemptible, pathetic sides of themselves. She’s renowned as a chronicler of the morally deformed, a diagnostic for the deleterious effects that a swollen bank account can have on the brain.So, why do these people keep agreeing to let her shoot them? What possessed Imelda Marcos, the former Philippine first lady and resurgent political operator, to sit for Greenfield’s latest and perhaps most damning portrait, The Kingmaker?“Imelda Marcos is incredibly aware of the profile she puts forward,” Greenfield says firmly over coffee at a Manhattan hotel. “In the film, I tried to include the parts that show her art-directing the world around her, moving the sheets and arranging her photos, so that we can see her in this presentational state.”All manner of articles about the dynastic family, many of them harshly critical, hang framed on the walls of the palatial Marcos estate. It’s just one in a handful of canny symbols in Greenfield’s new feature, a telling encapsulation of the mentality shared by her subjects as they hoist themselves by their own petards. Regardless of whatever light they might be seen in, they’re just glad someone’s looking.Another one of these “perfect metaphors” first brought Greenfield into Marcos’s orbit and began the project that would expand in scope and ambition to become The Kingmaker. She read a Bloomberg story by the British journalist William Mellor about a quixotic idea Marcos had while on safari, to bring an ark’s worth of the savannah’s animals back to the Philippines and create an island haven for them as a miniature African getaway she could visit whenever she pleased. As it fell into disrepair and the ousting of the Marcos regime left it fully abandoned, it became something like an Ozymandias statue, warning all those looking upon her works to despair.“I was interested in the contradiction between her personal charisma and its terrible consequences,” Greenfield says. “The animal island was how I get into the story. It was something she just did because she thought it’d be lovely for the Philippines, intending to treat the animals well, then cut to four generations of inbreeding later, they’ve lost all funding and everyone else has been left to pick up the pieces … This was the ultimate extravagance: depopulating an island of its indigenous population just to bring in animals from Africa. It was a strange, unnatural Jurassic Park.”She continues: “I thought there would be two strands, the first being her coming back to the Philippines as a congresswoman, and the animal island as part of her legacy. It was going to be a historical tale, stuck in the past. What shocked me was how it came rushing into the present.”There’s a perceptible shift in the winds about halfway through The Kingmaker, as Greenfield realizes her true focus. The first hour plays out not unlike The Queen of Versailles or its follow-up Generation Wealth, a cataloguing of the one per cent’s obscene excesses and the pathologies undergirding them. But the film shifts into a far more urgent, high-stakes register as Marcos attempts to guide her son Bongbong into the seat of the vice-president in 2016, and assists with the current tyrant Rodrigo Duterte’s rise to the presidency. What begins as a peek behind one woman’s gilded curtain pivots into an embedded reporter’s coverage of a power grab with unsettling resonances to the ascent of Trumpism.Marcos displayed what Greenfield calls “a strategic purpose and effect” in her creative relationship to her own record. While her husband’s administration waged a campaign of terror against the country’s poorest citizens for two decades, she hoarded capital obtained through possibly illegal means and put a smiling face on their crimes against humanity. She’s now going all in on revisionism, as if the body count can be erased with a single Orwellian declaration that perception matters more than truth.“In the very first scene, when Imelda walks into her living room with the Picassos and asks if her tummy looks too big, I asked her to look at my camera,” Greenfield explains. “She says, ‘I should look at you?’ and I say yes, and then she just doesn’t. I wanted to show immediately that there’s a tension between who’s really controlling the story. She’s an unreliable narrator, and I’m allowing her to talk. The key was to check in with others – truth-tellers. I did feel a journalistic obligation, as well as an obligation to history, to make sure the audience knew that Imelda’s version of events was not the only version.”The most affecting moments come when Greenfield ventures into the villages to speak with survivors of the brutal Marcos policies, which frequently employed rape and other violence as intimidation tactics. For the documentarian, speaking with these women and witnessing the strength with which they revisited their trauma underscored the crucial human toll that Marcos took.The film levies a bruising indictment against Marcos from within her direct proximity, a broadside clarified over a five-year editing process that gave Greenfield ample time to think about the efficacy of her actions. She accepted that while her work would be unlikely to wield any sway with Marcos herself – someone inviting a camera crew to follow her every move isn’t prone to self-reflection – it could still have a vital utility. She couldn’t pierce Marcos’s manufactured reality, but she could show it to everyone else. She’ll print the legend, and make sure to clearly label it as such.“If she saw this movie, and she hasn’t yet, she’d probably be fine with everything she said,” Greenfield muses. “She wouldn’t be surprised, she was right there, fully aware of what she was saying. Now, that we talked to survivors of her regime – that, she wouldn’t like.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c691e93d6f66c74373d2840253c02d84e6c5cb5/131_469_4898_2939/master/4898.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5707955b327d05b7fa5fe56dce8df74e","title":"everton tottenham premier league match report","story":"Tottenham had a first Premier League away win in 10 months torn from their grasp by a stoppage-time header from Cenk Tosun that may also have reprieved Marco Silva as Everton manager. It all felt completely irrelevant. The sight of André Gomes being carried off and straight to Aintree hospital with a horrific leg-break, players from both sides barely able to look at the stricken midfielder as he received treatment, rendered the problems of Mauricio Pochettino and Silva a footnote on a thoroughly depressing evening.Tosun saved Everton from a sixth defeat in seven league games when he converted Lucas Digne’s cross deep into 12 minutes of injury time created largely by Gomes’ dreadful misfortune. The Portugal midfielder was sent sprawling by a cynical foul from Son Heung-min although it was a combination of an awkward landing and collision with Serge Aurier that caused a dislocated fractured right ankle. Gomes will undergo surgery on Monday.Martin Atkinson, the referee, booked the Spurs striker and VAR upgraded his punishment to a red for “endangering the safety of a player which happened as a consequence of his initial challenge”, a Premier League statement clarified.Son was distraught as he departed to a cascade of boos. The Goodison Park crowd, in fairness, did not have the benefit of reviewing the incident. Not that anyone would want to. VAR made several unwelcome interventions on a desperately poor game, taking three minutes to decide that Dele Alli, the Spurs’ goalscorer, had not handled inside his own penalty area, for example.Everton were on the wrong end of VAR in defeat at Brighton the previous weekend and Silva admitted his appeals for players to respect referees is being seriously tested. But all that mattered was Gomes, a stylish footballer and friendly, engaging man now faces a long recovery period ahead. Pochettino may have been correct in his argument that Son’s harsh dismissal cost his team victory but some things are best left unsaid at moments like this.VAR, the game-killer, and Atkinson ignited more passions inside Goodison than the contest itself in the opening hour. The few chances that were created in that time fell to Everton, who, it was confirmed in a statement issued on Sunday night, are also investigating an incident of alleged racist behaviour by a supporter during this game. Gomes headed over at full stretch after Djibril Sidibe released Theo Walcott to the by-line and the winger floated a cross to the back post. Gomes was also at the heart of the home side’s first flowing move, switching play from right to left for Digne to find Richarlison inside the area. The Brazilian turned sharply only to shoot straight at Paulo Gazzaniga.The Spurs goalkeeper saved impressively from Richarlison early in the second half and the stop assumed greater significance when the visitors took full advantage of a seismic error by Alex Iwobi moments later. The former Arsenal winger was under little pressure inside his own half when he played a careless pass straight to Son. Iwobi instantly put his head in his hands and the fear was well-founded as Son released Alli in space down the left. The England midfielder, who had an otherwise quiet game, came to life as he cut inside Mason Holgate before finding the bottom corner of Jordan Pickford’s goal.The evening took a darker turn when Gomes sustained his awful injury. Tosun, a late substitute, rewarded Everton’s professional reaction with a thumping header into the bottom corner. But his thoughts were elsewhere after the final whistle sounded. “Everybody is sad inside,” Tosun said. “Some players they nearly cried. He was in shock, his eyes were open so big. He was like crying, shouting and screaming. I just went over to him and tried to hold him and speak to him I tried to tell him to stay calm. We couldn’t understand it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ea89d8b849e731edb087188aff4fd4d13a5a8db/0_309_4058_2434/master/4058.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05295f43f7cc2ff364ff9cf8df47399d","title":"football transfer rumours werner to manchester united for 27m","story":"Today’s fluff is wondering where the time wentHaving watched his Manchester United side take on Bournemouth with a giant void up front where a hungry striker should be, Ole Gunnar Solskjær has made it a priority to bring in a proper No 9 this January. And to make the winter transfer window more enjoyable for the club’s fans than actually watching his team play, he will try to get one over on Liverpool while doing so. Timo Werner has been linked with a move to Anfield for so long we suspect he was being watched by club scouts when he was weening – and when a move to Bayern Munich fell through last year, Liverpool jumped to the top of the queue to sign the Leipzig goal-guzzler. The thing is, Solskjær will try to sweet-talk the 23-year-old into a move to Old Trafford instead by telling Werner that he will play every week at United, whereas if he signed for Liverpool, he’d become a Carabao Cup cameo man like Rhian Brewster. Werner would only cost United his £27m buyout clause, too, which would make him that rarest of things at Old Trafford: a good value signing. What a time to be alive!There is the possibility that Werner will just choose Liverpool anyway, because who wouldn’t want to be hugged regularly by Jürgen Klopp? If this happens, Solskjær may nip in ahead of Milan to sign Zlatan Ibrahimovic on a short-term deal till the end of the season. This would be ludicrous but at least it would free up money for a midfield reinforcement – and at the top of United’s wishlist is West Ham’s ball-winning tempo man Declan Rice. But get this, the Hammers want £80m for him. Oof!Mauricio Pochettino has decided Hugo Lloris might not be very good any more – and what better time to replace him than when he’s on the sidelines nursing a dislocated elbow. Ajax’s André Onana impressed Tottenham’s manager last season and would be the No 1 target but he’ll cost £35m – and this is Spurs we’re talking about.We may have to put up with José Mourinho’s punditry for longer than we would like after Max Allegri jumped to the top of the shortlist to succeed Niko Kovac at Bayern Munich. And rumour has it that Unai Emery has been given a month to save his Arsenal job and the Gunners would not be in a hurry to hand Mourinho the keys to the Emirates Stadium in any case.Despite not having a manager, Bayern Munich still have the hots for Manchester City’s convalescing winger Leroy Sané. It was expected the German champions would have to bid up to £85m to lure him away from the Etihad Stadium but Bayern believe an offer of £69m will land them the 23-year-old, who will have only 18 months remaining on his contract this January. City could use a slice of the money they get from selling Sané to bring in Rodrigo Bentancur from Juventus. The powerful midfielder would cost around £35m but Barcelona are also sniffing around Turin and may be the Uruguay international’s preferred destination.Brendan Rodgers is keenly aware that the in-form Jamie Vardy’s football party can’t go on for ever. He’s fast approaching 33 and could fall apart at any minute. So Leicester have sent scouts to Metz to look at Senegal striker Habibou Diallo. The 24-year-old has earned glowing reports, having scored seven goals in 11 games for the French club. Newcastle have also been monitoring the striker, which means the Foxes are surely favourites to sign him.Adam Lallana is expected to take his suitcase full of Cruyff turns to the Chinese Super League or MLS when his Liverpool contract ends next summer. And Jack Rodwell’s agent is certainly earning his corn. After almost landing the much-mocked midfielder a move to Roma last week, the 28-year-old is now in talks with Serie A side Parma, whose sporting director Daniele Faggiano wants a player with a “strong engine”.

Mohammad, a Rohingya farmer who lost his leg fleeing violence in Myanmar, does not understand why.“We got a lot more before in terms of food and help, but now it feels like we are not getting enough support from the government and NGOs. We are also more restricted in our movement,” he says, sitting on a bench outside his house, surrounded by discarded plastic bottles and rotting food.The Bangladeshi government has launched a crackdown in the camp, shutting shops run by refugees, blocking internet services, confiscating mobile phones, putting up fencing and setting an 8pm curfew, meaning people can’t leave their homes at night.Bangladesh appears to be getting frustrated with its more than 1 million guests. Politics is turning and it has been reported that locals in Cox’s Bazar are running out of patience. The government is finalising plans to move 100,000 refugees to an island in the Bay of Bengal and refugees wonder if it is all connected.For Mohammad, the internet ban means that he has been unable to contact relatives in Malaysia and Saudi Arabia. “I feel frustrated by it. Not just about being unable to contact people overseas, but I also cannot call my neighbours. If they are at the market I cannot say, for example: ‘Please bring me back something.’”Along the dusty road running down the middle of the camp, a number of shops selling food, clothes and other items were shut by police in recent weeks. Their entrances are covered in green and blue tin shutters, and the wooden benches outside lie empty.Wasi Rahman, 20, a Rohingya vendor, does not understand why his clothes shop has been shut. “The police came and closed it,” he says, adding that he used to make about 4,000 taka (£37) a day.Abdullah, 30, had a chicken shop a few huts down that has also been shut. “The chickens are dying in my shop because I have to keep the door shut and it is hot in there … I have already lost 10 of them,” he says.“We have not been given a reason as to why this is happening. We were just told it is, until further orders are given.”NGOs working in the area were issued a statement from the government last month saying they should not hire Rohingya refugees. They have been using them as volunteers in camps, with those who help receiving a stipend for casual work as porters, night guards and labourers for construction work.“The most obviously bad part of this is that it is cutting off these people’s only legitimate source of income. The only other option for them is selling aid but they are not allowed to do that either. It puts up logistical issues for the aid community as they use the Rohingya,” says a diplomatic source.An anonymous aid worker says the question of Rohingya working and getting employment in camp has always been a “grey area”.The crackdown comes as the government tries to relocate thousands of refugees to the silt island of Bhasan Char in the estuary of Bangladesh’s Meghna river, accessible only by boat.The proposal has concerned human rights groups and NGOs, who are particularly worried about the island’s isolation – it is prone to severe flooding and cyclones, and is more than three hours by boat from the mainland.The state minister for disaster management and relief, Enamur Rahman, says 3,500 refugees have signed up to go and, if aid agencies give their consent and Rohingya leaders agree, then they will make a final decision to move people. He notes this would probably be in the middle of November. “I have been told a lot are expressing a desire to go,” he says.At the camp, rumour has swirled in recent days that aid will be cut off and conditions will get worse, so it is better to sign up for relocation to Bhasan Char.A majhi – a camp leader – who asked not to give his name for fear of repercussions, claims officials said at a recent meeting that there will be less aid in the future. Rohingya families were told they would be better off in Bhasan Char, where there was security and health facilities.“A lot of people don’t want to go. In that meeting, 22 families said they were willing to go, but no one from my block,” he says.But the restrictions in the camp have already put some people off staying. Mohammed Saber, 36, a Rohingya farmer, is keen to move.As he sits in the darkness of his hut, light sneaking through the bamboo slats, he explains that he lost three of his brothers in the violence in Myanmar. He misses his former life, waking up at 5.30am for prayer and then tending to his cattle. His childhood was spent visiting local markets with his father, buying sugar cane.“Living in the camp is becoming harder as they are tightening restrictions. I don’t feel like we are getting enough support and I hope to be freer on Bhasan Char,” he says. “I saw on the news that there are buildings and solar panels there.”As he speaks, his wife Fatima pokes her head from behind the door of a dark room, shouting: “I do not want to go!”Mohammed explains: “She is scared because it is in the middle of the ocean and goes under water from time to time. She thinks she might drown.”Mohib Ullah, chairman of the Arakan Rohingya Society for Peace and Human Rights – who represented his community when he met Donald Trump in the White House earlier this year – says poor conditions in the camp won’t make people move to Bhasan Char, and he doesn’t think that is the authorities’ aim.He puts the heavy-handed approach of government officials down to drug gangs operating in the camps. “Many criminal groups inside the camps are getting organised and controlling the drug markets with mobile phones. The government has a hard time facing it. I don’t know why more restrictions are in place, but I think that’s why.”It comes following the fatal shooting of two Rohingya refugees by Bangladeshi police during a gunfight in a refugee camp after they were accused of killing a ruling party official.One consequence of the crackdown, according to Ullah, is fewer passes being issued to people who need to go outside the camps for hospital treatment. Ullah has diabetes and says that he has been feeling unwell.There have also been a number of reports in local press stoking tensions between Bangladeshi locals and Rohingya refugees. One paper published a photo of tools for an NGO farming project, suggesting that refugees were being given weapons. Ullah also says his speech at a gathering was wrongly quoted in the media."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/facf3f842036d4b06868140dfdf02e6ecf255ccd/0_252_3775_2265/master/3775.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed7e6862728f472e8eebbb3a546a6f73","title":"five ways to avoid a vitamin d deficiency in the dark of winter","story":"It’s the vitamin that helps maintain bones, teeth and muscles, but levels can drop significantly once summer ends. Here’s how to ensure you are getting enoughFrom April to September, most Britons produce all the vitamin D they need in their own bodies, as sunlight strikes their skin when they are outdoors. Levels drop significantly once summer ends. “It’s not having high levels of vitamin D that matters – it’s avoiding being deficient,” says Julia Newton-Bishop, professor of dermatology at the University of Leeds. The scientific advisory committee on nutrition recommends that everyone living in the UK should consider taking a moderate daily dose of vitamin D, which helps to keep your bones, teeth and muscles healthy. For people of relative good health, that is 10 micrograms. “For people with darker skin pigmentation, it’s generally harder to make the same amount of vitamin D from sunlight, so taking a daily supplement year-round should be considered,” says Martin Hewison, professor of molecular endocrinology at the University of Birmingham. “You can either take a dedicated vitamin D supplement, or a multivitamin capsule, which will usually have a low level close to what the government advises. Eating certain foods can also partially address vitamin D deficiency – but it’s not enough on its own.”“The skin of mushrooms has the ability to make vitamin D when sunlight hits it, just like human and animal skin,” says Hewison. “Leaving mushrooms outside where they are exposed to sunlight (if they are inside, window glass will block UVB rays that are used to make vitamin D) means they become vitamin D-enriched. Some mushrooms can now also be bought enriched.”Few foods are naturally rich in vitamin D and the levels provided can be hit and miss. “Fatty fish such as mackerel, herring and salmon is the best option in moderate portions each week,” says Newton-Bishop. “Salmon in the wild get vitamin D from the plankton they eat, so wild Atlantic salmon, for example, will be rich in it, whereas farmed salmon may not have very much at all. Of course the other problem with fish is that it doesn’t appeal to vegetarians and vegans. In that case, the only natural source is mushrooms.”Fewer foods are enriched with vitamin D in the UK than in, say, the US, says Newton-Bishop. “So you have to rely more on naturally rich foods. However, some breakfast cereals are fortified with vitamin D, and it is also added to some yoghurts.” Researchers from the University of Birmingham found that a national policy of fortifying certain foods such as wheat flour could sufficiently address vitamin D deficiency.“Along with the other benefits of omega and fatty acids, one tablespoon of cod liver oil provides far more than the government’s recommended daily intake, so that’s another alternative to taking a dedicated supplement,” says Hewison."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2390b2e17e5e050d68a14ce1ad3e9edef9f40599/0_0_4820_2893/master/4820.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d76ea79181f34a7f6c46d603125d0d9f","title":"has your relationship been affected by brexit divisions","story":"We want to hear from couples whose opposing views on Brexit have impacted their relationship.The EU has agreed to Boris Johnson’s request for a Brexit extension to 31 January 2020 with the option for the UK to leave earlier if a deal is ratified.The agreement has cleared the way for a general election, with the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party pledging to back one on 9 December if no deal on 31 October is “taken off the table”.

The BBC’s director general, Tony Hall, is now calling on private companies and civic-minded iniduals to pay the salaries of reporters who will “hold those in power to account” by covering local government and institutions such as the NHS.His plans are part of a major expansion of the Local Democracy Reporter scheme, through which the BBC pays the salaries of about 150 journalists across the UK who share their work with commercial news outlets. Under the proposal, unveiled earlier this year, the BBC would give responsibility for the scheme to a not-for-profit charity, which would be able to seek external funding.But Hall said the ambitious expansion would only work if companies start providing hard cash and challenged them to cough up: “I want businesses and other institutions to join with us so we can get even more reporters into communities – and give people the local journalism they deserve.”There are already plans to allow publications aimed at minority ethnic audiences to employ reporters through the scheme, on the basis that they provide news to underserved communities.Google and Facebook, which together dominate the online advertising industry and take much of the revenue that previously flowed through other forms of media, already have their own schemes which respectively provide millions of pounds of grants to news outlets for innovation projects and cover the costs of some regional journalism jobs. Both companies expected to come under pressure to donate to the new scheme, which could have the added benefit of ensuring news outlets are not swayed in their coverage of the businesses.The vast majority of local newspapers in the UK are owned by just three companies: Reach, JPI Media, and Newsquest. This could soon become just two, as Reach is in negotiations to buy the majority of the 200 titles owned by JPI Media – including the Yorkshire Post and the Scotsman – on the basis that competition regulators are unlikely to block any deal due to the news industry’s terrible finances.Not all local news outlets are facing oblivion. Some newspapers based in major cities, such as the Manchester Evening News, have managed the transition to online publishing while retaining loyal audiences for their output. At the same time, new hyper-local outlets – often run by a single member of staff – have built loyal audiences by focusing closely on communities and making enough money to maintain the operation.But mid-sized outlets serving smaller towns and cities have been particularly hard hit as they attempt to maintain reporting standards in the face of continued cuts, while still meeting the financial targets set by their corporate owners. This year Newsquest’s York Press laid off three experienced journalists who provided the newspaper’s sport and culture coverage, shortly before putting much of the site behind a paywall in the face of a dire online advertising market.In February the government-commissioned Cairncross review of the local news industry concluded that the decline of local media posed a threat to the “long-term sustainability of democracy” and called for public funds to revive the industry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c2ee4ebd77b02276d396b460de9d8105921c35e/0_54_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb83ca340100fe64aeda43f60a3a6626","title":"flea red hot chili peppers interview memoir","story":"The bassist’s new autobiography lifts the lid on a difficult, violent childhood and a conflicted relationship with Anthony KiedisIn his new memoir, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea recalls a Halloween night of genuine horror. At 13, he was trick-or-treating with friends when word spread through his neighborhood that a madman was firing a gun randomly in the street. The terrified kids scattered to find safety in their homes, but when Flea approached his parents’ house he noticed that all the front windows had been blown out and debris strewn all over the lawn. Once inside, he found his step-father, Walter, with blood smeared over his face and torso, a smoking pistol dangling by his side. “He was the lunatic they were all talking about,” Flea recalled. “It was terrifying and shameful.”And it wasn’t the first time something like that happened. “Walter would get drunk and something would trigger him and he would freak out and smash everything in the house,” Flea said. “At times, a gun would come out.”After the Halloween incident, the cops came and arrested Walter. After he went through the system and returned home, he apologized to Flea and his mom profusely. “And then,” said Flea, “the pattern would repeat.”Making sense of events like this wound up driving nearly the entire narrative of Flea’s harrowing – but, at times also, hilarious – memoir, titled Acid for the Children. It’s overwhelmingly focused on his formative years, broken by short fast-forwards to his time with the Chili Peppers. Some of the Peppers’ vignettes deal with the band’s own traumas, including Flea’s guilt over the heroin-related death of the band’s early guitarist Hillel Slovak at just 26. But the main part of the book ends with their very first live show.Not that this was Flea’s original game plan. “I thought I would just write about the band because who would be arrogant enough to think anyone would care about my childhood?” he said.But, given the amount of violence, drug use and sometimes useful adventure in his past, this clearly wasn’t just any childhood. “Eventually, I became entranced with the idea of getting under the narrative, to find out the ‘why’ of my early life,” he said.To capture the fractured nature of it, Flea ided his book into brief, blunt chapters, in the process creating a rhythm for his prose as curt and distinct as his bass playing. The first part of the story centers on impressionistic perceptions from his first four years of life in Melbourne, Australia, where he was born Michael Peter Balzary. When he was five, his father’s work necessitated the family move to Rye, a northern suburb of New York City. By the time he was seven, Flea’s parents orced and his father moved back to Australia, causing the boy to feel abandoned and unmoored. Things became even more unstable when his mother remarried to a troubled jazz musician, Walter Urban Jr (now deceased). Immediately, Walter moved the family (including Flea’s older sister, Karyn) to his parents’ house where they lived together in the basement. Though Flea paints his stepfather as an unkempt, odd and violent man, he believes his mother was drawn to his bohemian sensibility. “She had grown up in this really straight Australia, where things went by the rules of the 1950s,” he said. By contrast, “Walter did drugs and played jazz and had all kinds of ethnicities hanging out. It was a chance for her to go into New York City and liberate herself.”After a few wild years on the east coast, the family relocated to the gnarlier parts of Hollywood and, by 11, a barely supervised Flea began to smoke pot every day. The cover of the book boasts a picture of him at 12 smoking a joint. By that time, Flea had acquired his nickname, based on his fidgety nature and diminutive stature. The latter contributed to an already serious inferiority complex. From early childhood, Flea writes that he had “an undying sense that something was wrong with me, that everyone else is clued into a group consciousness from which I am excluded”.This belief, along with his unstructured home life, led him to yearn for a brotherhood of friends to serve as a surrogate family. Most of the kids he found were fellow scamps who enabled his knack for getting into scrapes, which ranged from petty theft to crashing cars. Drugs became another bond. Flea began shooting speed regularly, which didn’t help his attention deficit disorder tendencies or his emotional advancement. On the other hand, he believes he got a lot out of his experiments with hallucinogens. One chapter begins with the line “LSD was good to me”.“For someone like me, who was running crazy in the street, the drug got me to access my subconscious, to develop introspection,” he said.Flea admits he overperformed on that front, a tendency exacerbated by his desire to escape the violence at home. At the same time, his stepfather’s role as a serious musician and artist had a positive effect on him, providing a living example of the power and beauty of music. “When I saw him and his musician buddies set up in the living room to play bebop with such emotion and physicality, it changed my life forever,” he said.The combination of the muscularity of music and Flea’s wild character contributed to his later emphasis on nudity and primitivism in the Chili Peppers’ presentation. “I grew up running around naked,” said Flea. “There’s a freedom inherent in it, a rebelliousness, that I find beautiful.”The band’s eager display of their bodies gave them a homoerotic frisson from the start. But for Flea there was a serious message behind it, rooted in his past. In a chapter of the book titled Men Don’t Kiss Men he recalls how hurt he felt at the age of six when his birth father admonished him for wanting a kiss. It seeded a will in him to rebel against the restrictive nature of male identity. Early in their career, the Chili Peppers did so in a daring way by posing for the Los Angeles-based gay porn magazine In Touch. “I felt honored that they wanted us in the magazine,” Flea said. “The gay community in Los Angeles were the first ones to really embrace the Chili Peppers.”In conversation, Flea revealed that he had gay experiences of his own growing up, episodes he wrote about at length in an early version of the book. But, he wound up taking all that out. “I didn’t want it to be sensationalized,” he explained. “To me, it wasn’t a big deal. I was experimenting and it turns out, ‘hey, I’m not gay’. So, it’s not really my story.”More central to Flea’s story is his deep, and complicated, relationship with the Chili Peppers’ singer, Anthony Kiedis. In the book, he calls Anthony “the missing link I never considered”. “He was unlike anyone I had ever met,” Flea said. “Among my friends, I was the guy who was always trying to do something that would freak people out. Then I met Anthony and he matched me step for step. We got up to all kinds of crazy shit.”In the memoir, Flea expresses an undimmed awe for Anthony but he also calls him controlling. Still, he’s vague on details. Considering that Flea also writes about forever wanting Anthony’s approval, one wonders if he censored his writing to stay on the singer’s good side. Flea admits there’s something to that, but he is willing to discuss one key issue between them. “He doesn’t accept that I’m different and that things that excite me may not excite him,” Flea said. “He’s looking to be the alpha.”He also admitted that Anthony’s many years of drug abuse (which the singer wrote about in his own memoir, Scar Tissue, published in 2004) infuriated him. “It’s painful and scary and sad,” said Flea. “Because the rationale of someone who’s a drug addict is disingenuous and hollow and misguided.”He said he hasn’t read Anthony’s memoir (“I might feel hurt and I don’t want to walk into a rehearsal room feeling upset about something”). And, he said, Anthony hasn’t read his. As it happens, Flea devoted as much of his book to the band’s late guitarist Slovak, as he did to their living singer. One of the most wrenching sections finds Flea beating himself up over his handling of Slovak’s addiction. “I was so angry at him,” he said. “For a long time, I kicked myself that I didn’t know how to be there for him in a way that I could have been. It’s a hard thing.”Ultimately, Flea said, he found everything about writing the book hard. “I went through so much to get it to be honest about what shaped me,” he said. “That’s what this is about: a yearning to know who I am.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98c8fcf24678649d85fe9961ef4b0c9cd5cb311b/0_0_4183_2789/master/4183.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=504cf953c75a00c1f9b7cd9c4c636871 2020w","title":"mps pledge to stop abusive language during general election","story":"Cross-party MPs vow to ‘promote compassion’ as part of #StopTheNastiness campaignLeading politicians from major parties have signed a pledge to avoid hateful language during the general election campaign, as a growing number of MPs cite relentless abuse as their reason for stepping down from parliament.The group Compassion in Politics has launched #StopTheNastiness, which aims to encourage candidates to “campaign with respect, call out hate, and promote compassion” over the next six weeks. It also urges the public to contact their local representatives and ask them to back the pledge, and calls on the media to avoid exacerbating abuse.Matt Hawkins, who co-founded the group, said it hoped to instil ideas about decency and compassion at the heart of British politics, which has become increasingly ided since the Brexit referendum. He said one particular focus was to stop the abuse of female MPs who have said they feel their lives are in danger when they go out campaigning.Hawkins accepted there were times when forceful language is justified “if you’re coming from a place where it’s concern for humanity”, such as when a politician highlights links between austerity policies and the deaths of vulnerable iniduals, but said the aim should always be to win others around to your argument rather than being needlessly abusive.The campaign has received cross-party support, including politicians from Labour, the Conservatives, the Greens and the SNP in addition to faith groups such as the Muslim Council of Britain and Jewish Council for Race Equality. Members of the public will also be encouraged to call out hate online by using the hashtag #StopTheNastiness, and the campaign group will also distribute badges and stickers carrying the slogan while campaigning.The Archbishop of Canterbury has also said that strong language by MPs risks “pouring petrol” on the current political situation, and a growing number of female politicians have talked about the vitriol they receive and its impact. The departing Conservative cabinet minister Nicky Morgan said she had decided not to stand again in part because of the level of abuse she received.Rosie Duffield, the Labour MP for Canterbury who is standing again, said she had been shocked by what she had encountered in her first two years in parliament. “Behaviour that is tolerated in politics would be considered obscene in any other walk of life,” she said. “Verbal and physical threats, xenophobia, sexism, bullying and intimidation, we were meant to be wiping these from the face of our society. Instead we’ve allowed politics to become their breeding ground.”The campaign may face a challenge in an election expected to be high on emotion and an increasingly partisan media environment. Leading politicians have been accused of stoking isions by using inflammatory language, notably when Boris Johnson described death threats against MPs as “humbug”.A recent analysis by the Financial Times suggested there was a direct correlation between the language used in parliament during that debate and the volume of toxic tweets from both sides of the Brexit ide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92ef9c7e84a5e1abed89d7d41ff560bc866d41b0/0_44_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdd422da3801dc7121663fdfdedeffa2","title":"government spending set to return to levels last seen in the 1970s","story":"Government spending is on course to return to levels last seen in the 1970s, according to a report that found both Tory and Labour plans will significantly increase the share of GDP taken up by the state over the next parliament.The report, The Shape of Things, which comes ahead of the parties’ manifesto launches in about two weeks’ time, said: “This would mean the size of the state under Labour being significantly above the 1970s average.”The Resolution Foundation said the make-up of departmental spending had changed radically since the 1970s as society had aged and the state needed to dedicate an increasing share of expenditure to health and old-age social security.It added that both parties should consider how a larger state can be sustained, “with tax rises likely to be needed to fund the bigger state both parties support”.Matt Whittaker, the author of the report, said: “After an unprecedented decade of austerity, both main parties are gearing up to turn the spending taps back on.“Whichever party wins are going to face huge questions about how they are going to pay for Britain’s growing state. The fact is that whatever promises are made over the course of this election campaign, taxes are going to have to rise over the coming decade,” he said.At the last election Labour said it would pay for most of the increases in day-to-day spending through a series of tax increases, mostly on the better-off.

It’s about stacking items in a shopping bag.If you get full marks in parts (i), (ii) and (iii), well done. Most of the applicants who got in to Oxford did too. But on average, successful applicants did not score full marks in either of parts (iv) or (v).Can you do better than them?You need to pack several items into your shopping bag without squashing anything. The items are to be placed one on top of the other. Each item has a weight and a strength, defined as the maximum weight that can be placed above that item without it being squashed. A packing order is safe if no item in the bag is squashed, that is, if, for each item, that item’s strength is at least the combined weight of what’s placed above that item. For example, here are three items and a packing order:This packing is not safe. The bread is squashed because the weight above it, 5, is greater than its strength, 4. Swapping the apples and the bread, however, gives a safe packing.(i) Which of the other four orderings of apples, bread and carrots are safe or unsafe?(ii) Consider packing items in weight order, with the heaviest at the bottom. Show by giving an example – that is, invent some items and give them weights and strengths of your choosing – that this strategy might not produce a safe packing order, even if one exists.(iii) Consider packing items in strength order, with the strongest at the bottom.

He was among MPs who openly criticised the government over a proposed delay to the curbs on FOBTs introduced earlier this year.The interim report from the APPG, led by Labour’s Carolyn Harris, Duncan Smith from the Conservatives and the SNP’s Ronnie Cowan, is the result of a six-month inquiry including evidence sessions with gambling companies and addicts.Among the more eye-catching recommendations in the report, due to be published this week, is a maximum £2 bet on online slot machines. This would echo the ban on £100-a-spin FOBTs introduced earlier this year after the government branded the machines a “social blight” following a lengthy campaign.“If they are not acceptable in land-based venues they should not be allowed online,” the report said.The MPs also backed calls to stop credit cards being used to gamble – as well as the introduction of mandatory affordability checks – to make sure customers don’t get into financial difficulty.The average disposable income in Britain is £450 a month but online casinos and bookmakers often check on a customer’s finances only after they have lost thousands of pounds.And they also recommended restrictions on “VIP” accounts, frequently cited in cases where problem gamblers racked up huge debts after being offered incentives such as free sport tickets or bonuses.Brigid Simmonds OBE, the chair of the industry’s Betting and Gaming Council, said gambling companies were “committed to ensuring a safe gambling experience for all customers, using the wide range of tools that online operators have at their disposal”.“Our members continue to invest significantly in new technology to make full use of data and algorithms to identify risk of harm and interact with customers at an early stage, and to introduce new affordability checks on customers.”But the report said gambling companies had not been able to tell MPs what level of gambling they considered affordable and therefore could not reliably intervene when customers are losing dangerous amounts.“This report highlights the urgent need for a root and branch review of the regulation of online gambling,” said Harris, who oversaw the report.She also singled out the industry’s regulator the Gambling Commission, saying it was not fit for purpose in the age of internet gambling and required greater powers to sanction companies.A spokesperson for the Gambling Commission said: “We are disappointed that this report has been released before we have been given the chance to give evidence.”They added: “The report does not reflect our considerable action and progress on most of the areas of concern set out in the report and we look forward to being given the chance to outline that work to the APPG.”The commission said last week that it would not fine Ladbrokes after the  revealed the bookmaker told the victims of a problem gambler’s £1m theft that it would only repay them if they signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA).The regulator has issued guidance to firms advising against the use of such NDAs, and the cross-party group’s report called for a change in the law to prevent bookmakers using them to keep information from the regulator.The report also calls for online firms to improve their systems to identify vulnerable people and protect children, as well as to simplify terms and conditions.Duncan Smith, the vice-chair of the APPG, said: “It is outrageous that there are not stake limits online, that gamblers are still able to gamble using credit cards online and that operators are able to continue to offer inducements to the vulnerable without proper sanction.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7adee44656e13e8fd486e71dfe5e355581f86232/1_0_2276_1367/master/2276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16055bbbdaa33cd2994b7a114aa150e9","title":"share convicted children bame doubles","story":"Diversion of minor offenders away from courts seems to have mostly helped white childrenThe proportion of children convicted of a crime who are from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds has nearly doubled in eight years, an increase experts have described as an urgent problem.The steep rise comes despite a drastic drop in the overall number of youth cautions or sentences handed down, which one academic described as an indictment on the whole justice system.Just 26,681 children were cautioned or sentenced in 2018 compared with 106,969 in 2010, thanks to a shift toward dealing with less serious offenders out of court. The increased use of “ersion”, however, in which minor offenders and those deemed at low risk of reoffending are steered away from the courts, seems to have disproportionately benefited white children.Children in the dock is an investigation into the youth justice system in England and Wales, which in 2018 saw 26,881 children aged 10-17 cautioned or convicted of crimes ranging from shoplifting and joyriding to rape and robbery.No other EU country puts such young children on trial. Most other nations do not use an adversarial system which can see children separated from their parents and lawyers via bulletproof glass in what is essentially an adult courtroom with a different sign on the door.Children who end up in trouble now are disproportionately likely to be of black, Asian or minority ethnicity. They are vastly more likely to be in care and they are extremely likely to have ADHD, autism spectrum disorders and communication difficulties. This series examines how the court system deals with these vulnerable children and explores whether there is a better way to break the cycle of offending and help them build productive and fulfilling lives.Becky Clarke, a senior criminology lecturer at Manchester politan University, said the “failure to act, given these issues of racial injustice have been known and worsening for many years, is an indictment of the whole justice system”.She said the increase in levels of disproportionality was a direct consequence of BAME children being dealt “different treatment by practitioners across the criminal justice system”, and called for wholesale changes to policing, transparency in the charging and prosecution of cases, and an end to the unequal application of laws such as joint enterprise.Clarke welcomed the overall reduction in criminalisation of children but said negative racial profiling meant it “hadn’t benefited all groups equally, meaning BAME children cannot be erted out of the system in the same ways as their white counterparts”. She put this down to “perceptions of risk and criminality” in the police, Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), courts and youth justice service. spoke to senior representatives of all four groups and few could point to positive changes in outcomes since the Lammy review, which cited youth justice as the “biggest concern”.Olivia Pinkney, the chief constable for Hampshire and national policing lead for children and young people, conceded there was still “so much more to be done” and “none of us should rest and be comfortable” with the rise in the proportion of young BAME people criminalised. “It’s certainly something that will be unwitting, but we need to understand why.”She said the police were taking steps to tackle the problem, pointing to the increased focus on the use of stop and search and mandatory equality and inclusion training.Gerry Wareham, a senior prosecutor and CPS lead for young people, said the CPS could only choose to prosecute from the cases that the police brought to it. “We’re in a demand-led position. We get what the police bring to us,” he said.Lammy said his review not only showed the disproportionate criminalisation of black youth, but also similar trends for young Muslims and a “historic problem” of overrepresentation of young people from Gypsy and Traveller backgrounds.The youth justice system is in need of further reform, he said. “There’s a real need to get a grip on how we’re supporting families, how we’re supporting young people, what second chances they are getting.“Those are big questions that obviously affect all young people who fall into the criminal justice system, but they are generally young people from working-class and poor socio-economic backgrounds and most definitely young people from ethnic John Bache, the chair of the Magistrates Association, said some magistrates had found it “very difficult to accept the results” of the Lammy review. He said the reason for that was “absolutely obvious, because every magistrate believes that they are acting with scrupulous fairness … so to be given a report that suggests that that might not be the case is first of all surprising, but also very upsetting because none of us want to be unfair to anybody who appears in front of us.” Unconscious bias training for all magistrates and legal advisers launched in June this year.The Magistrates Association, which represents the 15,000 justices of the peace in England and Wales, has recently convened a group to address disproportionality, including representatives from the Ministry of Justice, the CPS, the Youth Justice Board and charities. The group agreed it was an “urgent problem, especially in relation to the alarming disproportionality illustrated by the proportion of BAME children and young people in custody”. It proposed recruiting more erse magistrates and promoting awareness among magistrates of the different factors that BAME iniduals face.The Ministry of Justice said: “The issues that lead to black, Asian and ethnic minority children being overrepresented in youth custody begin before they enter the criminal justice system, which is why work is under way across the system to change race disparity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba7f5254bddf39ed836c205d9a437aa7e9606c52/239_203_3181_1910/master/3181.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb8f2a669b435a2c6c87c7b26f91d928","title":"england south africa fans preview world cup final","story":"The two sets of supporters are ready for the Rugby World Cup final on Saturday – when they will both be on the bacon butties“I’ve been supporting England since I was 11 and remember cheering the World Cup win in 2003.

This would go far in blurring racial lines that still form a ide in our country. England have done so well this World Cup. If they win, they will truly deserve it, but we won’t go down without a serious fight.If South Africa are to win, we need to focus on keeping our strong defence lines intact. England are a strong team and are going to make this a tough game. We need to keep as much possession as possible and ensure we don’t drop the ball – in all senses of the word. Shannon O’Farrell, a South Africa fan in GuildfordIt’s been a very exciting World Cup. I’m so glad for Japan. It’s going to be one cracker of a game on Saturday. Both teams are so strong physically. I can’t wait for the final. I’m having a braai (barbecue) at my brother’s house next to the swimming pool and a big TV outside. All four of my brothers will be there and we will be going big with outfits and flags, all the necessary stuff. We will open the first can of beer at 9am, two hours before kick-off. The Springboks need to play wisely with their physicality and dominate England up front. The rest will fall in place. Enjoy the game. May the best team win. Anton Wessels, Johannesburg“I’m very excited about how South Africa have progressed. The low was losing to New Zealand after camping in their half for 20 minutes and only getting three points for their efforts. On a high happy, they made the final and were made to work hard for it by Wales which has prepared them for the final.The difference between teams is basically nothing but England may have peaked a week too early. We have not seen the best of this South Africa team. If they click on Saturday, England are in for a torrid time.I shall be watching with my brother as I can scream at his house as his wife is a Springbok supporter. South Africa will have to play it in the forwards with their power and domination of being very physical and in England’s faces. Their backs can also be devastating, especially Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe. If given the chance, Damian De Alande and Pollard can be dangerous. They must just stay calm and focused.” David Lichtenstein, South Africa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15f9054af3322855861f8b627b2124ddb01bd02f/0_145_3214_1929/master/3214.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af557c06fa2a6ce084ef02e0442ae938","title":"ashleigh barty wins wta finals elina svitolina shenzen","story":"• World No1 earns $4.42m after winning title 6-4, 6-3 in Shenzhen• It was her first victory in six attempts against the UkrainianAshleigh Barty arrived for her final showdown in Shenzhen against Elina Svitolina having been beaten by her in all five of their previous meetings. But in the time since Svitolina last defeated her in March, Barty has won the French Open and reached No 1. On Sunday she showed emphatically just how far she has come by outclassing Svitolina 6-4, 6-3 to win the WTA Finals and its $4.42m (£3.42m) cheque, the biggest prize money in tennis history.“Bizarre, if I’m being completely honest,” she said of her victory, according to the Women’s Tennis Association. “It feels like it’s been a year that just hasn’t stopped. It’s been a year of incredible ups and downs – I think more ups than downs. To cap it off with a very, very special night tonight in Shenzhen is really cool.”It is difficult to think of many downs. Barty started the season ranked 15th without a grand slam quarter-final to her name and she finishes it as the best player in the world. Her rise to the summit has been unique in its swiftness – she did not break into the top 10 until March, when she won the Miami Open, yet four tournaments later she had won at Roland Garros and Birmingham to become world No 1.In recent years the women’s game has seen many players struggle with the pressure and increased expectations inseparable from winning grand slam titles, yet Barty has played quality tennis throughout.Against the defences of Svitolina on the notoriously slow courts of Shenzhen, the Australian produced one of the best performances of her career and took her game to yet another level. Both players came out serving well but it was Barty who patiently dictated from the baseline with her forehand, while lacing her game with swift forays to the net, drop shots and her skidding slice. She was first to break serve in the final game of the first set by which time she had fired 19 winners past Svitolina.Barty’s improvements were particularly evident in the second set after she lost concentration at 1-1 and threw in a service game littered with unforced errors and a double fault that gave Svitolina a break. In previous years that would have unsettled her but she responded after the changeover by dominating Svitolina with her slice and producing three stunning points to break back. She won three games from 2-1 down and eventually served out the match to love.Barty has not suddenly transformed into a completely different player. Her serve is as fast as it was last year and her forehand carries the same wicked spin but she has learnt how to limit the low points in matches and which weapons to employ at the right time. In the past there were moments when she panicked during matches. Now she calmly solves her problems. In this tournament alone she bounced back from a torrid display against Bertens and confidently recovered from a set down against both Belinda Bencic and Karolina Pliskova.While injury took its toll on her rivals, with four players forced to retire or withdraw through the week, Barty’s success is also a reflection of the most underrated facet of achieving tennis greatness: scheduling. While Bertens played 28 tournaments and burned out, Barty has played only 15 tour events in 2019. While most of her rivals were toiling through the Middle East in February, Barty trained and relaxed at home for a month. After her triumphant, exhausting spring she retreated back home and did not even look at a racket for two weeks.When Barty returned for the US swing of the Tour a month after her fourth-round defeat at Wimbledon she looked rusty and was not back to her best until after the US Open. For some players that would have been unacceptable. For her it was fine. It was part of the bigger picture.Barty’s early career will always be defined by the two years she retired from tennis after mounting pressure and loneliness led to depression. She returned determined to conduct her career on her terms, ensuring her mind was never overworked and she always had time to return home. Her success has shown it is possible to be successful without sacrificing everything in pursuit of greatness. She has done everything at her own pace and now stands as the best player in the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/259656630e758174daab38ed1ba0ed766dfe34b8/0_95_4342_2605/master/4342.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b415e4212ff525eaddf1103ccfaa2db8","title":"lewis hamilton sixth f1 world title us grand prix bottas","story":"• Mercedes driver completes third championship in a row• Valtteri Bottas wins US Grand Prix with Hamilton secondLewis Hamilton said 2019 has been his best and toughest season after he secured his sixth world title on Sunday with a second-place finish in the United States Grand Prix.Number six gives the 34-year-old sole ownership of second place on the all-time list. The greatest driver of his generation has overtaken Juan Manuel Fangio, whose championships came in the 1950s, leaving him one behind Michael Schumacher. Few would bet against Hamilton equalling the German next year, given the Briton’s relentless desire for self-improvement.Hamilton said that even in his thirteenth F1 season his career remains a work in progress. “I’m working on a masterpiece and I haven’t quite finished it yet, so I’m trying to understand. It takes a long time to master a craft and, whilst I feel like I am mastering it, there’s still more to master, still more to add to it, more pieces to the puzzle to add, more ups and downs along the way. But I feel like I’ve got the best tools now, up to this point at least,” he said.Hamilton paid tribute to Niki Lauda, the three-time champion who acted as an advisor to Mercedes. He died in May aged 70. “It’s been the hardest year for us as a team. We lost Niki this year, a real crucial and pivotal member of our team,” Hamilton said.Despite his unassailable lead in the standings with two races still to come, Hamilton has won only two of the past seven races after eight victories in the first 12. “It’s been a real challenge, the second half of the season. It’s been the toughest second half of the season I think we’ve had as a team,” he said, paying tribute to his Mercedes squad for “out-thinking” Ferrari, who arguably had advantages in power and straight-line speed.One minor blemish is the relative lack of pole positions – four so far compared with 11 in 2018 – though Hamilton said that, while he has not dominated in qualifying, he has at least been consistent. “Otherwise I think it’s been the best performing year,” he said.Only his teammate, Valtteri Bottas, could have delayed the date of Hamilton’s coronation, so it was fitting that the two fought hard for first place in Austin, duelling in the closing stages as Bottas successfully chased down the Briton.Bottas, second in the standings, had to win from pole and hope Hamilton finished outside the top eight at a venue where he habitually excels. The 30-year-old Finn did what was required but so did Hamilton, with a solid, composed and determined drive on a bumpy surface.The result was especially impressive given that he started in fifth but he rose to third before the end of the first lap, surging past the struggling Ferraris of Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc. Suspension woes forced Vettel out of the race on lap eight.The afternoon soon settled into a three-way tussle between Bottas, Hamilton and the Red Bull of Max Verstappen. Hamilton was on a one-stop strategy, with Bottas and Verstappen adopting two-stop tactics, making the outcome hard to predict.Hamilton enjoyed a roughly three-second advantage entering the final 10 laps of the 56-lap race but Bottas was steadily gaining ground on fresher tyres and he overtook his teammate on lap 52. Hamilton had just enough left to hold off Verstappen in the final stages.The inevitable question now is whether he can catch Schumacher. “I’ve always said to you that reaching Michael never was a target for me. I’m not really one that thinks of records and those kind of things. I definitely had thought that getting anywhere near Michael was just so far-fetched,” he said. “I believe that I have the ability to continue to grow and to do more with this team.”Rather than look too far into the future, Hamilton preferred to cast his mind back to the past. He recalled sitting at home with his father, Anthony, watching races on television and eating bacon sandwiches. Anthony was in the cheering crowd beneath the podium after this race, standing next to the cowboy-hatted Texan actor, Matthew McConaughey, who gave Hamilton a hearty hug.“It’s beyond surreal, that my life journey has brought me to this point in winning the sixth title. I don’t really know how I’m supposed to feel,” Hamilton said. “I don’t believe in the whole Cloud Nine thing but I’m flying super high right now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d9efeac0610af10b12f00140e2b7e0f08b8e7f5/0_208_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17c71bebd0c2264f0a189305fe4c296c","title":"rugby world cup japan values south africa","story":"So in the end Jack did not kill the 15 giants. But still the Rugby World Cup had a different kind of fairytale finish. Siya Kolisi, South Africa’s first black captain, a kid from a township outside Port Elizabeth, led his team to a famous victory. And a team that once epitomised the apartheid regime was reborn, at last, as one offering the promise of togetherness. It was not long ago that the Springboks were jeered by black South Africans. Now they are being cheered by them. They have made good on Nelson Mandela’s words from 1995. “Sport has the power to unite people in a way that little else does,” Mandela said, “Sport can create hope where once there was despair.”We should not garnish it any more than that. If anything, this may be the moment to offer a timely reminder that we should not overreach or strain to explain the significance of all this. South Africa’s coach, Rassie Erasmus, was absolutely clear about the limits of what his team had achieved. The World Cup final had bought his country 80 minutes of togetherness, Erasmus said, and a couple of happy hours after the match when people back home had put aside their differences. Nothing more than that. The social problems he and Kolisi spoke so openly about this week will not be fixed by this victory. But it will give some succour and a hint, too, of what is possible.There is also hope there for England. This was all at their expense, but they are a young team, the youngest to play in a World Cup final with 25 twenty-somethings in their squad of 32. And what they have achieved these last six weeks has to be set against the way they embarrassed themselves, and everyone else, in 2011 and 2015. England were never, have never been, better than they were on the weekend they beat the unbeatable All Blacks. It may turn out, when they finish their debrief, that they were still suffering from the hangover of that when they played South Africa.They would not be the first. New Zealand have lost four World Cup knock-out matches in the last 20 years now. None of the teams who beat them went on to win the final. It is one thing to persuade yourself the fabled All Black aura does not make any difference in the week before playing them but another really to believe it the week after, too, when you are sure you are already on top of the world. There are always new lessons, then, even for a wily old dog like Eddie Jones. As one of his young standout performers, Sam Underhill, said when he was asked if he had heard of the theory that you have to lose a World Cup final before you learn how to win one: “No, but I’m a fan of it now”.Even the English may agree that South Africa’s victory was a fitting way to finish a tournament that was, after all, about opening the game to new audiences. It is easy to forget in the wash of it all what a risk World Rugby took by bringing their marquee tournament to Japan, where the game is – or was – a minority sport. There has been nothing quite like it since Fifa decided to hold the 1994 football World Cup in the US. And it has paid off. They filled almost every seat in every stadium and at the tournament’s peak won an audience of 54.8m TV viewers in Japan alone.That was during Japan’s game against Scotland at the end of the pool stages. It was one of those matches which meant more than can be conveyed in facts and figures like that, when the sport became about something much larger and more important than itself. It was the day after typhoon Hagibis had blown through and, around the country, they were still reckoning the damage. The official death toll was 24 when the match started, 28 when it finished. Days later it finally reached 89. Some of those deaths were just miles up the highway from the stadium.What was that match but a gesture of pride and defiance and togetherness? They were pumping floodwater out of the changing rooms on the morning of the game. One could hear the plain truth in Mandela’s words then. And one could hear it again in the little town of Kamaishi, the smallest place to host a World Cup match, where they had built their new stadium on the site of the school that was swept away in the tsunami in 2011. There never was a town that seemed as happy to be hosting a match. It was, the manager of the local rugby team said, their way of thanking the world for its support after the disaster.They never did get to play the second game that was scheduled there. It was one of the three matches cancelled because of the typhoon. It would have been the biggest fixture of the tournament for the two teams who were due to play, Namibia and Canada. But instead they got on with helping the people who lived there clear up the damage. Rugby loves to talk about its values and there they were again for everyone to see in the footage of the Canadian players shovelling mud off the roads.It was a timely reminder of the best of the game because there was some of the worst on show too, in the backstage bickering between the unions about who was to blame for the cancelled matches. It was a flash of the sport’s narrow-minded side. If the World Cup offered a glimpse of what the game might become, it also showed some of what is holding it back. In Europe the game is being taken over, piece by piece, by the private equity firm CVC Capital Partners, who were recently accused of “raping the sport” of F1. Let us see how those traditional values and this newfound drive to develop the game, this desire to prioritise player welfare, hold up in partnership with a firm whose biggest worry is the bottom line.In many ways the game has changed these last few weeks. This tournament could be the beginning of something. And in many others the game remains the same. It could also be its end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4aa501ea87017fa89f42d6c4926612c2915fcbc/142_391_3279_1968/master/3279.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4cf305c583d17c18a418fe6b92667a6","title":"locals guide nantes france brittany loire top 10 tips","story":"With brilliant art, cuisine, river islands and muscadet, the thriving city at the mouth of the Loire is ideal for a short break, and only six hours by rail from LondonIt must be hard for today’s visitors to imagine the Île de Nantes, in the middle of the Loire, as the industrial wasteland it became once shipbuilding finished in the 1980s. But from 2007, it has been transformed from virtual no-go area into cultural hub – giving the island back to the people and attracting tourists. The Machines de l’Ile – gigantic, surreal steampunk animals and insects lumbering through the old shipyards – have been a big hit. For summer days, La Cantine du Voyage is a huge open-air cafe on Quai des Antilles, serving healthy meals (from €11, reopens April 2020). A huge warehouse, Le Hangar à Bananes, where bananas were once brought to ripen, is now HAB, a brilliant contemporary art venue, while at night there are bars, concerts and clubbing.The place to meet locals is Marché de Talensac, the belly of the city, where everyone does their shopping. Inside the 1937 covered hall are specialities such as rum- and lemon-flavoured gâteau nantais, pungent curé nantais cheese, and fish straight from the trawler. Each weekend, farmers set up stalls outside with a cornucopia of organic vegetables, including a buzzing flea market covering the adjoining Place Viarme on Saturday. The market is ringed by friendly cafes and bars, such as Café du Coin, or the stallholders’ favourite, Café du Matin, where you can bring your cheese, charcuterie or oysters and enjoy them with a chilled bottle of muscadet.• Tues-Sun 8am-1pmVisitors to France often forget that many of our provincial cities have art galleries with the same class of grand masters as at the Louvre and Musée d’Orsay in Paris, but without the queues or crowds. That is certainly the case in Nantes, where the magnificent Musée d’Arts, established by Napoleon in 1801 and recently reopened after a six-year renovation, showcases a splendid collection, from Tintoretto and Rubens to Monet, Rodin, Kandinsky and Chagall. I oversee a host of ever-changing avant-garde events here under Le Voyage à Nantes umbrella, but visitors can appreciate the museum’s 10,000-strong collection all year round. • museedartsdenantes.nantesmetropole.frMuscadet is the wine of Nantes, sold at every cafe and restaurant. It has been enjoying a revival as the focus has returned to quality over quantity and more organic wines. The vineyards begin just outside town, so either drive or join an organised trip through the countryside between Nantes and Clisson. Stop off at elegant 70-hectare waterside Château de Coing, run by mother-and-daughter vigneronnes, or make an appointment for a tasting with Michel Badouet, one of the leading lights in the natural wine movement. Book lunch at romantic La Cascade in Clisson (two-course lunch from €16.50), then end the afternoon with a couple of hours’ lazy kayaking on the Sèvre and Maine rivers. • levignobledenantes-tourismeThe magnificent Loire estuary is a natural extension to the city that we have been opening up for locals and tourists. Three art biennales have left a heritage of 30 monumental sculptures and installations as the river nears the Atlantic. A cruise (€25pp) lasts almost three hours, the landscape changing from industrial sites to fishing villages, farms and wetlands filled with wildlife, to shipyards and containers at Saint-Nazaire. The artworks will take your breath away: a half-submerged house, a giant sea snake, wild animals climbing trees, a metal tower with a house on top (that can be rented). And at the end, a €5 train ride gets you back to Nantes in 30 minutes.The flamboyant Passage Pommeraye – a precursor of modern shopping malls, built in 1843 – may not be as famous as its peers in Paris, Brussels and Milan, but for me Pommeraye is the most beautiful, with its elaborate staircase, statues and ornaments that climb up three floors, leading to a maze of gilded galleries. Shoppers can browse fashion showrooms, cake shops and jewellery or leather workshops. Just down the road from Pommeraye’s ornate entrance, the lustrous belle époque showroom of Chocolatier Gautier Debotté (9 rue de la Fosse) is a paradise for chocolate lovers, and the talkative owner of Les Rigolettes Nantaises (18 rue de Verdun), Stéphan Le Guiriec, will explain the century-old history of Nantes’s famous fruit bonbons, inspired by Verdi’s opera.• passagepommeraye.frThe striking art nouveau tower of the old LU biscuit factory is a symbol of Nantes, but when production closed in the 1980s, it became a symbol of the city’s decline. The vast building was abandoned until we created Le Lieu Unique in 2000 as an accessible and affordable cultural centre – a place for everyone in Nantes to have fun, and open daily from 11am to 2am or even 6am. It was a success from day one, offering a cheap and cheerful restaurant and waterside bar, a bookshop, a kindergarten, contemporary art exhibitions and ever-changing theatre, dance and music events, many of them free. There are even Turkish baths in the basement. It was a gamble, as this kind of venue hardly existed then in France. • Quai Ferdinand-Favre, lelieuuniqueNantes probably has more crêperies than any town in Brittany (historically and culturally the city is Bretom though it now belongs to the Pays de la Loire region), and visitors should experience a meal of savoury galettes de blé noir (buckwheat), then sweet wheatflour pancakes accompanied by local cider. Of the crêperies, it’s difficult to beat Heb-Ken. The Breton name means “take it as it is”, so don’t expect anything else apart from crêpes, all made with local ingredients such as ham, goat’s cheese, strawberry jam, chocolate and the traditional beurre salé – just don’t count the calories. It’s all delicious and all affordable, with prices starting at €2.70. Nantes has some inventive new bistros too, run by young talented chefs. Restaurant Ici and Le Petit Boucot are especially good value for a gourmet lunch: both offering two courses for €18, comprising perhaps mackerel with heritage tomato carpaccio and line-fished hake on a bed of creamy aubergine. Just north-west of the 19th-century Jardin Botanique is Les Bordes de l’Erbre, a tranquil neighbourhood bordering the river of the same name. The bustling town centre may be only 15 minutes’ walk away, but this laid-back bohemian quartier is perfect for sunset aperitifs on the Pépé Guinguette, a houseboat moored on the quay, or waterside bars such as Le Bateau-lavoir and Café de l’Ile. Rent an electric boat (€25 an hour) to explore the Erdre, where a stylised Japanese garden with pagoda is hidden away on the Île de Versailles. For eating out, reserve at Le Brocéliande, where a €10 plat du jour could be a bistro classic of juicy lamb cutlets and garlicky potatoes or a vegetarian prune tagine.Best time to visitThere are cultural festivals all year round (Cinematography of Africa, Asia and Latin America kicks off on 19 November). The city is quite rainy (800mm a year – more than London) but mild.Getting thereTrains from London to Nantes, with a change of station in Paris, take about six hours, from £110 return when booked in advance.Jean Blaise is the founderdirector of Le Voyage à Nantes festivalLooking for a holiday with a difference?

She becomes embroiled in a deeper mystery involving her explorer uncle Asriel, his discovery of elementary particles known as Dust and possible parallel worlds that the all-controlling Magisterium wants to keep hidden. From there arise questions about the value of organised religion, the corruptibility of authority, the ambiguity of truth, what we mean by souls (embodied by the daemons all characters have, who represent their inner essences) and other such moral and theological considerations.Jack Thorne, the writer of acclaimed work from the This Is England series (with Shane Meadows) to National Treasure and most recently The Accident, is the man in charge of adapting Pullman’s magnum opus for the small screen. This series covers the first book, Northern Lights, and a second one, covering The Subtle Knife, has been commissioned. There is time and space to do them justice and the first episode, in all its steampunkish glory, gave every sign that the potential is to be realised. We begin with Lyra – a fierce, intelligent performance by 14-year-old Dafne Keen – being delivered for safekeeping to Jordan College by Lord Asriel (James McAvoy), invoking the principle of “scholastic sanctuary”. It’s a phrase that encapsulates so much of what drives the first part of the story, and is a sure sign to fans that they can relax and enjoy what’s to come.The opening episode covers the abduction of Gyptian child Billy and his people setting off up the river to find him, the master of Jordan’s attempts to poison Lord Asriel, Lyra’s discovery of Dust, her (re-) abandonment by Asriel, her acquisition of the all-important alethiometer, the arrival of Mrs Coulter (a fantastically unsettling Ruth Wilson) into her life and Lyra’s acceptance of the offer to become her assistant. She and Coulter board an airship and begin their journey to London, where her new friend promises to locate the missing Roger. Meanwhile, the Magisterium, its emissaries and its powers thrum in the background.Whatever flaws may develop as the eight episodes unfold, the show has vehemently eschewed repeating those of the dismal 2007 film, which (after much supposed studio interference) excised most of the questioning of the church and other such tricky subjects that don’t traditionally play well in the US. Despite the new series being a BBC co-production with HBO, it looks so far as though these ideas will not be compromised this time round.So much so, in fact, that there have been concerns raised that this is too dark to be suitable for children. But children will take from the material whatever they are ready for – be it insights into the convoluted heart of man, or delighted fascination at the idea of having a talking animal to accompany you wherever you go.And, just occasionally, the material will ready them for something else. That is what books – and prestige TV dramas – are for. Especially in a world where notions of fact, heresy, truth and who gets to define and censor them all need to be interrogated more urgently than most of Pullman’s young readers yet know."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f085db45fc4f199da594a4fa4755950cfd30ecc6/288_818_2346_1407/master/2346.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d8e1c1c6ec4e48b8e3ba08c4112a342","title":"tv tonight the audacious awesome end of the fing world","story":"The pitch-black comedy is back and as bold as ever.

A court in Fuyang has accepted his case. He questioned why a wildlife park would need to collect such information and had doubts over data security and who would be responsible if any were leaked.The case could possibly open wider debate in China over the use of such technology by businesses and the government.“China’s use of facial recognition, across the board, without any notice or consent, is appalling,” privacy expert Ann Cavoukian said, when asked about the significance of the case, which several Chinese outlets indicated was a first. “I sincerely hope there will be more resistance to such surveillance, but I doubt it will have much effect in China.”The park introduced facial recognition in July for annual pass holders and told those who did not register their biometric information by 17 October that passes would be invalid, Beijing News reported.About 10,000 visitors hold the annual park passes which cost £150 ($195) for a family of four, the park told the paper.Guo initially tried to cancel his card and get the money back after the facial recognition software was introduced but the park refused to return the full amount.Previously, cardholders were scanned with a fingerprint but system malfunctions led to long queues during peak season.Guo broadly backed the use of such technology by authorities but also said that the issue needed to be discussed more widely in China. “I think it is OK and, to some extent, necessary for government agencies, especially police departments, to implement this technology, because it helps to maintain public security,” Guo said, according to an interview with Beijing News. “But it’s still worth discussing when it comes to the legitimacy and legality of using the technology.”Calls to Zhejiang University of Sci-Tech to connect with Guo were unsuccessful.

Inspired by a flood of MeToo accounts that emerged in China, last year she brought a lawsuit against her former boss, a prominent and award-winning social worker, whom she claimed sexually harassed her four years ago.Over the course of proceedings, Liu Li, who uses an alias, saw her life scrutinised inside and outside the court. The defence argued that online posts she made about the play the Vagina Monologues suggested she was “open” to sexual advances. Friends and acquaintances, not realising Liu Li was involved, said they thought the claimant was a fame-hungry liar.But she carried on, helped by women’s advocacy groups and a lawyer. Then, on 11 July, a court in Chengdu ruled in her favour and ordered her former boss to publicly apologise. The win, while modest, is one of the first legal victories for China’s MeToo movement, which emerged last year as a dozen women publicly accused men in media, academia, the non-profit world, the tech sector and elsewhere of sexual assault and harassment.Earlier this month, another man was sentenced to six months in prison for molesting a woman and a minor on a subway in Shanghai, marking the first time someone has been criminally punished for sexual harassment on public transport in the city.“The movement really needs this right now,” said Lu Pin, a Chinese activist, based in New York.Liu Li’s case especially offers a much-needed injection of hope into a movement that has struggled recently under the weight of censorship, counter lawsuits and the detention of activists.“We were feeling our way in the dark, with no light ahead that we could see. You spend so much energy for a result that you can’t imagine,” Liu Li told local media after the court ruling. “Now, I want to tell even more people about this win. I want to tell them: this is definitely hard, but it is not hopeless.”Liu Li’s former boss, Liu Meng, said in a statement on Wechat in August last year, after Liu Li went public with her allegations, that the information online was “not true”. Calls to Liu Meng and his organisation were not returned and he did not respond to requests for comment. His lawyer has told Chinese media he plans to appeal and countersue Liu Li for defamation.In China where authorities regard grassroots activism with suspicion, the MeToo movement has frequently been censored. Authorities have shut down feminist social media accounts and banned search phrases related to MeToo while activists have been detained. Today, the movement is often referred to in Chinese as Mi Tu, or “rice bunny”, a homonym once used to get around censorship of the term.Still, authorities appear to be paying attention. Harassment and gender discrimination are illegal in China, but in December last year the country’s highest court added sexual harassment to the formal list of grounds for civil litigation, making it easier for such cases to go ahead. The government is also drafting a law on sexual harassment that will further define its meaning and require employers to better protect employees.Advocates say the movement still has a long way to go. Of at least 12 cases reported last year, according to NGOmetoo, a monitoring group, none have made meaningful progress aside from Liu Li’s.One case is that of Huahua, one of the earliest to go public with allegations against a well-known charity founder and anti-discrimination activist. In July last year, Huahua, who is also using an alias, published a letter online accusing the man of raping her during a fundraiser in Beijing in 2015 when she was a volunteer. The activist apologised and stepped down from his role as head of his charity but later told Chinese media that the sex had been consensual.Facing the prospect of a long legal battle in civil court, Huahua has decided for now not to pursue the case. Still, she has taken inspiration from Liu Li’s case. “It’s definitely a big victory. I’m very encouraged.”“The victory of Liu Li is definitely a positive influence. It must have been very difficult for her,” she said, of Liu Li.In one of the most high-profile cases of last year, a woman known by her nickname Xianzi accused a prominent CCTV host of touching and kissing her in his makeup room when she was an intern. Her case has stalled and the host, who has denied the allegations, has countersued friends who helped publish her account last year.Even Liu Li’s case is only a partial win. She did not win compensation for mental duress, as her complaint alleged – evidence, critics say, that courts still treat the impacts of sexual assault too lightly. Her former boss’s only punishment from the court is a public apology. Still, advocates say Liu’s case is one step forward and that they are encouraged by other less tangible improvements. More victims are getting help from others – forming support groups and seeking legal advice. Another former colleague of Liu Li’s is also pursuing a case against the same manager.“I used to be desperate,” added Xianzi, who said she finds younger women are becoming bolder and less ashamed to talk about cases of assault or harassment than previous generations. “Now I’ve become more optimistic.”Lillian Yang and Jiahui Huang contributed additional reporting"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fddb7959c83e9831743888d552d69356b9ce5cac/191_563_5620_3372/master/5620.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7d7497c1810b5eab91e4206813462a9","title":"monday briefing yes jeremy corbyn lays down law on brexit","story":"Labour leader tells shadow cabinet to fall in line over election … Grace Millane’s murder trial … and Lewis Hamilton’s triumphGood morning and welcome to this Monday briefing with Alison Rourke.Jeremy Corbyn has told his fractious shadow cabinet “the debate is over” on Brexit, as he seeks to stamp his authority on the general election campaign and shift the focus to social justice and the climate emergency. He told the  he has told his frontbenchers to fall into line after isions over Brexit sparked a furious row over an election. “I just said, ‘look, this debate is now over. We’ve done it, the party has now made its decision, and that’s it and that’s what we’re going to campaign on’,” he said. Corbyn said he had made a unilateral decision to back Boris Johnson’s plan for the 12 December vote, despite the vocal objections of several colleagues, including Labour’s chief whip, Nick Brown. “I put it to them quite clearly: I said, our objections are now gone. We are now supporting a general election – and everybody gulped. I didn’t alert anybody in advance – it was my decision. On my own. I made that decision. And they gulped, and said ‘Yes Jeremy’.” If elected, Labour plans to negotiate a new deal with Brussels – including a closer trading relationship – within three months, and put it to the public in a referendum within six.Meanwhile the People’s Vote campaign will unleash its £1m election war chest this week despite a continuing internal feud, in part about whether it should back more Labour candidates. Despite half of its staff still being on strike, the campaign says it has received £200,000 in donations in the past two days.Overnight, President Trump waded in to British politics, saying he hoped Boris Johnson and Brexit party leader Nigel Farage, would come together on a united political platform. But Farage said on Sunday he would not run for a seat in the general election and the PM has rejected the suggestion from both that he should work with the Brexit party.Grace Millane – The man accused of killing the British backpacker in New Zealand nearly a year ago has re-entered his not-guilty plea at the start of his trial. The name of the 27-year-old New Zealand man has been suppressed by the court. The judge said members of the 12-person jury had a duty to “put feelings of sympathy and prejudice to one side and approach their task coolly and dispassionately”. Millane, 21, disappeared from central Auckland on 1 December and her body was found in bushland in west Auckland a week later. The death shocked New Zealand and prompted an outpouring of public grief.‘Time to move on’ – The British-born CEO of McDonald’s, Steve Easterbrook, has left the company after violating company policy by engaging in a consensual relationship with an employee. The company said he had demonstrated poor judgement as managers are forbidden from having romantic relationships with direct or indirect employees. In an email to staff, Easterbrook acknowledged the relationship and said it was a mistake: “Given the values of the company, I agree with the board that it is time for me to move on.”‘Begging fines’ – A landmark high court case will consider whether fines for begging, loitering and leaving bedding in doorways unfairly targets homeless people, after the fundraising campaign for legal costs reached its target. Lawyers for Sarah Ward, who lives in Poole, will challenge a public space protection order in the town centre which prohibits obstructing doorways, sitting with a receptacle “for the purpose of begging” and other behaviour associated with homelessness. People found to have violated the order are liable to a £100 spot fine, which can rise to £1,000 if left unpaid, and receive a summary conviction. The case, to be heard in 2020, could have implications for a rising number of councils that have obtained the power to issue fines in England and Wales.Better latte than never – The first compostable one-cup coffee pods from a major manufacturer will go on sale this week in a battle to stop the 20bn pods used every year around the world from ending up in landfill.

News spread across his neighbourhood that there was a mad gunman on the loose. The children scattered to find safety but when Flea, real name Michael Peter Balzary, returned home, he realised the gunman was his stepfather. “He was the lunatic they were all talking about,” Flea recalled. “It was terrifying and shameful.” But it reflected a violent and sometimes terrifying childhood of drugs and petty crime, triggered in some part by the separation of his parents and his musician stepfather’s dangerous lifestyle.In Flea’s memoir, Acid for the Children, he tells of smoking joints at 12, roaming the streets with no one watching feeling abandoned by his father. Flea writes that he had “an undying sense that something was wrong with me, that everyone else is clued into a group consciousness from which I am excluded”. However dysfunctional his stepfather’s life, it exposed him to music: “When I saw him and his musician buddies set up in the living room to play bebop with such emotion and physicality, it changed my life forever,” he said. Ultimately, Flea said, he found everything about writing the book hard. “I went through so much to get it to be honest about what shaped me,” he said. “That’s what this is about: a yearning to know who I am.”Lewis Hamilton said 2019 has been his best and toughest season after he secured his sixth world title on Sunday with a second-place finish in the United States Grand Prix.

File photograph: Aidan CrawleyPaleo this and protein that and charcoal the other... What is it with all the food fads and why do they all cost so much money?1. The great diet con When it comes to food fads, ridiculous diets have been front and centre for hundreds of years. Our world is groaning under the weight of faddy notions that promise to keep us leaner and younger and more beautiful for longer and in the US alone, the diet industry is said to be worth more than $70 billion (€63bn) each year. Almost all that money is wasted.Detox diets are where a big chunk of change is flushed away. Such diets are among the most ridiculous of faddy food trends because they promise to help us lose weight and detoxify our organs when they do nothing of the sort. The reality is that foods do not help bodies detox – organs do that and no amount of celebrity endorsements will change that fact.While detox diets are stupid they might not be the stupidest diet fads that have ever appeared on our table. More than 100 years ago the world was enthralled by something called Fletcherism. It was invented by Horace Fletcher who said if people chewed every mouthful of every meal exactly 32 times they would lose weight. The programme was – obviously – nonsense although some people may have lost weight because chewing each mouthful of food 32 times must have seen them lose the will to eat any more.Silly diets were not the preserve of bygone eras and they still come thick and fast. It isn’t that long ago that Robert Atkins was said by Time magazine to be among the 10 most influential people in the world. Atkins invented his eponymously named high-proteinlow carbohydrate diet in the 1970s but it only really became a big deal in the last years of the last century. The diet – so the narrative went – allowed people to eat almost all the meat, seafood, eggs and cheese and other proteins they wanted but no carbs and not too many vegetables. Through a strict observance the weight was said to fall off. Did it work? Sort of – at least in the short term but it also caused bad breath, tiredness, dizziness, insomnia, nausea and constipation and failed people in the long run.2. Fryer tuck In the 1980s almost every home in Ireland seemed to fall in love with the deep fat fryer and we all sought to replicate the greasy chipper experience in our own homes every day of the week. They were certainly fast and sort of easy to use and deep fat fryers were able to cook almost everything but at what cost to our hearts, waist lines, skin and taste buds? They were also hard to clean and smelled pretty bad too if they were mistreated. They are still in use but are nowhere near as popular as they were in the 1980s. It many cases they have been replaced by the likes of the Tefal Actifry which uses hot air and a tiny amount of cooking oil to deliver a passable version of chips without the grease or the smell.3. Gadgets Hell There are scores of faddy foody things that promised to make our lives in the kitchen easier from the pressure cookers and SodaStreams of the 1970s to the spiralisers and the juicers of more recent years. But very few of them have delivered in the long term and the ones that have let us down all end up in that press in the kitchen where hope and ingenuity go to die.4. Airline food on your couch The idea of the TV dinner was sort of intoxicating – in much the same space age way as instant mash and rehydrated peas were. You could get a hot and healthy meal to eat while watching the telly in minutes with absolutely no washing up to do at the end of it all. And not only that, the TV dinner would sort of replicate the experience of dining on aeroplanes by iding your food into handy little compartments. The only problem was they were just a little bit revolting and not very healthy. While people still eat in front of the telly and still eat a lot of ready meals – the TV dinners of times past are gone.5. Meat free Now, if you are vegan don’t get cross. We know the path you are on is virtuous and we know you are making all sorts of sacrifices as a result of animal welfare concerns or concerns over the future wellbeing of the planet. And we are open to the idea that veganism is here to stay but when we see retailers and restaurants and manufacturers falling over themselves to hop on the plant-based bandwagon we can’t help but think we are in the midst of a fad. It is possible to live a healthy and happy life by eschewing all animal products but it is very hard work and involves a lot more than just swapping out regular milk for an almond variety and cutting the sausages out of your diet. We suspect that many of the people who have declared themselves vegan in recent years will find themselves giving up when the going gets tough.7. Cups runneth over And sometimes fads are very explicable. In an episode of Sex and the City which was broadcast in the US on May 10th, 1998, Carrie and Miranda spent 60 seconds sitting outside the Magnolia Bakery on Bleecker Street eating vanilla cupcakes and – we’re guessing here – talking about Carrie’s love life and how she was getting on with Mr Big or Aidan or whoever. As soon as the programme aired people were queuing outside the Magnolia Bakery to be like Carrie and within months the cupcake had unseated the humble bun in bakeries across the world including Ireland. But it couldn’t last and the cupcake was in turn unseated by doughnuts or cronuts or whatever you’re having yourself.8. Leave my coffee alone Coffee has been a particular target for the fad makers. In recent years, trendsetters have sold us coffee made from beans excreted by animals and have added butter to coffee and marketed it as way to get more energy while simultaneously shedding the pounds. Charcoal has also been added to lattes in order to make help us cleanse. One thing all the coffee fads have in common is the price. They are all ridiculously expensive.9. Pulled legs Barely 10 years ago, pulled pork did not exist in Ireland. Then it was suddenly everywhere. What looked like a mushy mess of meat was selling in high-priced restaurants and low-rent delis. It was all a long way from the North Carolina towns where it used to be made using the shoulder of a pig cooked slowly over barbecue coals until it was soft enough to be “pulled” into shreds and doused in barbecue sauce. You can still find pulled pork around the place but it is nowhere near as common as it was five years ago.10. AvoFAD Oh The same can’t been said for the avocado. While this fruit has been eaten by some people for many thousands of years, it only reached this part of the world in recent times and only exploded in popularity over the last decade. Marks \u0026amp Spencer was one of the first supermarkets in Ireland or Britain to sell “avocado pears” and when they first appeared on its shelves in 1968 they were so alien to shoppers that one customer tried to serve them as a dessert with custard. Since the start of this century global sales have climbed by more than 400 per cent and in excess of €5 billion worth of them are now consumed each year. So many patients cut themselves slicing the fruit that some trauma hospitals have coined the phrase “avocado hand” for the injury. The British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons have even called for a warning label to be put on avocados.The fruit was a staple in central America for centuries but a luxury item in the US. Then in 1926, a Los Angeles farmer called Rudolph Hass created a variety of avocado tree which grew a sweeter juicier fruit that was easier to grow, store and transport. It became known – obviously – as the Hass avocado and was all conquering and it accounts for more than 90 per cent of the avocados eaten. In the 1960s the avocado became more popular thanks to the increasing popularity of Mexican food and it became even more popular again in the 1990s when Sydney chef and restaurateur Bill Granger added lime, salt and chilli flakes to the mix and put it on toast and charged people a tenner for it.11. Quinoa The Incas who lived in Peru, Chile and Bolivia happily grew and ate quinoa undisturbed for many hundreds of years. They had plenty of it to go around. Then it started being exported to the US only in the 1980s and in the early part of the 21st century it was discovered by foodies who decided it was better than wheat, couscous or rice. Suddenly, the newly classified superfood was everywhere. It is probably more healthy than other options and it tastes grand but the heightened global demand has put pressure on many South American farmers to keep up. Many of them can no longer afford to eat their staple. Just imagine how we’d feel if the hipsters of Portland stole all our potatoes?12. Smells like protein spirit Protein balls, protein bars, protein shakes, protein bread, protein coffee, protein water, protein Weetabix? Is there nothing we won’t add protein to nowadays? Apparently not. And it is not hard to see why. “When the Box Says ‘Protein’, Shoppers Say ‘I’ll take it’” ran a headline above a Wall Street Journal article which was published six years ago and if anything our desire to have protein with everything has only intensified since then. The global protein supplements market is now valued at more than $12.4 billion each year. We do need protein but do we need so much of it to come from artificial sources and do we need to pay quite so much for it?13. Palee oh no Who decided that it was a good idea to build entire diets around what our ancestors ate eaten during the Paleolithic era which stretched from about 3 million to 10,000 years ago. While there is nothing wrong with a diet which is made up of meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds – the food that could be sourced through old-school hunting and gathering – there is something wrong with slapping the prefix “paleo” on to something and then charging us a premium for it. And we’re not mad about a programme that cuts out things such as cheese and bread. And apart from all that what was the life expectancy of the people who actually invented the paleo diet? Not many of them lived beyond the age of 30."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4071053.1572801914!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"monitoring of climate targets unsatisfactory audit finds","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan:  “For all the talk, for all the plans, emissions are rising, not falling.”  Photograph: Sam BoalRollingnews.ie The State’s system for monitoring whether Ireland is meeting key climate change targets is “unsatisfactory,” an internal Department of Communications and Climate Action audit has found. The audit found a “significant number” of failings with how progress on climate targets is recorded and reported to Government and senior department officials. “The arrangements in place in relation to the monitoring and oversight of the climate change targets within the department are unsatisfactory,” the audit concluded. Completed in November 2018, the department’s audit report was released to The  under the Freedom of Information Act. Ireland is set to fall short of European Union climate targets to reduce its carbon emissions by next year, and is also on course to miss significant 2030 targets. The strict targets include cutting greenhouse gas emissions, improving energy efficiency, and increasing production of renewable energy. Failure to meet the climate targets will result in heavy fines being levied against the country. The internal audit found Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton “is not informed on a systematic basis of performance gaps” in department policies to hit climate targets. As a result the Minister was “unable to advise Government of the need for corrective action”, the audit said. There was “no procedural arrangement” for reporting progress on emissions targets to the department management board of senior civil servants. The audit found this posed a risk decisions made by the board “may not be informed by the most recent information”.Similarly, the audit found there was “no regular arrangement” for reporting progress on renewable energy targets to the management board. The internal audit ision found while data on progress was collected, it was only provided to the board once a year. OireachtasThere was also a lack of formal reporting on overall climate change targets to Government and the Oireachtas, the audit said. The Oireachtas was only updated on Ireland’s performance towards the set targets when Mr Bruton, or the department secretary general, appeared before parliamentary committees, or in response to parliamentary questions. The audit recommended the department set up a “cohesive structure for reporting to Government, where all relevant information regarding progress on respective targets can be presented regularly”.Commenting on the audit, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said it was “very welcome that the department is recognising its own failings”. “That is critical because what the department were doing to date has been a lot of talk, with little action. What we need is to be monitoring what’s actually happening, rather than producing white papers or plans. For all the talk, for all the plans, emissions are rising, not falling.” In June, the Government launched an ambitious plan to significantly cut emissions on a sustained basis up to 2030, which included plans for increased carbon taxes, targets to push electric vehicle sales, and widespread retrofitting of homes. A department spokeswoman said a “central focus of the new plan is the establishment of the necessary governance arrangements to monitor and oversee progress towards meeting Ireland’s climate targets”.These included setting up a climate action delivery board, quarterly reporting to government on the plan’s progress, and introducing a Cabinet committee on the environment, the spokeswoman said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Dublin Airport owner told McEvaddys failure to take up offer would hurt value in future dealsIncident at S\u0026eacuteamus Woulfe\u0026rsquos Clontarf residence \u0026lsquominor\u0026rsquo although family was upsetClimate expert \u0026lsquowould not go anywhere near\u0026rsquo many of capital\u0027s coastal homes when buyingTrinity College refuses to say what paintings, sculptures kept for academic eyes onlyJudge highlights concerns over lack of communication about issues such as self-harmIrish goods may be cheaper due to tariffs imposed on UK imports if hard Brexit occursHines claims new regulations could add \u0026euro11,000 to construction cost of each flatScoping exercise into whether staff have \u0026lsquocase to answer\u0026rsquo established more than a year agoFormer top US official Posner urges Ministers keep pressure up on \u0026lsquoheavily polluted internet\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoSignificant number\u0026rsquo of failings around how progress on climate targets reportedSame-sex parents to be allowed register both names on child\u0026rsquos birth cert under new lawsGroup formed as \u0026lsquoalternative voice\u0026rsquo to those holding round-the-clock protest in townKind, founded by Angelina Jolie and Microsoft, has provided support to 22,000 children in USOver 30 calls logged in relation to rodents, ants, wasps, bluebottles and silverfishWoman takes action over dismissal from cultural bureau in Dublin two years agoRepresentatives of civic society seek dialogue on constitutional future of island of IrelandGarda\u0026iacute detained the man in his 20s after child is found with multiple injuries in BallynantyMan (30s) has leg wounds and his injuries are not life-threatening, garda\u0026iacute sayGarda\u0026iacute recover drugs during operations targeting two houses in the Westport areaAmbassador takes part in wreath-laying during service to commemorate the 1,192 Wicklow men who died in the first World War"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4071085.1572804430!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"expert says catastrophic storm surge in dublin inevitable over coming decades","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Great South Wall walkway in Dublin Bay with Poolbeg chimneys in the far distanceA catastrophic storm during high tide which will leave thousands of homes, businesses and landmark buildings in Dublin under water is inevitable over the coming decades, one of the country’s foremost climate change experts has warned. Prof Peter Thorne said Ireland had been lucky to “dodge a bullet” until now during major storm events – because they have struck during low or neap tides – but it was only a matter of time until the elements combined for a devastating surge. The Maynooth University academic, who was lead author on the fifth assessment report of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and is aged 40, said he expected a major high tide flood event in his lifetime.In the capital this would mean water from Dublin Bay surging into the Liffey while it was in full flow from the Wicklow mountains. “The combination of water trying to escape and water being pushed up into the river means it will end up moving sideways,” he said. Mr Thorne said the Liffey would “over-top into the surrounding areas” resulting in major flooding in the city centre, while areas like Clontarf and south Dublin would also be badly hit. “There would be hundreds or thousands of properties basically – residential, commercial and government properties – that would be under water for a considerable length of time, with all the implications that that has.” The cost of the clean-up, he predicted, would run into billions of euro. Some of Dublin’s most iconic landmark buildings along the quays from Dublin Port to the Guinness brewery, including Custom House and the Four Courts, would be submerged, he told The . Very lucky“In our lifetime the sea level rises are not going to accelerate much more than it is now – it will be going up a centimetre a year at most globally,” he said. “But then you have the storm surges – and we have been lucky, frankly. We’ve been very lucky over recent decades that when those storm surges have hit they have been at low tide or neap tide. “It is only a matter of time before one hits at high tide, or even worse, spring high tide. Then it will be very, very catastrophic.”Predicting the timing is like “rolling the dice”. “It could be decades, it could happen next week or it could not happen within our lifetime,” he said. “I would expect to see a major event in my lifetime. Somewhere in Ireland I would expect a major sea level combining with storm surge having a large-scale impact,” he said.“It would take months to dry out the structure of properties flooded. Some may be so damaged they would end having to be destroyed and rebuilt. But mostly it would be matter for residents relocating for six to 12 months.”He cautioned against people buying property less than 10 metres above current sea levels in the capital as well as other major urban centres built on the coast, including Cork, Galway and Waterford. “If you are thinking of buying a property clearly don’t buy one near the sea level. If you have a property already that might be at risk, thinking of how to – at low cost – mitigate that risk . . . you can’t at this point, you are kind of in the lap of the gods.” Low-lying areasMr Thorne said he “wouldn’t go anywhere near” many of the expensive coastal homes in low-lying areas of Dublin. “If I was buying property today that I wanted to eventually leave to my children I would not be buying property probably within five to 10 metres of the sea level.” Residents in Clontarf who successfully argued for the lowering of a recently built flood defence sea wall, at a cost of half a million euro to Dublin City Council, to restore their view were of a “King Canute mindset”, said Mr Thorne, who is also director of the Irish Climate Analysis and Research Units group. “For some reason these residents feel they can hold back the waters,” he said. “At a national level we need to think about what areas we want to protect and to what level we want to protect them. “Clontarf is a case in point where the government quite rightly wanted to protect the citizens, and the citizens unfortunately decided their view was more valuable than protecting their properties.” Mr Thorne added: “I don’t think people see the risk very well. We are very poor as human beings at recognising and coping with risk. This is one example of that.” Finite pot of moneyResponding to the Government’s briefing last week updating the progress of its climate action plan, he said it faced “hard and difficult choices as to which properties and areas it decides to protect and which it doesn’t”. “There is only a finite pot of money, and there is only a finite amount of properties that can be protected.” The Government will have to decide this on a basis of where is strategically, economically and politically important to protect “and where to let go because you can’t protect everything, you can’t do everything”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4071059.1572802935!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"over 1 000 sign new conversation open letter to taoiseach","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinger and politician Frances Black is one of the signatories of the open letter to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, published in today’s .

A local security source said there has been a recent spate of burglaries in the area.The burglary is believed to have been random and most likely “kids messing at Halloween”, a source said. Mr Woulfe’s family is understood to have been unharmed although upset after the event.Mr Woulfe, who is the legal adviser to the Government, was appointed in 2017. He became a senior counsel in 2005 and took over the role from Máire Whelan when she became a judge in the Court of Appeal.The burglary comes after an assistant commissioner said earlier this month that a curtailment on Garda overtime would not stymie efforts to tackle the expected rise in burglaries this winter.Longer nightsGarda research states residential burglaries can increase by up to 23 per cent in winter as thieves take advantage of the longer nights. The largest increase occurs between 5pm and 10pm, with more than 50 per cent of burglars entering through the front or back door.The Garda has enjoyed significant success in tackling burglary rates in recent years through Operation Thor, which uses intelligence and data analysis to target prolific burglary gangs.House burglaries fell by 50 per cent between winter 2014 and winter 2018, from 12,057 to 5,997. They fell 10 per cent between 2017 and 2018.Cash and jewellery tend to be targeted by robbers breaking into homes.

Eighty years later, and the effect is still breathtaking. MGM’s legendary musical adaptation of L Frank Baum’s children’s book, nominated for six Academy Awards, not only cemented Garland’s early stardom, but continues to transport those both young and old to a world where imagination is the only limit.Most memorable track: “Somewhere Over the Rainbow”Madonna, The Beatles, Nirvana, and The Police found themselves transported to the streets of 1900s Montmartre for Baz Luhrmann’s jukebox musical. Yet, as giddy and eclectic as Luhrmann’s directorial approach may be – making him one of Hollywood’s most unique creative forces – Moulin Rouge!’s doomed love story of a penniless writer (Ewan McGregor) and a courtesan (Nicole Kidman) is still grounded in the same sweeping romanticism that fuels the classic operas from which Luhrmann took his inspiration, including La traviata and La bohème.320 Singin\u0027 in the Rain (1952)Hollywood has (and will forever remain) in love with itself, but no other single film has ever quite shared that joy with audiences in the way Singin’ in the Rain does. A light-hearted parody of the industry’s transition from silent film to sound, MGM struck gold with its stars Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O’Connor. All three play off each other with both spirit and wit, while demonstrating unmatched technical ability: from the delightful tap routine of “Good Morning”, O’Connor’s pratfalls in “Make ‘Em Laugh”, to Kelly’s now iconic umbrella dance.Most memorable track: “Singin’ in the Rain”It’s a tough decision to determine which of the 10 musicals Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers co-starred in represents the very best of their work. The dance team are responsible for some of the most graceful, accomplished routines ever captured on film – and there’s no denying they made a perfect pair. As Katharine Hepburn is said to have noted: “He gives her class and she gives him sex appeal.” Yet, it’s Top Hat that remains their most fondly remembered collaboration, as a screwball romance of mistaken identities plays out across a series of glamorous locales in London and Venice.Most memorable track:  “Cheek to Cheek”520 Cabin in the Sky (1943)Cabin in the Sky has a complex legacy, and it’s difficult to judge how exactly it should be remembered. On the one hand, it’s a radical work, as a rare example of a musical with an all-black cast produced during Hollywood’s Golden Age. Although it was released by MGM and even nominated for an Oscar, the film was banned in several US cities on its release. However, as the product of a major Hollywood studio in the 1940s, the film is guilty of troubling racial stereotyping in its depiction of folksy, childlike black characters. Although this must be taken into account, the film remains a major part of film history, especially as it provides an opportunity to see some of the greatest black performers of the era – including Ethel Waters, Lena Horne and Louis Armstrong – in one place. It was also the debut film of Vincente Minnelli, who went on to direct the likes of Gigi (1958) and An American in Paris (1951).620 An American in Paris (1951)The height of class and elegance, An American in Paris rises to the top of MGM’s crop of musicals thanks to its George Gershwin score and its unforgettable 17-minute ballet sequence, which cost almost half a million dollars to film. Imagined as a fevered daydream of the film’s main character, Jerry (Gene Kelly), the sequence is a riot of colour and twirling skirts, as Jerry and his love (Leslie Caron’s Lise) traverse across a series of theatrical sets, each stylised to evoke a famous French painter. La La Land’s epilogue sequence is a direct reference to the film.720 The Sound of Music (1965)The third highest-grossing film of all time (when adjusted for inflation), Robert Wise’s adaptation of the stage musical has remained a source of great comfort over the decades. Drawing from the true story of the von Trapp family, who escaped Nazi-invaded Europe to continue their musical career in the United States, the film allows us to believe, even momentarily, in a world where kindness, joy and optimism is all that’s needed to shield us from the evils of the world, as exemplified by Maria (Julie Andrews) herself.Most memorable track:  “The Sound of Music”This wasn’t simply William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet reheated for a new generation. West Side Story injected new blood into one of our greatest tragedies, exposing how relevant the story remained in a decade as ided as the 1960s, when America faced conflicts both on a global scale, in the Cold War, and at home, with continuing racial tensions within the US. As the Jets, the white American gang, and the Sharks, the Puerto Rican gang, fight for control of their New York neighbourhood, two lovers cross the battle lines to offer the hopeful message that love will save us all.The inarguable peak of Bob Fosse’s career as a director and choreographer, Cabaret exemplifies exactly what’s possible within the musical genre. Utilising the Weimar Republic’s booming nightlife scene as a backdrop for the rise of the Nazi Party, Cabaret could be sexy, glamorous, dark, and sinister in equal measure, exploring topics that were largely taboo at the time (including abortion) while still delivering the musical’s traditional exuberance, anchored in Liza Minnelli\u0027s magnetic lead performance.The ultimate cult musical, once described by critic Roger Ebert as more of “long-running social phenomenon” than a film, The Rocky Horror Picture Show now comes with its own rules and traditions – you can either be enlisted to dress up and perform alongside the film, or join in with one of the many callbacks that fans all know by heart. It’s a testament to the film’s glorious, schlocky embrace of B-movie history and its message of feel-good sexual liberation and gender fluidity.Bugsy Malone is an idea that never should have worked on film: would we really sit and indulge in a cast of children playing pretend cops and gangsters? Yet, under Alan Parker’s direction, and thanks to Paul Williams’s riotous lineup of songs, the film is not only a delight, but feels oddly subversive in the way its cast so gamely fill the roles of wisecracking ne\u0027er-do-wells – a smart way to parody the cultural obsession with the machismo of the gangster genre.While the film may have earned its place in the history books thanks to Marilyn Monroe’s now iconic performance of “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend” – frequently revisited, whether by Madonna or Moulin Rouge!’s Satine – Gentlemen Prefer Blondes also deserves to be heralded for including one of cinema’s greatest double acts. Monroe and Jane Russell are formidable as two best friends on the hunt for the ideal husband, with Russell’s witty cynicist providing the perfect counterbalance to Monroe’s goofy bombshell.1320 Dancer in the Dark (2000)The film’s production history has been mired in controversy after its star, Björk, alleged that she had been sexually harassed by a Danish film director she worked with, with the Los Angeles Times later identifying the accused as Dancer in the Dark’s Lars von Trier. He has denied the allegations. However, it’s hard to deny the film’s cultural significance, as one of the most startling and groundbreaking musicals of the 21st century. Björk’s score adds incredible compassion to the story of an immigrant factory worker who finds herself betrayed by the world and its cruel machinations.Most memorable track:  “I’ve Seen it All”Rob Marshall, whose last film was Disney’s Mary Poppins Returns, has become the go-to director for the modern Hollywood musical. Having also directed Nine (2009) and Into the Woods (2014), his best work is easily Chicago, which became the first musical to win Best Picture since Oliver! in 1968. It’s a film that dutifully pays homage to its stage origins, including Bob Fosse’s original choreography, while still feeling slick and modern in its invocation of the 1920s and its lurid culture of celebrity criminals.Most memorable track:  “All that Jazz”Director George Cukor knew he had two key ingredients when it came to his take on the musical adaptation of George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion: Audrey Hepburn and the gorgeous stylings of Edwardian London. And so, My Fair Lady’s most delightful image remains Hepburn’s Eliza Doolittle, engulfed by an enormous black and white hat, hollering at a race horse to “move your bloomin’ arse!” Doolittle’s resilience and fierce sense of independence endures today, 50 years after the film was first released.1620 The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964)Arguably, the film could could be described more as an opera than a musical, since every line of dialogue is sung, accompanied by Michel Legrand’s score – but it’s also a work that feels purely cinematic, in love with how much life and colour can be conjured in every frame. The film remains one of the most purely romantic entries in cinematic history, as Geneviève (Catherine Deneuve), a teenage girl working in her mother’s umbrella’s shop, pines after her lover (Nino Castelnuovo) after he’s drafted to fight in Algeria.The Disney animated musical is almost a genre unto its own, considering how much it has to offer, but if one film must tower above the rest, it’s almost certainly The Lion King. Released at the height of the studio’s renaissance in the 1990s, the film recasts Shakespeare’s Hamlet in the African savannah, offering an epic story that deals with themes of destiny and responsibility, without skimping on the humour. If an entire generation is now scarred by the infamous stampede scene, it’s a price worth paying.Most memorable track: “Circle of Life”Much more than the screen debut of Julie Andrews, Mary Poppins has endured in the hearts of so many because of how it spoke to children: directly, but with a wit that never dared to patronise them. Knowing Mary was to be in on the great secrets lost to world-weary adulthood, and to be welcomed into the bountiful world of imagination and play – as beautifully represented in the Sherman brothers’ musical score and the film’s combination of live-action and traditional animation.Most memorable track: “A Spoonful of Sugar”Although Grease will largely be remembered for its karaoke-primed tunes, what’s often forgotten is how subversive the film actually proved to be at the time of its release. Grease helped break barriers when it came to the teen film, featuring characters (especially female characters) who speak frankly and openly about sex. As much as Sandy (Olivia Newton-John)’s “bad-girl” transformation can elicit eyerolls today, the scene isn’t as simple as a woman changing herself in order to impress a man – it’s also a kickback against the stifling sexual norms of American society.Most memorable track: You\u0027re the One That I WantLa La Land’s legacy is now forever tied to the great snafu of 2017’s Academy Awards, but there’s more to Damien Chazelle’s modern musical than a besuited Ryan Gosling trying to suppress an embarrassed giggle on the Oscars stage. A love letter to the genre’s history, it’s a film that both pushes forward while looking back, much like the ill-fated lovers at the centre of its story.Memorable track: “City of Stars” 120 The Wizard of Oz (1939)All the tricks and gimmicks of today’s filmmakers could never upstage The Wizard of Oz’s grand reveal, as Dorothy (Judy Garland) takes her first step into cinema’s bold, technicolour future. Eighty years later, and the effect is still breathtaking.

If somebody tells you, ‘you have six months to live’, very possibly you will – because you believe that.”Instead she is focused on fundraising for cancer research, specifically the effects of cannabis as a treatment for the disease.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab341 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive. At first, it seems as if this is low-key social realism in the Dardennes or Ken Loach mould, albeit set on the French Riviera. Gradually, though, we realise how stylised and theatrical his approach really is.” Geoffrey Macnab“Director Jon S Baird, whose previous film was scabrous Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, wrings every last drop of pathos he can from his material. This is very much a case of the tears of the clowns.” Geoffrey Macnab“Vice is bravura storytelling. McKay isn’t only taking us through Cheney’s life and career but is giving us a whistle stop tour through US politics from the Nixon administration almost right to the present day.” Geoffrey Macnab“Playing Lee Israel, McCarthy manages something very special: she makes a character who is odd, obnoxious, difficult and alcoholic seem lovable and even heroic. The rest of the world is at fault, not Lee.” Geoffrey MacnabGreen Book flatters the audience about its own good sense and tolerance. It deals with racism and homophobia but still has a fairytale, fantasy feel to it. Whatever humiliations Don endures on their road trip, we know no real harm will ever come to him as long as Tony is at his side.” Geoffrey Macnab“The golden age of bonkers horror movies is gloriously evoked by Netflix’s latest feature length presentation. Beginning as a satire of the arts world, Velvet Buzzsaw swiftly and gleefully descends into a savage splatter-fest, smeared in paint, viscera and garishly-bright blood.” Ed Power“Written by Ben Elton and directed by its star Kenneth Branagh, the film plays so fast and loose with the playwright’s final years that they needn’t have bothered fitting Branagh with a prosthetic nose – accuracy is clearly not the priority here.” Alexandra PollardThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the doomed progeny of a celebrated genius – brilliant but slightly stunted by the knowledge they will never live up to their predecessor.” Clarisse Loughrey“Nicolas Pesce’s sleek and stylish horror comedy is repulsive and funny by turns. In adapting Ryu Murakami’s cult novel, Pesce strikes just the right balance between humour and Grand Guignol-style shock tactics.” Geoffrey MacnabThe best moments here are remarkable. Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead. He’s an irrepressible figure with such an inbuilt sense of moral decency the film seems upbeat and optimistic, even at its darkest moments.” Geoffrey MacnabRalph Fiennes combines thriller elements with poetic flashbacks to ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev’s childhood and keeps a tight focus on the dancer. When he is most at risk, Nureyev makes decisions with his artistic future more in mind than his personal safety. As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the \u0027white crow\u0027 will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films. In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters. Tina is the innocent – a visionary who hardly understands her own powers but who can sense human venality and corruption wherever it appears.1641 Fighting with My FamilyCertain scenes feel very trite and predictable but the film gets you in a choke hold early on and won’t let you go. It is far more gripping than its subject matter might suggest. Who ever would believe a story about a wrestling family from Norwich could have quite such heart and resonance?Doppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele’s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.The Avengers cycle comes to a rich and very satisfying conclusion with Endgame, surely the most complex and emotional superhero movie in Marvel history. At 181 minutes, this is a veritable epic, but with so many characters and plot strands, it fully warrants its lengthy running time.It’s a rare and precious feeling when a film completely dismantles you. Eighth Grade – the directorial debut of US comedian Bo Burnham – breaks down every delusion we have about ourselves and burrows deep into those parts we’ve made such an effort to lock away. You may cry. You may shudder as every awkward social interaction that’s kept you up at night replays in your head all at once. You may feel the sharp pain associated with those moments when you feel completely isolated from the world. Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.Natalie Portman gives her fiercest, most memorable performance since Black Swan in Brady Corbet’s enjoyably subversive satire about a troubled pop star whose loss of innocence mirrors the fall from grace of the US itself. Portman’s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking “floozy” whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.Robert Pattinson gives one of his most striking performances as Monte, the death-row criminal in outer space, tricked into making a voyage described at one stage as a “class-one suicide ride”. The former Twilight star makes his shaven-headed, gaunt-faced character seem hyper naturally sensitive and feral at the same time.Amazing Grace is as uplifting a film as you will see all year. It’s a concert movie filmed over two nights and featuring Aretha Franklin, the “first lady of soul”, performing gospel standards in a church in Los Angeles in 1972, with a huge backing choir and an enthusiastic congregation.Disney’s live-action remake of its 1992 animated feature is a rip-roaring, old-fashioned matinee-style spectacle that turns out far better than we had any right to expect.“Olivia Wilde is a visually inventive director, who keeps the tempo here so brisk that we hardly notice how glib the storytelling sometimes becomes. We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clichés.” “Late Night is a caustic satirical comedy that turns into an unlikely tearjerker. It’s by turns snide and uplifting, and often very funny too. Its writerproducerstar Mindy Kaling makes vicious observations about the inanity, narcissism and corruption of the mainstream US media at the same time as she celebrates the professionalism of many of those who work within it.“Gloria Bell is somewhat exhausting – both unbearably intimate and at a constant remove – but it is endlessly pulled back into focus by Moore, who has a firm understanding of the delicate balance between contentment and yearning, joy and pain, recklessness and spontaneity. In a remake that could have felt indulgent in the hands of people less skilled, she more than justifies its existence.”The brilliance of the new film lies in the surefooted way it caters both for children too young to have seen its predecessors and for adults who’ve grown up (or grown older) watching the previous instalments. It takes some kind of genius for the Pixar animators to give such a searing emotional charge to a story in which one of the main characters is a single use plastic spork retrieved from the trash.Perhaps The Flood isn’t quite the urgent, profound film a crisis of this scale deserves, but in a culture where refugees are so rarely shown any empathy in mainstream media, maybe this is the film we need right now.Ari Aster\u0027s follow-up to Hereditary serves up much of the same: it’s a break-up movie wrapped up in pagan horror. It’s also bound to be one of this year’s most memorable films, proving that Aster is far from a one-hit wonder.The Lion King is undoubtedly a technological marvel that, much like Avatar, will come to be viewed as a milestone in special effects history, yet it’s just as interesting to see how all this innovation has been employed.3241 Varda by Agnès  For a film that’s almost entirely narrated by Agnès Varda\u0027s own voice, it doesn’t feel driven by ego, but by pure intellectual and emotional curiosity.Animals treats its subjects with patience and generosity. You’ll find no life lessons here. Its main characters are free to pursue their desires, to whatever end.3441 Blinded by the LightBlinded by the Light offers not only a reminder of Springsteen’s lyrical genius, but of how he’s always served as a beacon for the disenfranchised.Lined up against some of this year’s other more heartfelt offerings, including Booksmart, Good Boys offers further proof that putting a little humanity in our comedy always gets the best results. Hustlers is an electrifying response to the deluge of stories we’ve had over the years about very rich, very bad dudes. Finally, we can turn the tables on every film that’s used women, specifically strippers, as decorative accessories to drape over businessmen as they conduct their illicit backroom meetings. Or, failing that, to shake their out-of-focus tits in the background of a shot.For Sama is one of the most profoundly intimate depictions of the Syrian conflict ever put to film. It’s the push to help those on the outside process something so incomprehensible in the depth of its horrors.The real drama here is not whether or not apocalypse can be avoided but whether Brad Pitt’s character can reconcile himself with his father and overcome his own extreme emotional repression. In other words, in spite of all the jargon and the hardware, this is an intimate family melodrama at heart. Thanks to Pitt’s performance and Gray’s delicate direction, it turns into a very moving one.Wrapped up in all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, The Farewell is a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Simply put, it’s one of the best films of the year.This is Renée Zellweger’s Judy. It doesn’t belong to Rupert Goold, its director. Nor does it belong to Tom Edge, its screenwriter. It’s a performance of such overwhelming force that it wrests authorship from every other hand that guided the film’s creation.4141 Ready or NotAs absurd and self-indulgent as Ready or Not can get, it doesn’t mess around with its social commentary. The class system is the game we never asked to play, don’t get a fair chance at, and have no hope of winning. It’s a timeless metaphor.“Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move.

The fact is that whatever promises are made over the course of this election campaign, taxes are going to have to rise over the coming decade.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But critics say that behind the scenes the animals are being controlled by painful hits from metal bullhooks and left “psychologically broken and suffering immensely” from the treatment and training they receive.‘Skeletal’ baby elephant made to bang head to music as tourists laughThey accuse the centre of being a “baby-making factory” where female elephants are often relentlessly “bred”, spending much of their lives in repeated pregnancies.Even expectant mothers are forced to perform tricks, such as “painting” and kicking a football, three times a day, often while still in chains, according to the investigators from the Moving Animals group, who claimed to have filmed the abuse.Female elephants are artificially inseminated repeatedly, spending 18-22 months pregnant each time, and their babies are bred into lives of captivity.The calves are taken away from their mothers when they are two years old, then put into phajaan, a training process known as “the crush”, which is used across Asia to “break a young elephant’s spirit”.“Under phajaan, elephants are bound with ropes, confined in tight wooden structures, starved, and beaten repeatedly with bullhooks, nails, and hammers until their will is crushed,” National Geographic has reported.Moving Animals says this process is used to force calves to become money-making performers to entertain tourists who pay to see calves at the nursery before watching older elephants perform “cruel” tricks including:painting pictures while their mahout pinches their delicate ears to guide the paintbrushthrowing sharp darts at balloonskicking footballs into goalsperforming an “excruciating” recreation of the now-illegal logging industry, pulling and stacking heavy logsOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But its website says elephants cannot be released into the wild as they would be at risk from farmers protecting their crops and from landmines.It adds that the elephants are used to being chained, which prevent them from straying, and that hooks are used only by mahouts in defence of his own life.But the footage shows at least one trainer using a bullhook to make elephants comply.Amy Jones, of Moving Animals, said: “Our investigations across Asia have repeatedly shown elephants face relentless physical and emotional suffering to take part in rides, processions and performances.Call for ban on adverts for tourist adventures with elephant rides“It is heartbreaking to think these innocent babies at Maesa Elephant Nursery are at the start of a lifetime of captivity that will feature sharp bullhooks, cruel performances, and severe psychological stress.”National Geographic’s witness account went on: “When a baby is about two years old, they say, mahouts tie its mother to a tree and slowly drag the baby away.

But the machine depends on electricity –\u0026nbspsomething in critically short supply in Gaza.\u0026nbspSamar’s story is far from unique, with the enclave’s two\u0026nbspmillion residents forced to try to survive on roughly three hours of electricity since Israel imposed a blockade in 2016.Hospitals and other buildings rely on generators to keep the power on during the cuts, but they are expensive, and until recently, a luxury that Samar was unable to afford.\u0026nbspIn comes Majd Mashharawi, an award-winning entrepreneur and CEO of a company that is providing radical solutions to Gaza’s energy crisis.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Family home destroyed in strikes on Gaza: in pictures Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Tamer al-Wakeel lived with his family in the building destroyed in an Israeli airstrike on 5 MayTamer al-Wakeel stands among the ruins of his family home which was destroyed in an Israeli airstirke on 5 MayA man clambers among the rubble of a building that was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike on 5 MayA man stands among the rubble of a building that was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike on 5 MayThe rubble of a building that was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike on 5 MayTamer al-Wakeel lived with his family in the building destroyed in an Israeli airstrike on 5 MayTamer al-Wakeel stands among the ruins of his family home which was destroyed in an Israeli airstirke on 5 MayA man clambers among the rubble of a building that was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike on 5 MayA man stands among the rubble of a building that was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike on 5 MayThe rubble of a building that was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike on 5 May“I wanted to address two serious issues in my community –\u0026nbspelectricity and building materials,’’ she tells The Independent.\u0026nbspShe designed SunBox, a generator that uses solar power to provide electricity in the face of the blockade. Linked up to panels that residents can install on their roof, the machine generates 1,000 kilowatts of electricity and needs only three hours to recharge back to full capacity. Gaza, she jokes,\u0026nbspwill never run out of sun.\u0026nbsp“SunBox is more than a solar device that provides lights for my kids to study and run the TV for them, it really changed my life by providing electricity to run the medical device for my sick child,” says Samar.\u0026nbsp“Now I do not have to worry every day whether I can go to the hospital or not, I do not have to run anymore to be on time so I can provide him with oxygen before something happens.”\u0026nbspResourced from China, SunBox subsidises the generators, but at $450 (£348) it was still too expensive for many in the enclave. According to the World Bank, unemployment in the strip is 47 per cent, among the highest in the world.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company initially started by providing energy to 15 families, but this soon skyrocketed, and in the first quarter of 2019, she says more than 1,000 people were using the clean-energy source.For another customer, Muna, the energy source has enabled her to continue her work from home as a tailor. She says her small business was severely affected by the electricity crisis and she’d often stay up all night waiting for the electricity to come back.\u0026nbsp“I don’t have to worry when I will wake up and when I can sleep. I never imagined I would control my source of energy, I feel independent,” she says.\u0026nbspSunBox is not Majd’s first project to have found a novel solution to one of Gaza’s crises.\u0026nbspAfter the 2014 war between Israel and Hamas, 17,000 homes were destroyed or damaged and some 100,000 people were left homeless, according to the UN.\u0026nbspThe war and the ensuing devastation had\u0026nbspa profound effect on Majd: “I thought, as an engineer, what can I do for my people?”\u0026nbspHouses needed to be rebuilt, but the block on many imports meant that Gazans were unable to get the cement and aggregate needed for bricks.It was among the destruction and debris that Majd founded her first project: “Green Cake”. Hers was a revolutionary solution: Combining ash and rubble to create an affordable, cheap and sturdy building block.The team went through dozens of trials until they found the prototype that passed the strength, water and fire resistance tests.\u0026nbspThe response was overwhelmingly positive, and her first client commissioned her team to build an external wall with 1,000 blocks.“This is not just a building block, it’s changing the stereotype of women in Gaza,’’ she says.\u0026nbspFor Majd, her inventions are a crucial way of challenging the stereotypes around women in Gaza and trailblazing the way for other female entrepreneurs.\u0026nbspClients are often surprised to find that the CEO of SunBox is female, and she recounts how her engineering class at the Islamic University of Gaza had a 6-1 male to female ratio.These preconceptions only spur her on further: “Education is the strongest weapon us women have to fight for our freedom, a decent life and our future.\u0026nbspMajd is now training new graduates to be involved in her company, with a big focus on recruiting women. Well known in her community, she has an open-door policy in her office and gives advice to young entrepreneurs.\u0026nbsp“I want to show that we are not just victims in Gaza.

Are these two really the brightest and the best  Obviously not. But with politics becoming ever more isive and toxic, they are all we have left.Let’s be honest. What normal human being would want to be part of such a cesspit  As we are all well aware, the past three years have seen a constipated parliament unable, or unwilling, to sort out Brexit, forcing us all into a nightmarish version of Groundhog Day.I believe the idea of a European referendum was the height of stupidity by a spooked David Cameron who wanted to neuter Nigel Farage. When the nation voted Leave, Cameron was the first to abandon ship.Never mind “women and children first”. He was rowing away from a Titanic mess in a leboat stuffed with like-minded, snivelling clowns, leaving poor Theresa May behind playing an out-of-tune piano with the rest of the ship’s doomed orchestra. Mrs May foolishly called an election that was a personal disaster, then was worn down until she had to step aside.Boris Johnson thought he could bluster and blag his way to a solution and promised we would exit the EU a couple of days ago, on Halloween. For all his blather about “dying in a ditch”, he couldn’t deliver.So here we are, facing a pre-Christmas election at a time when distrust of politicians has never been higher and our expectations have been never lower. It is easy to dismiss the whole bloody lot of them as a waste of time.But there ARE some decent MPs who want to make a dference. Sadly, some are unwilling to put up with the scrutiny and vilication the job now entails and many are heading out the door.Female MPs, in particular, have been subjected to online abuse that chills the blood. As well as death threats, they have had to deal with vile monsters threatening rape and other violent attacks. It’s horric to have to cope with such hideous abuse on a daily basis. I can’t blame them for quitting in despair.Their fears are real. We saw that with the tragic murder of MP Jo Cox in . She was a we and mother who wanted to make the world a better place and do the best possible job for her constituents. It’s a real pity the MPs now calling it a day are mainly moderates who were calm ­voices of reason amid all the shrieking and howling from extremists on both sides of the political ide.Heidi Allen, a Tory who joined the Lib Dems, can no longer cope with the “nastiness and intimidation” which has become the norm in Parliament. Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan is leaving because the abuse towards her has had a “clear impact” on her ­family.The Tory and the Labour leaderships should hang their heads in shame at allowing such an appalling situation to develop. They should have called off their attack dogs and clamped down on cowardly online trolls.There have always been robust arguments and passionate debates in politics — but nothing like the sheer hatred and aggression Brexit has unleashed. MPs were used to attacks from opposing parties. But now some of the worst abuse comes from inside.Left-wing extremists threaten deselection for Labour MPs who even whisper about their discontent with Corbyn. Tories find themselves booted out for failing to toe the line. Sadly, the next six weeks will see even more of this aggression as we have to listen to hate-filled rants and ­ludicrous, undeliverable ­promises to secure our votes.It is strange to think that Westminster was respected and admired not so very long ago. I honestly don’t think those days will ever . We deserve so much better.SOME welcome good news comes in the form of Richard and Judy, who will pop back on to our TV screens to front the show they helped make such a huge success.It was meant to be a one-off when they presented This Morning a couple of weeks ago. But viewers were so excited, “R and J” have an open invitation to .The stumbling block has always been because Judy was reluctant toto live national TV. But Richard told me this week she really enjoyed herself and loved reconnecting with This Morning’s loyal audience.Richard was quick to stress that they are not after anyone’s jobs or in the market for a permanent– but it would be lovely to pop in now and again. I’m delighted. They are both total pros who make it all look delightfully easy and relaxed.They also have the sort of public affection only enjoyed by the Queen and Dame Judi Dench.IT is heartbreaking to think Ben Needham would have turned  this week. He has been for ever frozen in time as that little blond toddler playing in the Greek sunshine before going missing on Kos back in .Brave mum Kerry has never once stopped fighting to discover the truth. Three years ago, British police finally conducted a thorough investigation.They believe Ben was killed in an accident involving a digger on a building site on the island, where his grandad worked and close to where the family lived at the time. Despite handing over their evidence to authorities on the island, there have been no further attempts to find Ben’s body.Poor Kerry should have been celebrating her grown-up son’s milestone birthday, perhaps with her daughter-in-law and grandchildren. Instead, her agony ­continues.She has no closure, no grave to visit and is no nearer to finding out exactly what happened to her son almost three decades ago.I CAN’T wait to see what Michelle Visage and Giovanni Pernice have in store for us on Strictly Come Dancing. Last week their Halloween routine was perfection and Michelle foxtrotted around the floor like a gothic goddess.She was my tip to make the final even before the first steps were taken in this year’s competition. I knew Michelle had the sass, talent and work ethic to go all the way. I love that she’s flying the flag for the over-s while exuding buckets of sex appeal.Don’t forget that for years Michelle suffered with a serious autoimmune disease she believes was caused by her breast implants. She has only just recovered from surgery to have them removed.Michelle is a steel magnolia and the best is yet to come. So make sure you give her and Giovanni your vote.A HUGE thank you to everyone who has been so positive about Shine, my book out this week.With my th birthday coming up at the end of this month, it felt like a good time to reflect and take stock. I also wanted to share all of the knowledge and advice I’ve acquired from so many of the guests and experts I’ve met over the  years I’ve been on TV.So I decided to put it all into a book that will hopefully give useful tips and information to make your le better. I want it to be a book you can have by your bedside, to dip into when you need a bit of a confidence boost or advice on looking good and feeling great.I’m doing some signings on Saturday, so do pop in and say hello at WH Smith in Glasgow’s St Enoch Centre at noon and at Waterstones on Princes Street in Edinburgh at pm.I WAS in the US last week, going through astronaut training at Nasa. I will tell you about that very soon. But I also managed a couple of days to recover in Florida’s Key West. My husband and I had no idea that at this time of year there is a little event called Fantasy Fest. Well. What an eye-opener that was.Some brave souls were out and about in nothing more than expertly applied body paint. I was a bit bemused at first and obviously I refrained from joining in.But it is amazing how quickly you get used to someone wearing nothing but a leather posing pouch standing at the bar talking to you about the latest Trump baloney.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was called “man”.He was hemmed in on all sides by giant deserts he couldn’t cross because, at this point, God had not invented the Land Rover. But it didn’t matter back then because this part of the world was full of all the food and water the mans and womans would ever need.It was lush, green and beautul. Everyone was very happy. Now, imaginethey’d known the planet was about to wobble on its axis, which would cause us to start on an all-new orbit around the sun.Imagine the panic. Imagine how many Greta Thunbergs would have rampaged about the place, blaming their elders for the mess and the certain death that faced them all. All the usual routes to the ­watering holes and fruit trees would have been blocked by ­activists in weird costumes saying a whole new way of le had to be adopted to stave off disaster.Everyone would have been told to go vegan and stop wearing shoes made from leather. But they didn’t know the Earth was about to wobble. They just woke up one morning to find the climate had changed.It was warmer and wetter. In fact, there was so much rain, the deserts surrounding them came to le. This meant they could explore strange new worlds and boldly go where no one had gone before.They moved to Europe and Asia. They spread out across the seas and soon, they came up with ­literature and agriculture and architecture and medicine. They became civilised and happy and healthy. And then they started going on holidays and drinking beer and laughing on the way home from the pub with their friends and a delicious kebab.And then they got next-day delivery on anything they wanted and a new smartphone every year and Instagram. One day, a tall man with a motoring show on the television was even able to drive a Lancia right across the salt pans where it all began. And all of that was possible thanks to a big, juicy lump of global warming.That’s the thing about climate change. We keep being told the next sht will be a disaster for mankind. But who knows  You might wake up one morning to find your garden full of unicorns and mermaids and big chests full of jewels and money.LOTS of people are wondering why Jeremy Corbyn took so long to agree to an election. But the answer is simple.Corbyn knew the longer he could stall Brexit, the more damage would be done to the one thing he hates more than everything : Britain. He’s always sided with anyone who wants to do us harm. The IRA. Hamas. Russia. You name it.He wants everyone in those camps in Calais to come here because he knows it will destabilise our way of le. In fact, every one of his policies is designed specically to ruin the country.Because that’s what the bitter and twisted weasel wants. Mind you, the Shadow Chancellor is even worse.Which isn’t strictly trueyou’ve got a one-off Ferrari  Speciale MM. APPARENTLY Daniel Craig was fed up with saying: “The name’s Bond. James Bond.” Well, I’m sorry, my precious, but you’re not getting any sympathy here. If you’ve worked in a poultry farm for  years, you can say you’re fed up with chickens.Andyou’ve worked on the railways all your adult le, you can say you are looking forward to a retirement without trains. But you, Mr Craig, only said that line FIVE times. Which is hardly taxing, is it No matter. There’s talk about who will replace him in the role. And because Bond is so woke and #MeToo these days, we cannot rule out the possibility that the role will be given to Diane Abbott or Janet Street-Porter.Some of me hopes he really does die in the new movie, as has been rumoured. Buthe doesn’t, might I suggest the part is given to a chap called Geoffrey Moore, top I met him at a party once and was impressed by his louche, charming style, his clever eyebrow work and his bright orange skin that even David Dickinson would call “over the top”.I’m not sure he can act. But that doesn’t matter because neither could his father Roger . . . and he was the best Bond of them all.BAD news. It seems the plug has been pulled on the hotly anticipated prequel to Game Of Thrones.They had a stellar cast including the brilliant Naomi Watts. And it was being written by Jane Goldman, the brains behind Kick-Ass and Kingsman. And her husband Jonathan Ross.HBO, though, has obviously decided the end result won’t work, which begs a question: How can they know I’ve worked in television for  years butsomeone came to me and said: “We have a show featuring an old lady baking cakes” I’d have put their ideas in a big bag of rubbish, along with that hare-brained scheme to stage a prime-time dancing competition.GATWICK airport is set to roll out a new system to cut boarding times and reduce delays.Sounds clever, yes.

Nor is he remotely likely to hold the balance of power.There is no longer a route to the No Deal Brexit he wants. Nor any prospect of Boris Johnson caving to his demands for a pact, destroying the Tories’ unity. And it is patently untrue to say Boris’s deal is not Brexit. The Tory ERG simply wouldn’t back itso.It will end our membership, payments and free movement and extract us from the customs union and single market, with no “backstop” keeping us half-in. We would trade freely as an independent nation. And Boris alone can get us out. The sole alternative as PM is Corbyn, and he will keep us in the EU for ever.In a few constituencies Farage’s party could hurt Labour more than the Tories. Overall it is FAR more likely to prevent Boris winning the majority which is vital to delivering Brexit and without which it is lost. That is why Farage’s ultimatum to the PM delighted Labour.Two by-elections — in Peterborough and Brecon, both of which the Tories should have won — were gted to Labour and the Lib Dems by Brexit Party votes. On December , those could put Corbyn in Downing Street in a Remain coalition.At which point Farage’s legacy won’t just be that his vanity wrecked his le’s work.That a party he founded with only one aim, a real Brexit, became the very instrument of the project’s destruction.He will be remembered as the right-wing maverick who handed anti-Semitic, anti-Western Marxists an unprecedented chance to plunder the world’s fth-largest economy. The Sun admires Farage.His pressure brought about the referendum AND a better deal. But he could now be the author of a double national catastrophe.He and his voters should think again.WE’VE heard it all now.Labour’s Tom ­Watson, of all people, insists broadcasters must combat the Tories’ “fake news”.That’s the same Tom Watson who destroyed lives spreading a paedophile’s lies.Whose party’s campaign centres on a blatant fiction about Boris “selling the NHS to Trump”.Whose leader lies endlessly about his terrorist sympathies and anti-Semitism — then sinisterly orders reporters: “Just report what we say.”These charlatans lecture journalists about the truth.But they themselves are strangers to it.Andthey took power, Press freedom would be a nostalgic memory.The Sun joins everyone rooting for Owen and England’s rugby heroes.Best of ruck, lads!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But oddly,  is one of the things that mean the Tories might win that majority this time round. They are determined not to make the same mistakes again. As one senior party figure puts it: “We screwed it up once. We’re not going to do that again.”When Chancellor Sajid Javid spoke to Tory MPs on Wednesday night, he reassured them that “this campaign will not be like last time”. He described Theresa May’s  effort as “the most incompetent election campaign in modern times”.In , the Tories assumed that their chunky poll lead would easily translate into a big majority. There was a complacency and cockiness about their campaign. There was no ­rationale for why Mrs May was going back on her pledge not to have an election and a belief that the Tories could use that lead to win a mandate for almost anything.This time round, the Tories are being much more cautious. The groundwork has been laid for this campaign. Conservative Campaign HQ has been getting election-ready for months. The Tories have heavy-hitters ready to join their ­campaign team, including Paul Stephenson, one of the key ­figures from Vote Leave’s  victory. In , Mrs May took her own party machine by ­surprise with her decision to go to the country.In another dference with the ex-PM, Boris Johnson has a clear argument for why an ­election is needed — the only thing this Parliament is capable of on Brexit is delay. It is hard to see how anyone who wants Brexit and has seen what has happened since the  election could disagree with that.This Tory desire not to screw up will also lead to more ­discipline. This time, the ­manesto will be a cautious document, not an attempt to gain a mandate for a series of deeply unpopular reforms. The fact that everyone knows this election will be close helps the Tories too. There’ll be much more scrutiny of what a Corbyn premiership would mean than there was in .Cabinet Ministers believe that the prospect of a Labour SNP deal which would see Nicola Sturgeon’s Scottish Nationalists help Corbyn into Downing Street in exchange for another independence referendum is already cutting through, and particularly in Scotland, where the Tories are increasingly ­confident they can limit their losses to five seats or fewer.But perhaps the biggest dference from  is between Johnson and May. May had never done a ­national campaign before, she disliked big events and preferred going door to door. Boris, by contrast, is a showman who has already ­successfully fronted one nationwide effort, the  referendum. Boris knows how to make himself the centre of attention in a way Mrs May never did.As one Cabinet minister puts it: “Boris is ­capable of stealing the oxygen from all the other candidates.”The most signicant threat to the Tories is pro-Remain tactical voting. The big question, frets one Cabinet minister, is whether Labour and the Lib Dems end up splitting the ­centre-left vote and letting the Tories win — as happened with Labour and the SDP in  — or whether there is anti-Tory voting that condemns scores of previously safe Tory MPs to defeat — as happened in .Butthe Tories avoid the pitfalls of , then even from a much less promising starting position they should be able to win a majority.THIS election will see the first ever head-to-head televised leaders’ debate between the two big parties. On November , Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson will clash in primetime on ITV. Both Labour and the Tories think they will benefit from this one-on-one format.On the Labour side, they hope that it helps them unite the anti-Tory vote behind Corbyn. The Tories think the question of who you want to be Prime Minister – Johnson or Corbyn – favours them.During the  campaign, Theresa May lost her lead on this question. But right now, Boris Johnson has a -point advantage over Corbyn. If he can maintain anything like this margin, he’ll still be in No  come Christmas.Downing Street also thinks that making this election a forced choice between a Tory government and a Labour government works to their benefit. Polling for Conservative Campaign HQ shows that half of voters want the Tories in government in some way, compared to just over a quarter for Labour.They calculate that making the election a choice between Johnson and Corbyn helps them squeeze the Brexit Party vote down – something which is particularly important given Nigel Farage’s determination to put up candidates right across the country.Influential Tories are also worried thatthe Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson turns in a barnstorming performance, her party could threaten the Tories in their shire seats.Johnson himself will not do the seven-way debate between the party leaders. The Tories are keen to downplay the importance of this event. I’m told they are considering sending Sajid Javid, Michael Gove, Priti Patel or Rishi Sunak.THE “moratorium” announced on fracking today is a sign of the Tories’ safety-first approach going into this election. They want to close down issues that could cost them seats.One minister defends the decision to abandon the effort to improve the UK’s energy security by saying: “The reality is, it wasn’t happening.”But a bigger factor was their desire not to go into the election with this as a potential vulnerability.I understand that, in stark contrast to , the manesto will be a cautious document designed to prevent handing ammunition to Labour.AT CABINET on Tuesday, Boris Johnson called the Scottish Secretary Alister Jack to speak.An embarrassed Jack explained that he wasn’t actually trying to get in, to which Johnson replied he thought his hand was up.Jack, a multi-millionaire who owns a large farm, then quipped to laughter: “That’s why my farm manager doesn’t let me go to auctions.”THE Tories are planning to accuse Labour of staging a massive raid on the pension pots of million voters.This would hurt the .million who contribute to a private ­pension. Afterwards, one Tory told me Javid’s message was clear: “Labour are coming after your money.”I understand the Tories are also preparing a “tax bombshell” attack on Corbyn.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But they never got one vote from our house. And I have been thinking of my parents over the past few days and wondering: Would they have broken the habit of a letime and voted for Boris Johnson Because that is the key to who wins this General Election. We hear a lot about how Boris has to woo “Workington Man” — “an older, white, non-graduate male from the north of England with an interest in rugby league and a tendency to vote Labour”. But it is not just Workington Man who holds the keys to  Downing Street now.From one end of the country to the other, it is all those voters such as my mum and dad, who never voted Tory before. That is who Boris has to woo and win. Those millions of Tory virgins.The polls all suggest there is a massive majority for parties which favour leaving the European Union. Butthat vote is split between the Tories and Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, then we don’t get Brexit.We get Jeremy Corbyn gurning on the steps of No. We get an economy in ruins. We get Venezuela without the nice weather.  But splitting the Leave vote is not a strategy for delivering Brexit. It is a cast-iron guarantee that Brexit is cancelled. If you want to see the result of the Referendum, you have to vote Tory.My mum and dad would not have recognised the rotten Labour Party of today. They would have been baffled, then angered, by the total absence of anything resembling patriotism among Corbyn and his Marxist mob.My parents would have scratched their heads at Labour’s immigration policy — to allow “as much free movement as possible” — not because they disliked foreigners but because they thought the identity of their country was worth preserving.My folks would never have trusted a grizzled old Marxist like John McDonnell with their hard-earned wages. They would have been wary of seeing the police force supervised by Diane Abbott.They would have noted Emily Thornberry sneering at the flag of St George while happily adorning herself in the EU flag. They would not understand how Corbyn could happily lick the sandals of Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA.My parents — the kind of people who fought our wars, paid their taxes for a letime and built this country up from the rubble — would not have spat on this Labour Party. And after years of seeing Parliament place itself above the people, they would have crawled across broken glass to get to the polling booth on December .My parents believed in democracy. They had no doubts about the importance of voting. They would never have voted for Jeremy Corbyn. But would they have seen that the Conservative Party is now their natural home That’s your historic task now, Boris — convince the millions of working-class patriots like my mum and dad that you truly understand their lives. Andyou can do that, you will win a landslide.We have heard a lot about the failure of fire chiefs and their policy of “stay put” which added to the death toll of .But there has not been nearly enough focus on the heroism of the firefighters who were there on that hellish night.Firefighters put their lives on the line for strangers.Yes, that is their job. But their job deserves our unequivocal respect and gratitude.PRESENTER Samira Ahmed is suing her employers at the BBC for £, in pay because she received a fraction of what Jeremy Vine was paid for allegedly “similar” work.I like Samira Ahmed on Newswatch and wish her well.But Jeremy Vine is far more of a household name. And when it comes to getting paid, star power matters more than gender.I would like to be banking the same royalty cheques for my books as JK Rowling. But best not to hold my breath.IN the Eighties I did a story on the politan Police’s Vice Squad, which logged the contents of the pornographic videos they seized while watching the raunchy action in fast-forward.I can still recall the bored, joyless expressions of the young Vice Squad coppers as they yawned through all that fast-forwarded filth.Now Netflix is offering the same sort of thing – aallowing viewers to watch shows at up to one-and-a-half times the normal speed. Don’t bother.If it’s not worth watching in real time, it’s not worth watching at all.THERE are million dog owners in the UK and I can’t have been the only one who cringed to hear President Trump boasting that IS monster Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had “died like a dog”. And exactly how does a dog die, Mr President In my experience, a dog dies surrounded by humans who feel as though they have just had their heart torn out. A dog dies surrounded by love. A dog dies bitterly mourned by the family it leaves behind.According to Trump, the IS leader, “whimpered, cried and screamed like a coward . . . in utter fear, panic and dread”. My dog is not going out of this world like that. When our Stan finally goes, many years from now, he will be in my arms and looking in my eyes.Death will be painless and peaceful. It will be a moment of love and grief. Who writes your lousy material, Donald  All this “dying like a dog” rubbish felt stupidly off-the-cuff.While the world is mightily glad to see the back of a mass murderer, the florid violence of Donald Trump’s language sounded exactly like the kind of crass rhetoric we hear from terrorists.The President’s sneering “died like a dog” line was particularly misjudged because American special forces were helped in their ultra-dangerous mission by military search dogs.They pursued al-Baghdadi right up to the moment he detonated his suicide vest, injuring one of the brave dogs – a Belgian Malinois named Conan – who will be honoured at the White House next week.Kill all the terrorists you like, Mr President. But there is really no need to talk like one.THE traditional Guy Fawkes Night celebrations of my childhood have largely been replaced by Halloween.This makes me incredibly sad, although my we says Halloween is far less dangerous than all the bonfires and bangers of my boyhood.But did you see this outfit Craig Revel Horwood sported on Halloween ROBBIE WILLIAMS, , has challenged Liam Gallagher, , to a boxing match.Really not recommended at their age.

Happily, though, most of us know that, these days, coercion and force in the bedroom are not only ­unromantic but unacceptable.The offending lyrics in the song, which is a duet, are uttered by the female voice, which sings: “I simply must go, the answer is no” . . . only for the man she is singing to to hand her a drink — and for her to question what is in it. Obviously not good on any level. But this song was written in  .It was a hit during a time when sex was for marriage, and women weren’t actually allowed to express any active interest in men so had to feign modesty at all times. In the s and s, before the Pill was introduced, that dance of reluctance and “persuasion” was part of the courting process and the whole process of seduction was based on women pretending they weren’t interested only to be ­persuaded that they were.But look how dferent things are now.Also, let’s face it, when you get the magnying glass out, there are plenty of storylines from the past that don’t quite measure up to the standards of . Look at James Bond, who basically sexually assaults Honor Blackman’s ­character Pussy Galorein the movie Goldfinger.Or the song Every Breath You Take and the film Love Actually, both of which feature a stalker as the romantic lead. And when you think about it, Daniel Cleaver’s courting of Bridget Jones really just boils down to ­sexual harassment.There are countless other examples of “romantic” plots which are very dodgy indeed by current standards but, at the time, we all lapped them up. And don’t even get me started on the lyrics of rap songs that are being played today which routinely talk about killing and raping women. Now that is grim.But instead of allowing this song to exist as the relic from the past, soul singer John Legend and Kelly Clarkson have rewritten it. Their version now includes the lines, “What will my friends think If I have one more drink  ”.That is instead of “The neighbours might think,   Say what’s in this drink  .  Legend describes his version as having “a new-found sensitivity in the #MeToo era”. I’d put it a dferent way and say he is ­trying to re-write history.Last year a radio station in Ohio announced it would stop playing the original because of ­complaints from listeners saying the song, “didn’t have a place in modern music”. That’s fine. No one needs to play itpeople are offended by it. But the idea that we can airbrush the fact that it existed in the first place is ridiculous and I worry we are all in danger of trying too hard to be PC.The risk is we become so vanilla, so afraid of upsetting everyone with our view, that we stop speaking our mind, which is a form of societal repression. Yes, it’s good to stand up for what you believe in, but taking offence at the lyrics of a song more than  years old might not be the best cause to bat for.Everything has a context, andwe aren’t careful we will all be so worried about how “woke” we are that we will forget our own views and how to express them.PARENTS everywhere will be reassured to learn that even when you are a sporting hero your kids still think you are a bit of an embarrassment.Peter Crouch said in an interview yesterday that his daughter, Sophia, who is eight, initially asked him to stay outside when he dropped her off at summer camp – because the other kids were laughing about how tall he is .The thing is, as any parent will confirm,it wasn’t his height she would have found another reason that he had to stay outside, whether it be his shoes, coat or haircut.In fact, don’t worry Peter, as they get older they get embarrassed about you just for breathing.MILLIONS of motorists use their mobile phones while they drive. Thirty-five per cent of drivers under the age of , and  per cent of all drivers, admitted to taking their eyes off the road to check texts, email or social media, an RAC survey reports.But the current law means reckless drivers can only be prosecutedthey are caught using hand-held phones to call or text. Meanwhile, those who take photos or scroll through music playlists are exempt from punishment.So police have struggled to enforce the law because they are often unable to prove exactly what drivers are using their phones for. Bear in mind thata driver looks at their phone for just two seconds while travelling at mph, they will cover ft blind, drastically increasing their chance of an accident.So I’m fully behind plans for a ban on even touching a mobile phone while driving, which were announced – drivers take note – on Friday. It is thought the ban could be in place by spring next year.Drivers caught holding phones to browse social media, or even input a sat-nav location, now face six points and a fine of up to £. But how anyone can be complacent enough to check Insta while in charge of a moving metal box that can kill people is beyond me.I have not driven for ten years – I walk or get the Tube – but my kids do and it really bothers methey even so much as glance at their phones. There is no doubt that it is distracting – and dangerous for the driver, but also to others. So this proposed new law is nothing but a good thing as far as I’m concerned.I’VE never been one to embrace dressing up for Halloween or any other kind of forced fun.Sorryyou think that makes me sound like a killjoy, but one thing I have noticed with each passing year is the sexualising of Halloween going off the scales.Forget wizards, goblins and ghouls – every celebrity event seems to be populated only with sexy vampires, sexy ghosts and sexy witches.

Millions of pensioners face being stripped of the vital leline from June after the Conservatives axed a  manesto commitment. But Shadow Culture Secretary Mr Watson told the Mirror: “The Tory decision to scrap free TV licences for over-s is utterly callous. “Four in  older people say the TV is their main source of company, but from next year . million older people will lose their free TV licence.    “It’s disgraceful. Our message is clear - vote Labour to save free TV licences.” The Conservatives promised at the  election to protect the benefit for the rest of the Parliament, which had been due to run until . But the BBC had already been handed responsibility for funding the leline from June , under a deal stitched up in . It says that continuing to fund free licences would have cost £million - a fth of its budget - by -. That is equivalent to what it spends in total on BBC, BBC, BBC, the BBC News Channel, and children’s stations CBBC and CBeebies. The corporation plans to curb the benefit, meaning just . million OAPs are likely to continue receiving free licences when restrictions take effect next Spring. From June, only over-s receiving Pension Credit will be eligible - meaning % of over-s, some . million OAPs, will have to stump up to watch their favourite shows. The Mirror is campaigning to save the leline, with more than , readers backing the fight by completing coupons in the paper. More than , have signed Age UK’s Switched Off petition calling for free licences to be preserved and the Government to take back responsibility for funding.    Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Royle Family actor Ricky Tomlinson have supported the battle. Ricky, , said: “I absolutely agree with what Tom Watson’s saying. “It’s an absolute disgrace to try and withdraw the TV licences. “It’s all they have got, some of them depend on their television for their news, for finding out what’s going on. “Some people are lonely, they are locked away in these little places on their own. “It is common sense what Labour is announcing - we are supposed to look after the old aged pensioners. “Why do we take away from the people that have got nothing in the first place ” Mr Brown, as Chancellor, introduced free TV licences for over-s in  - meaning that for two decades the age group has been spared having to dig deep to switch on their sets.    Rattled PM Mr Johnson tried to head off criticism of his party’s betrayal, admitting: “This needs sorting out urgently and I’ll be talking to the BBC about how to sort that out.” He has repeatedly tried to dodge blame for the row - and previously claimed he would “put the screws” on the BBC over free TV licences. Speaking in August, he told the Mirror: “The BBC received a settlement that was conditional upon their paying for TV licences for the over-s. “They should cough up.” Piling pressure on parties to commit to saving the benefit - currently worth £. a year - Age UK Charity Director Caroline Abrahams said: “The general election is a perfect opportunity to ensure that whoever forms the next Government, they take steps to keep TV licences free for all over-s. “The current Government’s decision to abandon this highly-valued universal entitlement - that’s been in place for a generation - has caused real dismay, prompting approaching a million people of all ages to sign petitions. “Many older people are especially worried and angry about this issue. “TV is the main form of companionship for two in five over-s and much more than a box in the corner of the room – it is a precious window on the world and often their main source of news, entertainment and company. “We call on all the parties to include the funding of free TV licences in their pledges at this election. “There’s no doubt that vast numbers of older people care deeply about this and are waiting eagerly to seeour politicians will stand by them in this way.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kevin maguire prime ministers brexit","story":"NewsopinionKevin Maguire: Prime Minister’s Brexit blunders will cost us all dearlyThe Treasury refuses to estimate the financial damage of Johnson’s Brexit bomb only because Chancellor Sajid Javid knows it is disastrousShareCommentsByKevin MaguireAssociate editor:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsopinionBoris Johnson is an expensive nightmare for low and middle earners, the disabled, pensioners and users of public services\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

The £million unbuilt aposluvvieapos garden bridge, illegal water cannons, narcissistic buses, the conceited Boris Island airport plan in the Thames that never took off and an expensive Taxpayers’ Stadium for West Ham United’s owners – who just happened to donate cash to the Conservative Party – were bad enough. But they are pennies compared with the pounds his party has cost the country, with their austerity programme – which has cut the economy, squeezed wages, destroyed public services and killed thousands of people – and now Brexit. The Treasury refuses to estimate the financial damage of Johnson’s Brexit bomb only because Chancellor Sajid Javid knows it is disastrous.    Experts at the respected NIESR think tank have calculated it would cost each of us £, within a decade by slashing £billion, or %, off the economy creating a Wales-sized hole.

Jeremy Corbyn delivers a big Brexit speech today in Essex in a smart move to address the issue. He can then focus an election fight on general issues such as wages, jobs, health, education and crime.

MPs are electing a new Speaker for the first time in  years - less than  hours before Parliament dissolves for a general election. On the same day Mr Bercow - a former Tory - will resign as MP for Buckingham - leading to a race in his seat. But that contest will likely now be lumped in with the pending election. Current deputy Sir Lindsay Hoyle is the favourite while Labour grandee Harriet Harman is bidding to become only the second woman to hold the post.

But theyaposll be put forward as a single candidate to be aposconfirmedapos by MPs - so theyaposre pretty likely to keep the role. OnlyMPs vote down the new Speaker in December will there be another full ballot.  It comes after Mr Bercow - regularly accused of anti-Brexit bias but hailed as a hero of Parliament by his fans - finally announced he will bow out after a decade. The Speaker wept as he announced he would quit on October  in a declaration watched by his we Sally. The timing of his resignation was no coincidence. It meant the current Parliament - not a new one - could choose his replacement. That is important because it means a group of MPs who are against a hard, no-deal Brexit will be choosing the next person to oversee the legislature. Many of them are bowing out when Parliament dissolves on Wednesday So how will the Speaker election work and who is running  Heres everything you need to know.  MPs are voting for a new Speaker on Monday  November - the same sitting day that John Bercow quits as an MP. Candidates must submit their nomination papers, signed by at least  MPs from at three parties, to Commons authorities between .am and .am on the day of the election. Names of all the approved candidates are then published at am before a snap hustings in the Commons chamber at .pm - consisting of a speech from each hopeful. In the Speakeraposs chair for the debate will be Ken Clarke, the veteran Tory, because he is aposFather of the Houseapos - the longest continuously-serving MP in the Commons. MPs will then be given half an hour to vote for their favourite candidate on a ballot paper. If no single candidate wins more than % of the vote, the lowest-ranked candidateis eliminated and there is another round of voting. This continues until one candidate has won more than % of the total votes from MPs. A motion is then put to the Commons proposing the winner as Speaker. It can go to a vote again but by this point, they are likely to win. Traditionally the Speaker is dragged to the grand seat, supposedly against their will. Confirmed candidates Lindsay Hoyle Labour, Chorley, age . Odds:    The Lancashire-born businessman went to private Lordaposs College in Bolton and ran his own screen-printing firm before becoming an MP in . He has been a Deputy Speaker for nine years where his no-nonsense manner led to clashes with MPs - including telling off the SNP for singing EU anthem Ode to Joy in . In the same week he had a fierce clash with ex-SNP leader Alex Salmond, with the pair shouting at each other across the chamber over time slots given to Brexit scrutiny. Despite this Mr Hoyle is generally regarded as a popular figure who hasnapost made enemies in the same way as Bercow. There was an outpouring of tributes in  when his -year-old daughter Natalie was found dead. An inquest recorded an open verdict. Mr Hoyle was one of just three Labour MPs who did not declare their voting intention in the  EU referendum. His Lancashire district backed Brexit by % to %. Harriet Harman Labour, Camberwell  Peckham, age . Odds:     As Westminsteraposs longest-serving female MP, the QC is known as the Mother of the House with  yearsapos unbroken service. She spent more than two decades on the Labour front bench including as Deputy Labour Leader, Tony Blairaposs first Minister for Women and Leader of the House of Commons.  Born in London and educated at private St Paulaposs Girlsapos School, Ms Harman worked for the National Council for Civil Libertiesbefore becoming an MP in . Following a torrent of stories in the Daily Mail, she later said she regretted the NCCLaposs decision to grant affiliate status to a pro-paedophile group before she joined the staff. When she was elected barely  women had served in the Commons in its history. Her decades of activism for womenaposs rights led to mockery from right-wing pundits, including when she toured a pink bus round the country in . Her four-month stint as acting Labour leader, before Jeremy Corbyn took power, was marked by her decision not to oppose cruel Tory tax credit cuts that were later scrapped. Other controversies included being banned from driving in  after she was caught speeding at mph on the M. While in government she also tried to block the release of detailed Parliamentary expenses data. Due to her long experience and cross-party reputation, her name has been put forward as a possible caretaker Prime Ministerthe government loses a no confidence vote. Ms Harman was a prominent Remain-backer in  and though she has promised to be scrupulously neutral on Brexit, she has also warned she will be a champion for Parliamentelected. Her warning that she will take a robust stance could spark fears she will be a continuity John Bercow. Dame Eleanor Laing Conservative, Epping Forest, age . Odds:     The privately-educated solicitor from Paisley has spent six of her  years in Parliament as a Deputy Speaker, meaning she did not declare how she voted in the  EU referendum. She was a Special Advisor during the Thatcher and Major governments, and after her  election was an early Tory backer of equalising the age of consent at  for gay men. But she attracted controversy in  when she allegedly criticised a pregnant MP for leaving a debate to eat. She also voluntarily repaid £, during the  MPsapos expenses scandal over claims relating to a second home. Announcing her candidacy, she said the next Speaker should definitely be a woman as people need a breath of fresh air in Parliament. Meg Hillier Labour, Hackney South  Shoreditch, age . Odds: Not available  The privately-schooled former journalist and councillor served on the London Assembly before her election in . As Gordon Brownaposs Identity Minister she was tasked with promoting the failed ID card scheme - but was left red-faced in  when forgetting her own ID card at a photoshoot. She later served as Shadow Energy Secretary under Ed Miliband before rising to prominence as the hard-bitten chair of the powerful Public Accounts Committee. Pro-EU Ms Hillier voted Remain in the  referendum, voted against triggering Article  in , and earlier this year said Parliament should seriously consider delaying or revoking Article  to cancel Brexit. Chris Bryant Labour, Rhondda, age . Odds:     The privately-schooled former Church of England vicar dabbled with Conservatism as a student, before leaving the priesthood in  when he realised other members of the church believed the Bible doesnapost really like gays. He moved to London and rose through the ranks of the capitalaposs Labour groups through the s before his election to Parliament in . He shot to prominence soon afterwards for his role exposing wrongdoing in the press, including extracting a confession by then-Sun editor Rebekah Wade in  that the paper had paid the police for information in the past. He has become an outspoken voice on skin cancer after discovering he had melanoma on a trip to the barber. The MP voted Remain in the  referendum and said the whole country should have a chance to hold a second referendum on Brexit. His opening offer to MPs marked him out from John Bercow, emphasising that he would stick to rules and fairness. Dame Rosie Winterton Labour, Doncaster Central, age . Odds:  Not available  The privately-educated MP began her career as John Prescottaposs assistant in the s before her election to Parliament in . She spent almost a decade on Labouraposs front bench under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown before becoming the partyaposs Chief Whip in . Her six years in the top job presided over a tumultuous time in the party when more than  Labour MPs voted no confidence in Jeremy Corbyn but he refused to quit. Before becoming a deputy speaker in , which bound her to rules of impartiality, Dame Rosie voted Remain in the EU referendum but said it was important to respect the nationaposs vote to leave - including in her Doncaster seat. Sir Edward Leigh Conservative, Gainsborough, age . Odds:    The privately-educated veteran MP since  has only an outside chance due to his tub-thumping backing for Brexit. He has highly conservative views on social issues including backing the anti-gay Section  and voting against civil partnerships. Briefly a junior minister under John Major, the MP has spent all but three of his  years in Parliament as a backbencher including on the trade, procedure and parliamentary restoration committees. Shailesh Vara Conservative, North West Cambridgeshire, age . Odds: Not available    The MP since  was born in Uganda and moved to Britain aged four, where he studied at a grammar school in Buckinghamshire. He worked as a solicitor in the City of London in Hong Kong before joining Parliament.

The report did not state how many users were actually stung by the fraudulent behaviour from the app. Secure-D launched an investigation into behaviour from the app following reports of strange transaction behaviour and the appaposs subsequent removal from Google Play. Security experts found subscription verication texts to premium digital services on two devices examined as part of the investigation. These confirmed unwanted subscription sign-ups that occurred without any user intervention. The investigation also found the app had been delivering invisible ads and non-human clicks to its users.    A conclusion folllowing on from the investigation declared compromised mobile apps and mobile ad fraud was a growing problem. While Google Play was typically a safe source of Android apps, they could still be compromised. To avoid falling victim to data theft and unwanted purchases or subscriptions, Android users should immediately check their phones to seethey have any suspicious app installed, the report read.Just last month Android users were advised to delete a series of apps that contained malicious software and could risk a major data breach."},{"url":null,"title":"cctv shows car mounting kerb","story":"NewsCCTV shows car mounting kerb before crashing into pub smoking area, killing manPolice arrested a -year-old man on suspicion of murder after a white Nissan Qashqai slammed into an outdoor smoking area at the Spinnaker Public House in Colchester, EssexShareByChris KitchingLouie SmithEwan Foskett:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video cctv-shows-nissan-mount-kerb-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news cctv-shows-car-mounting-kerb-\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

A -year-old man died and a -year-old man suffered le-changing injuries in the horror smash at the Spinnaker Public House in Colchester, Essex. Police arrested a -year-old man on suspicion of murder after the white Nissan Qashqai slammed into an outdoor smoking area just after .am on Sunday. Witnesses said it sounded like a bomb had gone off and they described a distressing scene with victims pinned against the wall and trapped underneath the vehicle. Have you been affected by the incident  Email webnews@mirror.  The Nissan is understood to have crossed the road, mounted the pavement and smashed a trellis fence before ploughing halfway through a pub window. People were left pinned against the wall while others were trapped underneath the vehicle. Sources close to the investigation say it is not believed the collision was a targeted attack. Witnesses say revellers were laughing and joking in the smoking area shortly before the crash.  Regulars say the man who died had been enjoying an evening meal at the pub with his partner. One friend said: “It is so weird we were just laughing and joking and now he is dead. “It was an average night out, you would never expect that to happen. It is understood Ian Winter, , was in hospital with le-changing injuries to his legs and hips, and his friend Carl Joyner, , was less seriously injured.  A -year-old woman, who was a passenger in the Nissan, suffered minor injuries and is said to have been seen having a panic attack following the crash. Friends Mr Winter and Mr Joyner, who play football together, met at the pub after watching the Rugby World Cup final between England and South Africa earlier on Saturday. Mr Winteraposs half-brother, James Howard, said: “I donapost know the full extent of his injuries, he is under sedation and being monitored. “As far as I know he had been out for the rugby in the morning and then this happened.  “Itaposs devastating, Iaposm still in shock – I hope he pulls through. “Whatever the future now holds for him his friends and family will be there for him.” Mr Joyneraposs stepmum, Tina Joyner, said: “He is in Colchester Hospital. “I have no idea what happened, all I know is they were standing in the smoking area and this car ploughed into them. “I don’t know what injuries he has.  “He was just down the pub having a drink with his friends and this happened.” Pub landlord Rod Isbister paid tribute to the victims and the emergency services, and thanked regulars in a post on Facebook. He wrote: You have helped Bridget and I get through a very dark day.We are devastated that a wonderful talented young man has lost his le through no fault of his own and pass on our condolences to his family, girlfriend and friends. We so hope our amazing courageous friend Ian can battle his injuries and come back to us and Carl be strong you were both amazing in the face of such devastation. Something early this morning put the Great back in Great Britain for me and that was the amazing professionalism of our emergency services your efforts will never be forgotten.We will be closed for some time to recty the structural and interior damage. In the aftermath, witnesses described a harrowing scene. Neighbour Simone Rowe said: “I spoke to a chap who was in there at the time and he was just playing pool. “He said it was like a bomb went off and everyone just got on the floor.  “There were people trapped under the car and they were pinned against the wall. “I came back home and saw the paramedics wheeling out the dead body. A friend of one of the injured victims said he was devastated to hear about the incident. The man, who gave his name as Sean, said his friend was airlted to hospital by helicopter with two broken legs, two broken hips and possibly a broken sternum.

Emrah and Avni Piro, from Croydon, were devastated when they struggled to conceive - a struggle caused by both being overweight. As they were both morbidly obese, they decided as a couple to change their diets. After joining The : Diet by Cambridge Weight Plan in , the pair were over the moon when Emrah lost six stone and Avni dropped a whopping twelve stone. They were ecstatic when Emrah fell pregnant with Ceren, who was born August ,  but they couldnapost believe their luck when Emrah fell pregnant for a second time just three months later.    Emrah gave birth for the second time in  months to their daughter, Jeyla, on September . The pair are now sharing their story to give other couples hope. Emrah, , said: Avni and I had grown really comfortable with each other which probably aided our weight gain. Iaposve suffered with polysystic oies for a long time too, so I knew conceiving wouldnapost be easy.    Avni and I come from a Turkish Cypriot background so food has been a big part of both our lives for a long time. We would overindulge on things like carbohydrate heavy meals with lots of pasta or potatoes in particular. But we decided to ditch our unhealthy ways and join The : Diet in the hope it would help us conceive naturally after eight years of trying. December  I was just lb away from reaching my six stone loss and my weight loss coach said to me I looked tired and she was a little concerned as I hadnapost been looking myself.    Iaposd mentioned my period had been late, but this was always quite normal for me, but she advised I do a pregnancy test anyway. I was completely gob smacked when I saw my positive pregnancy test - Avni and I had pretty much lost hope of conceiving naturally. But to then fall pregnant naturally again in just  months was just unbelievable! We honestly couldnapost believe our luck. Prior to Emrah falling pregnant with the first of their two miracles, Avni suffered a health scare which kick started the couplesapos decision to lose weight.    Emrah said: In August , Avni ended up being rushed to hospital with breathing dficulties which was really worrying. This wasnapost helped by his  stone frame either - after being looked over by the doctor, Avni was told he was on the verge of type two diabetes. At this point, this is when we both knew we desperately needed to make a change to our diet and lestyle. Emrah and Avni, who have two older children Cenel, , and Jeyan, nine, had always wanted four children and tried for eight years to try expand their family.    Their first child, Cenel, was conceived through IVF whilst Jeyan was natural the pair had started planning for another round of IVF - but ended up not needing it. They now feel their dreams have come true following the births of Ceren and Jeyla. Since their amazing, combined weight loss of  stone, both Avni and Emrah have become consultants themselves at Cambridge Weight Plan. Emrah said: Since our weight loss, Avni and I are hoping to help others do what we did.

Michael, , and Paul Atwal-Brice, , say they found exposed wiring, dead cockroaches, dust and dirt on every fixture and fitting and, most disgusting of all, a used condom in the bed. The couple, from Barnsley, took their two adopted twins Levi and Lucas - aged  - on a dream holiday to the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, US. But they claim what was supposed to be the trip-of-a-letime turned into an ordeal when they arrived at the £-a-night Caribbean Beach Resort hotel. Both boys are autistic and donapost speak, while they also suffer from epilepsy and asthma.    Having the room cleaned is important to their needs and the hotel was made aware of this, promising to clean and check the room before the familyaposs arrival. Disney World says the couple have received compensation numerous times, but claims their claims are exaggerated.Michael and Paul, who hit the headlines in  when they adopted two sets of twins - Levi and Lucas and toddlers Lance and Lotan, were terried about the dangers they claim the hotel room posed. Michael told : Straight away you could see the room was dirty then we saw a dead cockroach, which was quite big. There was lots of exposed wiring. Our boys have no sense of danger, so they could easily stick their fingers in that. There was so much crap and dust. You wouldnapost put a dog in there. It’s been a holiday from hell so far. Dead cockroaches and other bugs in  the room, broken lights with exposed wires and, worst of all, a used condom on the bed. The boys could have stood on the cockroach and could very easily have touched the condomthey dropped their bouncy ball down the side of the bed.  Levi and Lucas are severely autistic and require full-time care from their dads. This holiday was supposed to be like all their presents rolled into one. With flights, the Disney Package which includes tickets to Walt Disney World and the £-a-night hotel, in all the couple spent around £,. The flight took  hours before a two-hour ride on the Magical Express bus which takes holidaymakers to the resort.  After all that, the family were distraught with what they found. Thataposs what shocked us. Weaposve not just booked any old hotel. Weaposve purposefully booked this resort and spent a vast amount of money to make it all magical and special, said Michael. Itaposs supposed to be magical, once in a letime, but that was like a one-star bedsit. We couldnapost stay in there. The boys were upset and were screaming and distressed. It was a really bad start to the holiday.  When the couple complained to front desk at the Caribbean Beach, they say they were moved to another room. But to make matters worse, the next room contained just as much dirt and dust - as well as centipedes moving around the place, Michael and Paul allege.Michael said: It was more like Iaposm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! Having the room cleaned is very important to our boysapos needs. We made front desk aware of it and they said thataposs fine. They said it would be pre-checked but it was also really dirty and dusty, with centipedes moving around the room. Michael said Disney staff initially refused to refund any more than one nightaposs stay but, as things escalated, senior management got involved. Now the family have been moved to Disneyaposs lavish, bayside Grand Floridian Resort and Spa.

Nathan Priestnall, , says he has had a string of bad experiences with bartenders at The Green Dragon, in Leek, Staffordshire. He claims workers have aposslappedapos his change down on the bar - instead of putting it in his hand - poured his pint away, and even chased him out of the bar.His latest run-in with the employees landed him with a ban from the pub, StokeOnTrent Live reports. Mr Priestnall was having a drink on October , when he spotted a sign about a Halloween party.   He asked for more details at the bar, but claims he was met with ‘terrible’ service. The dad said: “I went for a drink with my friend and the Halloween party poster caught my attention, as I have an -month-old. “I asked at the bar for details and the response was terrible. I was met with, “f*** knows”, despite the fact the sign said ask at the bar for details. “I wasnapost happy about the response, so asked for the manager to come down. She was by no means as rude as the other staff, but still very rude.It isn’t the first time Mr Priestnall, from Endon , has found himself walking out of the pub with a bad taste in his mouth. He added: “One time, I’d been in with my little one for food. He’s been wearing a bib that catches food, but since he was only about  months old, he still made a bit of a mess. “I tidied what I could, but the manager chased us out of the pub and askedI would go to my parents for tea and leave a mess like that. “I don’t mind about not being treated well, but I shouldn’t have to deal with rudeness. “Another time, I asked for details of the beer festival, and got a similar response to the Halloween party. “I have had my pint poured away over a plant by staff because they wanted to go home. “Any change that I have from my drinks has never been given to my hand, it is always slapped on the bar. Anda drink runs out, the response is always ‘it’s gone, what  do you want’ - the staff just aren’t polite.” Mr Priestnall was a regular at the Wetherspoons, popping in each Monday after playing darts. But he’s now been barred from the premises after complaining to the new manager.The drinker had posted on a Facebook group, asking people to discuss the customer service in the venue, which led to a threat of nearly  comments.One person posted: “I never had any problems, until I was in there one mid-week lunchtime with my -month-old.

She had almost turned back on her way up the drive because the big house meant her nightmare was now reality. “It was a place people go to die,” explains Helen. “And my -year-old husband was moving in. I had to face what I’d been blocking out for months and admit ‘My Dan is dying’.” Helen, mum to nine-month-old George, had arrived at a hospice – Sue Ryder Leckhampton Court, in Cheltenham, Glos, and  days later her husband of  months died there from a brain tumour. But the care Dan and his family received transformed -year-old Helen’s views about death and is helping her grieve.    “They took the fear away,” she says. “They allowed me to be Dan’s we again, not his carer, so we could live those last days together.” Now Helen is backing a campaign to get us all talking about death. In  a Dying Matters campaign aimed to break this last great societal taboo. But research by charity Sue Ryder shows that, more than a decade on, we are still dodging the issue and denying ourselves “a good death”. They found % of people have not discussed their death with relatives, % haven’t written a will and fewer than % have planned their funeral.  Yet % of us know who we want to spend our final hours with and % have considered where, with most wanting to die at home or in a hospice. But % have no idea they can write that in an Advance Care Plan. Heidi Travis, Sue Ryder CEO, said: “We all need to start talking about the D-word. Deciding in advance how we want to die and having a conversation with loved ones will help ease and demysty the process.”    I spent a week at the hospice, one of seven run by the charity, and met with staff, patients, families and volunteers. Three-quarters of patients have cancer and others have degenerative or neurological conditions. And expert palliative care means half willhome after a first stay with their symptoms eased. Yet consultant Dr Paul Perkins, , explains: “There is still the stigma that this is where people come to die – and death is a taboo. We live longer and die in hospitals, not at home, so everyone is less aware of death – and it scares us.Our job is to make it as good as it can be by easing the physical process of dying. “We can’t ease the fear of leaving loved ones behind but we can help patients see that they’ve lived well. “And then, when that person is in their last hours – comfortable, warm, knowing that they are loved – we can look after the people holding their hands “That’s what hospices are about – loving people.”  I feel that sense of tranquillity and compassion while touring the wards with Head of Clinical Services, Debbie Williams, , who is a former oncology nurse. “I’ve been privileged to see many people die beautully here,” she says. “When patients first arrive they’re scared they will be writhing in agony when they die. We explain that they’ll start to sleep more, then be in and out of consciousness and gradually their breathing will slow and their body will shut down. Then they’ll die. “I don’t use euphemisms like ‘passing’ or ‘slipping away’. It’s important to be honest.” She goes on: “Of course it’s sad and sometimes I have a cry on the way home. “My mum died suddenly five years ago, just weeks after being diagnosed with cancer and after that I talked to my dad about his wishes. “My husband’s a paramedic and we talk to our kids, who are  and , about dying and where we’d like our ashes scattered. It doesn’t have to be a big issue. “You can do it in a casual way when something comes up on telly. But talking about death removes the stigma and helps us live our best lives.”    During my visit several patients are very close to death and the emotion of their families is palpable. They sit with their loved ones, popping out for a quick break in the family lounge. Volunteers are on hand to chat to patients and relatives. One volunteer, Pat Howard, , says: “I wanted to give something back after Mum died here in . We’re trained to handle dficult conversations but it’s about listening and empathising. “A young mum once asked me ‘How do I tell my son I am gong to die ’ “I arranged for our family support team to talk to her but also said ‘When my father died we’d look for the brightest star in the night and say That’s Dad’. She found that a help because her little boy had bought her a star for Mother’s Day.” Patient JJ, , has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease which ­worsened when she got flu and pneumonia. Husband Bob, , was spending every day at her bedside.    “She had antibiotics in hospital but they didn’t work and she was transferred here for a bit of extra care,” he says. “The staff are amazing,” smiles JJ beneath her oxygen mask. “Nothing’s too much trouble. You are a person, not a number. And I’m as comfortable as I can be.” Then I meet “S”, who has advanced oesophageal cancer. The disease has affected her vocal cords so she talks in a whisper. “I can’t swallow properly so I don’t want to eat,” she says. “But they always find something I can fancy – yesterday I had the ice cream from the middle of an Arctic Roll. Lovely.” She squeezes my hand. “I can’t change things,” she says, “but I have asked for Holy Communion because I think I’ll find it a comfort.” S died a few days later. Chaplain Rob Pestell, , is the least “churchy” man you could meet. He explains: “Some patients see the dog collar and say ‘Sorry, I’m not very religious’, I respond ‘That’s good, neither am I!’ “I get to know what makes them tick – and I say ‘That is your spirituality’. Most patients have accepted they are dying but some say ‘I’m a hopeless case’. I try to help them see the value of their le.”    Kath Keogh, , teaches hospice staff to talk to patients about death. “We can all do it better,” she says. “We have birth plans but don’t say how we want to die. Death is seen as a failure, not a natural part of le.” Hospice catering assistant Claire Pemberton-James, , says her job is a privilege. She meets all the patients as she tours wards taking meal orders. “Many don’t want anything,” she says. “ButI give someone four peas and half a fish finger and they enjoy it it’s the best feeling in the world. “You really get to know them through chatting every day or sitting holding their hands.” Claire was so inspired by her work that she wrote a moving song called The House on the Hill “...where love resides and the weary can rest”. It was performed at the annual Lights of Love service and a video features on the website. Receptionist Mandy Edwards, , is the first person frightened relatives meet when they arrive. She started working at the hospice after her father died there in . Six years ago her husband Bob, , died there too. “His death confirmed everything that is wonderful about this place – the peace and support,” she says. “Not one person walks through that door willingly the first time. “So I’m here to say ‘You’re here now – we are going to look after you’.”    Helen Hopkins felt that emp­athy when she arrived to book her husband Dan into the hospice last July. He worked for a bank and she was a hospital administrator when they met in . But four years later Dan got an itchy mole on his back, checked – and was told he had malignant melanoma. Three years later it had spread to his brain. “Dan never wanted to know how long he’d got,” she says. “So we never talked about him dying. “Then last June he got much worse. One night he didn’t recognise me and I started to realise he wasn’t going to get better.

Adam Ellison is pictured smiling and goofing around with his friends at the Old Mill Pub in Prescot, Merseyside, in the images.A few short hours later he was stabbed to death as he headed home, the Liverpool Echo reported .The -year-old had got caught up in an argument with people on the back of a scrambler bike while walking the streets with his three friends. Adam was rushed to hospital but died a short time later. Two years on from the November  tragedy, the killers have still not been brought to justice.  Two -year-old males and a -year-old man, all from Huyton, Merseyside, were arrested last month, and have since been released under investigation. Adamaposs mum Joyce Ellison, , along with two sisters Nicola Moore, , and Joanne Evans, , spoke about losing Adam. Joyce said: He was part of our family for nearly  years and now we have got the rest of our lives without him. Itaposs destroyed us. We are a very close family and it has affected everyone.  You get your good days and your bad days, sometimes itaposs like a rollercoaster. You start laughing over something and then you feel as though you shouldnapost be laughing because heaposs not here with us and Iaposm finding something funny. I wouldnapost wish it on anybody. Adamaposs older sister Nicola said that younger members of the family have been deeply affected by his death. Itaposs two years but it doesnapost seem that long at all. It seems like weeks, she said.  The impact has been horrendous. Itaposs had a ripple effect on the family and the children in the family and we still have trauma and therapy because of that night and what we saw. We miss him so much, he was a massive part of our family and he was loved by everybody. We miss him everyday. Nicola went on to reminisce about her brother, who was always making people laugh and was the le and soul of the party. She added: He had such an infectious laugh and cheeky dimples, I miss that.  Joanne explained why the family were releasing the new photos of Adam. I want the photos to show people how Adam was just being himself that night, when he went out with his friends and his family, she said. I want someone to look into his eyes and realise how beautul a person he was and to think I canapost stand knowing something any more and not coming forward.  Joyce urged anyone with any information about the killers to come forward. She added: Youaposve got your whole le ahead of you but Adam hasnapost. Iaposm angry. Iaposve gone through dferent stages but angry that these people are still walking around. What would their mum thinkit was her son that was murdered  Sheaposd want someone to speak to the police then. The family are not doing him any favours and heaposs got to face up to what heaposs done, we want justice. Joanne added: Come forward because look at my mum. How can they sleep of a night knowing a little bit of information  They might be scared but thereaposs no reason to be scared. Detective Chief Inspector John Middleton, of Merseyside Police, described the attack and the impact it has had on the family. “This was a senseless assault which brutally cut short the le of an innocent young man who had everything to look forward to, he said.His family have been left devastated by their loss and they still have no answers to why this horric incident took place. “But I want those responsible to be under no illusion. We have not given up. They will always be looking over their shoulder because we will not stop until we catch them and bring them to justice.

Westmoor Veterinary Hospital near Tavistock, in Devon, posted information along with heartbreaking images of the animal on their Facebook page. A nearby resident spotted the creature crawling out of a bonfire he had just lit in his garden, so he took him to the vets immediately, Plymouth Live reported . But it was too little too late as the hedgehog - which had also got tangled up in some plastic - had to be put to sleep after his injuries were judged to be too severe.    It was very sad, bless him, said student nurse Kirsty Balman. It happened two or three weeks ago. The gentleman had a pile of rubbish sat for a few days and when he set it alight he was walking around it and the hedgehog appeared.  He brought him down straight away. He was alive but not well. We sedated him, unrolled him and had a look. He actually had some plastic around his head and middle which he was caught in. The degree of burns became apparent and most of his spines were burnt with plastic mixed in and on his skin.    The decision to put him to sleep was made because of the degree of recovery required, plus shock – he was quiet and cold. A couple of dferent vets decided it was better to put him to sleep. He was quite a big, mature hedgehog. He would have been at least last year’s, maybe even the year before that. The plastic wrapped around the hedgehog appeared to a type of sport mesh similar to cricket netting. The mesh is knotted and near impossible for creatures like hedgehogs to escape from. With Bonfire Night on Tuesday, November , there is plenty of advice about how to watch out for hedgehogs. A big pile of rubbish in a garden is ideal for a hedgehog to hibernate in, so the British Hedgehog Preservation Society urges people to build bonfires on the day they are due to be burned. If that is not an option, it is advisable to try and check the pile for animals before it is lit.

Aside from PTSD, itaposs likely she also had postpartum depression after her son Finlay arrived early - and says she continued to ask for help but eventually gave up. With her newborn in an incubator she was brought to tears by her crippling guilt and it felt like her body was constantly shouting where is your baby  Virginia, who also had a history of anxiety before her pregnancy, has since suffered flashbacks and her husband Laurie, also , has experienced similar trauma following their experience in neonatal intensive care.    As she spent five weeks on an antenatal ward, one consultant suggested her problems were not serious enough when she asked to see someone from a mental health support team. Virginia, now , told : Near the end of my stay a senior female consultant coldly suggested the reason I may not have been seen was because aposthat department usually only deals with people with serious mental health issuesapos. Iaposm not usually caught speechless but I was shocked. I just accepted it and began to question my ability to deal with stress. The former Londoneraposs pregnancy was going well until a routine  week scan revealed a problem with her cervix in .    She was shocked when she was admitted to the antenatal ward and put on strict bed rest despite feeling completely fine. Virginia, a former social media consultant, said: My diagnosis was cervical incompetence - my cervix was open and funnelling. An absolute nightmare for anyone and an awful introduction to parenthood. She struggled in hospital and suffered a panic attack on her first night as she spoke to a consultant about being forced to stay in the induction room for the first three nights due to a lack of beds.  Once she was moved out of the room she adjusted to le on the ward, but she was filled with anxiety and fear. She said: Iaposve dealt with mental health issues long enough to know when to ask for help, so I did, as soon as I felt emotions getting out of control. I requested help every day for the first three weeks I was on bed rest in the antenatal ward and roughly every other day after that until Finlay arrived. I explained to each doctor that visited on ward rounds that I have a history of generalised anxiety disorder and depression and that I was not coping.  I needed help and was not scared to ask for it. The whole experience really added to my trauma. My requests were consistently met with blank faces and I was told every day that they would look into it, that they would speak to someone who may know who I could talk to. No-one ever came. I felt asthey didnapost believe I was really struggling. She had a history of anxiety and depression, and had been doing well and was off medication for eight years. Even though her requests went ignored, Virginia said medics on the antenatal ward were truly wonderful and offered compassion. She added that the NICU nurses and doctors who cared for Finlay were incredible. At almost  weeks, the mum-to-be went into spontaneous labour. By then she had been on the antenatal ward for almost five weeks.  Virginia gave birth to her son, who weighed lbs oz, and he was whisked into the neonatal intensive care unit , where he would spend the next six weeks. She said: He was in pretty great shape considering his prematurity. It was just awful having to leave him there every day. We had trouble sleeping, my husband reduced his workload by half. We were coping, but I was in tears daily - it was like my body was shouting aposwhere is your babyapos constantly. I was scared to go in to see him out of guilt and for fear of bad news, and I was torn apart every second I didnapost have him near me.  She added: I felt incredibly guilty for feeling a sense of relief when I went into labour, knowing the anxiety and uncertainty of the last five weeks was about to be over. I felt Iaposd failed him - my body being unable to keep him in was the reason he was born so early. And I felt guilty for feeling anxious and depressed when, really, I had a healthy baby whoaposs biggest issue was that he was very small. We were meeting families who were dealing with the loss of one twin, whose babies were having le-threatening surgeries, who had been in the neonatal ward for six months or more. The heaviest guilt came when Iaposd go home and leave Finlay in hospital. In some happy news, Finlay was discharged a month earlier than expected. About , babies, or one in every , are born prematurelyin the UK every year, according to the charity Bliss. The earlier they are born, the more vulnerable they are because they havenapost fully developed in the womb Some may suffer from conditions such as behavioural dficulties, long term health problems or cerebral palsy as they develop into children and adults. Some research has found that the earlier a baby is born the higher their risk of having special educational needs at school, the charity said. It added: It is important to remember that every baby is dferent and will develop dferently. If you are worried about your baby’s development please speak to a health professional.   His parents later realised they hadnapost processed everything they had been through and it was having a negative effect on them. Virginia sought help from her GP after Finlay turned one and later saw a psychologist who diagnosed her with PTSD and said she likely had postpartum depression. She said: I had really struggled with flashbacks, crippling anxiety and depression for a year, and roughly three months later was contacted by my boroughaposs perinatal team. They were so kind, they listened, and they referred me to a psychologist who I eventually had  weekly sessions with. She was wonderful and Iaposm so grateful to have been able to work through things with her. She suggested I had more work to do for my trauma, but wasnapost able to see me any longer. I could see she wanted to, but they are only allowed  sessions.  I couldnapost believe that either - as sessions is enough time to work through a great deal of trauma and dficulty. Such a disappointing policy. She added: In hindsight, it strikes me as shocking that NICU parents arenapost just automatically issued a meeting with a psychologist to talk through everything that has happened. Youaposre caught in a whirlwind of information and emotion, living on autopilot, then when your baby is finally discharged, youaposre relieved but itaposs not like itaposs over. People donapost always ask for help or realise they need help. Virginia and Laurie have since moved to Vancouver in her native Canada. Laurie, a business coach, suffered similar trauma and was left struggling to come to terms with everything. He said: The whole period was emotionally challenging for me, but the impact of that really only surfaced many months after Finlayaposs birth.

Martin Strang, , was born with a congenital heart and spinal condition and later suffered complete kidney failure. He had been on dialysis for four years when stranger Toby Hart, , tragically died after plunging from a clf during a family holiday to Cornwall. The teenager’s parents honoured his wish to gt organs, and his heart, kidneys, liver and pancreas were all donated.    Martin, who received Toby’s kidney and pancreas, has now become close friends with Toby’s parents Sally and Graham after meeting them for the first time. Team GB transplant archery champion Martin said: “I was so nervous I sat in the car for about  minutes beforehand, wearing my Team GB kit, thinking ‘what do I look like  Are they going to like me  “But Sally, Toby’s mum, put her arms around me and hugged me for about ten minutes. It was a very emotional meeting. “Now we keep in touch all the time via text and facebook messages. Sally says ‘We’re family now,’ which is lovely.” Knitting shop worker Sally, , added: “Ever since Toby donated, I’d been really keen to know how the people who received his organs were. “What I love about Martin is that he has done so many things since having the donation. “I always think of it as Toby and Martin doing them together which is just lovely. “It’s not just that Toby is living on through other people, it’s that Martin has made the most of what he has been given. “Toby dying wasn’t a waste. That’s what’s really important.” Toby, of Warrington, fell ft to his death at Cadgworth Cove on Cornwall’s Lizard Peninsula in July . The tragedy came in July  just five days before his th birthday. Toby, who was on holiday with his parents and younger brother Stephen, had decided to become an organ donor two years earlier. His family decided to discuss the subject following the death of his grandmother. Sally explained: “When he applied for his provisional driving licence he ticked all the boxes for organ donation and it was a huge help when he died.    “We didn’t even have to think about it. At the hospital we were able to say ‘you don’t even have to ask because we want him to be an organ donor’. “There were lots of decisions we had to make – including what colour coffin we wanted - but this was the easiest one.” Martin was born with several serious medical conditions and diagnosed with Type  diabetes as a toddler. This resulted in him suffering kidney failure, leaving him reliant on dialysis to survive. Insurance broker Martin says he didn’t have a sporting bone in his body before receiving Toby’s kidney. But he decided to immediately take up a new hobby. Martin, of Falkirk, Scotland, explained: “I wanted to do something to honour Toby and celebrate getting my le back and just fancied archery as it’s such an inclusive sport.” By  he had become so proficient that he has taken home medals at British, European and World Transplant Games. He had also been put into contact with Sally and Graham through leading transplant charity the Donor Family Network In May this year Martin was making a trip down from Scotland to a Team GB when Toby’s parents asked him to meet on the spur of the moment. He pulled off the motorway and met them at hotel near their home for a coffee.    During the meeting Martin discovered that he shared many interests with his donor, including motorbikes and archery. He said: “We’ve discovered all sorts of uncanny similarities. My first holiday after the transplant was to Lake Garda– a place where Toby had holidayed. “Soon after the transplant, I bought a motorbike – unaware that Toby had bought a moped just before he died. “And when I asked: “Out of interest, did Toby ever do archery ” they both looked at each other and said he’d done a course as a child. I thought ‘this is just crazy’. “To get a gt like this is amazing. But to have so many coincidences with your donor is even more amazing.” Martin wears an archery armguard bearing Toby’s name, while his quiver belt is inscribed with the words: “For the needs of the many – in honour of Toby.” He met Sally and Graham again at the Donor Family Network annual service memorial service at the National Arboretum, at Alrewas, in September. Martin added: “Over the summer I visited Toby’s grave, placed my leather arm guard there for him to watch over and spent half an hour talking to Toby thanking him for what he has done for me. “I’ve told the family ‘it’s Toby doing this - not me. Every time I pick a bow up I’m thinking of him. “I’m getting word out there to raise awareness of the importance of organ donation and encourage people to tell their families about their wishes.” Nigel Burton runs the Donor Family Network, a charity which helped bring Martin and Toby’s parents together.

The convicted drugs mule, who was locked up for trying to smuggle £.m-worth of cocaine in her luggage, said the women would openly get together behind bars. She often didn’t know where to look but was barely acknowledged. The -year-old claims some of the female inmates were known as “chetos” and used for sex, but many of the other prisoners craving affection would also join in.    Writing in her new book, Youaposll Never See Daylight Again, she said: “When you’re sharing a bedroom with  other people any right of privacy is out the window. “You see each other shower, you see everyone peeing, what’s a bit of sex between you and your most intimate  mates  I have to admit to being surprised by a couple of the relationships. “The chetos signposted their sexuality. Any time they hooked up with one of the more feminine inmates I wasn’t surprised, except when they found each other.  “Others spent so much time showing me pictures of their children and husbands I had to do a double take when I saw them face down in someone ’s cleavage. When their bloke visited, they’d be all over him. But for those cold winter nights in between they had alternative sources of comfort. “And when they got down to it they were so passionate it was like the world was ending. I was transfixed by their intensity. I’d never seen anything like it.”  Michaella, from Northern Ireland, was  when she and pal Melissa Reid, from Scotland, were arrested in the airport at the capital city of Lima in . She was initially sentenced to more than six years behind bars, but served just over two years in the maximum security prison. She was released in March  and has since given birth to twin boys. Describing one sex act between two inmates, she said: I was chatting when I got a nudge from the girl on the other side of me. I turned around.

The case highlights a surge in demand for emergency parcels and shortages of supplies at foodbanks which are under increasing pressure.Mr Parkinson told of the heartbreaking moment the starving dad visited the service at Riverside Training after going without food for almost half a week, LincolnshireLive reports.   As volunteers were putting together a package for the dad, he told them not to worry about him and to include things his children would enjoy. Mr Parkinson said: “We ask about children in the household and whether there are any food allergies or intolerances. “He said, aposIt doesn’t matter about me, I just need food for the children. Can you give us stuff they will eat apos “He hadn’t eaten for three days but still wanted food just for the kids. “He was more concerned about them than himself.”  There have been other worrying cases, Mr Parkinson added. A record .million emergency food parcels were given out by the Trussell Trust foodbank network last year. More than half a million of them were given to children. Mr Parkinson said the service at Riverside Training in Gainsborough has snowballed since October last year after a man taking part in an education class didn’t go for a meal when everyone  did. He said: “We didn’t realise the scale of the issue – it’s a hidden issue.  “A learner didn’t leave for lunch when all the others left. He sat there. “We had a conversation with him and he said he had not had breakfast but said ‘I am ok’. “We asked him what the last thing he had to eat was. He said ‘I had a slice of toast yesterday morning’. “From there we got a few items for learners not eating to try and support them to continue with their education and courses.” The service links those in need with other services they may require, including education courses and appointments related to mental health.

Voting for the NHS Equipment failures and staff shortages leading to a surge of cancelled hospital operations is symptomatic of an NHS struggling to cope under Tory austerity.

The Government has just published a list of estates across Scotland which have been left unclaimed after their owners died either without making a will or without identying a next of kin . When a person dies in Scotland without leaving a will detailing their desired benefactors, any unclaimed assets automatically fall under the care of the Crown , and are then placed in the care of The Office of Queen’s and Lord Treasurer’s Remembrancer. In March , the Succession Act passed by the Scottish Parliament made the process of claiming unwanted estates easier, removing the requirement to obtain a aposbond of cautionapos - a type of insurance provided only by a small number of firms in the UK.    Cash, land, assets and homes - some as large as mansions and castles - could be up for grabs, providing claimants are able to successfully prove they are entitled to them. When a person dies with no will, everything they owned can theoretically be claimed. And it could start by simply noticing you have the same surname as the previous owner of an estate. Some of the more unusual surnames on the list include Carlin, Hunniball, Malone-Philban and Raube.

The calves are taken away from their mothers when they are just two years old before being forced to learn tricks and perform at Maesa Elephant Nursery. Footage taken inside the nursery by Moving Animals - a photojournalism and filming project working to expose animal industries around the world - shows the young elephants being struck and scraped by sharp metal bullhooks, tugged by their ears and chained up, swaying in distress. This kind of abuse is part of the aposphajaanapos - the traditional process of breaking a young elephantaposs spirit.    Elephants are bound with ropes, confined in tight wooden structures, starved and beaten repeatedly with bullhooks, nails and hammers until their will is crushed. Activist Amy Jones said the groupaposs investigations across Asia had repeatedly shown elephants facing relentless physical and emotional suffering. It is heartbreaking to think that these innocent babies at Maesa Elephant Nursery are at the start of a letime of captivity that will feature sharp bullhooks, cruel performances, and severe psychological stress, she said. “Travel companies are misleading tourists into supporting animal abuse. To save another generation of baby elephants from a letime of misery, Defra must act now and ban British companies from selling tickets to elephant “attractions”.    More than  elephants are living in captivity in the camp, which has been running for more than  years.

Myself and other care workers want to highlight what’s happening.“People have been left overnight with no food, sitting in urine-drenched clothing. In some instances disabled people have been left bed bound.“Elderly and vulnerable people are suffering and we want everyone to know what’s happening.”Councillor Ken Lynn, vice- chairman of Dundee Health and Social Care Partnership integrated joint board, admitted that major issues had developed due to staffing issues with Allied Healthcare.He said: “The situation reached a head at the weekend and the city council were forced to intervene. They brought in care workers from Glasgow and other private care companies to provide care for those in need.”A Dundee Health and Social Care spokesman said: “Once the situation was brought to our attention, staff quickly moved to work with other external providers, internal services and community nursing to support those who had been affected. Some families made direct contact with out of hours services when assistance did not arrive at the usual time.“We are in discussions with Allied Healthcare about the situation going forward.”Allied Healthcare Dundee said it was aware of the ongoing issues and was working to resolve them “as a matter of urgency”.A spokesman added: “This has arisen due to staff changes.

On  minutes, the Pars had another chance to draw level but Kyle Turner blasted over from  yards.However, it was former Par Clark who came back to haunt his old side three minutes later as the Terrors doubled their lead.After Ian Harkes was fouled on the edge of the box, Clark smashed home his first of the season with a curling right-footed free-kick from  yards out leaving Gill rooted to the spot.Paul McMullan nearly made it - on  minutes, sliding onto Smith#s low delivery at the front post, but Dunfermline managed to clear the danger.Three minutes after the restart Calum Butcher rled a full volley just over the bar from  yards after the ball broke kindly for the Englishman.Having only just ed from injury there was concern over Robson on  minutes when he went down in his own box but after receiving treatment he was OK to continue.On  minutes the Fers had their best chance of the match as Josh Edwards slid in former Terror Ryan Dow but Siegrist got down well to deny the attacker from close in.The home side bounced back, though, as Clark was denied a double by a well-timed Lee Ashcroft block in the box following Pawlett#s cutback.Second-half sub Nisbet threatened to claw one back for Stevie Crawford#s men but his volley into the ground bounced over on  minutes.On  minutes Dunfermline came even closer, this time Nisbet feeding Ryan who cracked a curling effort off the crossbar.United were able to close out the final moments, despite heavy pressure from the visitors, to snap a two-game losing streak and tighten their grip on top spot.With Ayr United losing to Dundee on Friday night and Inverness falling to Morton, the Terrors move three points clear at the Championship summit.Dundee United : SiegristSmith, Robson, Reynolds , Brown Butcher , Harkes McMullan, Pawlett , ClarkShankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Stanton, Watson.Dunfermline : GillComrie, Edwards, Martin , Ashcroft Paton, Cochrane , Turner , Dow Kiltie, Ryan.Subs not used: Scully , Beadling, Morrison, Coley.Ref: Steven Reid.Att: ,."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/SNS-18999821-Dundee-Utd-v-ICT.jpg ","title":"exclusive i have unfinished business at utd says ex tannadice striker pavol safranko","story":"Pavol Safranko says he has “unfinished business” at Dundee United and hopes he’ll one day be back at Tannadice.The Slovakian international became a firm fans’ favourite during his one-year loan spell from Danish side Aalborg last season.He scored  times as the Tangerines got themselves to the brink of promotion to the Premiership, losing out in the play-off final on penalties to St Mirren.That failure was the only disappointment on the pitch for Safranko but he’s backing United to put that right at the end of this season by winning the title. vw, px\"  He told the Tele: “I feel like I have unfinished business with United.“I promised something and we did not manage it.“If we had won that game it would have been the perfect end to the season and maybe I would still be at the club.“I really enjoyed my time at Dundee United, we were so close to going up in that last game.“The penalty-kicks did not go our way and it was a disappointing end to the season and my time there.“I miss the city, the stadium and the people – I felt everyone was really good to me and I liked it there.”Safranko was disappointed a deal couldn’t be done with United and his parent club Aalborg with the Danish side holding out for £ million for the striker.After that fell through, he moved to Romanian side Sepsi where he rejoined former Tannadice boss Csaba Laszlo, signing a three-year deal.“I was open to speak to everyone, including United,” he added. “I would have liked to stay but the problem was with Aalborg.“I like to think you can always find a solution to any problem but there wasn’t one there.“I was disappointed we didn’t. I then had to decide very quickly and did not have a lot of options.“I expected something  to come along but I am happy to work with Csaba Laszlo again.“We have a good relationship – not just on the football pitch but outside as well. He is a good guy and I like working with him.”Safranko does see his future back in the UK, however, once he has done all he can to help Sepsi in the Romanian top flight.“I have always said my target is to play football in the UK – I have always seen myself going there some day because the style of football suits me.“There is also a lot of passion for the game there, I could see that at United.“The football in Romania is very dferent from Scotland – there are technical, quick players but the style is not the same.“I loved the style in Scotland, the way the referee would leave the game to play on and it was very physical.“The game there really suited me, I think.”Safranko revealed he’s kept a keen eye on United this season and says he expects them to finally get back to the Premiership.He added: “The guys who have bought the club know what they are doing and bringing in Lawrence Shankland was a fantastic move. I have no doubt about this team and I hope they go up this year.“We had the perfect team last year, in my eyes. I think now they have kept that team and added a special player to it.“Of course, I keep an eye on what the club is doing – you can’t just forget what happened last year.“We don’t get the games to watch in Romania but I do look for the results and any interviews on the internet about the club.”And he hopes to be back on the pitch at Tannadice one day, whether for United or on the opposing side after being linked with moves to Aberdeen and Hibs in the summer.“You never knowI will be back at Tannadice, le is crazy.“Whether it is with United or another team maybe it will happen but Dundee United will always be in my heart after my time there – that will not change.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5d970e153c3919.99006593-e1570180930942.jpg ","title":"lawrence shankland ups and downs are part of the game utd must embrace","story":"Talisman Lawrence Shankland insists he knows what he signed up for playing for Dundee United in the Championship and is pleased to see they’re dealing with the ision’s ups and downs.United bounced back from two poor away defeats at Alloa and Queen of the South with a - win over Dunfermline at Tannadice on Saturday, with Shankland opening the scoring with his th goal of the season.The result left the Tangerines three points clear at the top of the table but, summer signing from Ayr United, Shanks knows there are more twists and turns to come.“There’s many ups and downs, probably more than other leagues,” the -year-old said.“You experience it quite a lot, you’re on a high and then there’s a bad result around the corner.“That’s just the way the league is and it’s the same for everybody. We just need to make sure that,we do get a bad result or two, we bounce back in the right way.“We did that on Saturday with a positive result and positive performance.“I knew what I was coming to, I knew I was coming to a big club in this ision especially.“I knew the objectives of the club and for myself as well.“I’m a striker soI go out there and score goals people will take to you. I just need to take that in my stride and, hopefully, they keep talking about me because that way the goals will be going in.”United face the second of their three-games-in-a-week schedule as they welcome Partick Thistle, and Shankland’s former Ayr boss Ian McCall, to the City of Discovery tonight ahead of a trip to Inverness on Saturday.And the Scotland international striker is hoping the Terrors can keep up their perfect home record as they aim to stretch their lead at the top of the table.He added: “It’s good to bounce back. That’s what we looked to do on Saturday because we knew we had a tough week ahead. It was good to go and get the victory to start the week positively.“It’ll definitely be a tough test. Thistle were always a well-drilled side, even before McCall went there, and they’ll be the same again.“They might even be better but it’s a tough fixture because they’re a good side with good players.“It’s another test like Saturday was which we need to take in our stride and, hopefully, go and get a good result. Obviously the home form is a positive because you need to win as many home games as you can but we’re not going to get carried away and feel like we need to beat everybody.“We just need to turn up and do our jobs week-in, week-out and make sure that we’re performing at our best when we’re at home. vw, px\"  “If we do that, we’ll get results.“We had two disappointing results in the last two games away from home and it’s something that happens in this league.“You see teams dropping points all over the place so it is like that.“If we keep our home form good, though, and win most of our games then we can maybe afford to drop a couple away.“Obviously, we’ll look to go up to Inverness on a real grass pitch as well, which helps, and put on a performance there. But we have a big test tonight first.”Nicky Clark got the second goal against Dunfermline on Saturday after teeing up Shankland, leading the hitman to praise his colleague.“It was good to get back on the scoresheet with a tap in and I was delighted to see Clarky get his first goal and get off the mark as well.“Earlier in the season we had glimpses of playing with each other but he got injured. It’s good to see him back in the starting line-up and he topped it off with a great goal.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/06/medw-tele-sports-podcast-twa-teams-1-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street its a halloween special but there is nothing scary about city clubs form","story":"This week it#s a Halloween special as Tele sports reporters Calum Woodger, George Cran and Graeme Finnan discuss the recent upturn in fortunes for Dundee and Dundee United and take a look at all the latest results in the Scottish Premiership.Calum and George will be joined by former Dundee and Dundee United defender Lee Wilkie for next week#s Dundee derby special.Call the #Twa Teams, One Street# fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about all things Dundee and United.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5db97191f41b02.74681445.jpg ","title":"striker stars as dee shine kane more than able as his double downs alloa","story":"Dundee put together their most complete performance of the season as they swept past Alloa Athletic at the Indodrill Stadium.Striker Kane Hemmings was the star of the show as he answered his critics in style with two superb first-half strikes before setting up Sean Mackie with a late third on a chilly night in Clackmannanshire.After clinching their first away win of the league season last Friday night at Ayr United, James McPake’s side put together their first back-to-back victories of the campaign with a commanding performance.Loanee Conor Hazard may have been the first goalkeeper tested but it was the visiting side who started the match with vim and vigour. vw, px\"  Midfield maestro Graham Dorrans was at the heart of everything good from the Dark Blues as he dictated from the middle of the park.The Wasps couldn’t get anywhere near the former Rangers and West Brom man as he pulled the strings for the increasingly-confident Dundee.That confidence was well-placed and so was manager James McPake’s un-erring belief in his frontman, as Hemmings repaid that and then some with a stellar display.He kicked off a fine night for the Dark Blues – their best of the campaign so far – as he and Declan McDaid were too sharp for the home defence, exchanging passes to send Hemmings in on goal where he made no mistake by planting the ball through goalkeeper Jamie MacDonald’s legs.From there, Dundee controlled the first  and doubled their lead six minutes before the break with a superb team goal.Alloa broke down their right after Andrew Nelson, once more employed as a left-winger, gave up possession.He didn’t give up on the ball, however, with a lung-bursting run covering more than half the pitch forcing the Wasps into a mistake – from there Dundee were away.Jordan Marshall had set up the counter and was played down the left by Dorrans with space to power into and the left-back picked out a peach of a cross which gave Hemmings the chance to bury his second of the evening.Despite the home side upping their game after the break, the Dark Blues backline were in no mood to give in to any sort of comeback after doing so in such spectacular fashion in the - defeat at home to Partick just  days ago.They dealt with everything thrown at them by the Wasps and chances continued to come at the other end with Hemmings close to grabbing a third early on, bringing a good save from MacDonald. vw, px\"  He turned provider with  minutes left on the clock as he burst past a defender and, instead of shooting, cut the ball across for the waiting Sean Mackie to roll the ball into the empty net with his first touch after coming off the bench.Manager McPake had been full of praise for the efforts of his frontman over the past few weeks eventhe goals hadn’t been flowing with none in his previous seven outings.He wasn’t too complimentary about Hemmings’ miss late on, however, as the -year-old blazed the ball over the bar with the goal gaping to pass up the chance of a treble.Despite that, it was an excellent night’s work from the striker and one that will give the Dens faithful plenty to be excited about for the rest of the campaign.With Dorrans pulling the strings in the middle, a defence looking solid and a real goal- getter in scoring form, the Dark Blues are starting to look like they mean business in the Championship title race."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.48072655-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.48072655-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.48072655-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.48072655-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"win 100 with the teles fantastic strictly come dancing competition every friday","story":"Every Friday whilst Strictly Come Dancing is gracing our TVs the Tele is giving you the chance to cash in!Every Friday, each copy of the Eveningwill have the name of one of the dancers taking part on the show printed on the front page along with a Unique Reference Number.If your dancer is voted off on Sunday then you are in with a chance to win £!TO ENTER:Simply enter your dancer#s name and Unique Reference Number in the boxes below along with your contact details…that’s it!Good luck!Entry to this competition is by registering online only.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

Around  resident berth holders and more than , visiting leisure craft during the sailing season add considerably to the numbers who arrive at Tarbert and appreciate the attractive surroundings.The present plans for the power line, however, as exhibited by SSEN, will present a view on entering the harbour despoiled by a line of monster pylons.The current proposal suggests that four or five of the -foot pylons will dominate the western skyline. The visual impact of this scheme as presently proposed will have a negative effect on the experience of everyone who lives in, or visits, Tarbert.Tarbert was designated as a conservation area in the s. Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness.

This link resulted in the pupils being invited to be a part of filming.On the day of filming pupils were taken to Kilmartin Museum where they met with the cast and crew and chatted over a hot chocolate before the hard work began.Heading out to Nether Largie, the pupils were encouraged to explore the southern cairn and were filmed weaving in and out of the cairn and lting up rocks.The crew even gave pupils the opportunity to get involved with the filming, passing the responsibility of holding and positioning lighting equipment over to them, as Brendan O#Hara # who ha since been elected as MP for Argyll and Bute # directed.Filming for the Argyll episode took place in April  and although it has not yet been aired it is available on the STV Player, so it came as a bit of a surprise to guidance teacher Jamie Wire when a pupil announced they had spotted him on TV.He commented: #It#s funny how it has all come to light now as the pupils were all in S- and now only three remain in school, all in S.

A fantastic solo effort in a - win capped a great team performance. Tom would have run around with the customary shirt over the head celebration, however he found the snug fit just too much to pull over his head.By the time the final game took place the team had both done enough and run out of steam.

This was followed by Debussy#s Premiere Rhapsodie which was written as a test piece for a competition at the Paris Conservatoire this requires of the performer the full range of colour and technique which was deftly delivered. Finally we were given Poulenc#s last Sonata. In this, and many of his works, he was rebelling against the Impressionist style and was particularly reflected in the outer fast movements with often angular and zany writing.The second half of the programme started with the Saints-Saens#s Sonata # also his last work. Unlike Poulenc, here he was harping back to the th century#s more classical style style of composition.Their official programme ended with a highly-virtuosic rendition of Chausson#s Andante and Allegro, but we were also given a short and charming encore # one of Gerald Finzi#s three pieces for clarinet and piano.This was all chamber music of the highest quality Maximiliano#s musicality, technique, emotional expression and tonal range were exemplary as indeed were those of his accompanist, Scott. It was patently obvious from their opening bars that they had played many times together with the rapport between them a delight to witness.

It will include a new toilet, shower, laundry and kitchen building,  new camping pitches and  motor home pitches, most of which will have hook-ups.The total project will cost around £,. In addition to HIE’s contribution will be an award of £, from the Rural Tourism Infrastructure Fund, with the balance from IGHT.It is expected that the modern site will strengthen the local economy by an additional £, a year and that other businesses on Gigha will benefit from the increase in footfall and visitor spend.The Isle of Gigha camp and motorhome site is due to welcome its first visitors in autumn , after which it will be open throughout the year.Strategic planning to secure a strong, sustainable future for the Mount Stuart Trust and the Isle of Bute is at an advanced stage, with key decisions expected by spring .Speaking ahead of the next phase of community consultations, Colin Boag, managing director of Mount Stuart Trust, said: #We are working intensively with community groups, Argyll and Bute Council and the Scottish Land Commission to develop a range of initiatives to improve the rural and urban landscapes on the island of Bute and to unlock growth opportunities for the local economy.#There is a great sense of purpose and commitment from everyone involved. This is matched by a desire to make progress on a number of crucial projects. The trust will conclude a strategic review by the end of the year. In conducting this - year ‘look forward’, we have been well supported through discussions with iniduals and community bodies across the island.#As part of the overall review, we are creating a specic rural strategy focussed on building a sound, sustainable future for farming and forestry on the island. Following an initial consultation with key stakeholders in July, we are developing the rural strategy through a number of joint working groups. These are examining key priorities including dairy farming, rural training and skills, forestry development and the environment.#Our emerging rural strategy builds on work completed with Argyll and Bute Council to support their bid to the Scottish and UK governments for a multi-million-pound Rural Growth Deal. Working together with the council, Fyne Futures and the Bute Island Alliance, we drew up a proposal for investment of £million to pilot on Bute a new transformative rural development model for niche food and drink and primary island industries.The trust is also consulting with local communities about the proposals to release urban land for community projects. This important work is being conducted in line with the Scottish Land Commission’s protocol on community engagement.In August, Mount Stuart Trust, with Scottish Land Commission representatives, held an urban community workshop with key community organisations in Rothesay. Discussion centred on how potential community projects could utilise land in Rothesay, which is currently in either council or trust ownership.Colin Boag added: #Throughout the discussions with ious community representatives, a number of local groups have expressed interest to make use of some or all of the land on offer. We welcome their interest in creating opportunities for positive change on the Isle of Bute.#I am confident that the depth of collaboration between Argyll and Bute Council, the Land Commission, local communities and the trust is set bring a strong sense of renewal and confidence to the island.#It was a trip to the Co-op and trollies at the ready for Lochgilphead High School pupils, as they were set a mission in aid of the Argyll Foodbank.Staff from the school ided the group of S pupils into teams, giving each an inidual budget to stick to.

Henderson joined a sell-out audience in Galashiels earlier this month for some couplets and carry-ons with Dr John Cooper Clarke.Dr John Cooper Clarke has an honorary doctorate from the University of Salford.JCCs entitlement can be well justied on the basis of his longevity and skilled poetry.You do wonderhe was ever told, it just wont last and he should keep a day job!But omnipresent he is, far outliving the time confines of the \"Punk Poet\" label.Arise the Bard of Salford and fast forward to .And here we are in the Borders town of Galashiels, and a sold-out Wednesday gig at the MacArts venue.Putting this gig into some kind of perspective, I first saw JCC supporting the Buzzcocks in  so my sabbatical stands at  years.An ocean has passed under the bridge. And a reminder that Im not getting any younger as I try to grow old gracefully.JCCs, now a septuagenarian, style has remained a constant.His image of the suit, shagpile black hair and sunglasses remain intact. His social realism poetic constructs seem relevant today as they did during his inception, extrapolated initially from the often nihilism and tales of social decay that earmarked punk mark one.Poetry is often a barometer of an epoch or epochs. Combining observation and the written word. JCC has become a master of mind imagery, social commentary, surrealism, and semantics and above all story telling. We get it because it resonates with us.It is us or we know someone who it references. Sometimes dystopian, often hilarious and never dull. Add the heavy Salfordian brogue the chemistry set is complete.The performance was slightly peculiar to what I was expecting.Maybe my expectations were misguided or unrealistic. There were some long periods of stand-up comedy that laboured at times.It was only when \"Johnny\" ed to his natural home of poetry recital that he got back on track. Though his joke about Billy Bragg being in crisis because he hadnt released an album in two weeks, I found amusing.But when he got back to the poetry it was a reminder why most people were here.Most poems were from the back catalogue and instantly recognisable. A greatest hit set list.JCC proceeded with Hire Car and the sharply expletive named Get Back on Drugs You Fat F***.Well it was an adult show after all.Common language for common poetry. And it never did Billy Connelly any harm. The poem insinuating it was easier to lose weight being on drugs.Beasley Street, arguably his most well-known poem received one of the best reactions of the night. Imbued with the description of a rock bottom street, a dreg of society and where everything that could go wrong did in this street. A caricature of a threadbare existentialism. Mainly bought on by social and economic deprivation.And then a natural supersession in the form of an epilogue Beasley Street Bouled recital, as the street had now changed into middle class suburbia.Next up Ive Fallen in Love with My We. A reference to marriage, the vows and marital bliss. Tongue in cheek of course.The \"bloody song\" Evidently Chickentown, was greeted with widespread applause. More nihilistic scorn and deprecation of a town, that is in a state of dys.Funny how we tend to laugh at the misfortune of others. But we do.Twat was another poem that represented consistency in tonights performance. A crowd pleaser for all times. Twat being the ultimate character assassination and castout. Bringing sporadic fits of laughter within the audience.The closing recital I Wanna Be Yours, famously adopted by The Arctic Monkeys for one of their songs, represented a slight U-turn in the writing of JCC. More linked to a character who wishes to show an undying love for someone . The positives of the human condition. Did I detect some optimism!The MacArts performance had poetry that mixes modernity with the historical. Comedic in value.When we laugh, we are laughing at ourselves. With him, not at him. Parody is a work of art, human invention and a release from les stresses.He may be the luckiest guy alive, who can tell Graham J.

There are many people walking around freely drinking during these times.ldquoThis makes it dficult to identy those young people who are underage drinking when there are such crowds.Another wrote: ldquoIntoxication in these areas is unpleasant to witness. In all cases we are entitled not to be subject to the loudness and antisocial behaviour this leads to.On the other hand, some respondents voiced their concerns about bringing in alcohol bylaws: ldquoI think itrsquos a complex situation which deserves time and thought. Irsquom not entirely sure that reacting in a retrospective way is the best approach.ldquoI feel there are many behaviours and traditions entrenched in Scottish and Borders society around drinking habits.ldquoI feel personally that there are alternatives for many people socially that do not centre around drinking or going to the pub, such as the cinema, concerts, sports, dining out, etc., but not everyone has the imagination or willingness to explore these as valid ways to enjoy yourself.Another objector wrote: ldquoDrinking in public places doesnrsquot cause a problem in itself. Issues arise when certain iniduals drink alcohol to excess in any setting.ldquoThe problem, in my view, wonrsquot be solved by a blanket ban on alcohol in public spaces. There are already laws to prevent antisocial behaviour but they need enforced.Police Scotland also provided a detailed response to the consultation. It reads: ldquoAlcohol bylaws are used within the three other local council areas within Lothian and Borders, namely East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian.ldquoBy having such bylaws in force it assists Police Scotland in reducing anti-social behaviour and violence both of which are known to have an association with drinking in public.ldquoCurrently the Scottish Borders area is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.NHS Borders, Borders Alcohol and Drug Partnership and Scottish Borders Children and Young Peoplersquos Leadership Group provided a joint response, which reads: ldquoAlcohol consumption can take place in our communitiesrsquo private space as well as within licensed premises.ldquoNot allowing people to drink in a public place will help to reduce the normalisation of alcohol being an ordinary commodity and builds communities and environments that supports a culture change and reduces exposure for our children and young people.ldquoPublic drinking can adversely affect the quality of le for residents and our communities.ldquoAlcohol Focus Scotland report that one in two Scots experience harm from anotherrsquos drinking and often this harm is experienced in public spaces .ldquoIn this study % had experienced harm to others in public places and this was mostlyexperienced by the younger age group .ldquoAlcohol bylaws can be used as an additional tool to reduce the nuisance and disorder normally associated with public drinking.ldquoLicensed premises are well regulated within the Scottish Borders and provide the opportunity to consume alcohol in a safe environment.ldquoThe Scottish Borders is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.Councillors will now be asked whether to conduct further consultation on two options: a blanket ban on public drinking to cover the whole of the Borders, or the introduction of an alcohol ban in certain areas of the Borders. Police Scotland has indicated it would prefer the first option, to ease the enforcement of the ban.Furthermore, councillors are asked to consider undertaking a pilot scheme in specic towns, which could then be used to gather further feedback from the public."},{"url":null,"title":"golden-granny-hilde-aims-fashion-success","story":"AN archery gold medal winning grandmother at the British Transplant Games is setting her sights on fashion.Hilde Paxton from Clovenfords, who had a liver transplant shortly after her th birthday, struck the bulls-eye at Newport earlier this year.And the -year-old is already preparing to defend her title next year by raising vital funds for her Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team.Hilde is hosting a fashion show on Saturday, November  in Galashiels.She told us: \"Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team has around  members from all over the east of Scotland who take part in the Transplant Games.\"An important part of being a member is helping to raise the funds required for sending members to the British Transplant Games.\"The Colours Fashion Team will take to the Focus Centre boardwalk on the Saturday for an evening of glamour and casual wear.Included in the pound ticket price is a complimentary glass of Prosecco on arrival.As well as the fashion show, there will also be a grand raffle and a licensed bar.Tickets for Hildes fashion show, which starts at .pm for pm, are available from the Salmon Inn and Focus Centre, Galashiels, the Bridge Inn and The Gt Shop, Peebles, or The Hub in Innerleithen."},{"url":null,"title":"top-up-tap-plans-galashiels","story":"GALASHIELS is set to become the first town in the Borders to receive an official top-up tap.Scottish Water has already installed the water stations in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Ayr, Oban and Fort William as part of its Your Water, Your Le initiative.As well as providing healthy drinking water, the refill taps will also reduce the number of plastic bottles which are currently in circulation.Scottish Water now want to install the top-up tap in Market Place -

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

Despite signicant effort over the last  months, it has not been possible to conclude the sale of the Campbeltown Creamery.When it became clear that a sale to a third party was unlikely, the local Kintyre farmers launched a plan to take over the creamery.

We fully appreciate that this decision has signicant consequences for colleagues at the creamery and the local community, but it is important that we act in the best interest of the wider business and our farmer members and continue with the solid progress we have made in strengthening and developing First Milk.#We regret the impact this decision will have on our colleagues and are committed to treating those affected fairly and with consideration during this dficult time.#Throughout the last  months we have been in regular dialogue with our local members on Kintyre about the future of the site.

That is due to the harsh, economic reality of processing milk in an incredibly tough dairy industry that has witnessed so many casualties at both farm and processing level in recent times.#While this is very disappointing news, it is reassuring that all of the local farmers are members of First Milk and will continue to benefit from being part of a national co-operative with an evergreen contract and continuing to have their milk collected in the future.#"},{"url":null,"title":"harvest party reaps food bank donations","story":"At the group#s harvest party on Wednesday morning, each child, dressed in ious costumes, some spooky and some sweet, brought an item to donate to the food bank.Kintyre Toy Library meets every Monday and Wednesday from .am to .am, and on Thursdays from -pm, during term-time, in Springbank Evangelical Church Hall.For £ entry, children up to school age enjoy a range of arts and crafts, as well as songs and stories."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 1 2019","story":"It is devastating news for the Kintyre economy that one of the area#s biggest employers looks set to lose up to  per cent of its workforce.It must be devastating news for all CS Wind UK#s staff, with the uncertainty surrounding jobs made all the worse in the lead up to Christmas.The company#s next potential order is due for production in , so there is a future for the factory and we are sure the company is doing all it can to secure that future.Our fingers are crossed that the talks with Argyll and Bute Council, the Scottish and Westminster governments and other organisations are successful in finding a solution to the shortfall in orders.By chance, the news of redundancies at CS Wind came the same week as Amazon revealed its power purchase agreement with a Kintyre wind farm.Attempts by the Courier to confirm the location of the wind farm were unsuccessful but,it comes to fruition, it is to be hoped it will bring jobs to the area."},{"url":null,"title":"springbank and machrihanish help graces pals raise cash","story":"Two nights’ accommodation, a VIP tour and tasting at Springbank Distillery, and a round of golf for eight people at Machrihanish Golf Club were the star lot at an auction in aid of the charity.This was part of an event held by Blairmains Farm Shop and Coffee Bothy in Blairlogie, near Stirling, run by the Logan family and Meg Filshie, who are friends of Kintyre#s David Allen.David and his we Cynthia moved to Campbeltown just over six years ago when David joined Springbank#s sales team.

What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children.

The River Esk snakes around the edge of the course.Prof Crofts expressed concern that dogs could easily swallow them, resulting in ldquolarge vet bills for owners.After ing the balls to the club, he has issued a call for the flood protection scheme, currently being drawn up for Musselburgh, to include measures to slow down water coming off the Pentland and Moorfoot Hills where the North and South Esk rise.Prof Crofts, of Musselburghrsquos Eskside West, a geography expert who has worked as a research scientist in Scotland, said: ldquoAlong the golf course there are very soft banks and you can see where they have been cut back, and probably there was some rough at the end of the fairway where lots of people have lost balls.ldquoWe cannot stop leaves and tree trunks being brought down the river but the speed of rise of the water level and its velocity shows that any flood prevention scheme for Musselburgh needs to look hard at measures to slow down water coming off the hills and into the river. Without this, the erection of walls being proposed in Musselburgh will not be public money well spent.ldquoMany of us feel the importance of the amenity of this stretch of the river ndash it is very fine.He said a tree planting scheme using native species should be discussed with landowners in the headwaters of the Esk catchment area, as government grants were available for such work.He said: ldquoI am talking about hundreds of thousands of trees maybe. Careful hand planting of trees is best rather than using tractors to dig ditches to prepare the land for planting as this would aggravate the problem by increasing the rate of water running off the hills. The trees would take up water from the soil.ldquoThe use of the reservoirs on the North and South Esk and the temporary flooding of the flat land along the river should be seriously investigated to store water during heavy rainfall and therefore slow the release of water into the river.ldquoIf you look at the flood issue, itrsquos caused by the river rising very fast but itrsquos made worsethere are high spring tides and a storm surge in the North Sea, and also a northerly wind across the estuary which piles the water up high and stops the river water escaping for a couple of hours either side of high tide.Professor Crofts has raised his concerns with consultants who are drawing up the Musselburgh Flood Protection Scheme and he has also made local councillors aware of his views.As for the coast, he highlighted small sand dunes which formed a natural barrier with grasses, which, below the ground level, had yards of roots acting as a natural catcher of the sand.Jackie Lambert, captain of Musselburgh Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was unaware of the issue regarding golf balls being found on the beach near the mouth of the River Esk.ldquoWhilst, the figure of  golf balls is signicant, it is unknown over what timescale these balls have accumulated andthey are all, indeed, from the course.ldquoNotwithstanding this, the golf club will happily participate in any working group looking at the wider issues of flood protection and the environment in and around Musselburgh.

I have edited it for publication here, but I have attempted to keep the story as close to the original as possible, and the story itself is completely the idea of the children.IN PRESTONPANS, there lived two nine-year-old children called Max and Lily.One day, they went on a bike ride to Preston Tower for a picnic. When they got there they laid a chequered blanket down on the grass, opened their basket and began to eat.They were about to leave after eating their food when they saw a robin perched on a nearby branch. It seemed friendly and the children fed the wee bird some of their leftovers.The robin then flew to a nearby abandoned cottage. The children were intrigued and followed the robin to investigate the cottage.They couldnrsquot remember noticing it before and they were wandering around it peering inside through small a gap in the wall. They couldnrsquot see where the robin had gone. They should have just left it but curiosity got the better of them and they searched for a way in. They were anxious to find out what had happened to the robin.But there was no way in, as the entrance and windows were blocked. So they clambered up the cottage wall, the bricks crumbling under their feet.Tired and exhausted, they finally reached where they thought the robin had landed.They found an opening which led to a dark passage. Despite being a bit scared, Max and Lily decided to investigate and walked down the passage. It was dimly lit by small gaps in the wall that let in narrow beams of light. At the end, there was a staircase. They huddled together as they walked.Then all of a sudden, the floorboard behind them collapsed.Now in fear and panic, they dashed up the steps of the dilapidated staircase into the attic.From the corner of the attic, they could just make out a small black figure running towards them.They thought they had seen the robin but it was something much worse. ldquoMouse! screamed Lily. Then they heard a glass shatter ndash smash!They were now terried and they sat in pitch darkness. The only light they had was the light that was seeping through the bricks in the walls.As they sat in fear, they realised they needed to come up with a plan to escape. They searched the cottage for a way out.As Lily investigated around the room, she tripped over a rug that seemed to have something poking upwards. She called out for Max and he came rushing down the stairs.As Max kneeled down to take a closer look, Lily revealed what looked like a trapdoor.Astonished, the children pulled the handle.It led to a tunnel which was flooded with candlelight. Who lit the candles  Max and Lily wonderedwhoever had lit the candles knew they were there.They entered the candlelit tunnel and one step at a time they cautiously moved forward.Then, slam! The trapdoor shut behind them and they jumped in fear. This was all too much for them to handle, they were desperate to get out.Then Max heard a soft but evil whisper: ldquoPlease stay, Irsquom lonely.In terror, he pulled out his phone and pressed  but it instantly shut off. ldquoPlease stay, said the voice, now sounding child-like.ldquoHelp! screamed Max and Lily through the gaps in the wall, but help never came.Then they heard something on the floorboards above.ldquoThere must be something up there, said Lily. ldquoI guess the only way out is to follow the candlelight.So they ventured further down the candlelit passageway.As the pair made their way through the tunnel, they could just make out what looked like a white figure approaching, who had a terrying grin with sharp teeth.Max and Lilyrsquos hearts beat uncontrollably as they sprinted away from this terrying image and as they did so all the candles blew out, throwing the children into complete darkness.Was this thing still there  The friends sat together in the darkness breathing heavily, in shock and terror.Suddenly, in the darkness, icy fingers gripped Lilyrsquos arms.ldquoWas that you rsquorsquo asked Lily. ldquoNo, replied Max.All at once, the candles lit up again. Max and Lily turned round and saw a horrying face: ldquoArghhhhhhh!They woke in the sunlight. ldquoWhat  said Max, confused. ldquoWhat just happened   added Lily.ldquoIt must have been a bad dream, said Max. ldquoBut both of us had the same dream, how is that possible ldquoWe had better go, they said.As they were about to leave, they saw a robin. They turned and looked at each other with a smirk on their faces and a chill in their bones."},{"url":null,"title":"port-seton-library-closing-refurbishment","story":"The library, situated within the Port Seton Community Centre, closes on Monday and will re-open on Monday, December .During this period, customers will not be able to borrow books or other loans however, they canany loans to staff at the community centre and the outstanding loans period will be extended during the refurbishment work.Anyone wishing to use a computer will be able to do so within the community centre.Councillor Jim Goodfellow, council spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: ldquoOur investment in the refurbishment of the library will result in it being repainted and the carpeting being replaced, which means that it has to be completely emptied for the work to be carried out.\"Loans can still be taken out or ed at any of the other branches across East Lothian and we have made sure that two PCs will be available to use within the community centre."},{"url":null,"title":"pumpkin-patch-nursery-boss-admits-defeat-closing-dunbar-nursery","story":"Jonathan Bruneau said the Dunbar branch of his Pumpkin Patch Nurseries would close permanently in two weeks after  years of looking after children in the town.The nursery was criticised in a recent Care Inspectorate report over changing staff and a lack of management.However, Mr Bruneau, who also has Pumpkin Patch nurseries in North Berwick and Haddington, said the problems had been created by Scottish Government demands.He said: ldquoUnfortunately we have had to admit defeat related to our ability to staff and manage our Dunbar setting.ldquoRecruiting management and senior staff has been impossible over recent years due to Scottish Government policies which have driven the average age and experience of nursery practitioners down to levels which are simply not appropriate to run a nursery.ldquoNursery staff work long hours for salaries which are not commensurate with the level of education and expertise they are expected to achieve.ldquoThis, plus the rolling out of , hours per year of free nursery care , has created a staffing crisis most noticeably felt in rural areas where staff cannot afford to travel from Edinburgh or beyond.ldquoThe final straw came when we lost our most recent manager after three months when she was poached by a nursery closer to home. This was inevitable as she had been travelling one hour each way to get to Dunbar and, even though subsidised by us to make the journey, a two-hour commute is simply not sustainable.Mr Bruneau warned of the impact of demands on private nurseries in April this year when his nursery in Haddington saw its grades fall in an inspection. He said: ldquoThis is a systematic problem which is causing a death spiral in the quality of nursery provision throughout the industry.The inspection report on Dunbarrsquos Pumpkin Patch rated its quality of care and support, staffing and management and leadership at twowith the environment rated a three .The report said that parents had contacted the inspectorate following its unannounced visit in August to discuss concerns.A high turnover in staff was raised by a number of parents, with one telling inspectors: ldquoOften when I drop my child off I have to introduce myself and my child to the agency staff.The report said: ldquoParents told us that they often did not know the staff when they dropped off their children in the morning, often resulting in their children being reluctant to attend.Mr Bruneau said that the introduction of mandatory SSSCregistration was creating recruitment problems throughout the industry.He said: ldquoBefore the advent of SSSC registration, our group of nurseries never used any agency staff as recruitment was simple. It included people of ying ages, experience and circumstance.ldquoIt was a healthy labour market now new staff are iniably under , inexperienced in le, work and certainly the care of children.ldquoNursery closures are inevitable as sites struggle to find staff, maintain standards and satisfy increased demand.He said his company had decided to rationalise itsservices, placing more experience in fewer sites, and called on the Scottish Government to reverse policies he said ruled out more mature staff from working in nurseries.He added that all five members of staff at Dunbar had been offered places at his other nurseries.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council, which used the Dunbar nursery as a partner provider, said: ldquoWe have worked with Pumpkin Patch as one of our partner providers, offering funded early learning and childcare for pre-school children for many years.ldquoOur officers have also provided extensive support to the Dunbar team to help them improve the quality of experiences following recent Care Inspectorate reports. Our assistance has been recognised and appreciated by the owners, who feel that we have done all we can to support them.ldquoWe acknowledge that this will have been a dficult decision for the owners and will have implications for their team at Dunbar. We also acknowledge the upset and disruption that the nursery closure will bring for parents using this service.ldquoOur staff will work with and support parents to find alternative early learning and childcare within the area that meets their needs.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoMore than , children are already benefiting from the expanded entitlement after we increased training opportunities and routes into the early learning and childcare sector, resulting in a record ,-strong workforce.ldquoWe are working alongside local authorities and providers to ensure the necessary workforce is in place ndash including running a national early learning and childcare recruitment campaign, increasing support for training places and modern apprenticeships, and enabling providers to advertise jobs free on the MyJobScotland website."},{"url":null,"title":"pensioner-completes-74-year-quest-discover-father","story":"David Simpson had spent  years looking for his dad after growing up in a Quarriers orphanage to the west of Glasgow before moving across the Atlantic.But his attempts proved fruitless until a visit to long-lost family in Elgin last year.John Hamilton, from Lost Haddington, then became aware of Mr Simpsonrsquos quest.He said: ldquoFrom the information David received from Quarriers, all he knew was that his father was a Jack Cunningham, a plasterer from Goodallrsquos Place in Haddington.ldquoHis niece AnnMarie Whyte did a search for Goodallrsquos Place and the result came back with a find against a Lost Haddington image for the old Goodallrsquos shop on the townrsquos Bridge Street this led to AnnMarie posting a question askingI knew who Jack Cunningham was.ldquoA search of the Lost Haddington collection for Cunningham brought back too many matches, so the search was honed to lsquoplastererrsquo and the results produced the equivalent of a Holy Grail image ndash a George Angus scan of a lsquoJohnrsquo Cunninghamrsquos security application to RAF East Fortune.As well as correcting the name, the image confirmed his occupation and address, as well as his height, hair and eye colour.A plea was put on social media for further information, which found that Johnrsquos nickname was lsquoGibbyrsquo and that David had a cousin living in Musselburgh called Janette Brotherstone.Mr Hamilton said: ldquoAlso, a further search of Lost Haddington for the word lsquoGibbyrsquo, with it being an unusual name, produced another George Angus image from  showing Davidrsquos father John when he was only five or six years old holding the date plate for his school photo ndash George had annotated the image saying the lsquoboy holding the date slate was Gibby Cunninghamrsquo, so when I sent David this image it was the first time hersquod seen his father.ldquoThe feedback from the Lost Haddington followers also indicated that John died in  when he lived at No  St Annrsquos Place.ldquoThrough the invaluable feedback which named Janette as his first cousin, David was put in touch with her and shersquos since sent him some old family photos showing his father throughout his le.ldquoThe photos came from Davidrsquos fatherrsquos home, where he died, as it was Janette who dealt with the death notices for both Davidrsquos father and Johnrsquos we Jessie Cagder.ldquoDavid visited Scotland in autumn  so I offered to bring him to Haddington, which he accepted.From there, David, who now lives in Rochester, New York, was able to see the home where his dad was born on Haddingtonrsquos St Martinrsquos Gate, as well as his homes on Goodallrsquos Place and St Annrsquos Place.It is thought Davidrsquos dad was lodged with a landlady while working in Elgin in .According to Mr Hamilton: ldquoThe landladyrsquos husband was away from home for two years as a soldier in World War Two and itrsquos during this period that John and the landlady must have had a moment of indiscretion together, which produced David!ldquoWhen the landladyrsquos husband ed home from the war due to injury and found his we holding baby David ndash that couldnrsquot have been his ndash he gave his we the ultimatum: lsquoTake him to the orphanage or itrsquos a orce.rsquoldquoAt the age of around one month old, David was taken to the Quarriers orphanage which is near the Bridge of Weir to the west of Glasgow.David left Quarriers at the age of  and eventually moved to Winnipeg in Canada in  before eventually settling in New York.More than  years ago, he began his bid to track down his family.

And itrsquos not just the political climate thatrsquos volatile.Derek Mackay, deputy ing officer for Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, said the highlands and islands ldquocould have signicant issues with a winter poll.He said: ldquoWeather is a major consideration. We often have challenges with a summer poll, never mind something in winter, because wersquove got to transport the ballot boxes and the ballot papers up from Barra to South Uist.ldquoSo yoursquore going across the Sound of Barra and the Sound of Harris ndash two stretches of water.ldquoWe always have a contingency arrangement for that, using boats, but that would obviously take pretty much till the next day before we get the papers there. So we usually use either a helicopter or a plane.If weather conditions are so severe that even boats canrsquot make it across, officials will simply have to wait.Mr Mackay added: ldquoWe have in the past looked at having the leboat in the Sound of Barra route,we can do that.ldquoIt is a shorter route, so it wonrsquot take the leboat far away from its normal base. But we just have to see what the weatherrsquos like on the day.ldquoIn the evening and in the morning, wersquoll obviously be watching the forecast well in advance so that we can make any logistical decisions.ldquoAndit is delayed, itrsquos delayed, but hopefully not for a signicant amount of time. But thatrsquos very much out of our hands. The risk is signicantly higher at this time of year.There is also the possibility of strike action by air traffic controllers employed by Highlands and Islands Airports Limited , amid an ongoing pay row.This could rule out using a plane, while helicopters can be weather-dependent.Mr Mackay continued: ldquoTherersquos also the issue of getting the ballot papers from the mainland to Stornoway and then on to Uist and Barra.ldquoWersquoll have contingency arrangements in place for that as well. That usually happens several days in advance of the poll.ldquoWe may have to bring that forward, depending on weather. So therersquos issues there.ldquoGetting postal packs to and from the islands,therersquos weather disruption with the Royal Mail ndash especiallyitrsquos on polling day, a lot of people could end up disenfranchised because their postal votes are stuck in Glasgow.Elsewhere, seasonal flu means more staff could be off sick, while officials are also looking at buying additional lighting to cope with the dark winter days.Mr Mackay said: ldquoWersquoll be meeting with the ious emergency services and our own technical services staff to look at options for their potentially having to have xs or all-terrain vehicles on the road.In , when the local government and Holyrood elections were held on the same day, last-minute fog grounded the helicopter on the Western Isles and delayed the count. And that was in May, not December.John Mundell, the interim chief executive of Orkney Islands Council and ing officer for Orkney and Shetland, said there is a ldquosignicant potential risk around the winter weather.Ferries could be cancelled, planes grounded and roads and footpaths covered with ice or snow.On Shetland, ballot boxes in the outer islands have be transported down to Sumburgh on the southern tip and then across the sea to Orkney, by plane or boat.Mr Mundell said: ldquoItrsquos unpredictable at the best of times, but during the winter you can get hit with all sorts that makes it even more unpredictable.ldquoItrsquos quite acute, and the risks are quite hefty. And obviously, from my perspective, Irsquoll be watching the weather forecasts very closely.Mr Mundell stressed ing officers up and down the country have been anticipating a winter election.He added: ldquoHowever, given the circumstances, there is a limit to what we can dowe are hit with the worst of the weather.ldquoObviously, the intention from the outset is to have the count completed in a professional and organised manner.ldquoBut under no circumstances will I be allowing my team to put lives or property at risk.Elsewhere, David Sutherland, Highland Councilrsquos elections manager, said a ldquomulti-agency coordinating group will be set up to assist with any events or incidents under severe conditions.He said: ldquoWe have been planning for a snap election for some time now and are very mindful of the possibilities of conducting an election in winter in the highlands of Scotland, which has the largest geographical election area in the UK with some of the most challenging distances to cover, including island communities.Scotlandrsquos cities also face a logistical juggling act to ensure everything runs smoothly.Both Glasgow and Edinburgh have been unable to secure their preferred venues for the election count due to the late notice.Andrew Kerr, chief executive of Edinburgh Council and the cityrsquos ing officer, oversees one of the largest operations in the UK, coordinating votes from five constituencies.He said: ldquoItrsquos not so much that itrsquos winter, itrsquos that now we donrsquot have very much notice before we go to the polls, with , polling cards going out.He said there are  polling stations to organise, with  staff manning them.A further  staff will be needed on the night of the count, which is likely to take place at the Royal Highland Centre in Ingliston.Mr Kerr said a small number of Christmas parties and other events had to be rescheduled to free up polling stations.He said: ldquoItrsquos just about getting yourself prepared. Itrsquos a big logistical exercise ndash a big complex logistical exercise.But he added: ldquoLocal governments all had some practice, I think, because of the European election, which were done at speed as well.ldquoSo wersquore just using the same protocols. Irsquove just stood up the full-time team again as of Monday. My election team ndash some of whom had gone back to their day jobs ndash are now back full-time.Peter Stanyon, chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators, said councils will need to use ldquoinnovative thinking.He said: ldquoWersquore stepping into the unknown, because we havenrsquot had a national poll in December since the s.He said there is a legal requirement to start counting the votes within four hours of polls closing.If this window is missed, he said, officials need to formally state the reasons for this.Mr Stanyon added: ldquoOne of the things that wersquove been talking to the Electoral Commission about is an understanding that, for exampletherersquos a heavy dump of snow, ortherersquos gales in the Northern Isles forecast for polling day, then clearly the count wonrsquot start within that four hour period. Itrsquos testing anyway, obviously, for the islands regardless.ldquoSo I think there will need to be a degree of understanding that every effort will be made to run this poll in exactly the same way asit were in the spring or summer months, but there will be that challenge.ldquoI know in the past, for example, when there have been weather issues, theyrsquove actually helicoptered the boxes in from the islands.He continued: ldquoThe good news, I suppose, is that ironically because of the European election, that we had been told wasnrsquot going to happen, the councils have been through this process recently.ldquoIf there had been any issues in the run up to the European elections, they will have been ironed out now in time for this particular poll.

The pleasure beach carnival provided thrills and spills, there were donkey rides, high teas and dancing at the Beach Ballroom.Union Streetrsquos silver granite buildings offered a sparkling welcome to tens of thousands of visitors from Edinburgh, Glasgow and beyond who trooped off trains and buses or,they were very posh, a BEA flight to Aberdeen airport.So popular was the Granite City that at the height of a busy tourist season there could be as many as six trains arriving every eight minutes, each packed with up to  people.During a golden period of British seaside holidays before continental tourism dawned, the city was one of Scotlandrsquos most popular tourist destinations, while the castles, scenery and golf courses of the surrounding Aberdeenshire countryside kept the visitors coming.In Aberdeenrsquos case, an unfortunate delivery of contaminated Argentinian corned beef to a city shop in  proved disastrous. The subsequent typhoid epidemic left  people desperately sick, visitor numbers slumped and suddenly Aberdeenrsquos shining northern star was fading.Now, however, after decades of enjoying an oil and gas boom that more than made up for the loss of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Fair visitors, the Granite City and Aberdeenshire are preparing to become Scotlandrsquos next big tourist destinations.Stung by the downturn in the energy sector that saw demand slump for its once-packed hotel rooms, and perhaps slightly envious of Dundeersquos rising star as a ldquomust-see destination, Aberdeenshirersquos tourism sector is now seriously upping its game.Yesterday saw a major step towards the cityrsquos tourism rebirth with the reopening of Aberdeen Art Gallery following a pound. million revamp.Around , visitors were expected to pour inside the -year-old gallery to admire works by Tracey Emin, Henry Moore, Francis Bacon and Monet.Its  galleries offer three times the number of previous exhibits and include displays on nearby Balmoral and its links to Queen Victoria, the empowerment of women and the cityrsquos relationship with the sea.The galleryrsquos rejuvenation is accompanied by a host of other multi-million-pound new developments and revamps across the city, from the dramatic expansion of the cityrsquos harbour to welcome mega-size cruise ships, to a new look for Union Terrace Gardens.Along with the recent opening of the pound million Event Complex Aberdeen with its conference and venue space, restaurants and two new hotels with  new rooms, city leaders believe the city is set to shed a little of its ldquobusiness only image to lure a new generation of leisure visitors.That should be very welcome news for the arearsquos hotels. From enjoying the comfort of having rooms block-booked months in advance, many were left grasping for customers as oil and energy businesses slumped.Rooms lay empty, the cost of a nightrsquos stay in luxury hotels designed to meet high demands of big paying customers was slashed. Some, such as the -room Highland Hotel on Crown Street, closed.According to VisitScotland figures,  saw the volume of domestic visitors to Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire fall below , for the first time, driven by a % drop in business travellers.Meanwhile, BDOrsquos Hotels Britain report for the year showed the cityrsquos hotels had the worst occupancy rates in the country with more than one-third of rooms lying empty.It also recorded the biggest drop in rooms yield in the UK, with hotels earning pound. per room, down from pound. the previous year.The figures were particularly concerning at a time when rooms yield in Inverness grew by almost %, while Edinburgh soared by .%.Fast-forward to last month, and professional services specialist PwCrsquos latest Hotels Forecast report brought only some comfort. While a slight recovery in the oil and gas industry led to a .% increase in occupancy rates to .% in the past year, it is far short of the countless ldquono vacancies signs at the height of the oil boom when room occupancy rates were in the s and s.Despite the rise, revenue per available room was also said to have fallen by .%.Could Aberdeenrsquos multi-million-pound investments in visitor attractions and facilities bring the good times back ldquoUntil around , hotels had lsquono vacancyrsquo signs up, says Chris Foy, chief executive of VisitAberdeenshire.ldquoWe were doing very well from corporate business.

Aberdeen has , hotel rooms and the area has fantastic niche, luxury properties serving high-spending visitors. Therersquos plenty of capacity, the lsquono vacancyrsquo signs are down and there are fantastic deals.Foy believes Aberdeen and the surrounding areas can capitalise on a growing trend among travellers to embrace lesser-explored ldquosecondary cities which offer something dferent to well-trodden tourist centres.Evidence of that comes from Aberdeenrsquos recent surprise inclusion in the New York Times list of top  places in the world to visit alongside Doha, Los Angeles, Lyon in France, New York, Los Angeles and Tahiti.Meanwhile, accommodation giant Airbnb has also named Aberdeen as one of its top  trending global travel destinations for .

Aberdeen is a thriving energy city which is going through a transformation.Evidence of that seems to be around every corner ndash even at one of Aberdeenrsquos oldest buildings. Work has started on a major revamp of Provost Skenersquos House, built in the mid-th century ndash it is to become a visitor attraction where the lives of  famous Aberdonians will be celebrated, among them Annie Lennox and Denis Law.Aberdeen Science Centreis also set for a poundm upgrade to the old granite Tramsheds in the cityrsquos Constitution Street, while at the harbour, where for  years ships have brought visitors as well as supplies, a poundm expansion scheme is well under way.Once complete, the harbour will be able to welcome some of the biggest cruise ships in the world. Enterprising local travel agents have already confirmed new routes for the harbour, with vessels offering trips around Britain, to the Baltic States, St Petersburg, Norway and Iceland on the cards, while across Aberdeenshire tour companies are gearing up to cater for an influx of visitors seeking golf, castles and outdoor adventures.To help the area on its way ndash and following some criticism that its marketing strategies in the past have dwelled too much on certain other areas ndash national tourism body VisitScotland has included Aberdeen in a new six-month worldwide ldquoScotland Is Now marketing campaign targeting potential visitors from Germany, France, the US, China and the UK.Meanwhile, hopes are high that the decision to stage the BBC Sports Personality of the Year ceremony at the new Event Complex Aberdeen in December will give the area a national  for a sport-loving audience.City leaders are also looking at plans to host the final stage of the Tour of Britain next year and the cycling eventrsquos Grand Depart in  as a potential opening to encouraging adventure and outdoor tourism.All of this has led to local tourism agency, VisitAberdeenshire, calling for volunteer ambassadors for the area ndash people who can share their love and knowledge of the northeast to visitors.ldquoTourism in the northeast has been dwarfed by oil and gas in terms of the economy, agrees Councillor Jenny Laing, co-leader of Aberdeen City Council. ldquoThose in the city were happy to service the business market, but the downturn in oil and gas meant companies and their supply chains looked at how to cut their costs, and part of that was around accommodation.ldquoTherersquos an increase in the number of rooms available while the market has shted, she adds. ldquoWe have a great opportunity for tourism, wersquore close to the beautul coast, we have Royal Deeside, golf, castles, but we donrsquot have any joined-up approach about what we are offering.One idea is to present Aberdeenshire as Scotlandrsquos outdoor adventure destination, she points out.ldquoItrsquos about us finding a niche for Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, collaborating and showing we have a good offering for tourists.Five hidden gems in the northeast.

The Loch Ness Monster  Underwater gasses released from a seismic fault. Giants and elves  The result of our ancestors trying to make sense of Standing Stones and ancient burial mounds. Selkies and kelpies  Echoes of ancient rites such as human sacrice and animal worship.Scotland is rich in myth. Each tale, however, has a grain of historical truth lying at its heart. We may think of such legends simply as supernatural stories invented by ancestors with overactive imaginations way back in the mists of time, but in fact these fables all have some basis in fact ndash although itrsquos often hard to uncover.The same is true for any culture. Most myths across the world can be explained. Therersquos even an academic discipline for rationally interpreting legends ndash itrsquos called Euhemerism. This school of thought is so old that it goes as far back as the greatest myth-makers of all, the ancient Greeks.Such studies were inspired by Euhemerus, a gted thinker from the fourth century BC. He believed the Greek gods were merely ancient kings and queens who had become worshipped as deities over time. Euhemerus was certain that the real, mortal king who became known as Zeus was buried on Crete. He is seen as the first atheist in history.Archaeologists in the early-th century worked out that the Greek myth of the one-eyed giants called Cyclopes was inspired by the woolly mammoth. When ancient Greeks uncovered the remains of mammoths scattered across the Mediterranean, the skull would have been bewildering. It looked human, it was huge, and in the centre there seemed to be a single, giant eye socket. It was, of course, the cavity of the mammothrsquos trunk. But the myth of the Cyclopes was born.The dragon myth found across the world is down to our ancient ancestors uncovering fossilised dinosaurs and trying to make sense of their discoveries. Similarly, tales of the mythical Grfin originated along the route of the old Silk Road in Asia, where the remains of beaked dinosaurs and their eggs were found.In the book The Lore Of Scotland, folklorist Sophia Kingshill says the nationrsquos myths helped our ancestors ldquoexplain the world and take ldquocontrol over their surroundings and circumstances. In a world without science, the stories handed down to us as folklore were a very real attempt by our forebears to grapple with the mysteries of le.Folklorists have been trying to decode Scottish myths for decades, to unravel what might lie behind them. How do our myths reflect our own past culture, and the thinking of our ancestors Sawney BeanSometimes myths reflect not how a society thinks of itself, however, but how others see that society. One of our most monstrous legends, the story of Sawney Bean the Scottish cannibal, reveals how our closest neighbour, England, saw us centuries ago. Studying the Sawney Bean myth also reveals just how recently some legends have been created, and then quickly accepted as fact.The tale tells of a family led by Sawney Bean and his we who take to the caves around Girvan sometime in the s. The tribe turns to cannibalism, waylays local travellers, drags them into caves and eats them. Eventually, one traveller survives, and the king and his soldiers arrest the monsters in their lair, and execute the entire brood.Therersquos a spot near Bennane Head in South Ayrshire called Sawney Beanrsquos Cave to this day ndash however, therersquos no evidence whatsoever that the cannibal family ever existed. In fact, the first records of the tale appear in England in , when tensions were high between Scotland and England following the Acts of Union.Sawney Bean is first mentioned in a book called Lives And Actions Of The Most Famous Highwaymen, Murderers, Street-Robbers Etc written, we think, by Daniel Defoe of RobinsonTherersquos no mention of Sawney Bean in any Scottish sources, Hobbs points out, until  ndash by which time the legend was an established part of folklore.Loch Ness MonsterWhen it comes to Nessie it seems like science and religion may well have collided to produce one of the worldrsquos greatest monster myths.The first report of Nessie comes in the Le Of Saint Columba, written in the sixth century AD. It tells the story of the Irish monk who brought Christianity to Scotland. It canrsquot have been easy converting the Picts, but claims of supernatural powers always help. Columba was said to have defeated a Pictish wizard, and repelled a monstrous ldquowater beast at the northern end of Loch Ness.Columba battling a monster from a river or loch would have been highly signicant to the ancient Celtic mind. Rivers were among the most important deities in the Celtic religion. A prominent Celtic goddess in Britain and Ireland was Danu, the mother goddess. Danu is also the root of the name for the river Danube ndash showing the extent of Celtic faith across the continent.Stories of Columba overpowering wizards and river monsters would have acted as propaganda at the time and accelerated his mission to convert Scotland ndash but there might also be a grain of truth somewhere too. Italian scientist Luigi Piccardi investigated possible geological explanations behind myths. He was interested in the fact that the Columba legend says the monster appeared ldquocum ingenti fremitu or ldquowith loud roaring. Loch Ness sits on the Great Glen Fault and itrsquos thought what Columba claimed to have seen was a mini-underwater earthquake, or the release of gas.Giants and fairy folkThe landscape around Scotland is filled with Standing Stones, burial mounds and ancient hill forts. To a Scot in the Middle Ages, such sights would be almost impossible to explain. What were they  Who had built them  Perhaps, our ancestors theorised, they were the work of giants or the entrance to Fairyland. In the th century, the Normans thought Stonehenge was built by giants.Therersquos been speculation that the word ldquoPict might be the source of the word ldquoPixie. This could be the ultimate source for ldquoPuck ndash the fairy made famous by Shakespeare in A Midsummer Nightrsquos Dream. Strange Pictish carvings are found on stones across Scotland. Itrsquos thought our ancestors interpreted these carvings as the handiwork of fairies.If we had no understanding of Neolithic le or the Bronze or Iron Age, such ideas would give meaning to the unexplainable.One of the most famous examples of the Stone Age-inspiring myths comes in the shape of ldquoElf Shot. When farmers in the medieval period were ploughing their land they would often uncover Neolithic arrow heads. Of course, no-one knew of the Stone Age back then, so no-one could understand what these strange stone arrows were ndash unless, of course, they were weapons used by fairies.During one battle in  at Loch Gruinart, there were claims that little people ndash an eighth the size of humans ndash helped the winning side. The legend is thought to be down to elf shot found in the area.Fingalrsquos Cave on the island of Staffa in the Inner Hebrides is a perfect example of the landscape-affecting myth. Itrsquos an incredible and imposing geological feature ndash and to the minds of our ancestors it could easily be seen as the home of some huge giant. In Irish mythology, Fingal is the warrior giant Fionn MacCumhaill ndash or Finn MacCool. Like many ancient mythic figures, itrsquos thought he was based on a great king or warlord who became a god-like figure long after his death.Legend has it that Fingal erected the standing stones at Machrie Moor on the Isle of Arran. Some of these spectacular stones stand nearly five metres high. Without an understanding of the past and of science, how  could our ancestors have interpreted the stones  They had to be the work of giant hands.Fingal is supposed to have died in Scotland ndash maybe in Glen Dochart. The fact that an Irish myth has such strong Scottish connections points to the deep cultural links between Ireland and Scotland going back millennia. The ancient kingdom of Dal Riata, founded in the fth century, spread from the north of Ireland across the west coast of Scotland. The prevalence of Irish myths in Scotland is a cultural reminder of our shared history.The Cailleach was a female giant also inspired by the Scottish landscape. The island of Ailsa Craig is supposed to be a pebble which fell from her apron. Huge stones in the Forest of Mar in Aberdeenshire were said to be the remains of her home.Rocks at the Falls of Connel are stepping stones she used to cross Loch Etive. There were reports of sightings of the Cailleach well into the Victorian era and she was last seen around  near Lochaber.In Scotland, therersquos also a long tradition of ldquoBrownie stories ndash of elf-like creatures who come into homes at night and perform good deeds, such as mending clothes or sweeping floors. Similar stories exist throughout Europe ndash most famously in the tale The Elves And The Shoemaker where little people help a cobbler with his work at night. Itrsquos believed these stories may be a hangover from the time when most of the continent was ruled by the Roman Empire. Romans believed in ldquoLares ndash household spirits which looked after every family, and often helped out in times of need.In Shetland and Orkney, stories of the little people reflect the regionrsquos ancient Viking past. On the islands, little people are known as ldquotrows ndash a derivation of the Scandinavian ldquotroll. These creatures lived in hillocks or cairns. One such place is the Trowie Knowe, a chambered tomb in Shetland.Sometimes, tales of the little people were a way of explaining the most painful of events. If a perfectly healthy baby dies today, we realise it is cot death. A millennium ago, such a tragedy would be impossible to understand. However, parents could find some explanation in the malevolent actions of fairies who came into homes, stole human babies and left dead fairies in their place ndash so-called changelings.Kelpies and selkiesMany myths across the world began as stories told to children by their parents to scare them and keep them safe. Think of the bogeyman stories of the th century. Some of these tales have morphed over recent decades, and taken on the shape of myths, such as the online Slenderman legend. Slenderman was taken so seriously by some children in America in  that the story led to violence.The kelpie may well be the original Scottish bogeyman. Itrsquos also a myth that could only be created in a country dominated by water. Scotlandrsquos rugged and sprawling coastline and myriad lochs and rivers made this a dangerous place to live in ancient times. Unlike many other parts of Europe,you lived in Scotland in the Stone Age or Bronze Age you were going to have to travel by boat a lot.The kelpie was a terrying horse-like beast which lived in water and would drag you to your death. One of the most famous kelpie stories sees seven little girls and one boy playing in Glen Keltney. The little girls see a horse in the loch and climb on to its back. The boy refuses. The girls drown. The boy lives. The moral of the story, children, is do what your parents tell you and stay away from water.The kelpie myth is also an echo of the ancient Celtic practice of making sacrices to appease powerful water gods who lived in rivers. In some cases the sacricial victim would be a horse. To make more signicant offerings to the gods, humans would be sacriced, even children.Like kelpies, selkies also played a role in reminding people to be respectfully fearful of water, but these mermaid-like creatures, half-human half-seal, say more about ancient economics and religion. Along the Scottish coastline, and across the islands, the seal was a vital resource for our ancestors. It provided food and clothing. Humans have hunted them since the Stone Age. Neolithic people identied closely with the creatures they hunted, and even worshipped them. Their shamans, or priests, would ldquobecome the deer or seal during magical ceremonies to help in the hunt. Once killed the animal would be revered because of the importance of its sacrice to the tribe.In the s, a North Uist poet, John MacCodrum, claimed he was a selkie descendant. In the sea, selkies take the shape of seals, on land they take off their skins and assume human form. However,they lose their skin they have to remain human. The North Uist legend tells of a local man who fell in love with a selkie and stole her sealskin to keep her on land. The couple had children but one day the selkie found her skin and ed to the sea.Their descendants were known as ldquothe MacCodrums of the Seals. In the th century on North Uist there were still people who claimed a lineage back to selkies.On Orkney, there were stories of people descended from selkies being born with webbed hands. Perhaps that myth was inspired by the birth of a disabled child. After all, our ancient ancestors found source material for the legends they handed down to us wherever they looked."},{"url":null,"title":"general-election-2019-labour-win-itll-less-like-venezuela-britain-circa-1974","story":"Jeremy Corbyn was also talking tough this week.

A friendship with his landladyrsquos daughter Rita had blossomed into something more romantic and the pair were married in , despite the staunch disapproval of both their families.Rita Cowan, at , was living a le of faded prosperity with her mother and three siblings after the death of her father, Dr Samuel Campbell Cowan, the previous year, and seized the chance to break away from her tight-knit community even though it would mean uprooting herself to the other side of the world.Masataka had already marked himself out as an unusual man, but his mixed marriage was highly unorthodox in his home country, where arranged marriages were seen as the essential ingredient of a happy and successful le and Westerners were few and far between.According to family legend, the couple slipped away and married in a register office without the knowledge or permission of either of their sets of parents. Ritarsquos -year-old sister and her friend acted as witnesses and the diminutive party ate an illicit celebratory meal afterwards at the nearby Station Hotel.But despite its clandestine start, the marriage would prove to be a success, with Rita accepting the customs of Japan when she emigrated there with her husband later that year.The couple later adopted two children ndash a daughter, Rima, whose name combined Rita and Masataka ndash and a son, Takeshi, who was Taketsurursquos orphaned nephew. Takeshi, who would go on to inherit Masatakarsquos whisky business, witnessed the atomic blast at Hiroshima from his home nearby.Back in Japan, Masataka put his new-found distilling skills to use with a job at spirits maker Suntory.However, whisky was slow to catch on in the Japanese market and it wasnrsquot until  that the breakthrough was made.Establishing a distillery at Yoichi on the island of Hokkaido, which has a similar climate to Scotland, Mastaka began to produce a drink that found a ready market. Some of the recipes he introduced remain firm favourites today, such as Kakubin ldquosquare bottle, the most successful of all Japanese whiskies.In , with a gulf growing between Japan and the West which would soon erupt into war, homegrown whisky rose in popularity and Suntory became the official supplier to the Japanese navy.The distillery, with Masataka its guiding light, was then ideally placed to capitalise on the economic boom which gripped Japan as it rebuilt in the s, and a huge consumer class arose hungry for luxury goods.Rita died in , and Mastaka in , after a le which saw him awarded six honours from the Emperor and his hometown, and gain the unofficial title of ldquothe father of Japanese whisky. Kirkintilloch, where he met the love of his le, is now twinned with Yoichi, which has a ldquoRita Road among its street plan.Dr Niall Mackenzie of the University of Glasgow Adam Smith Business School said: ldquoMasataka Taketsuru is one of the universityrsquos many illustrious and world-changing alumni ndash the centenary of his enrolment at the University of Glasgow is an occasion for celebrating his role in the creation of Japanrsquos whisky industry and the longstanding connections between the university and Japan.The celebration of Masatakarsquos Taketsurursquos le will be held on November  at the University of Glasgowrsquos Kelvin Gallery."},{"url":null,"title":"andrew-marr-show-ridge-sunday-reviews","story":"ldquoIrsquove thought very hard about this.

Why, despite shting phenomenal amounts in novel form, some  million sold to date, and being a relative success on stage, has His Dark Materials never lit up the screen successfully Some pound million was spent on a , all bells and whistles movie which, praise for armoured polar bears and Nicole Kidman aside, failed to fly. Now the BBC and HBO have splashed a rumoured pound million on an eight part adaptation for television.Worth it  While first impressions were favourable, that is still a lot of money. One and a half new BBC Scotland channels to be precise, or , licence fees for over s.Jack Thorne, the writer of Shameless and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, was in charge of the adaptation. He gave little quarter to anyone unfamiliar with the novels. After a brief introduction covering the all-powerful ruling elite, known as the Magisterium, and a prophecy about a special child, we were pitched into a world very much like this world, yet somehow not. Welcome to the endless strangeness and complexities of Pullmanrsquos universe.Previous adaptations have fallen down in trying to get across the trilogyrsquos many and complex themes too soon. Wisely, this production homed in instead on the ldquodaemons, the spirit animals that encapsulate the souls of the humans to which they are attached. Scientist and explorer Lord Asriel James McAvoy, one of several Scots in the cast including James Cosmo and Gary Lewis has a very cool snow leopard as his daemon. His orphaned niece, Lyra, the child on whom so much will depend, has a stoat. Who doesnrsquot love a super furry animal that can talk British-Spanish actress Dafne Keen is excellent as the fearless, inquisitive Lyra, her dark features calling to mind the heroine of Panrsquos Labyrinth. McAvoy makes an awesome adventurer, never happier than when there is a swash to be buckled.Asriel has just blown in from the frozen north with tales of a mysterious substance he calls ldquodust. The existence of this material, which appears to conceal other worlds, is contrary to the Magisteriumrsquos teachings. It is the kind of information, indeed, that could topple empires.The mentions of ldquodust had unfortunate comic echoes of the Little Britain sketch about a slimming group leader who tells members that dust is all they can eatthey want to lose weight. The daemons, for all they were delightful in the main, took a while to get used to. When we could see their lips move it was obvious they were talking when we could not, their seemingly disembodied voices only added to the mounting confusion.Just when the story showed signs of slipping away, something happened that bodes well for any television drama: Ruth Wilson rocked up to play the mesmerising and beautul Mrs Coulter. Offering Lyra a job and the chance to move to London, the character played by the star of Luther and The Affair seems a dream come true for motherless Lyra. But her daemon is a gorgeous but terrying golden monkey - so make of that business what you will.By episode end, Asriel was racing back to the North, and scores of others were heading to London in search of vanished children. With armoured polar bears and Lin-Manuel Mirandastill to come, it would be a brave soul indeed who bailed on His Dark Materials this early.

We now appear to be running the risk of those who feel denied their own wish to just re-run votes until they achieve their own desired result which, with such close results in both referendums, is a recipe for unrest. What should now be done is to discuss changes to the way we vote to give more meaningful results in future rather than the one vote either way first past the post system we currently have.George Dale, Beith.IF there is ever to be an Indyref the question to be asked must be fair, unbiased and easily understood.As evidenced by the question posed in the Brexit referendum, the opinion of the Electoral Commission is that a simple Yes No question is unfair as it contains an inherent bias in favour of the positivity of Yes against the negativity of No. It is encouraging therefore that Holyroodrsquos cross-party finance and constitution committee has recognised this in calling for more scrutiny of the question to be asked in any Indyref, instead of simply rubber-stamping the underhand attempt by the SNP to gain advantage by repeating the Yes No question asked in  .In demanding Indyref, it is clear that the objective of the SNP is to leave the UK union and join the EU, but there are concerns that a Leave  Remain question might confuse some as it carries echoes of Brexit. One question which goes to the heart of the matter and adopts the style used in  would be ldquoShould Scotland be part of the UK or part of the EU  UK or EU. There is no bias in the question and the choice could not be clearer.Alan Fitzpatrick, Dunlop.THE result of the election will be, in Scotland, a barometer of attitudes towards both Brexit and Scottish secession. It will be interesting to see how many of the SNPrsquos habitual voters who chose to leave the EU will remain SNP voters. A figure of around one-third of SNP voters represents Brexiters. Those seeking to support a Remain party have an easy choice: vote LibDem. Yet for those who oppose secession from the UK there really is only one choice: evenit means holding onersquos nose, one must vote for the party best-placed to defeat the SNP candidate. That will normally be the candidate who came second in , although in some cases, such as Ross, Cromarty and Skye ndash the constituency of Ian Blackford ndash it will not. That constituency has a strong Lib Dem heritage, and Remainers can vote Lib Dem happily.Nicola Sturgeon has made it clear that the issue in this election is Scotlandrsquos place in the UK. This is allied to a  claim that a Scotland could remain in the EU. Pro-Union people need to vote, and to vote for the party best-placed to unseat an SNP MP or to prevent an SNP candidate from winning.Jill Stephenson, EH.WHATEVER view we might hold about Brexit most people in Scotland must find it of great importance that we must defend our NHS. Our health service is under attack from two angles. First US health care companies want to get into health care contracts in the UK to make profits from that, and also the big drug companies in the US want to force the NHS to pay more for drugs, indeed as much as an additional pound billion for starters to get us level with prices in the US.So this is a time to look at our politicians now seeking our votes and make an important judgment. In a vote in the Westminster Parliament to protect the NHS the Tories predictably voted against, but the Liberals abstained. Now we know where the Tories stand on the NHS, they will sell it offthey get a deal they like with the US. So why did the Liberals not support the NHS, can Jo Swinson explain this to us when she is looking for Scottish votes Andy Anderson, Saltcoats.IF I hear any more politicians telling me that at last we will be able to use our vote to determine what party will win and get on with Brexit, I will despair. We have already done that ndash in General Elections, in referenda, and in local elections and European elections ndash but to no avail. Our politicians donrsquot give a toss who we elect or what we want, and at the moment it would appear that it would be extremely possible that a government will be elected ndash probably another minority government and we will start  in exactly the same situation where we find ourselves just now.I mean, letrsquos look at our choices. A party led by a despotic, bully-boy private school pupil, who thinks he is still at school, and held to account not by his members or electorate, but by an evil unelected manipulator who lurks in the shadows. A party led by a devoted Marxist who at least admits to his beliefs , and leads another ided main party which was once a great party. A party led by an unelected and unopposed leader, anxious to talk about nothing but Brexit to avoid scrutiny over what has happened to all the countryrsquos money when its services continue to fall and implode. A party led by a leader who resolutely refuses to live up to the word ldquodemocrat, which is part of her partyrsquos name, but which she and her party members have redefined as ldquodemocrat as long as you agree with us. A party led by a leader determined to leave the European Community at whatever cost, and who seems to appear on television and radio more than any other politician, despite him not holding a seat.You kindly printed a letter which I sent to you at the time of this yearrsquos European elections, when for the first time in my le, I refused to vote for any candidate , and asked sincerely: why we do not have a box in our ballot papers which allows us to vote, but at the same time express our opposition to the candidates and or parties who wish our votes  Compulsory voting should be introduced to this country as soon as possible, so that we could become like all eligible Australian citizens, for example, who are required to register to vote, to actually vote in all of its elections, and are penalisedthey do not vote. Were this system in place in the United Kingdom right now, we would perhaps discover that those of us who voted our disgust or protestations at politicians today attained  per cent  per cent  per cent of the vote, and maybe ndash just maybe ndash some of our politicians would waken up and take notice that our country is not all about them, but about all of us. I donrsquot think that would ever happen, though, do you Walter Paul, Glasgow G.WITH the election called for December  we have the problems of the dark days and nights potential weather disruptions, cancelled ferries and flights, road closures from snow, flu bugs and other hazards for people living in rural Scotland in particular. However, a postal vote will solve many of the problems.We have plenty of time to apply online or at our local council offices.The postal votes do not need to be sent in right away so we have plenty of time to find out what the political party manestos contain and check out the facts.Young people in Scotland who got the vote at  cannot vote in UK elections until they are .

Images of its reflection in the deathly still waters of Loch Rannoch have featured in countless calendars and for many Munro baggers, it is a favourite to be saved and savoured as their final summit.One of Scotlandrsquos best-known mountains and at the very heart of the country, Schiehallion is now set to adopt a new role the nationrsquos most inclusive Munro.Work is now underway on a new low-level, circular footpath at Schiehallion that will enable visitors who might normally struggle to fully experience the beauty of Scotlandrsquos outdoors to enjoy its natural beauty up close.The km easy access path and boardwalk will open up the fringes of the mountain to people with mobility problems, families with small children, wheelchairs and prams, and others for whom the peakrsquos uphill trails are too exhausting and challenging.The path, which includes seating areas and interpretation boards along its route explaining the arearsquos wildle and archaeological history, is part of ongoing improvement work being carried out by the Schiehallionrsquos owners, The John Muir Trust.That has already seen extensive repairs to the main path. Pounded by countless pairs of boots, it had stretched to up to  feet wide in sections and left an ugly scar on the hillside. That work led to the first section of the realigned uphill path being specically designed as lsquoeasy accessrsquo.The creation of a new accessible route encircling the base of the mountain is among a growing number of initiatives intended to open Scotlandrsquos countryside and tourist attractions to visitors with a range of mobility or health concerns.Taken together, they could see Scotland position itself as a leader within the potentially lucrative international inclusive tourism market.Last month VisitScotland launched a new guide to help tourism-related businesses become more dementia-friendly in a bid to help them tap into a pound billion lsquodementia poundrsquo sector.The guide highlights the kinds of improvements needed to upgrade infrastructure ndash such as disabled-friendly bathrooms and paths - menus and boost staff knowledge to help attract visitors from a rapidly growing sector.That followed a move earlier this year when the national tourism organisation took guests from two of Europersquos top accessible tour operators to a range of attractions including Stirling Castle, Royal Yacht Britannia, Clydeside Distillery and Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, to showcase how leading destinations are already catering for the needs of less mobile visitors.It was the first trip of its kind specically designed to highlight Scotlandrsquos inclusive potential and has led to one of the operators, Denmark-based HandiTours, adding Scotland to its package tour programme for the first time.

In Orkney, Police have joined up with Orkney Road Safety forum, to encourage cyclists to remain safe and visible, with not only education, but the handing out of bike lights.Police are reminding cyclists that along with obeying all traffic signs, traffic light signals and not cycling on pavements, they must equip their bikes with the appropriate lights and make sure they are lit when it starts to get dark.Officers in Orkney will be proactively looking to address cyclists who ignore the legislative requirement to illuminate their bikes in darkness, and will be providing bike lights to those who need them. Just over  pairs of bike lights have been purchased using funding from Police Scotland Safer Communities for this purpose.#Visibility is key to keeping cyclists safe on the roads and I would encourage cyclists to ensure they wear bright reflective clothing and illuminate lights on their bikes, both front and rear, in order to make themselves more visible to other road users,# said chief inspector, Matthew Webb.#This is equally applicable during the day, but more important at dusk and when it#s dark, to avoid collisions and warn other road users to their presence.#Some cyclists wear dark clothing and particularly on faster roads they can be almost invisible to drivers until they are close to them.#He added: #I recognise in this rural community that a lot of the measures are equally applicable to the equine community and they are more than welcome to make use of the same free offer.#This initiative has been supported by the Orkney Road Safety Forum who will assist with the distribution of these lights, which in addition to the police office, are available from the OIC hubs and Scottish Fire and Rescue Service Community Safety Advocacy.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They weren’t just losing but being ground into the south-west London soil.We know now the miracle very nearly came off, with Scotland leading - on the last play of the game, only to let in England once again to close out a - draw. I doubt I will ever experience such eye-popping, man-hugging drama at a rugby match again. It was my team, my country, and I still get goosebumps thinking about it.: South Africa captain Siya Kolisi ready for shot at history: Defence coach says England can pile pressure on South AfricaBut whisper it up here, Scotland’s shock treatment might just have sparked England’s progress to the Rugby World Cup final in Tokyo, because since that March day they have only lost once, in August when a second string side including only six of today’s starters lost a World Cup warm-up - to Wales in Cardf. A week later, a team featuring  of today’s opening line-up thrashed Ireland -. The chances are anyone reading this column will already know whether Owen Farrell has held the Webb Ellis Trophy aloft orhe was down on his hunkers in despair as the honour fell to a victorious South African captain Siya Kolisi. And I should want the Cup to be raised for the first time by a black Springbok skipper.Pipe band member in But I don’t. I want to see the Veldt Leviathans cut open by the skills of Farrell and George Ford, honed on dimly lit rugby league grounds at Wigan St Pats and Bradford, because I’m supporting England. Always have. Ever since that collection of Esso  Mexico World Cup football coins was completed, I’ve backed England when they aren’t playing us.I was in the pipe band in  when Kenny Dalglish stuck the ball through Ray Clemence’s legs, my mates came back from Wembley the following year with tufts of grass and bits of wood they said were from the obviously tubular goal posts, and in  alongside everyone  I laughed along with Andy Cameron and ‘We’re on the March with Ally’s Army’ and sat stunned as we were undone by Cubillas and Peru. But it was striking how the rest of the country seemed to want Scotland to do well in Argentina, in contrast to those blokes who head to the pub wearing the football shirts of countries they can’t locate on a map when England play.In  I was playing for Preston Grasshoppers when the Grand Slam was won, where Wade Dooley was still learning his trade and couldn’t know he’d experience what it was like to lose to Scotland in a title decider six years later. That day I turned out for Furness RUFC from Barrow, the only Scot in a packed clubhouse where afterwards everyone patted my back and shook my hand asI’d actually been playing at Murrayfield. This morning I’ll be texting a couple of my team-mates from that day.A gun to Zeffirelli’s headYears living in England, playing rugby union and covering professional rugby league has made me feel as much part of their game as ours. The rest of the house is solidly behind England too, but at least my we can justy her support on account of actually being English. So the rest of the gang can claim red and white blood, but even so my hockey-playing daughterstill gets asked by some team-mates how she can support “them” when “we’ll never hear the end of it”. Well we never tire of Archie Gemmill’s goal or  and I’ll never forget Twickenham .There will of course be those who will say that it’s only to be expected from a Conservative, and a lot worse, although there are plenty of our persuasion who are in the Anyone-but-England camp. But I’ve never seen the need to wallow in every set-back suffered by English teams to demonstrate pride in my heritage and culture or the dferences between us, and I’m as quick as the next Scot when abroad to correct anyone who thinks I’m from where. Like the woman in Arizona who saw me in a kilt and askedI was Irish.I am reminded of the story told by Italian film director Franco Zeffirelli when he was a partisan fighter during the War. Trapped between Allied and German forces he gave himself up to what he hoped were friendly troops. “English ” he called, and thought his le was over when a soldier shouted back “No” in a guttural tone he didn’t recognise and put a gun near his head. The soldier hissed, “We’re f***ing Scottish.”Seven ministers in seven yearsTalking of culture, seven ministers in seven years is not a musical based on government departments, but it should be at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, where this week Nicky Morgan announced she will be the latest Secretary of State to depart since Jeremy Hunt’s elevation to health in .For us in the news business, it’s a key appointment, but no sooner had the industry got to know what Maria Miller, Sajid Javid, John Whittingdale, Karen Bradley, Matt Hancock and Jeremy Wright were all about, than it was usually time to move on.Ms Morgan has only been in the job three months, not even enough time to pop into the News Media Association offices for a spot of lunch. Nowhere will her departure be more keenly felt than amongst the senior civil servants she leaves behind who have seen them all come and go but in such a short space of time were thoroughly impressed by the speed with which she mastered complex issues and her ability to absorb a brief instantly.If Ruth Davidson can be offered £k for two days work a month, the ex-education secretary and treasury select committee chair won’t be short of offers.Edinburgh Christmas market: Treatment of memorial benches a disgraceAsthe mesh of steel currently spreading across Princes Street Gardens wasn’t shocking enough, the pictures circulated on social media of memorial benches carelessly heaped up in a corner by construction workers like an abandoned game of Jenga symbolised an equal lack of concern behind Edinburgh council’s decision to let it happen.It would be going too far to say the council officers who allowed the Christmas Market operator Underbelly to proceed with their scheme without submitting a planning application couldn’t care less about the benches, but the evidence strongly suggests they didn’t care enough to make sure it didn’t happen.Administration councillors were quick to respond on Twitter to tell the public how terrible it was, that immediate action would be taken, that it shouldn’t have happened, but the fact is it did.At every meeting of Edinburgh council, we on the Conservative seats listen to one SNP councillor after another boasting about the fantastic job they are doing to protect the city centre, but on this occasion they are responsible for the despoliation one of Edinburgh’s most treasured places.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"tory candidate francesca o brien urged to step down after saying benefits street cast need putting down","story":"The Tories are facing calls to remove a candidate in a key marginal seat who wrote on Facebook that people on reality television show Benefits Street need \"putting down\".Francesca OBrien, who was selected in the South Wales constituency of Gower, apologised on Sunday for the series of inflammatory remarks on social media.Labour said Boris Johnson must remove her as a candidate over the \"absolutely disgusting\" since-deleted remarks from January , which were reported by the .Of the Channel  programme highlighting the lives of welfare recipients, Ms OBrien wrote: \"Benefit Street..anyone  watching this   Wow, these people are unreal!!!\"Replying to a friends comment, she added: \"My blood is boiling, these people need putting down.\" -

It also has the support of Burra History Group for the Burra Noost Project and is partnering with Bressay History Group to support their recording of Bressay noosts this summer.Costs such as the website, room hire, resources for free school visits and insurance have so far been financed by the directors. Money is slowly trickling in via donations, sponsorship, and profits from workshop ticket sales. The next workshop is being held in Unst on Saturday st June.The first step of applying to the National Lottery Heritage Fund has been successful, allowing Moder Dy – named after the dialect phrase for the mother wave – to apply for a pot of £, to run the Burra Noost Project.However, at least £, needs to be raised to match this grant funding.

I do think the government has to recognise the costs up here.#Ms Henderson described food bank usage as #shocking in this day and age#, and highlighted the Trussel Trust – the organisation behind the food bank – which had data on who is accessing the service.#Once you#ve got clearer information on the problem you can look at ways of dealing with it.#She described as #a sin# that perfectly good food was being thrown out by supermarkets just because it was at or near its sell-by date.Mr Robinson said the government#s roll-out of the universal credit was at the #root cause# of the problem.#It#s been an absolute shambles. How they expected folk could go for weeks without any money at all, just with the the promise it would be sorted out, I think is disgraceful.#He said the much-maligned #bedroom tax# had also been a contributing factor, and added it was important for people both in public and private sectors to have a fair living wage.Ms Valente said she had been shocked by the numbers of people who needed to use the food bank but were too ashamed of their poverty.#The cost of housing is one of the things I find quite shocking,# she said, adding that people needed to #earn a huge amount of money# to put a roof over their heads.She was also #appalled# by universal credit, and added it was wrong for society to #really target# or make people feel bad about being poor.Mr Wenger said people were encouraged to go to Citizens Advice Bureau, which could advise people on how to manage their finances.But Debra Nicolson, who stood as the Green candidate in the recent Holyrood campaign, pressed for more information on what candidates would doelected.Other questions were asked about the stigma attached to free school meals, and how it can be tackled.Ms Valente said responsibility lay with the government, but stressed the council needed to ensure social work staff and support services were fully prepared to help.Mr Robinson pointed to the -plus housing waiting list, and stressed affordable housing was key to solving the problem.Ms Henderson added there was an #antiquated rule# in the council that a percentage of the housing stock had to be kept free in case there was an emergency, and added she had argued that should be scrapped because #people need houses now#.Mr Flaws added there would always be a stigma until people are prepared to talk more openly about it.Mr Wenger said beating stigma, and preventing discrimination, needed to start at an early age. He added SSE had raised energy prices three times in one year, and stressed the issue should be picked up in the council.A former councillor, Iris Hawkins, wondered how well the candidates would adjust to #le in the goldfish bowl.#Mr Wenger said many people knew him already as a postman and as a tourist guide. He said he was a member of Transition Shetland.As a German, he said people had noticed his lack of Shetland dialect, although he admitted having problems with English accents, too.#The most problems I have with the English isI look down to the #sooth-moothers# at  Downing Street#.Ms Valente said being a councillor meant #you can#t win#, because pleasing one person would mean upsetting another.#You just have to do the best job that you can so you can sleep at night with a clean conscience.#You just have to do the best job that you can so you can sleep well at night with a clean conscience# FRANCIS VALENTEMr Robinson has #been there before#. He said the hardest thing was the impact being a councillor can have on elected members# families.#You do have to really know what you#re in for.#Mr Flaws said he had read the hardest part was putting yourself forward in the first place.#To actually make the decision and say #this is the time. It suits me now#. Once that#s done you just have to get on with it.#As for Ms Henderson, she stressed she would be #very happy# to be accountable from the start.#There will be no curtains in my goldfish bowl,# she said.The site of a new Gilbert Bain Hospital was then brought up by chairman Jim Anderson, with Mr Robinson – who chairs NHS Shetland – left feeling distinctly on the spot.#I think wherever the site is it needs to be somewhere that is close to,not within, Lerwick. That#s going to be one of the real challenges.#Mr Wenger had his eye across the Bressay Sound.#Build the fixed link to Bressay, and build the Gilbert Bain Hospital on Bressay,# he told Mr Anderson.Mr Flaws admitted there were few options on where the hospital could be built.#You have to be looking on the outskirts of Lerwick – the south road or the north road.#Ms Valente said there was no easy solution.#I suspect any decision to build the hospital is going to be  years down the road.#Ms Henderson said any consideration needed to be #future-proofed#. But she said she was prepared to look outside of the town for the solution.#If you#ve got really good shuttle links that would ease some of the congestion.

Where did the candidates stand on this in light of the climate emergency Mr Flaws said he believed that was why the council had not yet declared a climate emergency.#The council is going to have to update its carbon management plan and see how it is going to bring this forward.#The council needs to be more transparent on what their long-term thinking is.#Part of the discussion focused on the Viking Energy windfarm.Ms Henderson said it was dficult to address Sullom Voe #until they#ve said what they want to do#.She added she was #not a fan# of the inter-connector, and the Viking windfarm was #not a green scheme – it#s only green in the context of money#.Meanwhile, Mr Robinson said the council should declare a climate emergency #and not worry about the oil companies#.He said BP had a #huge solar arm# in its organisation, while Total also promoted its environmental credentials and the Danish Dong Energy had gone completely out of the oil and gas sector.#Without declaring the emergency I don#t think there#s any real impetus to do anything.#Without declaring the emergency I don#t think there#s any real impetus to do anything– GARY ROBINSONMr Wenger said Sullom Voe helped provide the UK with oil and gas.But he said attitudes were changing, particularly with a growth in electric car usage.#Electricity you can produce without burning fossil fuels is the best.#Ms Valente said it was impossible to get rid of fossil fuels #over night#, but stressed thinking had to start now.#Maybe Shetland can do without Sullom Voe but the economy of Britain still depends on that. We need to bring it down and work on other solutions.#But I think the council does need to declare a climate emergency.#Questions were also raised on ferry links to the mainland, with concerns voiced about the number of cabins and the freight constraints.Ms Valente said the boats were #not fit for purpose,# and added capacity for freight was #dreadful#.Mr Robinson said Shetland should be able to design a ferry to suit its own needs. He said the real problems with NorthLink vessels lay at constraints at Aberdeen Harbour, as well as regulations which limited where on a vessel cabins could be placed.#To my mind we really should have the power locally to resolve our own ferry service, so we can design something that works for us.#Mr Flaws said the ferries were commissioned roughly  years ago. He said it was dficult for his family of five to get away on the ferry.#They#re just not fit for purpose. We need to say what we need rather than be told what we should be using.#Discussion also focused on the bus service, with support for cheaper – or even,possible, free – buses being offered.Mr Flaws said it would be good to see more people using buses.#If it was cheaper or free then maybe more folk would be using it. If that was an incentive to get more folk on it, then that should be looked at,# although he acknowledged some bus times did not suit everybody.Ms Valente cited an occasion when she lived in Sandveien when the bus could get her to work just before am.#They they changed the service, so that actually you either had to get to work by half eight or half nine. It#s just ridiculous. I do not know how that happened.#Mr Wenger said e-buses – smaller units which can be called upon using an app – should be adopted. He added he had enjoyed a positive experience with an electric bike.Mr Robinson – a convert to the bike himself – said there was no easy answer on buses.#The last thing you want to do is run a bus with three folk on it when in actual fact that#s causing a bigger carbon footprint than a car with three folk in it.#He berated the absence of any buses in Shetland that ran on anything other than diesel. He cited Dundee, which had a number of electric taxis.Questions were raised about how a councillor might get things discussed with other members.Mr Robinson said climate change was something he would consider attempting to raise a notice of motion over – a measure which would ensure the topic is debated in the chamber.#That is one thing the council has failed to move on so far. I suspectyou were to canvas the councillors and ask them to sign it, you#d probably get half the councillors for a start. I fail to understand why they#ve not moved on it. It#s ridiculous.#Mr Flaws said an issue that kept coming back was that people had no idea what the council#s strategy was with sustainable energy.#It#s Viking Energy, or it#s nothing,# he said.Ms Valente said she wanted to ensure everyone#s house was insulated.#There are people living in houses that are cold. There are people who can not afford to do it and are choosing between putting the heating on and having something to eat.#Mr Wenger said council office buildings should be insulated, but Ms Henderson said it was important to deal with the issues constituents bring forward. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"prince charles receives a right royal welcome to the borders","story":"Photos of his visit to St Boswells are online here: https:www.thesouthernreporter news in-pictures-duke-of-rothesay-s-visit-to-mainstreet-trading-company--"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH1810NCA-crop.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 18th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

If Edinburgh and Skye do suffer from overtourism, what can we do about it  In a free country, we cannot stop people from coming here, evenwe wanted to.It should also be recognised that folk visit those two places for dferent reasons. Edinburgh is an architectural jewel which is at its most crowded during the annual festival. People come to Skye for the scenery — most notably in recent years to the Trotternish Ridge and the Fairy Pools, two undeniably beautul spots in an island which is full of other undeniably beautul spots.Edinburgh cannot be expected to cancel its festival, any more than we want to drain the Fairy Pools or blow up the Old Man of Storr.And we do not want to stop them coming. They bring money, which provides jobs and kickstarts enterprises and improves the island#s economic wellbeing even outside the realm of the local tourist industry.Professor John Lennonof Glasgow Caledonian University#s Moffat Centre is presently commissioned by another independent body, SkyeConnect, to carry out a major survey of the impact of tourism on Skye.Professor Lennon and his colleagues are not due to deliver their report until next spring. But he will offer a taste of its findings so far to the autumn conference of SkyeConnect next month.We look forward to both the sample and the full report. We can hazard a guess at some of its content.Skye has been #discovered# by the rest of the world, like a Caledonian Machu Picchu.Unlike the Peruvian Inca site, however, Skye is a very big island. Unlike Machu Picchu, it is not yet collapsing under the weight of its visitors# feet.Skye can — and Mark Crothall congratulated the Skyetime campaign for pointing this out — accommodate half a million visitors, and continue to benefit hugely from their spending, particularlycertain adjustments are made to the tourist itinerary.More people should be encouraged to spend a quiet and infinitely rewarding week in Elgol or Waternish, in all four seasons, than take a whistle-stop, bucket list summer tour of the Storr, the Fairy Pools and back to the bridge.And of course, local and national government should do much more to improve the basic infrastructure of the island, from roads and parking areas to public transport and public toilets.Skye has bucked the trend of the rest of the north-western Highlands and Islands by growing its population and its economy in recent years.That has chiefly been because of the tourist industry. After  years of steady and apparently irreversible decline, the growth quite naturally took everybody by surprise. We should now learn to adapt to it, rather than call it #overtourism# and hope that it goes away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH2510NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 25th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

Instead, it leads to the booze aisle in thelocal supermarket and to a drinking den out on the moor.In this, the maincharacter in Kevin MacNeil’s novel ‘The Stornoway Way’ is depicted as havingmuch in common with his fellow islanders, whether or not they absorb their localminister’s thunderous moralising. Theplay of the same name, which MacNeil also wrote, pulls no punches so far asdevastating social critique is concerned.There’s a lot in a name. RomanStornoway can be read as romance torn away. He is also R Stornoway. He is a religiouscuckoo in the nest and the key in a roman a clef. The character himselfacknowledges all this. As an everyman outsider, Mister S is meant tocommunicate a great deal about Lewis.Calvinism, alcohol and climatecombine in a pernicious cocktail that permeates people and place. Depression, repression and addiction are endemic.So are dreams of escape.If this is the desolate reality in which MacNeil’s characters are immersed, the play of the novel # staged by Dogstar Theatre at Sabhal Mor Ostaig last week # sugars the pill with scabrous wit, hilarious minor characters, and some truly moving songs, among them a traditional Gaelic lament rendered with crystalline clarity by Lewis-born actor Rachel Kennedy. It is a sublime moment where Roman reconnects with the culture he scorns. But the moment passes, and the song of loss and love is soon replaced with cynicism and tomorrow’s hangover.All good writing, whetherfor page or stage, interweaves the personal, the local and the universal. Roman’s war is with himself and with Lewishis dreams are of finding love and self-fulfilment. The universal arrives inthe shape of Eva, a Hungarian student who initially succumbs to Roman’s scatterguncharm, but who later comes to see him as self-obsessed and manipulative. Roman is certainly that. Heis also vulnerable, funny, and capable of great profundity.Self-fulfilment comesthrough music, and when Roman’s long-suffering best friend Eilidh organises asession for him in a recording studio in Edinburgh, the road to salvationopens. But Roman is a master at self-sabotage. Matters don’t quite go to plan.Naomi Stirrat as Roman,Rachel Kennedy as Eilidh and Chloe-Ann Tylor as Eva are all fine actors, and adeptat lively theatricality. As an ensemble,they tick like a Swiss watch, darting here and there without missing a beat. Andthey can’t half belt out a tune.

Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her.Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she did it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family.Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care.This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  .We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us.This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby.We decided to host Rubys Birthday Fundraiser last year and it was a huge success, raising an amazing pound,.

The event will also see launch of a groundbreaking new report that outlines a framework for community development.The paper, entitled ‘We Must Dissent’, is the result of a community survey that assessed the human rights of local residents against the major issues facing the area. Amongst the issues identied were concerns around road safety, housing, health, education, and unemployment.Another key issue was the pressures of commercial land speculation in the area, which has presented an obstacle to the community development of the Lanyon Tunnels.Despite planning permission and £.million being granted for the development, plans have been stalled by owners of an adjacent piece of land – which was subject to plans to build a £million office block.In , residents won a legal victory when the High Court ruled that planning approval for office block was unlawful. However, the potential for future plans to develop the land could impede access to the tunnelsgiven the go-ahead.Speaking ahead of next Wednesday’s event, Fionntán Hargey from the Market Development Association said the tunnels development would provide a “massive boost to people’s self esteem”.“It would physically reconnect them to city centre and it would also reconnect them into the economic, social and cultural le of Belfast. “The tunnels got planning permission in , and there is £. million in funding sitting there ready to go, and there are three groups of residents trained up and they’ve got business places developed. We also have updated drawings that have recently been commissioned. “The issue is that there is a private developer who is refusing to grant access to allow the project to go ahead.”He continued: “Next Wednesday will refresh people on the latest concept drawings and give people wider overview of the Redeveloping the Local Economy programme. Our aspiration is that by January we will be launching a report, and we will have several groups of residents with business ideas that are on course for development.” Next Wednesday’s event will take place at pm in the Market Community Centre where guest speaker, Dr Sean Byers, will discuss the economics of community empowerment. There will also be a full project update on the Lanyon Tunnels."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ballotbox_pr8qo2.png","title":"north set for december","story":"POLITICAL parties in the north have put their general election machines in gear after MPs voted for a December  poll.The legislation is expected to be approved by the end of the week when it goes through the House of Lords.

The people of the north did not consent to Brexit. “There is no good Brexit for Ireland. “Westminster is in chaos. It has no answers and no solutions.“The Brexit debacle has shown that Westminster cannot, has not and will never act in the interests of the people of the north. “Your interests in this election are best served by voting Sinn Féin for a dferent future by sending a clear message to the British government that we want control of our own future through a referendum on Irish unity.#Alliance Leader Naomi Long said her party is best-placed to unite Remain voices.“This election will be mainly focused around Brexit and Alliance has always been clear there is no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit,” she said.“Therefore it will be an opportunity for people to have their say and elect MPs who want to avoid a hard border, protect the Good Friday Agreement and attend Westminster to represent their interests. “We are uniquely placed to do that, as the Alliance surge seen in May’s local government and European Elections showed the party could reach across all sections of our community and gain support from everywhere.“We have been preparing for an election for some time, as it is clear this Parliament is hopelessly ided and the Government has no legitimacy.

Higgins.Mannus was born in Canada but moved with his Northern Irish family back to their homeland at the age of seven.At yesterdays final, the former Linfield and St Johnstone goalkeeper, who also had spells at Larne and Carrick Rangers, ended up as one of Shamrock Rovers heroes.He saved a penalty in a shootout after the  minutes of normal and extra time ended in a - stalemate against the League of Ireland champions.Rovers won the shootout - and Mannus was immediately surrounded by his team-mates as they recorded their first FAI Cup win for  years in front of over , fans.One of his Rovers colleagues, Ronan Finn, hailed Mannus as the \"best goalkeeper in Ireland\".However, on social media Mannus - who brought a young child onto the pitch after the game to join in the celebrations - was subjected to a torrent of abuse over the Irish anthem issue.One condemned Mannus for failing to respect the anthem, adding that he \"doesnt have to sing but respect costs nothing\".Some of the attacks descended into sectarian abuse.Others said Mannus was one of our own and some defended the goalie, who has been capped nine times for Northern Ireland, insisting he was well within his rights to do whatever he wanted during the playing of the anthem.Several compared his approach to that of Londonderry-born Republic of Ireland international James McClean, who is subjected to regular criticism over his refusal to wear a poppy on his shirt at games in the Premier League in England.One poster said: \"The same people slaughtering Alan Mannus are the same people who do be up in arms when James McClean gets hate for standing up for his beliefs.\"Eleven years ago a Northern Ireland under- international was caught up in a similar controversy over the national anthem before an FAI Cup Final, where he was playing for Derry City against Bohemians.Sammy Morrow did not turn with other players to face the Irish flag, but he later said that he stood up straight with his head up to show his respect. He said he was disappointed and disheartened by the criticism levelled at him.There was also controversy over the pre-match ritual in the  Irish Cup final.Cltonville FC players appeared to bow their heads during the playing of God Save the Queen before their - defeat against Coleraine.Cltonville officials had requested that the song not be played before the game at Windsor Park."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/7857c/BINARY/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Last month Kevin Lunney was abducted by a gang near his home in Fermanagh and badly beaten before being left at the roadside with severe injuries.A former Fine Gael councillor, Mr McCartin said the intimidation is clearly aimed at causing enough chaos that US investors will accept the firm cannot be managed and hand back control to its founder and former owner, Sean Quinn. Mr Quinn has repeatedly denied any involvement in the threats and repeatedly condemned the ongoing intimidation and act of violence against Kevin Lunney.Mr McCartin told the Irish Mail on Sunday that the owners have been crystal clear they would rather close operations than hand them back to Mr Quinn. \"If the point of this campaign is to prove that only Sean Quinn can operate these businesses, the worst-case scenario is that these guys manage to prove that.

Their research examined the impact of reforms introduced in Northern Ireland since  through to everything planned until . It also analyses the value of the mitigations package agreed by the Stormont Executive, which is due to expire in March. In September the Northern Ireland Affairs and Work and Pensions Committees published a joint report calling on Secretary of State Julian Smith to commit to legislation which will extend the social security mitigations package here.Welfare mitigations, introduced to soften the impact of UK-wide welfare reforms like the bedroom tax in Northern Ireland, were introduced in .The committees warned that unless Mr Smith takes urgent action, tens of thousands of households in Northern Ireland would see their incomes suddenly fall, some by hundreds of pounds per month.They said that Northern Irelands special circumstances means the region would be disproportionately impacted by UK-wide welfare policies like the bedroom tax, which reduces the housing benefit entitlement of working-age tenantsthey live in housing deemed to be too large for their needs.The NIHRC reports authors set out the impact of reforms on dferent income groups by household composition, including lone parents and other families, by age, gender and disability. The impacts are especially dramatic for lone parents, who have lost around £, on average per year, while households with at least one disabled child experience annual average losses of around £,.The report also finds that households with three or more children experience overall average losses of around £, per year - in comparison to average losses of £ for households with one child. Women are worse affected than men because they are more likely to be receiving tax credits and other social security benefits. Chief Commissioner Les Allamby said the research demonstrates those with the broadest backs are not bearing the heaviest load. \"We need a tax and social security system which provides help where most needed - for those on low incomes,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"alliance chief long calls on voters to change minds over lame donkey eu deal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Its a considerable concession, as she may have had an interest in standing in the constituency herself.\"In the past the DUP and UUP have formed electoral pacts in closely fought constituencies, such as North Belfast and Fermanagh-South Tyrone to avoid splitting the unionist vote.In an interview in this newspaper on October  Mr Aiken had said \"there will be no pacts with the DUP under my leadership\", and said the UUP would run in all  constituencies.However, it sparked a row within unionism, including criticism from within the UUP amid fears it would jeopardise Mr Dodds chances of retaking the North Belfast seat.On Thursday this newspaper revealed that  unionists in the North Belfast constituency had written a joint letter urging Mr Aiken to rethink his plans.And the next day it emerged police were investigating threats against UUP staff members.In a -word statement yesterday, Mr Aiken said: \"In a modern democracy no one should have to face threats, intimidation or coercion of any sort because of their involvement in the democratic process.\"It is appalling and totally reprehensible and should have no place in Northern Ireland in the st century.\"Mr Aiken said, as Ulster Unionists, it is their role to \"protect and promote the Union\" and vital Northern Ireland MPs take their seats in Westminster.He added: \"In the face of Boris Johnsons terrible deal which forces Northern Ireland towards the edge of the Union, we cannot gt a seat to Sinn Fein who support this direction either in North Belfast or Fermanagh and South Tyrone.\"In Fermanagh-South Tyrone, Michelle Gildernew has an -vote majority.Mr Elliott had been expected to be the partys unanimous choice, but when contacted by the Belfastyesterday, he refused to confirmhe plans toto front line politics.\"There is a selection meeting taking place this week and I am considering the situation,\" he said.On Saturday Mrs Foster said she believes in unionist co-operation and parties working together to maximise representation.Mrs Foster said: \"Despite the DUP being the largest unionist party in the constituency, it is right to put wider interest ahead of narrow party politics and indicate our support for Tom Elliott to retake this seat.\"What the UUP man said yesterday ...“The outcome of the forthcoming Westminster elections will impact on Northern Ireland more than any other part of the United Kingdomplans for a border in the Irish Sea are implemented.“DUP responsibility in this debacle cannot be whitewashed away. It was their acceptance of a regulatory border in the Irish Sea on the nd October, vigorously opposed by the Ulster Unionist Party, which opened the floodgates for Boris Johnson and his dreadful deal. The Union itself is now in a precarious position not in spite of the DUP’s stance but because of the DUP’s actions.“We have been in discussions with senior political and community figures across North Belfast. In doing so we listened respectfully to all views expressed, including deeply held concerns that they will be unrepresented in Westminster in the critical months ahead.“This has been done in the context of threats and intimidation against Ulster Unionist Party staff and members. In a modern democracy no one should have to face threats, intimidation or coercion of any sort because of their involvement in the democratic process. It is appalling and totally reprehensible and should have no place in Northern Ireland in the st century.“As Ulster Unionists it is our role to protect and promote the Union. Therefore it is absolutely vital that MPs are ed who will take their seats and be able to influence the future direction of our nation.“We are a party that believes first and foremost in the Union, and secondly in the importance of representative democracy. Therefore we have decided not to nominate a candidate in North Belfast in the forthcoming election. The DUP recognise that they cannot win North Belfast on their own, despite having dismissed the opinions of other unionists in the past. They cannot expect to continue on that basis and must now realise they need Ulster Unionist voices at Westminster.“The choice in North Belfast is between Nigel Dodds as MP or an abstentionist MP who refuses to stand in Westminster to talk about health, education, justice, international affairs, or the future direction of the United Kingdom. In the face of Boris Johnson’s terrible deal which forces Northern Ireland towards the edge of the Union, we cannot gt a seat to Sinn Fein who support this direction either in North Belfast or Fermanagh and South Tyrone.“It is better to elect Nigel Dodds in North Belfast and hold him to account for his promises on the Union than facilitate the election of an abstentionist Sinn Fein MP who still cannot condemn IRA violence. We acknowledge that this decision will be welcomed by some and will disappoint others, but we believe it is in the best interests of our country and the Union.”What he said in Belfaston October  ...“The UUP will be contesting every seat in the general election. We will be aiming to win back Fermanagh and South Tyrone from Sinn Fein and South Antrim from the DUP. There will be no pacts with the DUP under my leadership.”"},{"url":null,"title":"general election foster says dup wont contest fermanagh and south tyrone would support uups tom elliott","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A similar request had been lodged ahead of the Presidents inauguration last November.The news follows a row over the removal of images of the Queen at Stormont House in Belfast earlier this year.At the time Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he was \"not offended\" by such royal tributes hanging in the castle.An internal memo within the OPW, seen by the Sunday Times, said the regal portraits were to be removed from Dublin Castle by Monday September , one day before Mr Higgins was due to make a speech marking the centenary of the International Labour Organisation.Six viceregal portraits from the Battleaxe landing were removed and rehung in the portrait gallery of Dublin Castle, while four large portraits of the British monarchs were relocated out of sight to the Gothic Room.Less than a week before Mr Higgins inauguration for his second term in , another memo stated: \"George and Charlotte have been taken down and temporarily stored in the Miverna Room.\" These were replaced with images of Eamon de Valera and Michael Collins.In July there was controversy when a portrait of the Queen was removed and later reinstated at the Northern Ireland Office in Belfast. It was removed from the public area of Stormont House amid claims in the House of Lords that a civil servant received £, in compensation after complaining that they were offended by having to walk past pictures of the monarch.Secretary of State Julian Smith intervened and ordered a review of the issue, with the image later ed to display in the public area.Speaking on the matter in August, Mr Varadkar was clear that he wasnt offended by portraits of British monarchs hanging in Dublin Castle. He stated at the time: \"Its not one for me to make any decisions on.

They called on their peers to jointhe programme.Bloc Blinds in Magherafelt is one of those companies. Mark Wilson, IT Director with the town centre business, said: “Since our establishment only eight years ago, Bloc Blinds has become a leading employer in Mid Ulster. Our technology underpins our success. We are pleased to be a founding member of this Career Encode initiative to develop and nurture the talent we need to continue to grow.”Alan Davis from Magherafelt, who secured a Career Encode apprenticeship with Bloc Blinds, praised the scheme.Hed said “I found Career Encode to be a better alternative to university as it gives the ability to learn and work in a real workplace.”FP McCann was another high profile company involved with the apprenticeship scheme.The Knockcloughrim-based companys IT Manager Brian Law said: “FP McCann is one of the largest employers in the mid Ulster region. Our bespoke IT infrastructure and software is critical to the sustainability of our enterprise.“We were so impressed with the high calibre of the applicants that we offered two apprenticeships as opposed to one. We are looking forward to continuing our investment in a skilled IT team with the Career Encode initiative and would strongly recommend it to any business that is experiencing dficulties in recruiting staff with technology skills.”Ronan Rafferty from Dungiven secured a Career Encode apprenticeship with FP McCann.Ronana said: “I was very interested in the ability to earn money whilst getting experience within the working environment.”Working in collaboration with Northern Regional College, the schemehas already appointed  newIT apprentices who will build careers within a rapidly growing sector, which, according to the Skills Barometer Report , compiled by Ulster University Economic Policy Centre, will grow by % over the next decade.With this in mind Career Encode is seeking more Northern Ireland businesses to sign up to the scheme to ensure the IT talent resource here is not outpaced by demand.Camilla Long, Director of Bespoke Communications, which specialises in training and leadership development, is acting as an independent facilitator for theexisting  employers on the scheme.She said: “One of the biggest hurdles for businesses today is sourcing staff, particularly IT staff. This scheme allows participating companies to take the IT skills gap into their own hands by developing a future workforce for their business.“We had a phenomenal response to the first initiative with  young people of exceptionally high standards vying for  apprenticeships. We anticipate that the demand for next year’s intake will be so much higher.“The benefits for participating companies are about much more than alleviating technology staffing needs. Being part of Career Encode sends out a message to the next generation that you provide a workplace with a positive working culture that nurtures long-term career goals all while allowing you to develop employees with the skillset that you need for your future.”For further information log ontowww.careerencode googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A gun battle was raging between the military and paramilitary. He was an unwilling, innocent spectator. This personal experience, in Belfast’s Ballymurphy, was a snapshot of a society bereft of civil rights and constantly consumed with relentless violence. His interview with former Deputy First Minister, the SDLP’s Seamus Mallon, perfectly encapsulates both the tragedies of ‘The Troubles’ and the hopes for a better future. In ‘Born to Lead’ Seamus narrates a comprehensive overview of the historical triumphs of two ‘half parish’ GAA clubs – Slaughtneil, one of the greatest all-round clubs the Association has ever seen and the mighty men of Mullinalaghta, the outstanding  Leinster Senior football club champions. googletag.cmd.push This book is essentially a cameo of seventy years of Irish social, political and cultural le. It ranges from the showband era of the ’s to the splendid contribution of two present day Country music stars. Their current status emphasises the inherent value of “singing the songs of the people for the people”. Likewise, the y careers of two recently retired GAA players illustrate the importance of total dedication towards achieving personal goals. The author examines the mind set of some of his fellow alumni of St. Patrick’s College, Armagh. Insightful profiles of the legendary scoring exploits of Hogan Cup winner, Iggy Jones, and the versatility of Horslips’ Barry Devlin, are a microcosm of twelve, other gted SPCA luminaries who are also featured. All of them help immensely to make this superb book a wonderful and enjoyable read. Seamus will be launching Born to Lead in Slaughtneil Hall on Saturday, November ,  at .pm. The event is open to all and everyone is welcome.

There was controversy in the final seconds when Feargal Higgins looked to have grabbed victory for Dungiven.  His kick, which appeared to curl inside the post, was ruled out.After the final whistle there were unsavoury scenes, lasting a minute, involving players and subs from both teams. Once order was restored, management and officials from both clubs entered discussions with referee Gavin Hegarty and a decision not to play extra-time was agreed. The game was played in incessant rain and both teams deserve credit for their endeavour over the hour.Ballinascreen played with Reece McSorley as a sweeper. Dungiven counteracted by putting Odhraacuten McKeever on Noel Rafferty, leaving Sean McKeever free at the other end.Early points from Pauric McNicholl, Feargal and Cahir Higgins had Dungiven - to - ahead after seven minutes. googletag.cmd.push A run from midfield by Marty Bradley split the Dungiven defence, before Jon Paul Devlin slotted ‘Screen’s first score of the game. When Conal Logan turned over possession in the face of Dungiven’s defensive wall, Sean McKeever broke at pace, leading to a second point for Cahir Higgins. An outside of the boot Niall Doyle point gave ‘Screen some brief respite but Fergal and Cahir Higgins, the latter from a free, opened a four point lead. Odhraacuten and Daire McKeever combined for Sean to surge forward and open a - to - lead after  minutes. Just when they were threatening to fade out of the game, Ballinascreen found the net. Caoilte McAlinden had the bravery to flick over the final Dungiven defender and when he rushed on the loose ball, he had the composure to slot an inch-perfect shot across ‘keeper Hasson to the far corner of the net. Marty Bradley added a fisted point after a Ronan McKenna run from deep but it was Dungiven who finished stronger. Hasson’s short kick-out found Eoin McKeever, who built a move up the right wing before Daire slotted between the posts.Feargal Higgins passed to and took apass from Conor Kelly to kick between the posts, putting them - to - ahead at the break. The third quarter became a non-event, with a series of failed attacks as both teams carried possession into the tackle.In the rd minute Aaron McBride began a move up-field that led to Emmet Duggan being dragged to the ground by Sean McKeever.  No card was brandished but when Devlin’s penalty hit the bar, he pounced on the rebound to force over the line and level the game. Darragh McGilligan began to come into the game and he started a move that led to a Conor Kelly score from the wing, after Cahir and Feargal Higgins both kept their composure.  McGilligan doubled Dungiven’s lead but Michael O’Kane’s men played second fiddle for the rest of the game. With seven minutes to go, Cathal Donnelly turned over a move from the Dungiven defence before being dragged to the ground by Thomas McClarey but astonishingly no black card was shown, with Donnelly correctly later seeing black for a cynical foul.Devlin tapped over the free and with Ballinascreen in control, a draw looked a likely outcome. Goalkeeper Ryan Scullion scuffed a th shot to the left of the posts but made up for it with pressure kick in injury time to draw the game. Dungiven will have to plan without Conor Kelly for the replay, after he was dismissed on a straight red card, late in the game.

Three seasons ago, Kilrea went all the way to an Ulster Final at St Paul’s only to be beaten by Burren at St Paul’s. There was torrential rain from start to finish but Quigg opened the scoring with a goal after linking up with Daithi McLaughlin to beat ‘keeper Caolan Convery at the near post. It was point for point for the rest of the half. Quigg, Gearoid and Daithi McLaughlin were on target for the Pearses.

The companies travelling from Derry and Strabane are O’Neill’s International Sportswear, Humanity Cosmetics, Learning Pool and Visual Edge while EKO Chute, MMG Welding and Wild Fuschia Bakery from Donegal will also be taking part. The trade and iInvestment mission will be led by Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Councils and will include third level and further education providers and development organisations including the Ulster University, Letterkenny Institute of Technology, the North West Regional College, Donegal ETB and Catalyst. The mission will run from  to  November. It will build on the strong political, economic and cultural linkages already established in Boston and Philadelphia with the North West City region and will be an opportunity to further reach out to the Irish diaspora.  Speaking ahead of the visit and welcoming the confirmation of the seven local companies, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr Michaela Boyle, said the visit was particularly timely for the companies and partners to promote the North West city region’s unique strategic cross border location. She said: “This trade mission is a real opportunity for us to focus on our strengths in terms of location, talent and skills and support. It is our chance to really sell our location to the business community in the US, by educating them to the fact that post Brexit they can locate in our region and access both the North of Ireland and the EU. We will be very positive in our approach to emphasise to potential investors the strong selling points we have in terms of our location, our talented skills base, our cultural compatibility and quality of le, During the visit the participating businesses will meet with key contacts, explore and understand opportunities in the US market, develop in-market networks and develop relationships with potential customers. The civic delegation will engage with industry influencers and leaders, meet with Philadelphia Council and attend a Philadelphia Diaspora event. While in Boston they will visit the Irish Immigration Centre, meet State representatives at the State House and attend the official launch of the Hard GSD Visit Atlas for a City Region project as well as engaging with senior business executives. In addition to attending bespoke business to business meetings and engaging with potential investors and business connections, the delegation will attend a reception hosted by the Irish Consulate in Boston and be guests at the Golden Bridges Conference. Last year, Joule, a locally based fire engineering consultancy business, was one of a number of companies that took part in the trade mission. The company’s founding director John McColgan said he trade visit was a fantastic opportunity to look at new markets in the United States and his company’s participation was a very positive experience. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The place the Germans had chosen for this stand was Monte Cassino, surmounted by the famous and ancient Benedictine Abbey, and it was here that four fierce and gruelling battles were fought out between the Allies and one of the best forces at fighting defensive actions in the history of warfare – the German Army in the Second World War.Ballinascreen Historical Society’s next monthly meeting will be addressed by one of the leading military historians in the UK and Ireland, writer and broadcaster Richard Doherty. Richard has around  books to his credit and over the years he has researched, written and presented several historical series for BBC Radio Ulster and presented two major historical programmes for BBC TV. He has featured twice in the popular “Who Do You Think You Are ” television series, providing historical background for the guests.Richard has addressed a wide iety of audiences in the UK, Republic of Ireland, France, Italy and USA. Since  he has been a guest speaker on cruise ships and he also leads battlefield tours in Ireland, Italy, Normandy and Greece. It will certainly be a major coup for the Society to attract such an eminent speaker and while, strictly speaking, it is not “local” history we can confidently predict that many local connections will be emphasised.The talk, which is open to everyone, will be held in  High Street – the room beside Draperstown Library - at pm on Tuesday, November . Light refreshments will be provided. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The event aimed to look at the issues affecting Atlantic Salmon in the freshwater and marine environment, with particular focus on the salmon of the Foyle system. The conference was well attended by members of the angling community interest- ed to hear the latest updates and research developments.  Opening the conference, Loughs Agency chief executive officer, Sharon McMahon, explained that “globally salmon numbers are in decline and we must work collectively to ensure the survival of this iconic fish in the cross border catchments of Foyle and Carlingford areas’. Speakers, who included Professor Ken Whelan, Dr Cathal Gallagher and Dr Robert Rosell, took the audience through the scientic journey of the salmon and echoed the stark warning that scientists, anglers and government agencies need to work together to protect the Atlantic salmon. Dr Diego Del Villar also presented to the large crowd on the SeaMonitor project.  SeaMonitor is a unique marine research project, the first of its kind in Europe, studying the seas around Ireland, Western Scotland and Northern Ireland. It will deliver Europe’s largest telemetric marine array and spatial models, supporting the conservation of several species including Atlantic salmon and will ultimately produce a Salmon Manage ment Plan for the River Foyle.The Loughs Agency will shortly be launching a public consultation to capture the views of the public in managing the salmon fishery. John McCartney, director of conservation andprotection, said: “We value the input and opinion of the public when reviewing our salmon management programme. I would encourage everyone take time to consider and respond to the questions’.Speaking after the conference, Francis Curran, chairperson of FASTA, said: ‘I’d like to thank the Loughs Agency and the professional speakers for providing an interesting forum on the challenges that the angling community face in terms of conservation of our Foyle system. We recognise that there are many drivers that are feeding into the problem but that anglers are up for working in partnership with the relevant government agencies, fishing clubs, private fisheries and the angling community North and South.”Mr Curran concluded: “We endorse the consultation process that will be rolled out by the Loughs Agency which will help inform decision makers as we move forward into this dficult period.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I am keen to see this Council deliver a benefit from this site to the Waterside community rather than the closed down eyesore it has become.“I have raised this issue with senior Council officials and welcome their response that the future of the site is being progressed.”Cllr Reilly concluded: “I look forward to receiving a more detailed brief from them at committee before the end of the year.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Described by her art teacher, Karen Torley, as someone who ‘paints mainly in acrylics and watercolours but over the last year has grown so much as an artist both in ability and confidence,’ and testament to this is shown by her large Facebook following and the great support she receives from all over the country.“I love painting because it makes me happy and gives me confidence,’ said Tori, as she relaxes in the comfort of her Waterside home among a number of paintings she recently finished for the exhibition,” said Tori.‘I called the exhibition ‘True Colours’ because I like bright colours and love the song since I heard it when it was being used for Autism Awareness.’Looking forward to her daughter’s upcoming exhibitions, mum, Dara, said she has seen Tori change for the better since taking up art. “There has been so many positive benefits since Tori has started to paint and we are so glad that she has found what she truly loves doing. We are all very proud of her,” she said.The budding young artist has many strings to her bow and presently has a work placement once a week in an office under the guidance of Habinteg Housing and is supported by Mencap. The young Waterside woman is also a keen photographer in her spare time.Tori is also been supported by the Foyle Down Syndrome Trust where she presently learns printing skills under their social enterprise programme and she put these skills to good use recently by printing her own posters and invites for the upcoming exhibitions. But it’s art that is still her first love and its where she’s directing all her energy to become and make a career of being a professional artist.Karen Torley, Banyan Theatre and Tori’s art tutor agrees. “Since I started working with Tori three years ago she has grown so much in her talents and confidence. We work together weekly on new paintings but have daily discussions on art and new ideas. Watching her development as an artist gives me so much joy, she is the highlight of my week.”Hoping for a great turnout at the two events, Tori’s mum Dara added: ‘All any parent wants for their children is for them to be happy and she is so happy when she is painting.’Tori’s exhibitions will take place at the Waterside Theatre from Friday, th November and the second will start at the Garden of Reflection on Monday, th November. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Only joking, nobody really cares about the Northern Ireland Music Prize unless you’re from Belfast or are nominated. This year Arvo arty with “II”, Beauty Sleep’s “Be Kind”, Blue Whale’s “Process”, Pat Dam Smyth’s “The Last King”, Cormac Neeson’s “White Feather”, Runabay’s “Between The Lines”, Sam Wicken’s “All I’ve Seen” and Two Door Cinema Club’s “False Alarm” represent Belfast, Down, Bangor, etc. Then Soak’s “Grim Town”, Ryan Vail and Elma Orkestra’s “Borders”, Conor Mason’s “On The Surface” and half of Saint Sister’s “Shape Of Silence” fly the flag for Derry. The album of the year is voted for by people whose very reason for living is the music that seeps out of this tiny wee place.I don’t think anyone could have escaped the hard work of Ryan Vail  Elma Orkestra this past year, they’ve been everywhere, Paris, Mexico, TV, Cool Discs, and up and down the countrywith their incredible live show featuring lasers screens and smoke machines. I’ve seen it a couple of times in Derry and had the record at the first available opportunity and, in my opinion, is album of the year. That’s not to say Conor Mason’s On The Surface isn’t an absolute clinker too, the follow up to ’s Standstill is as beautul as an album can possibly get.To make it more like a real awards ceremony they’ve added more categories including Best Single, Best Live Act and the Oh Yeah Contender award, because the Oh Yeah Centre has it’s fingers not only on the pulse but in the very beating heart of the Northern Ireland music scene. In a daring turn of events these three awards are voted for by the public so really, there’s no complaining about the outcome. Amy Montgomery, Brand New Friend, Bui, Documenta, Hand Models, Jealous Of The Birds, Joshua Burnside, Junk Drawer, Kitt Phillippa…twice inexplicably, New Pagans and Roe are all up for the single of the year award andyou’re wondering….that eerie feeling is deacutejagrave vu.Singles are the calling card for bands these days, they’re what makes a band last in your memory and it makes the shortlist all the tighter, Amy Montgomery, Documenta, Jealous Of The Birds, Junk Drawer, New Pagans and ROE all last long in the memory but for me New Pagans clinch it. It’s Darker really is a clinker.The best live act is voted for by the public and should arguably the most interesting award of the night will be fought out between Jordan Adentunji, Joshua Burnside, New Pagans, Ryan Vail  Elma Orkestra and Sister Ghost. A tough call to be fair when you witness New Pagans and Ryan Vail and Elma Orkestra and Sister Ghost live, probably because I’ve promoted the three of them and love them all. googletag.cmd.push But objectively, go see Ryan Vail  Elma Orkestra and don’t get blown away, I dare you. It really is the most professional and dazzling show out there, coupled with great musicThe Oh Yeah Centre suggests you vote for Cherym again or Amy Montgomery, Joel Harkin, Jordan Adentunji, Problem Patterns and Strange New Places for the Oh Yeah Contender award. We should be supporting our own here and giving Cherym the nod, but I can’t help but feel that having two bites of that cherry is a little unfair. Amy Montgomery managed to sell out of her entire stock at last year’s Stendhal festival after a really short set and her music is a thing of beauty, not to mention Joel Harkin’s whirlwindesque self- promotion and Problem Patterns doing for feminism in this village what Jacob Rees Mogg does for blood pressure in this village. It really is the most exciting award in my opinion.

New projects this year included social prescribing mdash helping people who present to their local GP to get out and about in their local area.New investment in multi-disciplinary teams in GP practices in Down was now being rolled out to the rest of Newry and Mourne. He said the Network was central to that roll-out and CDRCNrsquos experience of social prescribing made the organisation a great source of referrals to local community activities.Cllr Casey said CDRCN along with Community Advice and other umbrella support organisations were key to the delivery of Council services. He was grateful to the Network and especially to the hundreds of groups and thousands of volunteers who work away, day and night with no financial reward to make sure this area is a safe, pleasant and prosperous place to live, work and play.Alan Dumigan, CDRCN chairman, thanked the outgoing management committee for their time and expertise in bringing the Network forward.He acknowledged Board member Doris Noe, of Lecale Conservation, who, he said, had contributed her time, energy and expertise over the last number of years to the organisation and he wished her well in her retirement from the board.He thanked the community groups for their ongoing support and the management and staff for their continued commitment.The guest speaker, Dr Chris Leggett, recalled his long association with the community network and the exciting new developments. He acknowledged the importance of projects tackling social isolation and poverty and the need to address mental health and suicide in our local area.Nicholas McCrickard, CDRCN manager, presented the work of the organisation and reported that an increasing range of activities and projects were delivered to a high standard.He thanked the board and staff for a ldquofabulous year and acknowledged that the community and voluntary sector from Bangor to Crossmaglen was a thriving and creative place which was tackling issues relating to health, the economy, the environment and more.ldquoWorking together with the local Councils and Government departments is key to our success, he said. ldquoOur communities have a powerful voice coupled with large numbers of willing volunteers and we have risen to the challenge of tackling mental and physical health problems.The evening concluded with a talk from local photographer Raphael Mason on how photography can impact on peoplersquos physical and mental wellbeing.

We are being terrorised in our homes and our property is being damaged.Mrs Smyth said it was almost impossible to report incidents to the police.ldquoIf we can get through the police often donrsquot respond, she continued. ldquoThese temporary gates have been being put up for almost two years now. Torn down and put up again. Itrsquos the residents who suffer, not the council people for delays in signing off on the workthat needs to be done.The residents are being supported by local Independent councillor Cadogan Enright, who accused the council of being ldquonot exactly on top of their game.He said: ldquoThe need for fences and gates to make the area into a cul-de-sacs was triggered by an emergency situation where pensioners were and still are under siege by a small number of nersquoer-do-wells, culminating with the actual burning down of a pensionerrsquos cottage.ldquoThe council have not been treating this as an emergency.

We will eventually cover all old estates, subject to continuing funds and satisfactory contracts.Movements have already been made with the awarding of a number of pre-paint repair contracts and work on all contracts should begin by March or April next year.More programmes of maintenance work are being prepared and will be starting in the - financial year, subject to the approval of the Executiversquos Board.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Uncertainty has surrounded the recent proposals to establish units for educationally sub-normal pupils at Castlewellan.The South Eastern Education and Library Board give approval in January for two new units to be set up at the local controlled primary school.However, plans were revised when the neighbouring school, St Malachyrsquos Primary, decided it wanted to have special ESN units.Board officers decided thatan ESN unit is established at St Malachyrsquos the demand for ESN facilities at Castlewellan Primary mightand therefore only one unit might be necessary at each school.But confusion arose when the Board placed advertisements in a local newspaper about the plans to establish the units.Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, was unsure about whether or not the Board had changed its policy and was intended to establish the units at St Malachyrsquos instead of at the controlled school.Mrs Smyth, who has raised the matter on several occasions, told Board members, this week that she was aggrieved about the whole affair and thought that Board officers had acted in a ldquovery surreptitious manner.ldquoThis sort of thing raises suspicions in the community and itrsquos just not good enough,: said Mrs Smyth.However, she was assured by Board chairman, Mr Cecil Kirkwood, that Board officers had not acted in an underhand manner and that there had only been a misunderstanding.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Killyleagh priest had called this week for people to follow the example of friendship shown by more than  Protestants and Roman Catholics who joined together in a special Halloween dinner and concert organised by his church.He is Fr Hugh OrsquoHagan and he was speaking hours after  senior citizens had enjoyed a dinner and concert in St Maryrsquos Hall, organised by the hall management committee.Speaking afterwards Fr OrsquoHagan said that Killyleagh and Shrigley had a unique community, ldquo everywhere has like here, Northern Ireland would be a more peaceful place.Invitations to Thursdayrsquos dinner and concert went out to both sides of the community and Fr OrsquoHagan stressed that he hoped no senior citizen had been forgotten, either Protestant or Roman Catholic.The idea of the dinner mdash which was such a success last year, when he was held for the first time mdash has been widely praised in the town, especially by the senior citizens and Thursday nightrsquos was no exception, with many voting it a big hit.Before the dinner began, Fr OrsquoHagan mdash who has been priest in Killyleagh for over  years and who is the longest serving priest ever in the town mdash welcomed everyone and thanked them for coming.He welcomed especially, the three ministers in the town, the Rev J C Boggs, Rev J D Mark and Rev R E Conn.

preparing to import the generic drug from South America as part of a CF Buyers Club of families.In a desperate attempt to start their son on the drug as quickly as possible, the couple and their family fundraised around pound, to buy Lorcaacuten three months treatment.ldquoWe were so close to getting the generic drug ourselves and that would have been great as Lorcaacuten would have started on it, but we would have still been campaigning and pushing for it, said Jen.ldquoWe have been told that the Department of Health want to copy what NHS England did and get the drug into peoplersquos

The choral society gave me a taste for musical theatre and my mum really pushed me to do it. It turned out that I just loved it, added the former pupil of St Colmcillersquos High School in Crossgar and Down High School, Downpatrick.Mark performed in every musical staged by the society until his final appearance in Sunset Bouled, with music from Andrew Lloyd Webber, at the Grand Opera House in .ldquoThat role was the hardest one I had ever done, as while I have had plenty of leading roles, it was one that had me on stage in a major theatre and for nearly every scene, just as I will have to do the same in Joseph, said Mark.While Declanrsquos illness undoubtedly shook the McMullan family to its core, Mark said that he believes some good has come out of it.ldquoBefore Declan took sick in , my dream was always to go and live and work in London and do musical theatre. Unfortunately when that happened I had to put that dream on hold.ldquoI never thought I would look at it again as I knew I had to help Declan and my family, but unwittingly, the bad thing that happened to Declan has actually helped me pursue that dream even more.ldquoHe is my biggest supporter, hersquos like my manager.

Leading a presentation on Agriculture and Agri-food, Craig Humes highlighted how dairy farmers will be one of the main farming groups to be ldquostruck by Brexit.ldquo. billion litres of milk are collected from across Northern Irish farms each year.  per cent of this milk produced is then exported south to be processed.ldquoThis could make le extremely dficult for farmersexport tarfs are to be introduced, Craig shared, adding that Dr. Mike Johnston, Chief Executive of the Dairy Council Northern Ireland believes that milk prices could drop by  pence per litre should a no-deal Brexit proceed with such excessive tarfs announced.ldquoIn my opinion, to put it quite simply, dairy farmers will not survive in Fermanagh unless there is a deal, commented Craig.In her presentation on Tourism and Hospitality Rebekah Starrett noted how Fermanagh had over , visitors last year who spent an average of pound. million.ldquoThis is a massive amount of money being spent in this local economy. The tourism and hospitality industry here supports , jobs ndash one of the biggest employment sectors in the county.ldquoIf Brexit happens it could mean some businesses may need to let some staff go and leave people without a job, said Rebekah.Stating that in her opinion Brexit offers the tourism and hospitality sector many innovative opportunities to potentially grow and expand, Rebekah shared some examples.ldquoThere has been a rise in lsquostaycationrsquo ndash the number of UK residents that have been staying and holidaying at homehas shown a three per cent rise in  and is continuing to grow something which would be good for Fermanagh Tourism, explained Rebekah, who also highlighted how Fermanagh is renowned for its celebrity chefs, award-winning restaurants and local produce which will continue to attract visitors to the County.Presenting facts on Business and Cross Border Trade, Nicole McFarlane and Oran OrsquoLoughlin shared how Enniskillen has the lsquotop performing ASDA store in the UKrsquo which was the th best store in Walmart Worldwide Group in  and that an average shopping trip spend by Republic of Ireland shoppers to Enniskillen is euro to euro.ldquoCross Border trade stands at pound. billion for  and Northern Ireland makes up between  to  per cent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for seven to eight per cent of imports, stated Nicole and Oran, adding that the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will depend on what kind of agreement replaces the current one which is free market trade within the EU. Sharing a positive outlook on how Brexit could impact business trade, the studentsrsquo stated: ldquoBrexit could actually result in more opportunities in more vibrant markets across the world becoming available. Some argue that Brexit could liberate the UK government to sign fresh trade deals with more dynamic markets outside the EU and therefore bolster trade.Whilst presenting his research on how Brexit could impact Student Le, Jordan McClure shared: ldquoStudent le is a vital part of growing up where we learn many things. Brexit has taught me the importance of ensuring that my opinion and voice is heard, especially, when I wasnrsquot the age to vote in the  referendum.ldquoWhilst much of what happens around Brexit is beyond our control one thing for sure is that the potential impact will affect all of our lives. Whatever that may be, it is important that we as students embrace it and make the most of it, he added.Will Greenaway closed the conference by reiterating the potential benefits that could come from Brexit and potential concerns that leaving the EU could have on us in Northern Ireland and especially in Fermanagh.ldquoOur generation of students represent the future of Northern Ireland we are potentially the next generation of business leaders, health care workers and entrepreneurs.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I got it blown up so you could better make out the faces. I know quite a few of the names of the people pictured.”Of the decrease in the number of arches across Northern Ireland, Bertie said: “They’re falling away. There used to be eight in Lurgan, now there’s one.“It’s not just Lurgan, it’s happening all over Northern Ireland.”Fire Brigades Union welcomes Jeffrey Donaldson concerns over funding Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"A lot of the arches in Lurgan had been located in places like Victoria Street and William Street where the demographic has changed and the once Protestant areas have become Catholic-dominated.The Queen Street Arch was constructed from wood, painted and erected by residents within the Ballyblaugh townland, known by most as Blaugh .Detailing the history of the arch, Bertie said: “The poles at each side of the first arch, to give them a decorative look, were wrapped with laurels, sometimes ivy and wild flowers. “After a further few years the poles were wrapped with red cloth one yard wide. Orange lilies, rhododendrons, Sweet Williams and laurels were places in the overlay. “The laurels and wild flowers were donated by Lord Lurgan from his estate . Decorative wooden boxes were first added in the s. The first boxes were threepenny bit shaped.”He continued: “The curtain banner which hangs under the arch used to be donated by local linen factories. “It is normally  foot long, dyed orange with blue fringing. It was cut to shape by the local master tailor and in the light summer evenings the ladies gathered on the street to hand stitch the fringing to the curtain under the tailor’s watchful eye. “If the weather was bad the work was carried out in the band room.“When the old curtain was up it would last five or six years before the dye started to run.“It would be taken down, re-dyed and stitched back up again by the women in the street. You would get maybe  or  years out of a curtain.“Lurgan used to be coming down with linen factories who would donate to the arch. Since the mid s good linen has become very costly. We use PVC now which lasts about two to three years.”Bertie told an interesting story demonstrating how the method of putting up the arch has changed signicantly: “In the pre-s, the men worked long hours,  hour days, mostly in linen factories, then many would have gone to the pub on a Friday night. “To get the man power they’d have to wait until the pubs closed to put the arch up. “The wooden arch was erected late on Friday evening with residents watching and finished on Saturday.”Even after a new arch made from steel and aluminium replaced the old arch in  the process of putting it up was still a manual one.Bertie said: “We used to have a man in charge and he wouldn’t let a digger or equipment near it. Everything was done off ladders. I remember standing on top of it many a time.“It’s about  or  foot high. When you’re walking across the top it’s only about four inches.”He added: “Now with the use of hydraulic machinery, since the mid s the arch is now erected in three to four hours.”Having survived more than  years the wooden arch in Queen Street came down for the last time in .One of the main problems for the men erecting the arch was that a row of houses to which the arch had been attached with ropes had been demolished.To that end a new committee was formed to seea solution could be found, leaving Queen Street without its annual fixture.“When there was no arch in  we formed a new committee,” said Bertie. “Brothers Andy and Sammy Lutton came on board as chair and deputy and were the driving force in getting the new arch up.”The arch, made mainly of light steel and aluminium, was opened by Bro Harold McCusker MP, and dedicated my Bro Rev WM Smith BABD on Monday, June , .The crown on the arch was first lit up for the Queen’s Coronation in  and the arch became a focal point for parties on the Eleventh night when the street was closed to traffic.From the first arch to the present day, a group of dedicated volunteers meet in Easter each year to carry out checks and maintenance to prepare for the erection of the arch ahead of the marching season.Bertie is joined on the arch committee by his cousin Irvine Gordon, treasurer for the past  years, and chairman John Crozier.The arch is not owned, governed or directly attached to any particular lodge, preceptory or club within the loyal orders.The loyal orders provide the arch with the main source of financial support as well as fundraising activities like the calendar.There have also been many who have helped over the years in terms of materials and paint, electricity and lighting, hand tools, machinery, printing and storage.The Queen Street Orange Arch th anniversary calendar is available in Lurgan in Victor Stewart Enterprises, MK Savage Floored, the Mechanics Institute and DUP MLA Carla Lockhart’s constituency office.It can also be purchased in both Moutray Costcutter locations in Lurgan and Dollingstown as well as UUP MLA Doug Beattie’s constituency office in Portadown.try catch  TrendingCounsellors brought into NI school to help pupils after teen killed and four others hospitalised in horror crashMother tells of agony after sons body found -

The South Antrim MLA bluntly and emphatically replied: “No. We’re not standing aside. We’re going to fight all  constituencies.”Askedhe would regret his decision to run  candidatesit was to cost someone like Nigel Dodds his seat, Mr Aiken said: “Nigel Dodds and the DUP made it very clear, time and time again, that they don’t need Ulster Unionist support and we didn’t put a border down the Irish Sea Nigel Dodds needs to answer that question.”He went on to set out his reasoning for such a stance, arguing that the DUP had undermined the Union both through its involvement in ious scandals and its handling of Brexit, and said that the UUP would offer an alternative of either a very soft Brexit or cancelling Brexit entirely, which he said would not be as damaging to the Union.However, by yesterday Mr Aiken outlined a policy diametrically opposed to that which he had initially said he believed in.In a statement, he referred to what he said was the DUP’s responsibility for the Brexit “debacle” which “cannot be whitewashed away”.Denouncing the party for which he is urging north Belfast unionists to vote, he went on: “It was their acceptance of a regulatory border in the Irish Sea on October , vigorously opposed by the Ulster Unionist Party, which opened the floodgates for Boris Johnson and his dreadful deal.Naomi Long to stand again in East Belfast at general election Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The Union itself is now in a precarious position not in spite of the DUP’s stance but because of the DUP’s actions.”Mr Aiken said that he had been in discussions with “senior political and community figures across north Belfast” and had “listened respectfully to all views expressed, including deeply held concerns that they will be unrepresented in Westminster in the critical months ahead”.He went on: “This has been done in the context of threats and intimidation against UUP staff and members. In a modern democracy no-one should have to face threats, intimidation or coercion of any sort because of their involvement in the democratic process.“It is appalling and totally reprehensible and should have no place in Northern Ireland in the st century.”He said it was “absolutely vital that MPs are ed who will take their seats and be able to influence the future direction of our nation” and “therefore we have decided not to nominate a candidate in North Belfast in the forthcoming election.“The DUP recognise that they cannot win North Belfast on their own, despite having dismissed the opinions of other unionists in the past. They cannot expect to continue on that basis and must now realise they need Ulster Unionist voices at Westminster.“The choice in North Belfast is between Nigel Dodds as MP or an abstentionist MP who refuses to stand in Westminster to talk about health, education, justice, international affairs, or the future direction of the United Kingdom.“In the face of Boris Johnson’s terrible deal which forces Northern Ireland towards the edge of the Union, we cannot gt a seat to Sinn Fein who support this direction either in North Belfast or Fermanagh and South Tyrone.“It is better to elect Nigel Dodds in North Belfast and hold him to account for his promises on the Union than facilitate the election of an abstentionist Sinn Fein MP who still cannot condemn IRA violence.”On Saturday, DUP leader Arlene Foster announced that the DUP would not stand against Tom Elliott in Fermanagh-South Tyrone, saying that voters “deserve to be represented in the House of Commons rather than an absentee MP standing on the sidelines”.Howver, Mr Elliott told the Press Association that he was not prepared to confirmhe plans to run as a candidate ahead of a selection meeting on Thursday.DUP leader Arlene Foster – who Steve Aiken has derided as “two borders Foster” – was quick to endorse the UUP decision.The former first minister said: “We welcome the fact that the Ulster Unionists have reached this decision.“They know that they cannot win in North Belfast and that first class representation is already provided by Nigel Dodds. I have a strong sense that unionism across Northern Ireland wants to see unionist parties working together for the Union.”Alliance, which over recent years has continued to stand candidates inareas where it faced physical attacks, including a constituency office which was torched, said that “paramilitaries cannot be allowed to win”.The party’s North Belfast candidate, Nuala McAllister, said: “This backtracking by Steve Aiken is not only him caving in but also effectively bowing the knee to the DUP before he has even taken the reins of the UUP. He made a big play about running candidates in every constituency but has now lost any credibility he had.”Sinn Fein’s North Belfast candidate, John Finucane, has appealed to unionists opposed to Brexit to vote for him, saying that unionists who oppose leaving the EU “are not represented by Nigel Dodds, one of the chief architects of the Tory Brexit”. He said: “With the UUP withdrawing from this contest under pressure from loyalist paramilitaries, there is now no unionist candidate representing those who voted to remain in Europe.”The TUV had called for unionist unity in seats where Sinn Fein could otherwise benefit, saying that it would be “folly to gt seats to Sinn Fein” and that “any party that sets such a course is not serving the Union”. The PUP leader Billy Hutchinson had also called for a single unionist candidate.Just hours before Mr Aiken reversed his policy, former UUP leader Mike Nesbitt had warned that it would be “nothing short of hypocrisy” for his party to sign up to an electoral pact with the DUP.Speaking on Newstalk Breakfast, the Strangford MLA said that the election was a chance for unionists to voice anger at the DUP’s behaviour.He said: “Since the last election, the DUP have been embroiled in a sort of alphabet soup of scandals – both corporately with the likes of RHI and inidually with Ian Paisley Jr.“And also their stance on Brexit, I think, is an existential threat to the future of the United Kingdom.“So it is very dficult to be making those sort of criticisms of a party and then to go into the ballot box on the th of December coming and give them one of their preferences. That is nothing short in my analysis of hypocrisy.”He said the pressure coming from the DUP was “frankly undemocratic”.He added: “I mean, they are criticising us for saying we want to run candidates in a political election. If it is a democracy, we are entitled to run in all  constituencies.”try catch  TrendingCounsellors brought into NI school to help pupils after teen killed and four others hospitalised in horror crashMother tells of agony after sons body found -

They must know that there are real-world consequences from dangerous language.I have many friends who took a respectful and dferent view from me on Brexit. Like the overwhelming majority of Welsh and British people, they are perfectly capable of expressing that view without resorting to threats, aggression or violence.We must all learn to disagree well, however robust our views and remember that we all share this country and this planet - and that we genuinely have more in common.Meanwhile, it has been another extraordinary week in these turbulent political times.After we had the shock news that I wrote about last week ndash that the Supreme Court had delivered a unanimous judgement that Parliament should not have been shut down by the PM ndash we were able to go back immediately.I was straight back to Westminster having meetings with colleagues, holding the government to account, and of course getting back to work not just on Brexit but on many other issues.I was able to raise concerns in the Commons on behalf of constituents relating to the Thomas Cook collapse, which has affected everybody from holiday-makers to pilots to holiday reps and retail workers in the constituency and to call for a debate on the incineration of waste.And on Monday, I joined Allied Steel and Wire Pensioners from the constituency, and others hit by pensions theft, to hand in a petition to the Prime Minister at  Downing Street. They deserve justice on their pensions and have my full support. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Like the overwhelming majority of Welsh and British people, they are perfectly capable of expressing that view without resorting to threats, aggression or violence.We must all learn to disagree well, however robust our views and remember that we all share this country and this planet - and that we genuinely have more in common.Meanwhile, it has been another extraordinary week in these turbulent political times.After we had the shock news that I wrote about last week ndash that the Supreme Court had delivered a unanimous judgement that Parliament should not have been shut down by the PM ndash we were able to go back immediately.I was straight back to Westminster having meetings with colleagues, holding the government to account, and of course getting back to work not just on Brexit but on many other issues.I was able to raise concerns in the Commons on behalf of constituents relating to the Thomas Cook collapse, which has affected everybody from holiday-makers to pilots to holiday reps and retail workers in the constituency and to call for a debate on the incineration of waste.And on Monday, I joined Allied Steel and Wire Pensioners from the constituency, and others hit by pensions theft, to hand in a petition to the Prime Minister at  Downing Street.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections. We must resist Tory attempts to close down our democracy. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We need a UK Labour Government that will stand up for the many.The Tories have been cutting budgets for nearly  years now.Since  they have scrapped over , frontline police officers.In the last year alone more than , children were pushed into absolute poverty.Boris Johnson has sought to ide our country.Labour would immediately raise the minimum wage to pound an hour for all ages, increase funding to Welsh Government for the NHS, and kickstart a green revolution.On Saturday it is expected that MPs willto Westminster to sit for a highly unusual session in Parliament, as we reach the critical stage of the Brexit process.Weekend sittings are very rare, and the House has only sat on four Saturdays since  ndash on September ,  at the outbreak of World War II on July , as a final summer sitting on November ,  to debate the Suez Crises and on April ,  over the Falkland Islands invasion.A Saturday sitting, two days after the EU summit, is likely to be a decisive moment in determining the future of our country.Saturday will also see a lsquoTogether for the Final Sayrsquo march to Parliament Square.When a similar march took place earlier this year an estimated million people of all ages, from every corner of the UK and from all walks of le, took part ndash including many from Penarth and Cardf who travelled to London to make their voices heard.Their message was absolutely clear then ndash and mine remains the same now - that the people must be given a final say on this Brexit disaster. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His father was West African and his mother was Irish.Billy was overlooked by rugby union. However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their sole motive has been about blocking Brexit.I have long thought the only way out of this is a general election.The British people need to be given the opportunity to have a clear out of those politicians who said one thing to get elected and have done another in office.All Labour and Conservative MPs were elected on manestos explicitly promising to respect and honour the referendum result.The people of Penarth deserve better than this.Earlier this month, I was present on the steps of the Senedd as the petition to save the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital was presented to the Assembly.I joined other local representatives and campaigners from Unison to receive the petition, and send a clear message on the health boardrsquos proposals.Under the plans, the -bed older persons rehabilitation ward will close, with services transferring either to the community or Llandough Hospital.Local opinion in Barry is quite clear that the ward should stay, while in Llandough, further expansion of the hospital will cause further pressures on the village.You wonrsquot often catch me standing alongside Unison, but on this we completely agree.These plans need to be dropped.The Royal British Legion have officially launched the  Poppy Appeal, and as ever, I am delighted to pledge my support.It is crucial we commemorate those who made the ultimate sacrice to defend our freedoms, including those from Penarth.Wearing a poppy is an understated yet clear way of demonstrating that, and it also raises vital funds to support current and former servicemen and women and their families.It is often misunderstood as condoning or celebrating war, and that could not be further from the truth. It is respecting those who have fallen.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Royal British Legion for their work. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

There is fierce competition to host the All Ireland Fleadh each year as it attracts thousands of visitors and musiciaans from across the world. Councillor Mark BaxterAt Monday night’s meeting Sinn Fein welcomed the success of their motion, tabled by the party’s group leader Darren McNally, which asked council to investigate the feasibility and economic benefits of hosting the Fleadh Cheoil Na hEireann in Armagh.Cllr McNally said it would be ‘a massive economic boost for the entire borough’ with a potential £m for the economy.“I believe Armagh would be a very fitting venue given the rich ancient heritage and culture the city possesses’”#However DUP Cllr Mark Baxter said: ““We are hugely disappointed that we were the only party to vote against this potential colossal spend by council in these very tough economic times. The other parties were quite happy to task officers to investigate bringing the Fleadh Cheoil to Armagh despite the huge cost involved.” “Ironically it was only three weeks ago that Sinn Fein refused to back another much smaller proposal for a community event citing a lack of council resources. I would question in the strongest possible terms the economic benefits and the motives for bringing such an event and why the UUP and Sinn Fein are so keen to bring the event to Armagh which has in the past had some very controversial artists. Indeed we all can point to similar festivals recently held in Belfast where its very clear that ‘unionists’ were not welcome with Pro-IRA chanting and bands imploring the British to “go back home. “I would call on councillors to reflect on this wanton disregard for the public purse and remind them of their responsibilities in delivering first class services for best value. The DUP make no apology for being the champions of low rates in council.”Sinn Fein Cllr Liam Mackle dismissed claims by the DUP‘s Mark Baxter that the motion committed council to a massive spend as untrue.He said: “The passing of this motion gives council officers the freedom to engage with numerous stakeholders holders including Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann who organise the Fleadh Cheoil to get a better understanding of what’s expected of any host venue, Council officers will bring back a report to committee following engagements with local businesses, hospitality sector, community groups and traditional musicians, where Councillors can have an informed debate on its feasibility.“We have seen the DUP on ABC council spend hundreds of thousands of pounds on a whim - on events with no economic benefit to our borough. Their behaviour is somewhat childish, compared to the mature approach of this motion.”Musician Willie calls for better rehabilitation for stroke survivors Coremetrics  Coremetrics

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations. Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering.

One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey.

We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business. Combine those factors with the wide range of services and innovative technology we can offer, the possibilities for further growth in Northern Ireland look very strong indeed.”  Philippe Op de Beeck, chief executive of APCOA Parking Group, says the company “profited from healthy organic growth last year”. “In addition, we are currently strengthening our focus on strategic acquisitions.“The group recently acquired Onepark A S in Denmark, after having bought another smaller Swiss company early last year.
