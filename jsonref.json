The prime minister claims the Muslim world has produced “nothing like” the Sistine Chapel, a wonder “beyond the technical accomplishment of Islamic art”. Tell that to Diego Fernandez Castro. In the late 19th century, this Spanish artist created a loving model of the Alhambra palace in Granada that expresses the exact opposite: this glorious medieval Andalusian palace is indeed an Islamic equal of the Sistine Chapel.Castro’s model transfixes you in this exhibition. Delicate patterns of filigree stucco hang in space over slender columns in a theatrical layering of white arches. Brightly coloured tiles are laid out in intricate tessellations within the lighter-than-air galleries. Where the Sistine ceiling depicts creation as a story, the Alhambra expresses the glory of the cosmos in crystalline patterns and systems inspired by the Arab scientific revolution that started in the 8th century – and that also, Boris, provided European artists such as Michelangelo with the optics of perspective.The Alhambra was the last flowering of Islamic art in Spain before it finally fell to the Catholic monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella in 1492. Its beauty has seduced westerners ever since – as have the Koutoubia mosque in Marrakech, the Red Gate of Rabat and the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, of which admiring depictions by Europeans are in this perspective-shifting exhibition. The image here of the Dome of the Rock was drawn in 1486 in a Renaissance map of the Holy Land. There’s a drawing nearby by Peter Paul Rubens of Ottoman costumes, probably copied from a Turkish album to supply exotic ideas for his sensational paintings of lion hunts and battles. And there’s a portrait sketch by Anthony van Dyck of Sir Robert Sherley in Persian dress with turban, silk cloak and ornate dagger. This isn’t patronising fancy dress. Sherley, an Elizabethan adventurer who went to Persia to make his fortune, was the envoy of Shah Abbas I to the Papal court when Van Dyck drew him in Rome in summer 1622. His costume is authentic.That is the kind of twist that makes Inspired by the East such an important exhibition. It takes one of the most contested and controversial topics around – how the west sees the Islamic world – and offers unexpected insights into a dialogue that’s more complex and affectionate than you may think. Far from being bitter enemies locked in a culture war, the Christian and Muslim worlds, until recent times, looked at each other with mutual fascination. A key document of that entanglement is a 16th-century Venetian portrait of Sultan Bayezid I, in which the Ottoman ruler looks over his shoulder at you, his pensive eye and golden coat caught with a smoky sensitivity influenced by Veronese. This evocative portrait of a historic figure was commissioned in 1578 by the Ottoman vizier through Venice’s ambassador in Istanbul. The Ottoman court got its appetite for Venetian art when Gentile Bellini introduced Renaissance portraiture there. Meanwhile, Venetian painters got their sense of colour partly from the eastern silks and spices on sale at the Rialto.Power attracts. Most Europeans 500 years ago thought it was just a matter of time until the Ottoman empire conquered them. That inspired fear, but also respect. Sultan Bayezid I is portrayed as a godfather figure, both potent and wise. A fantastically wrought Ottoman helmet captured at the second siege of Vienna in 1683 is a relic of the last time the Islamic empire seriously threatened the heart of Europe. The really contentious aspect of this show is what happens afterwards. How did European artists look at Islam in the age of European global domination that became unquestionable by 1800?Lavishly, it turns out. While the west lorded it over a declining Ottoman empire and built colonies in north Africa and Asia, artists including Delacroix, Ingres and a host of lesser known “Orientalist” painters feasted their imaginations on eastern scenes. They researched their subjects in fanatical detail. Was this western interest in the east just a way of claiming to “know” the east in order to rule it? That is the argument of Edward Said’s book Orientalism. My old paperback has an Orientalist painting, The Snake Charmer by Jean-Léon Gérôme, on its cover – a blue-tinged reptilian fantasy of the Other.But that’s a caricature of Gérôme, reveals this show. His 1859 painting The Grain Threshers shows an everyday scene of rural life in Egypt, and offers a new way of understanding why 19th-century European artists painted north Africa. As the industrial revolution sped up, they were drawn to places that seemed to preserve a better way of life. Alphons Leopold Mielich’s The Pottery Seller shows an infectiously busy market Rudolf Weisse’s The Dice Players takes you into the streets of Cairo. These painters are outsiders, looking in with envy.Of course, there’s plenty of sleazy fantasising in Orientalist art. In 1819, Antoine-Ignace Melling drew the grand harem in Istanbul as a vast place, part prison, part hotel. But how realistic is it? Melling made up this western male idea of an eastern harem – yet he also designed a real harem for an Ottoman palace in a case of Orientalism shaping the Orient. In a video that closes the show, Turkish artist İnci Eviner repopulates Melling’s sinister harem with women playing and performing.One thing is undeniable in this exhibition of dreams. However prejudiced we may assume them to have been, westerners from the 15th to 19th centuries sincerely admired the beauty of Islamic art, architecture, crafts and lifestyles. It is only in our own time that Islam’s heritage can be so casually dismissed by pseudo-intellectual politicians and other philistines."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49a935ec38fdf222a71453f0f66ce7aca81ef793/0_741_1772_1063/master/1772.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24317936dd86160903da696f6016d591","title":"city of light brassai paris in pictures photography","story":"Called ‘the Eye of Paris’ by his friend the author Henry Miller, the legendary photographer created a striking body of work that documented high – and low – society in Paris between the first and second world wars.

Was it possible that this journalist, a man I admire deeply, would now think less of me, knowing that, on paper, I’m worth only half what he is? More to the point, did I now think less of myself? I worried that the answer to both these questions was yes.We tell ourselves that money doesn’t matter. The nature of the work that I do is, and always has been, more important to me than the fatness of my pay slip (and, yes, I know I’m lucky to be able to make this choice). But equality matters too: it is, in fact, everything. In 2017, when the BBC was forced to reveal the salaries of employees who earned more than £150,000, Carrie Gracie, its China editor, discovered that, while her own name was not on this select list, Jon Sopel, the BBC’s North American editor, was paid between £230,000 and £239,000. How did this news make her feel? Naturally, she was angry. Not only had the BBC begged her to take up her job, insisting she was the only suitable candidate she had made pay equality a condition of her acceptance, which meant she had been lied to. But she experienced other feelings, too: a faltering. This was a degradation of her abilities, her experience and her dedication.Gracie’s book about her ultimately successful battle to win pay equality at the BBC isn’t always an entirely gripping read. As she acknowledges, long accounts of grievance hearings, all circumspection and tedious HR-speak are likely to make anyone’s eyes glaze over. Moreover, the fact that she still works for the BBC – having resigned her position as China editor, she is now once again a news presenter – means that she is careful when it comes to venting her feelings about those (mostly men) who so casually belittled her, in ways both big and small. But still, her book is important, and not only for the sound advice it offers to those who may be going through something similar (it is a manual as much as a memoir).Gracie understands all the various ways in which pay inequality can play havoc with a person’s self-belief and peace of mind, and in her book she staples them to the page. It isn’t only that, as a skirmish turns first into a prolonged battle and then into something approaching a war, she is frightened and frequently weary that she hardly knows who among her bosses, if any, she can trust. For me, the most resonant parts of her book have to do with her self worth. “Carrie, it’s always such a joy to see you,” says James Harding, the then director of news at the BBC, when she sees him for a meeting in 2015. “You deliver so much and ask so little.” At the time, she received these words almost gratefully, as women are apt to do. (If people cannot recognise our talent, at least let them salute our efficiency!) Cut to a couple of years later, however, and the BBC is talking of her “growth and development” as if she were some graduate at the beginning of her career, not a woman in her 50s who speaks fluent Mandarin and who knows China inside out.Having to assert the value of her work gets her down. It makes her feel boastful. I understand this and so will many women. But the lesson here is also depressingly obvious. Men are not necessarily going to acknowledge how hard we work themselves, or not in any concrete way, for all that our productivity may be exceedingly useful (“you ask so little”). Some of them, in fact, may be quite determined not to acknowledge it, or even to notice it at all. This is a wilful blindness, and though the law is on our side, there is still, alas, every chance it is reflected in our pay packets (there are ways round the law). My own advice, having read Gracie’s book and having fought some battles of my own, is this: be grateful, but not too grateful. Don’t measure yourself against others, but don’t stop looking around you either. Ask the men questions, and if they don’t – or won’t – answer, ask yourself why.This review is from the Observer• Equal: A Story of Women, Men and Money by Carrie Gracie is published by Virago (£18.99).

This is at the top end of City forecasts but will still be below last year’s profits of £578m.More than 2,000 BA flights were grounded last month when pilots went on strike for two days. BA owner IAG has warned that the walkouts would reduce this year’s profits by €137m (£122m). There are additional costs caused by threatened strikes by ground staff at Heathrow airport and lower bookings at its Vueling carrier, which means IAG’s full-year operating profits will be €215m lower than last year’s €3.48bn.Ryanair pilots also took industrial action in September, prompting some travellers to switch to other airlines, although Ryanair flights ran as scheduled in the end.Its chief executive, Johan Lundgren, said: “As a result of our self-help initiatives and the increased demand due to disruption at British Airways and Ryanair, we anticipate achieving headline profit before tax for the full year 2019 of between £420m and £430m, in the upper half of our previous guidance range.”EasyJet had previously pencilled in a full-year profit of £400m to £440m.Richard Hunter, head of markets at trading platform Interactive Investor, said: “The unfortunate demise of Thomas Cook could also provide further opportunities.”He added, however: “The full ramifications of the UK’s departure from the EU have yet to wash through, either in terms of any future sterling weakness, which could crimp consumer demand or indeed additional travel regulations, which would add further cost.“Meanwhile, the industry remains one typified by an intensity of competition which has seen a number of smaller players go to the wall over recent years.”Thomas Cook, the world’s oldest travel firm, collapsed last month after running out of cash.

He shares how gardening both inspires him and keeps his wellbeing in checkWhile Alexander Hoyle finds himself working on most days of the year, it makes it far more bearable that no two are ever the same. On one he could be turning a boring shopfront on a sparse London street into a green oasis, on another he might travel to Morocco for a consultation with a client, or to the south of France to build a garden on the deck of a yacht.Now 26, becoming a professional plantsman and garden designer is something that Hoyle has been working towards since he was 11 years old and growing up in the Cotswolds. It turned from a childhood hobby into a four-year traineeship as a plantsman at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and has now flourished into working with private clients to devise their dream gardens. “Gardening is all I’ve ever known,” says Hoyle. “Getting outside is so important to me. I feel immensely lucky to not be stuck inside all day.”Gardening is growing in popularity among millennials a renaissance that is part of a greater resistance to being in front of a screen all day, whether it’s a phone or a computer, and getting involved in something that connects you to the real world. “Gardening really does help with mindfulness,” says Hoyle. “It sounds boring, but my favourite part of my day is watering and deadheading – it’s incredibly therapeutic.”Hoyle is one of a new wave of young garden designers bringing a fresh eye and direction to a profession that was never before considered particularly “cool”. Social media has its fashion influencers and beauty influencers – and on Instagram Hoyle has been building his status as one of the growing community of gardening influencers, picking up almost 50,000 followers since he launched his account while working at Kew. He shares design inspiration and his favourite flowers (begonias are no longer considered “naff”, apparently).He is mostly behind the camera on his Instagram account, and for Hoyle dressing right has less to do with being an influencer and more about dressing for a role that will see him outside, rain or shine, all hours of the day.Hoyle says that the priority starts from the ground up. “You have to look after your feet when you are gardening. Shoes are incredibly important to me,” he says. Clarks shoes were something that he once equated with going back to school as a child. More recently, they have started to have more significance in the garden.For Hoyle, leather Clarks Clarkdale Gobi Chelsea boots, with their elastic panel, are the optimum shoes for his job – mainly because they are so practical and comfortable, but also timelessly stylish, which makes them perfect to wear to a meeting without having to change.“They have great ankle support and cushioning. These boots are ideal for every kind of weather – and I can get them on and off easily when I’m walking through a client’s house where a rug might cost more than my flat. They are also perfect for when I visit clients for design meetings. But, most importantly, they are also great for walks in the countryside, which is what I love to do the most.”Outside of London, it’s the gardens of the West Country where you will find Hoyle most often, searching nurseries and grow houses for new plants. “The English garden is very important to what I do. I like to bring English country gardens to the city when I’m planting – I don’t see why it should be so different. What we do is very romantic and naturalistic – and you can enjoy that anywhere.”Currently reading I love Architectural Digest. I’m very into interiors and design – it’s one of my biggest passions after gardening.Podcast recommendation Gardeners’ Question Time on Radio 4 – I love that. They get excellent experts together and give very technical answers.Inspiration I’m always incredibly inspired by Umberto Pasti’s garden at his home in Tangier. Gardens in Tangier are incredibly beautiful.A plant everyone should try growing A scented pelargonium – it’s beautiful and hardy.Whether you’re looking for rugged outdoor styles, casual dress, or tailored workwear, Clarks has the right styles, with comfort built in that you can rely on.

There’s no geeky fix for the Irish border“Spaff some money on some geeks.” According to Chris Cook’s excellent account of Theresa May’s Brexit negotiations with Brussels, that was the instruction issued to the civil service by May’s enforcer Fiona Hill in late 2016.It had finally dawned on the British government that it had committed itself to two incompatible things. One was that under no circumstances would there be a return to a hard border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. The other was that all of the UK was going to leave the EU’s customs union. May faced exactly the same problem that her successor Boris Johnson is struggling with: you can do one or other of these things but you cannot do both. If Northern Ireland leaves the customs union, there will be border controls.And so May tried to do what Johnson is still proposing: throw money at nerds and hope that they can somehow transform a political problem into a technical issue. The old (superbly condescending) joke was that whenever the Irish question was about to be solved, the Irish would change the question. But the British government has been trying to solve the riddle of Brexit’s Irish question not just by changing the question, but by changing the entire conceptual framework. It has to be removed from a discourse of history and geography and memory and translated into the languages of technology and managerialism.That is how Johnson sought to define the problem in his speech to the Tory party conference last week: “Essentially a technical discussion of the exact nature of future customs checks.” Previously, of course, he suggested that crossing the Irish border was similar to going from one borough of London to another, and that any problem it creates could be solved with the same technology used to operate the city’s congestion charge.This is a way of minimising and dismissing an inconvenient truth. But it also goes to the heart of the complete failure of Johnson’s proposals for a replacement of the backstop designed to keep the border invisible. Everybody in Ireland, north and south, knows that there are many technical questions thrown up by Brexit. But nobody – not even Johnson’s DUP allies – really believes that what Brexit does to John Bull’s Other Island is a matter for a “technical discussion”. In Ireland, it’s about lives – and deaths.Writing about music is said to be like dancing about architecture. Using the language of technology to address the questions of history and belonging on the island of Ireland is geeking about memory – like trying to make an algorithm for grief. It’s a category error that shunts the problem not just into “alternative arrangements” but into a parallel universe.The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, gets this. When she visited Ireland last April and spent time talking to people who live and work on both sides of the border, she said simply that she understood what they were saying because: “For 34 years I lived behind the iron curtain so I know only too well what it means once borders vanish, once walls fall.” She grasps the truth that what is at stake is not “the exact nature of future customs checks” – it is that customs checks (which the British government pledged never to reinstitute but now proposes to make necessary) are the outward bureaucratic signs of an inner anguish: the rebuilding of spiritual and psychological walls that have been demolished since 1998.Two particular ironies attach to Johnson’s privileging of a technocratic discourse over real human experience. One is that the Brexit project is in every other respect famously contemptuous of “geeks”. The British people, in Michael Gove’s analysis, “have had enough of experts”. But the Irish, apparently, are expected to place all their trust in the experts, nerds and boffins who will come up with magical technologies to create what does not yet exist anywhere on Earth: a frontier between two different customs regimes across which goods move with no controls and no physical infrastructure.The other irony is that Brexit itself is predicated on the idea that a technocratic discourse is entirely inadequate to the task of understanding how people feel about who they are and where they belong. Its bogeymen are faceless bureaucrats in Brussels who can never appreciate the importance of identity and history to the English. Yet the Irish are invited by the very same people to forget history and identity, to just lie back and think of “maximum facilitation”.This creates a dialogue of the deaf. Brexiters’ technofreak obsessions cannot even begin to engage with the memories and anxieties and aspirations that are at the heart of Irish concerns about the collateral damage of the English nationalist project. The disjunction goes so deep that it even involves two different conceptions of time.While Irish people are painfully aware of the past – the deep history that led to the creation of the border and the living memory of the Troubles – the Brexiters act like dedicated futurists. When Johnson told his party, in relation to the border, that “technology is improving the whole time”, he was repeating the sci-fi utopianism that has been central to the Brexit faith: the technology to ensure a frictionless border does not yet exist, but in these days of miracles and wonder it is just over the horizon. The actual “solutions” may be less Silicon Valley, more the IT Crowd, but tomorrow’s world is almost upon us.Until they give up this technological illusion and engage with living history, there is no chance of Johnson and his allies coming up with serious proposals. But why should they do that? The great utility of their discourse lies in its distancing effects. The politicians and special advisers only have to spaff the cash – the geeks can find the answers. Technology – that abstract, shifting, supposedly value-free force – removes the burden of public duty. And the beauty of these machines and systems is that they have no memory, no fears, no hopes and, if it all goes wrong, no possibility of blood on their hands.• Fintan O’Toole is a columnist with the  and author of Heroic Failure: Brexit and the Politics of Pain"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80ae272b7eaecc3e21afbfd5289b24a5ee16d98a/0_214_5550_3332/master/5550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=790a2ce625e1af71d3e2c168d3bfb666","title":"democrats judiciary right wing kavanaugh","story":"The Democratic base is tired of the party being passive about Republicans packing the judiciary. So what’s their game plan?Last Sunday, a boisterous group of protesters, primarily women, marched through Washington, DC. They stopped in front of the Washington home of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and gathered on the steps of the Supreme Court. The protest, called “Reclaim the Court,” was led by civil rights groups like Planned Parenthood Action, the Center for Popular Democracy, and the Women’s March, and was meant to mark the first anniversary of Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court, and came on the heels of new reporting that lends corroboration to accusations of sexual assault by the Justice and provides greater evidence that he lied under oath at his confirmation hearings, charges which he has denied.Protestors carried signs that said “KAVA-NOPE” and “SUPREMELY CORRUPT.” A sister demonstration took place in Portland, Maine, where constituents expressed pointed displeasure at Senator Susan Collins, who voted to confirm Kavanaugh last year. At a podium on the Court steps in DC, protestors called on House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler to initiate impeachment proceedings against Kavanaugh, as he previously promised to do if Democrats won the House in the 2018 midterms. There was palpable rage at the appointment of Kavanaugh, whose presence on the Court symbolized the persistence of two great threats to women’s full citizenship and bodily autonomy: sexual assault and the erosion of abortion and contraception rights. Chants rose up of “My body, my choice.” A sign raised towards the Court façade read, “BELIEVE SURVIVORS.” The demonstrators felt that the Court has the power to make life-altering decisions about the rights and freedoms of women, and that Kavanaugh’s presence there indicated that they would not choose well.But the protesters’ anger at the court went beyond Kavanaugh himself, and beyond, even, the insult to women’s dignity and threat to women’s rights that the man represents. Representative Ayanna Pressley, of Massachusettes, told the crowd, “Kavanaugh may have that seat (for now), but what we are fighting for is so much bigger than one insecure man blinded by his privilege.” The protesters see Kavanaugh as only the most egregious symptom of a court system that is gravely diseased. Their action speaks to a growing liberal agitation around the judiciary, led by feminists, that is poised to change the politics of the courts.Traditionally, it was only the right that cared about the judiciary. Republicans ran on promises to appoint judges that would uphold conservative social values, and oppose abortion and gay rights. Those judges in turn enshrined the legality of gerrymandering, curtailed voting rights, and opened the floodgates of unlimited corporate money in politics, interventions which have enabled the Republican party to maintain power even in districts where they have only a minority of popular support. The result became cyclical: Republicans won by promising to appoint conservative judges, and then those conservative judges issued decisions that helped more Republicans win.To the left, the judiciary had often been more of an afterthought. Conventional wisdom held that the judiciary could not be counted on as a motivating issue for Democrats the same way that it could for Republicans. But the Kavanaugh appointment brought a new sense of urgency to the matter the Court’s new conservative majority, and the spectacle of the emotional Senate confirmation hearings through which Republicans secured this majority, galvanized the attention of a Democratic base that increasingly feels that its basic civil rights are imperiled under a federal judiciary packed with Trump appointees and a Supreme Court controlled by Trump allies.And this is the problem with the Supreme Court: it is a profoundly un-democratic institution, and has only been made more so by the right’s determination to politicize the court and to manipulate it into helping them secure a policy agenda that runs counter to popular will. The gross injustice of the Kavanaugh confirmation made Americans—and feminists in particular—more aware of the urgency of the problem, and less accepting of its inevitability. Now, every major Democratic presidential contender must be able to answer tough questions about how they will reform the courts several, including California Senator Kamala Harris and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, have joined the call for Kavanaugh’s impeachment. Some of the court reform proposals that have emerged from the Democratic field have been halting or insufficient, paying undue deference to a myth of an apolitical court. Others have been more aggressive, more willing to treat the Court as the political institution that Republicans have long treated it as. At any rate, the Democratic base wants answers: it is no longer acceptable for the party to be as passive and accepting of Republican aggression regarding the judiciary as its once was. In Portland, Maine, a small child carried a sign to the protest: “FAIR COURTS FOR MY FUTURE.” Beside him, an older woman was even more pointed: “CONSERVATIVE JUDGES ERODE FREEDOMS FOR ALL.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a779e9b3a9078835dc10debb943ab39a7e08b8b8/0_275_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5624b77cbdf484ce60a87fae4da0a8cd","title":"narendra modi bjp india","story":"Modi’s vision for the country is one that stifles dissent and difference, in defiance of its people’s historyFour months have passed since Narendra Modi and the BJP came back to power in India, and more seems to have happened there than in the last 40 years. The sense of severance that many experience today, of being orced from the workings of the nation, exceeds even the helplessness felt during the suspension of civil liberties in the emergency of 1975 to 1977 and the political traumas that followed.This is because – without the matter being explicitly articulated – citizen has been set against citizen: not just Muslim against Hindu or, say, Kashmiris against the rest of India, but those who subscribe to the BJP’s new conception of the nation against those who do not, leaving one without trust in the other.How to judge these past four months? A series of disruptions has dwarfed the now distant seeming upset of Modi’s economically disastrous demonetisation programme of 2016. In August there was the abrogation of article 370 of the Indian constitution, which granted “special status” to Kashmir in acknowledgment of its contested history. This was followed immediately by the “house arrest” of elected Kashmiri leaders and the imprisonment of thousands of others.What we saw was the attempt to take a difficult and isive issue and simply place it to one side by an act of will, so that it requires no further discussion. There is the impression that not just the Kashmiris’ but all our fates are now being decided for us. The home minister, Amit Shah, would have us believe that the “restrictions’” in Kashmir are all in the mind. I asked a Kashmiri how she interpreted this. She speculated that what was being implied was that the lack of protest in Kashmir was equal to normalcy. But a lack of protest in a democratic country is strange, and a sustained lack of protest alarming. Is this the normalcy that Indians wish to be bestowed on them by their government?Then there is spectacle of a different sort: of the government borrowing an unprecedented sum of money from the Reserve Bank of India of it failing to pay the Central Reserve Police Force of the economy tanking, of Modi pronouncing that India is in the ascendant. We live simultaneously in disparate realities: a “normal” Kashmir, an abnormal country a bankrupt economy a rising India – competing scripts, none of which acknowledge the existence of the other, as distant as countryman has grown to countryman.If asked what this government’s one great recent achievement is, some people might draw attention to the number of toilets built in a country with poor sanitation. Others, whose experience of the new India is different, would say that its greatest success has been in creating a climate of fear. As a consequence, dissent has a purer form now. It’s no longer, as it was once, preaching to the converted. It’s not even the pointing out of unpleasant facts. It’s simply a demonstration that dissent continues to be possible.India has not, outside of Indira Gandhi’s declaration of emergency, been in this place before, and certainly not with the degree of popular support we see now, which can only be characterised as a form of inebriation. The judiciary, the police and other law enforcement agencies are all seen, rightly or wrongly, to “belong” to the government, and many high-profile lawbreakers seem to be those who, coincidentally, disagree with the BJP. The number of cases of “sedition”, a charge left over from colonial India, has risen dramatically.Of course, the erosion of institutional independence didn’t happen overnight. Over the last 30 years all governments in India, state and central, have had limited respect for civil liberties and democracy: Indian parties are only fervent democrats when they’re in opposition. But no government has been as openly and robustly punitive towards dissent as this one.Could this ferocious and successful discouragement of dissent herald the achhe din (“good times”) Modi has advertised to Indian voters at his rallies? A dissent-free country is a “normal” country a dissent-free political environment constitutes a “good time” for its rulers.I myself have first-hand experience of this. I recently signed a letter of protest addressed to the prime minister, drawing attention to increased religious violence. My co-signatories were 48 of India’s most eminent film-makers, academics, activists, artists and writers. In response to a petition in Muzzafurpur, Bihar, a court has now asked the police to open a case against us.Then there’s the National Register of Citizens (NRC), a central government-backed project in the state of Assam aimed at uncovering and expelling “foreigners” (that is, Muslim refugees from Bangladesh who don’t have the relevant documents, though the reality has turned out to be far messier, and the majority of those now deemed “foreigners” have turned out to be Hindus). Many are threatened with being uprooted, and others in the region are being asked to help uproot their neighbours. These extraordinary developments got me thinking about ethnicity and citizenship. About the trajectory of Indians in the 20th century: of Gandhi’s relocation to England and then to South Africa, where, made conscious of his race and colour, he first moved towards politics of Sikhs settling en masse in Canada after murderous violence against them in 1984 of Bengalis departing a declining Kolkata in the 70s.Indians are a many-sided people: they are entrepreneurial, curious, cultured, open-minded, adventurous. They have great writers, scientists, businessmen they have Gandhi. They’re also great migrants: they’ve gone to and worked and settled in every part of the world. They know the pain of discrimination and upheaval intimately. In this context, the fraught rhetoric surrounding the NRC, where “illegal migrant” is time and again conflated with “Muslim”, and “Muslim” with “foreigner”, shows a disconnect between what Indians have historically known, felt and achieved as migrants, despite hostility and opposition, and how, at home, they perceive those they suddenly decide are the “other”.It’s odd that our past hasn’t given us a more immediate sense of the value and inevitability of plurality, of accommodating difference. Instead, many of us have refashioned ourselves as north Indian Brahmin manqués, wanting Hindi as the official national language, wanting to be what we’re not, wanting our nation to be what it can’t be. Only a determined abstention from self-inquiry could have got us here. Rather than accepting an India where lack of dissent is expected, it is time to look inward: to recollect the journeys we’ve made, and assess whether we’ve ended up where we wanted to be.• Amit Chaudhuri is professor of contemporary literature at the University of East Anglia and an author"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48205f60c3e5f8224c41c6b1cab3c71725fe974e/0_300_5811_3488/master/5811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8de91736e2d29d6a1aa84444269a1be","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of hypnotic","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘hypnotic’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘hypnotic’.Share your photos of what hypnotic means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 9 October at 10am.

Here we chart its feathered historyFierce triumvirate of pop – Miley Cyrus, Ariana Grande and Lana Del Rey – pull out all the stops in the video for Don’t Call Me Angel. It has all the aesthetics of a classic pop video – a boxing ring à la Christina Aguilera’s Dirrty, a room full of futuristic computers, a grape buffet - but most importantly, there are three pairs of wings, adorned by its three stars.While Destiny’s Child were distinctly wing-free in the video for their Charlie’s Angels theme Independent Women Pt 1, and Pink shunned it in her Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle track, the William Orbit-fuelled Feel Good Time, the fluttering trope has appeared throughout pop’s history. It is multifaceted, too: the wing motif is not only utilised when the artist hopes to convey innocence, earnestness or the afterlife, but a new generation has realised you can sport the angelic accessories and still look hard. To pay tribute to the feathered friend, here’s a rundown of some of pop’s finest wing moments.Mariah Carey’s Butterfly wingsThe elusive musician missed an opportunity when she used galloping horses instead of be-winged caterpillars in her Butterfly video, but she has certainly milked the imagery since then. Mimi reached her wing-based peak when she brought out a soft drink called Butterfly, described as “a melodic beverage inspired by the magic of Mariah Carey”. Yes, really.Paul McCartney’s WingsLegend has it that Macca came up with the band name Wings as Stella McCartney was born. Hailed by Alan Partridge as “the band the Beatles could have been”, but lambasted by Paul McCartney as “terrible”, who can argue with the majesty of Jet?Marilyn Manson’s goth wingsJust plain scary. See also: Adam Lambert, David Bowie’s skeletal disco wings that lit up the Glass Spider tour.Westlife: Flying Without WingsIf muscle tops made a man fly, then the bestooled boyband would be soaring in the video for their 1999 MOR ballad.Kanye West: Grammys, with wingsYeezy went full angel at the 2005 Grammys, slipping into a pair of feathery numbers mid-Jesus Walks. Oh, of course he did. It’s lucky he created the heavenly ersion or it would have been remembered as the year that Maroon 5 beat him to best new artist.Miley Cyrus: Can’t Be Tamed wingsDon’t Call Me Angel is not Cyrus’s first dalliance with wings in a music video. She wore a huge pair of flappers in her clip for Can’t Be Tamed, taking the metaphor even further by cavorting in a birdcage and pole-dancing in a cage. A bit like Rachel Stevens gone bad.Lady Gaga: serial flapperMother Monster debuted a hint of wing in the Born This Way video, went minimalist angel in Applause and unleashed the full feather at 2016’s Victoria’s Secret catwalk show. She even forced her piano to wear them at the 2018 Grammys.Little Mix: WingsLittle Mix added to pop’s wing-based canon with their 2012 hit. In its video, however, it seemed that budget stretched to headgear, chairs and dancers, but no literal wings, just the metaphorical kind.Harry Styles: Sign of the Times’ wingsWho needs wings when you’ve got a voluminous coat? Styles achieved the Westlife-like feat of flying without wings in his video. He also walked on water, so there might have been a little camera trickery involved. Or strings, like on the early Steps tours, when H would fly over the audience like a freshly shaven Jesus.Billie Eilish: emo wingsEilish appeared to sprout actual wings for her All the Good Girls Go to Hell video and chucked in actual tar and fire.Katy Perry: going largeIf Grande, Cyrus and Del Ray thought they were impressing fans with their modest wings, they obviously hadn’t seen photos of Katy Perry at the 2018 Met Gala. Never knowingly understated, K-Pez added the added feathery accessories to her gold Versace dress and nearly knocked someone out.

Since his breakthrough role in the Stephen Frears-directed drama Dirty Pretty Things in 2002, Ejiofor has become a fixture in British cinema and Hollywood, with appearances in Love Actually, Kinky Boots, Children of Men, American Gangster and The Martian.Arguably his career high point (so far) was his Oscar-nominated performance as Solomon Northup in Steve McQueen’s drama 12 Years a Slave. Ejiofor has also dipped a toe in directorial waters with the Malawi-set The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, about a villager who invents a wind turbine. And that’s not even counting his stage work, which includes an acclaimed Othello at the Donmar Warehouse in 2007 and Everyman at the National Theatre in 2015.This year is a Disney one-two: we have already seen the release of The Lion King, for which Ejiofor voiced the rascally Scar in the CGI “live action” remake, and just about to arrive is Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, in which he plays a wise clan chieftain who counsels Angelina Jolie’s Maleficent.He’ll be with us for a webchat on Thursday 10 October at 1.20pm BST so send us your questions now, and we’ll get as many answered as time allows."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6f0e800035c89ebd7d89301c427f6df1653c478/1055_2018_895_537/master/895.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89fe6bdd73bfcba453523d81d919deb3","title":"david squires on premier league managers","story":"Our cartoonist looks at the managers under pressure as we enter the international break"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20f6231a1f7d24d1460e47230dc67fc827149dcf/161_454_3989_2393/master/3989.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=339790409cca25d5d19867b8de2f34fa","title":"spread word iraqis translating internet into arabic","story":"Ameen al-Jaleeli and a team of student translators are working to empower people with knowledgeWhen Islamic State overran the Iraqi city of Mosul, human life was not the only thing in peril. Knowledge was, too.Fortunately, Ameen al-Jaleeli understood this. He used a friend’s wifi to transfer a vast batch of Wikipedia files for offline usage. When the militants cut the cables in July 2016, he was ready.“Reading gives me the feeling that I’m still a human being, especially when living under Isis, because knowledge has no limits,” he said. “Even under the airstrikes, I used to put my earphones on, listen to music and read.”Jaleeli downloaded files in English because Arabic is severely underrepresented on the internet. Now that the city has been liberated from Isis, he and a team of student translators at the University of Mosul are setting about redressing that imbalance.Together, they are making Wikipedia pages, academic articles and seminal works covering science, literature and philosophy available to Arabic speakers in attempt to confront lies with logic and pit critical thinking against propaganda and fake news.Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theThe organisation’s founder, Faisal Saeed Al Mutar, grew up under the regime of Saddam Hussein. “It was kind of the motherlode of misinformation,” the 28-year-old recalls. Now he wants to arm Iraqi and Arab young people against the authoritarian regimes and extremist groups that silence erse narratives and allow violence to thrive.So far the organisation has added more than 2.1 million words to Arabic Wikipedia, including entries on female scientists, civil rights, religious ersity, evolution and conspiracy theories.The response has been remarkable. Since launching in 2017, IBB has attracted more than 1 million followers to its Facebook page, and draws more than 40,000 views across its online channels a day. It has also translated books, including Enlightenment Now by Steven Pinker and Waking Up by Sam Harris.Requests are flooding in and IBB is doubling the team of 60 translators to work with six more universities across Iraq as well as branching into Kurdish and Farsi. Every week, the team posts about a different female scientist on social media.“It’s very important to raise the understanding of people here that women can do anything,” said Shahd Shahin, 25, who recently graduated after suspending her studies for several years when Isis shut down schools and universities in Mosul.At the time, Shahin was too terrified to leave the house, so she stayed inside, reading works about science and space downloaded on her phone. “I had my books. When I read I used to go to another world.”Momen Mohamad, a third-year student, spends two hours a day translating articles for the project. He will be paid a small stipend but money is not what motivates him.“I want to do something good as a person from Mosul and show the world that we can achieve things,” he said. “Going through a really tough time helped us understand the world better and look to improve our knowledge.”IBB makes material available via PDFs, which can be downloaded for free. But on the street readers are finding their own ways to spread the word.“People have started unofficially printing our books or distributing them via Telegram and other platforms to avoid censorship,” Mutar said.What started as a translation project is rapidly becoming a youth movement, he added. “These are people who have every reason to feel hopeless – all they have known is war and destruction – yet they wake up every morning and translate stories about culture and ersity because they want to be part of a solution that makes their country a better place.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Shockingly, I feel nothingEar seeds? Is this a beat poetry thing? A nonsensical yet evocative pairing of random words, like asparagus rebel or potted moon? Inevitably, no: ear seeding is the hot new technique in wellness circles. A self-administered variant of traditional acupuncture, it takes place entirely in one’s lugs, a microcosm for the whole body.The seeds are fixed to clear, sticky discs that require a frustrating amount of care to remove from the packaging. Six seeds disappear in quick succession, lost to the carpet or the furthest reaches of my ear canal. That’s £8.60 down the old ear toilet. Unthinkably, the seeds are meant to be changed “every two to three days, but can be kept on for a week”. I’m not convinced these seeds would stay in place for three minutes if I was dead.The instructions recommend cleaning one’s ear with alcohol before application: a faff, as I’m guessing they don’t mean a rum and coke. Eventually I find a suitable alcohol cleaner, which dries my skin of oils and means the discs stay put. Unfortunately, my head now smells of a KFC wipe.Should anyone interested in golden ear seeds manage to couple up – one would assume it was with an equal idiot, but let’s pretend not – how would they explain the purchase? “I’ve bought a handful of expensive, microscopic marbles”? At least when Jack traded the family cow for magic beans, he had a beanstalk the next day. There was actual produce involved. These aren’t even real seeds. So what is the point of these gaudy little pips, these golden nuggets of futility?Ear seeds are an ancient element of Chinese medicine, sourced from an actual plant, the vaccaria herb. Yet there is nothing bling about medicine made from the seeds of a weed. Vie Healing are based in West Hollywood, a clue as to the real aim here. (Ironically, weed is popular there, too.) “Enjoy the golden look, the nourishing feeling and this unique approach to easing your symptoms,” the box reads. Vanity, novelty and nonsense, together at last. I get the feeling this is mostly about looking special.My worry, though, is that I look too special. The seeds are nestled in a part of my body I can’t see, so enjoying “the golden look” is frankly a bust. A nourishing feeling? I am mostly experiencing profound anxiety that the missing seeds might find their way into my brain and tunnel through it. As for the unique approach to easing my symptoms, I could train a pigeon to answer my emails but nothing would get done. Press or stimulate the pellets throughout the day, the box says. I walk around, stimulating my pellet and feeling – this may shock you – nothing. Well, that’s not strictly true: it turns out it’s quite painful to push tiny ballbearings into one’s sensitive bits. The 24-carat-plated “ion seeds” apparently stimulate reflex centres of the brain “to help you achieve your Calm”, a claim so foggy I can see mist coming off it.Of course, many believe ear seeds placed on meridian lines clear up qi blockages, which may be true. Even if not, the placebo effect is powerful. But I would rather have a trained practitioner apply them, rather than this keyhole surgery with oven mitts.In fairness, the seeds remain in place for days, even after sleep and showers. They are non-invasive and harmless but also ineffective. I resemble a poundshop Lady Gaga who has lost his tiny marbles. You would be better off sticking 24 golden carrots up your arse.Vie Healing? Not v healing at all.Earful. I mean awful. 15 This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

They were close friends for more than a decade before they became a coupleWhen Dee and Joe became neighbours in 1973, it wasn’t love at first sight. “He moved in to my block of flats with his wife and their two children,” says Dee, who was a single mother at the time. “I didn’t see him in a romantic way.” There were a lot of young families in this block in south-west London and it was a tightknit community. “We were neighbours first,” says Joe. “Then we became friends. It was a really nice place to live.” A year later Dee met a new partner and moved to a house nearby, but they never lost contact. “Joe and I stayed friends and we’d often take the children out for meals.”The relationship remained platonic, but Joe says it was clear they enjoyed doing the same things. “It wasn’t romance but we were always happy going out as a group with our families,” he says. “I worked shifts for London Underground, so I’d often take her boys out when I wasn’t working.” Dee went on to have two more children with her new partner, never imagining that there could be anything more than friendship between her and Joe.By the early 1980s, Dee’s mum had became unwell and moved in with her. To help the family, Joe came over to do the gardening.“At the time I’d gone back to college to take my A-levels and I think this really inspired Joe,” says Dee. “One day he answered one of my essay questions and when I showed it to my tutor, she said: ‘He should be doing a degree.’” Joe had never had the opportunity to complete his education, and believed that studying could open new doors. “Life was OK, but I felt like I could achieve more. Dee really encouraged me with that in a way others hadn’t.” After completing his exams, Joe went on to further education and eventually trained as a social worker.When they began studying together, it became apparent that something in their relationship had shifted. “I just looked at him one day and realised that I couldn’t imagine my life without him.” Both Dee and Joe had drifted apart from their partners, but were careful about exploring their new love. “It was a difficult situation and we kept getting together and breaking up for a while,” says Dee. The pair finally became an official couple in 1987, when they both realised they wouldn’t be happy unless they were together. Although it was a “strange transition” from being friends, they’ve never regretted it. “Joe makes me laugh until my sides split. I always tell people if you want a really amazing relationship, be with someone who is your best friend.”As a white woman and a mixed-race man, they had to deal with some bigoted comments. Although Joe has experienced racism all his life, this was a shock for Dee. “We had people saying a few rude things to us when we got together, which never happened when we were friends.”Despite some difficult times, the pair have only grown closer over the years. “I love that Dee is such a ‘doer’,” says Joe. “Any suggestion she makes I know it will be great. We’ve been on a brilliant journey together.”The couple got married in 1995 and adopted a daughter seven years later. “Between us we’ve got seven children, 13 grandchildren and two dogs, so we’re always busy,” says Dee. The pair are now in their 70s, but have no desire to slow down. They love travelling, spending time with their family and having new adventures. “I love how Joe is so easy-going and always goes along with whatever I suggest,” Dee says.Thirty-two years since they got together, the romance is as strong as ever. “It always feels new and exciting to me, and I feel happy when I know I’m going to see him,” says Dee.“And I always feel happy to see the dogs,” laughs Joe. “No, I’m just kidding. I always look forward to seeing Dee. We have amazing lives.”Want to share your story?

But when times got tough, she realised keeping up with appearances can only make you lose sight of life’s meaningI arrive at six in the morning, two hours before the store opens. Awaiting me is an aisle of boxes, stacked up. One last sip of my coffee, then I put on my gloves and take a big breath. Time to go in.I lug boxes, slash open tops with my cutter, put new packages of whole‑grain seeded bread, naan and seasonal sugar cookies on the shelves, and then haul the overstock to the back freezer. It takes me nearly an hour to stack all the boxes in the right places, label them and leave the freezer clean. Then I walk to the bakery department and make sure the doughnuts are glazed and set in the case, waiting.By eight o’clock, when the store opens, I have made an inviting space for the first customers. At 10, during my lunch break, I meet my husband at the sports bar down the street for a plate of hash browns, sausages and eggs over easy. I am hungry. I have worked hard.I am a James Beard award–winning gluten‑free cookbook author. And for nine months, I worked in our local grocery store for $15 an hour.It is the best job I have ever worked.Online, no one knows you are poor. No one is posting photos of the basket of bills overflowing, some of the envelopes with urgent stamped on them. Very few people write about the choices they make out of fear of going bankrupt, like selling expensive camera lenses that feel less important than rent. And few of us want to admit that we are struggling with money, even though we live in a culture where the rich have grown astronomically rich and the rest of us have grown anxious about health insurance. As my friend Ashley Ford wrote online one day: “I’m trying to choose an insurance plan, but I’m pretty sure the only good insurance is wealth.”I never shared online the time that my husband Danny and I looked at our bank account and saw $85 left for the last week of the month. We didn’t have a savings account. We didn’t have a 401(k) to drain for emergency funds. I had already done that eight years before. Our credit score was shot by the medical bills we couldn’t pay after my daughter Lucy’s terrifying time and the hospital stay for my ministroke.We had only $85 and no way to charge anything on a credit card. Luckily, we were expecting a $6,000 check from a freelance gig, but it had been delayed. Still, we were like most Americans – living paycheck to paycheck (almost eight out of 10 Americans, according to reputable studies) and unable to pay for an unexpected bill of more than $500 (nearly six out of 10 Americans). We were struggling. And we were terrified. I realized that the mindset of worrying that we might go broke was damaging us.I was no longer interested in following my bliss. I wanted to pay my bills.Several artist friends recommended I find a manual labor job, one that would require none of my mind. I had never worked a job that merely asked me to show up. I found out that working part‑time at the grocery store – three days a week – would give me health insurance for the entire family. And maybe putting premade pies on a display table would give me some time to think. So the next time I took a case of our gluten‑free flour mix into our grocery store, I delivered an invoice and a job application. They hired me that week.They put me in the bakery. Since I have celiac, I can’t eat even a bit of gluten. But the bakery section in the grocery store is almost all packages, and I’m not allergic to plastic. It was a bit of a shock, at first, not being able to stop what I was doing to work on an essay or take photographs. Or check Twitter. After years of being a freelancer, I couldn’t believe how wild my mind was when asked to do a task and then check back with my supervisor (a former student of mine) to ask what task she wanted me to complete next. I noticed that my mind balked. I kept working. And after a few weeks of shelving bags of croutons and cleaning out the cake case, I started to enjoy the wildness of my mind. At the store, I had to show up on time, do my work, then leave it all behind. I didn’t know work could be that easy.Friends came into the store and we would talk in three‑minute bursts as I stocked frozen pizzas. Customers asked me questions about where we kept that one brand of whole‑wheat bread, since it was the only one their kids would eat. I answered dozens of little questions a day. I realized that I liked feeling useful.And all day long, I saw people, in tiny bantering interactions and questions. I developed a daily routine with fellow employees: a check‑in at the cheese counter, a quick conversation about politics in produce. I would never have met any of these people I came to like, any other way. I started to feel like part of the community of my town.On my lunch hours, I sat at the front of the store, taking notes. On the backs of papers that read “Grain‑free flatbread, $6.49 each”, I started writing lists. I look back at them now and realize I was clearing my mind of how I had lived. I wrote lists of what I wanted to accomplish in our house, our medical appointments, our taxes. I jotted down ideas for how to let go of my blog, Gluten‑Free Girl. And I started taking notes on what I noticed about customers who had less money than most.I noticed that the people who lived on the day‑old breads around furtively to make sure no one saw when they reached into the discount bin. I led one woman to the back of the store to find the package of day‑old rolls I had put in there, the gravy packets on sale, and some croutons for stuffing. “Thank you!” she said before she put her arms around me. “I’m going to have Thanksgiving because of you.”Each day, at about two, I walked to the back freezer with a laminated list and a tall cart. I pulled boxes down from the top of the back freezer. Methodically, with plastic gloves on, I pulled the doughnuts – raspberry filled, Bavarian cream, chocolate glazed – and put them on black trays in a specified pattern. I was in the freezer by myself, pulling the doughnuts, humming a little. And then I wheeled the cart to the cooler, ready for the morning crew to bake them the next day.Years before, I would have disdained these doughnuts: full of sugar, premade months before in a factory.In the second year of my blog, I wrote a silly little piece about how Danny and I stood in line at the store and wondered at the crap in other people’s carts. I received emails telling me I was being a food snob. At first defensive – come on, America eats lousy food! – I came to understand how wrong I had been. A woman shared with me how little she makes on her teaching salary in Oklahoma, how she visits the food bank to make it, and how a trip to the grocery store for cheap cake is an experience only reserved for once in a while when she can’t stand the shame anymore. I was chastened and changed. And now I try to do better. How do I know that the woman buying the 99‑cent doughnuts at our store isn’t giving her two kids the only treat she can afford that week? And who am I to say that they shouldn’t eat those doughnuts?One day, I had a long conversation with the store’s owner. At 89 years old, he had owned the store for 53 years. His grandson had taken over managing the store, but the owner still clocked in twenty hours a week. Mostly, he spent that time in the city, at a store in a low‑income neighborhood. He consulted a list of the 20 top‑selling foods at our store. If the price in the city was lower, he called his grandson and told him to lower the price on ours. I stopped him one day to thank him for all that he did for our community. He told me: “It befuddles me that people put their focus on what is happening across the country and the world. There is enough to do here.”A few months after I started working there, I switched away from the bakery to bagging groceries. I loved the rhythm of fitting in food like a Jenga game. I have a lot of friends on the island. People who recognized me from my website came through my line. It took me a while to stop talking so much and focus on my work instead. (The assistant manager had to reprimand me in his office for that. I learned fast.) So I had the chance to do what I have always loved most: observe people when they’re not watching me.I learned that very few people make the highly styled dishes offered on Instagram. Oh sure, about every two weeks someone would come through with a bag full of vegetables, determined to juice for 30 days to lose weight. A few people bought jo‑jo potatoes from the deli and an energy drink. But both of these were the outliers. Instead, most people bought meats, cheeses, some fruits and vegetables, three to five packaged crunchy foods, cat litter, toilet paper, beverages, butter, pads and some kind of sweet thing or two. Maybe three people a day were buying ingredients for a specific recipe. Over and over, I saw that what my fellow recipe developers and I hashed out to make ourselves relevant – Vegan treats for the whole family! How to use hempseed! – was not being made in most homes. It humbled me.I started paying attention to the people who shopped for the entire week with a plan. I took note of their food as I bagged it and how much it cost. I compared it to the people – like my husband and me – who shopped at the last moment. We were spending too much money on food. I started buying our meat from the discount bin and giving ourselves a limit on how much money we could spend each day. Our grocery bill started to grow smaller. Shopping was no longer a decadent pleasure for us but a mindset for being able to cook and eat without stress.I left the job, eventually, because another opportunity worth more money walked into my path. And then, when that fell through, the next step arrived. Danny is the one working three days a week now, expediting in a restaurant, mostly for the connection with our community. I no longer earn any money online.When I go back to the store, every Sunday, my daughter skipping next to the cart, I hug my friends who work there. As I pass the front counter on my way out, I remember the urgency of those lunch‑hour breaks – writing notes on the backs of recycled sale signs, where I first imagined the idea, then created the structure, and jotted down some of the first sentences for this book."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51668215fd016c829056dd38e3a364defaeb026b/117_161_3220_1931/master/3220.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=905099994d87e5b40803a6a67260e734","title":"lloyd cole and the commotions how we made rattlesnakes","story":"‘I was showing off with words – I’d read about Bob Dylan seducing women by writing songs for them’My idea was to be some sort of male Aretha Franklin, but then the five of us realised we could make this distinctive noise together. Between 1983 and 84, we went from being a wimpy band who sounded like the Style Council to more of a rock band. When I wrote Are You Ready to Be Heartbroken? it made us realise what we could do. I took a Portastudio to my room in Glasgow Golf Club, where my parents worked and lived, and wrote Perfect Skin and Forest Fire. Not one song on Rattlesnakes was more than a year old when it was recorded.Many of the songs are based on a year I spent in London studying law, when I was 18 or 19. The landscape for the album was my imagination. I’d been to Europe once, but my romantic imagery was from books or films. I stumbled on a way of creating an image with very few words. Everyone knows exactly what a “Grace Kelly car” looks like, and it’s probably in the south of France. I sang “Read Norman Mailer, get a new tailor” because he represented masculinity, the hard man. Similarly, Simone de Beauvoir represented modern feminist thinking.Perfect Skin’s Louise wasn’t real, though. I’d read about Bob Dylan seducing women by writing songs for them, so I was showing off with words: “She’s got cheekbones like geometry and eyes like sin and she’s sexually enlightened by Cosmopolitan.” When I sing that live now, I go: “Who isn’t?”The idea for the song Rattlesnakes came from a line in Joan Didion’s book, Play It As It Lays: “Life is a crap game, and there are rattlesnakes under every rock.” I sing that someone “looks like Eve Marie Saint” because she looked how I thought these characters in my songs should look: beautiful fragility.It was very exciting. We’d been playing gigs to 500 people in Glasgow, but empty rooms in England. Then Perfect Skin came out, Radio 1 played us, we did Top of the Pops, and we never played an empty room again.I was playing with Alan McGee when a friend told me that this English guy had borrowed his Portastudio and was writing fantastic songs. Lloyd was different then, awkward and gauche. He wore tweed, smoked Player’s Navy Cut and had that hair, so he probably felt a bit weird in Glasgow.He had an encyclopedic knowledge of pop music. We had black girl singers and were trying to be a soul band, when Bobby Bluebell interviewed us for a Glasgow magazine. He told Lloyd to listen to Dylan’s Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde albums and he was right, that was the turning point. I wrote the chords for Are You Ready to Be Heartbroken? and Lloyd wrote the lyrics.The arts weren’t just for posh people. Most of us were on the dole, which gave us time to create. I woke up one morning with the riff for Rattlesnakes in my head. I said to my girlfriend: “I’ve got to get this down on the Portastudio NOW!” She was like: “You’ve what?”Getting Paul Hardiman as producer was incredibly exciting. He’d just finished The The’s Soul Mining, and he was great at marshalling a young, naive bunch from Glasgow in our first major recording, working in John Foxx’s Garden Studio in London. One night, the rest of the band wanted to go for a curry, but I wanted to put more guitar on Forest Fire.I came up with this epic solo, and Paul and I stayed up all night recording it. At 2am, with everything turned up, it sounded incredible, but the next day I thought we’d gone over the top and wanted to take some of it off. Paul said: “No, play it to everyone as it is” and everyone agreed it was incredible, so we left it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c275ede9dca6e54350239811aa2761c93e1c4023/0_0_6537_3922/master/6537.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0aee42e8ee5120c99caea0a71d4df2a8","title":"reality tv social media and living your life online with jia tolentino","story":"Jia Tolentino, described as one of the world’s greatest young essayists, discusses how the age of the internet has fundamentally changed who we are.

And after the Windrush scandal, we know what that looks like. By  Amelia GentlemanIn early May, Doris Ratnam sat at her kitchen table, trying to scan her German passport with her mobile phone. She was applying for “settled status” in the UK, the new immigration status the 3.4 million or so EU nationals living in Britain need to acquire if they want to stay in the country legally after Brexit. Ratnam, who is 72 and has lived in London since arriving as an au pair in 1968, was annoyed that she should be required to apply to remain in a country she considers her home.She was flustered by the process of attempting to get her phone to suck all her personal details out of her passport. Something was not working, and we sat for 20 minutes in near silence as she moved the phone slowly over the cover of the passport, as shown in a reassuring Home Office Youtube video, trying to get it to read the chip hidden inside the document. “Move the phone to read the chip,” Ratnam muttered, studying the guidance notes. “What am I supposed to do? Move the phone to find the chip. I feel stressed … it’s the technology.”After repeated failed attempts, the app informed her she had been locked out of the system for 24 hours. It would take two-and-a-half months, two visits to the local town hall (an hour on two buses each way), a £15 appointment fee and numerous calls to a Home Office helpline before her status was approved. The process was dispiriting. “I shouldn’t be made to feel like a foreigner again after such a long time here,” she said.Before the end of June 2021, if Britain leaves the EU with a deal, or by 31 December 2020 with no deal, all EU nationals resident in the UK must have applied for settled status if they want to continue living and working here. The EU settled status scheme is designed to fulfil the government’s promise that all EU citizens, their family members, and dependants living here before Brexit, will be entitled to remain, with no diminishment of their rights. Anyone who has lived here continuously for five years should, in theory, be able to get settled status easily people who have been here for less than five years will be granted “pre-settled” status, requiring them to reapply for permanent status once they have racked up enough years of continuous residence (which means not leaving the country for more than six months a year).For Europeans in the UK, the Home Office’s “EU Exit: ID Document Check” app is the gateway between belonging and exclusion. How well this piece of software works will be a crucial factor in the government’s attempts to present Brexit as a success. In the past year, almost 1.5 million Europeans living in the UK have grappled with the Home Office application process and managed to secure settled or pre-settled status. The Home Office would like us to celebrate this as a bureaucratic success story, and in a very optimistic frame of mind, perhaps we might.The government has allocated about £460m to the scheme, of which about £50m was spent on developing this unflashy app, its opening pages headed with the outline of a crown on a royal blue background. At the launch of the scheme in March, a Home Office radio advertising campaign reassured people: “It is free, and all you need is your passport or ID card and to complete an online form.”In May, I was taken on a tour of the Home Office’s Liverpool offices, where 1,500 workers were then handling about 6,000 “settled status” applications a day (it has since risen to 20,000). At the end of the tour, one of the senior civil servants in charge of the scheme said it would be good to see media coverage emphasising how well things are working. “In an ideal world, we want you to write an article saying you have come here, and there’s nothing to be afraid of.”After the deadline, those who have failed to apply will gradually be transformed from legal residents into undocumented migrants. In the hostile environment – the obstructive and unwelcoming bureaucratic culture promoted by Theresa May when she was home secretary – they will be unable to work, rent somewhere to live, access free healthcare, drive, open a bank account, get a mobile phone contract or travel without being asked to prove their status. They will gradually discover that normal life has become impossible.The Home Office has never attempted a digital exercise on this scale. All the unknowns – numbers, timing, terms of the deal – have presented developers with unexpected challenges. By the end of January, two months before it was due to launch nationally, IT specialists working for the Home Office had successfully designed a scheme that charged applicants £65. Days before the app was rolled out for public testing, they were told that the fees were too politically sensitive and needed to be scrapped – leaving them no time to rebuild the app without the fee pages. So, as an awkward last-minute fix, initial applicants were charged anyway and had to get their money refunded later. The decision to scrap the fee also meant the government instantly lost about £190m of revenue that the scheme was meant to bring in.“They were trying to deliver the biggest, most contentious new system that any of them had likely ever worked on, while the basic requirements were changing around them, even days before they went live,” said Joe Owen, the programme director of the Institute for Government, a thinktank working to make government more effective. Owen has been tracing the development of the scheme since the EU referendum.One major problem was that the scheme does not yet work on the iPhone. The Home Office has been struggling with Apple’s refusal to allow third-party developers to use its contactless system since the start of the app’s development. Given that iPhones account for almost half the smartphones in the UK, this creates a major headache for applicants. Many people have had to borrow phones, or take the longer route of sending off their passports for manual scanning. Officials say the app should begin to be available on iPhones later this month.Another complication is that it is not known how many EU nationals there are in the UK. The figure of 3.4 million that the government is basing all its plans on is thought by many to be an underestimate.“Nobody knows exactly how many are eligible,” said Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. The government’s estimate was “almost certain to be too low because it doesn’t include people living in non-private addresses like hostels or care homes, and the figures are thought to undercount several groups – new arrivals, EUnon-EU dual citizens, and people who spend part of the year outside the UK.”Nor does the estimate include close family members from non-EU countries, who are also eligible under this scheme. The total number of people who need to apply could perhaps be as high as 4 million.For the moment the political rhetoric remains warm, and officials say people who have a good reason for missing the deadline will be allowed a “reasonable” further period to apply, but the small print spells out the chilling consequences of failing to get status. Although politicians are not currently choosing to highlight this publicly, the Home Office has made it clear in planning documents that, from January 2021 (in a no-deal scenario), anyone without valid UK immigration status “will be liable to enforcement action, detention and removal as an immigration offender”.It is not surprising that so many of the 3 million-plus are feeling vulnerable and furious. They were demonised by the leave campaign as the problem to which Brexit was the solution they have faced years of hostile newspaper headlines they are angry that the scheme has been developed as an application process rather than a registration scheme (meaning that the status is only acquired by successfully applying for it under a registration scheme, EU citizens who had failed to apply successfully for the status would not immediately become illegal). They point out that this is not the automatic guarantee of rights the Vote Leave campaign and the government promised. Being forced to apply for the right to stay in their homes has been the final insult. For all its royal blue neutrality, many see the app as performing a distasteful political function – locating them, counting them and classifying them.Meanwhile, all over Europe, about 1.4 million expatriate Britons are anxiously monitoring the scheme, aware that their own treatment could depend largely on how generously the UK government treats EU citizens.In April 2018, it emerged that thousands of people who had been born in Commonwealth countries and moved to the UK as children in the 1960s and 70s, when there was free movement between Britain and its former colonies, had become the victims of changes to immigration legislation. In what became known as the Windrush scandal, those who had never applied for British passports found themselves wrongly classified as immigration offenders. Some were detained and removed from the UK, back to countries they had not visited in half a century. Others lost their jobs or homes or were denied NHS treatment.Their experiences have alarmed EU nationals. The scandal highlighted how poor the Home Office’s capacity is for accurately identifying who is living in the UK legally or illegally, and its reputation has crystallised as an institution that combines malice with incompetence. Many of those obliged to apply for the scheme find the prospect of giving all their personal details to the Home Office disturbing.For about a quarter of applicants, the process is more complicated than simply submitting passport details and completing an online form. The Advertising Standards Authority has recently ruled that the reassuring Home Office radio advertisement must not be broadcast again, after a complainant pointed out that in some cases applicants had to provide much more documentation than just a passport or ID card.Since the beginning of the year, Labour has been warning of looming problems with the system, even talking of “Windrush on steroids”. But such warnings are often firmly slapped down as just being part of “project fear”. (“I find your comparisons to Windrush inappropriate,” Priti Patel, the home secretary, told the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, this month.)Even the Conservative and arch Brexiter MEP Daniel Hannan has voiced concern on Twitter, warning that he has had cases of EU nationals in his south-east England constituency being denied settled status despite living in the UK for years. “This is a breach of the assurances I and others gave during the referendum.” He called on Patel “to sort this out … before we end up with another Windrush scandal”.Nicolas Hatton, co-founder of the3million, an organisation set up to support EU nationals, describes the decision to introduce an application system with a cut-off date as a timebomb, because so many will fail to apply on time. Switching metaphors, he warns this will be an “illegal immigrants factory … designed to create thousands and thousands of illegal immigrants”.At the Home Office building in Liverpool, where many of the 1,500 people employed to process the applications are based, there is a relentlessly positive atmosphere. Everyone here is aware of the damage done to the Home Office’s reputation by Windrush. In recent years, the Home Office has been condemned by politicians for being steeped in a “culture of disbelief”, where staff are expected to probe for tiny inconsistencies in the accounts of refugees, and where officials are instructed to “deport first, hear appeals later”.Many Windrush victims described how they had tried repeatedly to explain that they were not illegal immigrants, but had been ignored, or simply unable to find a Home Office caseworker ready to listen. Before she resigned, Amber Rudd apologised for the “appalling” actions of her own department, blaming a culture in the Home Office which had “lost sight of iniduals” and become “too concerned with policy”. In turn, her successor Sajid Javid promised to introduce a “fairer, more compassionate” immigration system. This hasn’t materialised in most of the department, according to immigration lawyers and caseworkers, but in these open-plan offices in Liverpool, up an escalator, above a Tesco and a florist, something does appear to have changed.If things are working, the full application should take about 15 minutes (there are a few more questions on residency and criminality once ID checks are completed). Under the new scheme, the Home Office doesn’t care if applicants are self-sufficient, studying or working – simply whether they are resident in the UK or not this is verified by making instant checks with HMRC. Applicants have to do three things: prove their identity, show that they live in the UK and declare any criminal convictions. Once data has been scanned from people’s passports via their phone, they have to take a selfie, so the app can identify if the correct person is applying. The app checks identity through facial matching in the same way travellers are checked in airports at e-passport gates.To reduce the possibility of fraud, there is no physical document at the end of the process, just a digital record, which can be shared with a landlord or an employer (after Brexit, they will have to check EU nationals’ eligibility) via a time-limited unique code, on a smartphone.On one floor in Liverpool, staff sit at computers flicking through screens. A passport photograph flashes up, and the employee checks to make sure it matches the selfie taken and submitted through the app. Although much of the system is automated, every case is checked by a human before a decision is made. These human checks can take just 10 minutes. Some people are getting an email back telling them they have settled status within a couple of hours.When I visited, there was a homely smell of microwaved stew helium balloons hovered over the desk of someone who had been given a baby shower. Special EU Settlement Resolution Centre teacups have been printed for staff, with inspirational slogans on them. Most of the staff are newly hired, many of them students. One of the few longer-serving members of staff, who has worked at the Home Office for five years, said it was a relief not to have to be so sceptical when dealing with people’s applications. “Before the onus was more on ‘prove it’. Now we are doing everything we can to help,” she said. “When I first joined, it was noticeable that not many cases would result in us issuing the applicant with what they needed.”The only people likely to be refused will be those with “persistent and serious” criminal records and, so far, only one person has been refused – although a number of people have been dismayed to get the lesser, more precarious pre-settled status, despite having been in the UK for more than five years. Campaigners suspect that the difficult cases may be going to the bottom of the pile, to keep the figures looking favourable.When the project began, one of the senior civil servants in charge ordered a number of copies of a book called In Limbo, compiled by an Italian translator Elena Remigi, so he and colleagues could read the 144 testimonies of EU nationals resident in Britain, people who were worried about their post-Brexit future here, people who are, the blurb says, “haunted by the poignant question: where is home?” They say the book helped them understand the worries faced by those being asked to apply. Videos have been made for people who struggle with literacy, there is helpline assistance for those who are not confident with technology. The guidance has been translated into all 26 languages (although the helpline advice is only available in English and Welsh). In addition, £9m has been allocated to funding charities (organisations such as Citizens Advice and the East European Resource Centre) to help an estimated 200,000 vulnerable or hard to reach people to apply. Downstairs there is a hotline this is the first time in 10 years that people have been able to call a Home Office number and speak to a caseworker, rather than an employee at an outsourced firm, reading from a script.In August, Patel announced an end to freedom of movement in a no-deal scenario at the end of next month. Officials quickly had to clarify on her behalf that free movement would not be ending on that date (since EU law continues to apply until its legal foundation is repealed). Unfortunately, the home secretary’s premature announcement led to a spike in calls leading to long waiting times.“We’re trying to change the perception of the Home Office,” the woman who heads the call centre said. Staff have dealt with a lot of people who were “upset, frightened and angry”, she said. “We understand why. This is something that has happened to those people. They weren’t consulted or even given a vote in it. They are now having to apply for something that they always had.”Windrush victims waited years for anyone to pay attention to their difficulties with the Home Office, as they lost jobs and homes and faced detention. By comparison, a mildly famous French baker or Polish chef struggling with the EU status app need only send an irritated Tweet for newspapers to print outraged articles. The reality TV celebrity Fred Sirieix, after tweeting his frustration, had calls from the Home Office within 24 hours to resolve things. Home Office staff seem at pains to act fast to resolve high-profile cases, to quell the noise but less clear is what happens to those who have less of a public profile.For some people, the experience is genuinely easy. Some people describe doing it while sitting on the sofa at home, and being pleasantly surprised at getting an email confirming that they have been granted settled status within hours. The difficulty is that while around three-quarters are getting through easily and a quarter need to submit further information, a small proportion will have more complicated experiences.We already know that too many people are wrongly being allocated pre-settled status instead of the more permanent settled status, a problem that came up during the testing phase, Home Office staff told me. “One of the things we were surprised about in early testing was that people thought they were clicking the button for full settled status, but they were actually accepting pre-settled status, and then being surprised. So we tried to make quite a lot of changes to the guidance to reinforce that,” an official said.But the problem persists, and campaigners say there are still oddities in the design of the application form, which does not ask people how long they have lived in the UK or which status they hope to get. Only the most well-informed applicants will know they can challenge an incorrect allocation of pre-settled status.The immigration lawyer Chris Desira has spoken to audiences of EU nationals at more than 200 information sessions arranged by embassies and community groups all over the UK in the past three years. He has identified many vulnerable groups who might find it hard to supply the evidence required to prove that they qualify for settled status – elderly people, people with disabilities, children in care, stay-at-home women who haven’t worked or paid bills, and victims of domestic abuse whose partners have all their papers. He is conscious that the awareness of the need to apply has not got through to everyone. “I am massively worried, massively,” said Desira. He has seen older people who have been here for decades crying in meetings, worried they are going to be put on a plane out of the country. “Even when you tell them, ‘I am confident that if you fill in this form, you will be fine, you will get settled status’, the anxiety and the stress and everything that is happening around them prevents them from hearing that message.”His concerns are echoed by Chai Patel of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, who warns that the scheme is set up to be easy for people who are “wealthy, well-educated people”. He is concerned at the absence of a physical document proving status. “The scheme is very easy if you know your rights, you’re online and you’re bolshie enough to be able to stand up for what you’re entitled to. It won’t work so well for the more vulnerable. We are expecting hundreds of thousands of people to be left without status if the scheme continues as it is,” he said.I met Chris Desira at an event organised in a central London YMCA hall by the German embassy earlier this year, where he and two German diplomats, attempted to answer the questions of people confused by what they needed to do in order to ensure they could continue to live in the UK. While the official line appeared to be “Don’t panic”, the cumulative effect of almost two hours of anxious questions left many feeling disturbed.One by one, German citizens stood up to voice their alarm. “It’s giving me stomach ache. I’ve been here since 1961,” one woman said, before being reassured that she simply needed to make the application, and she would be fine. (Stephanie Dawoud of the immigration charity Imix, who was translating into my ear, said most of the meetings she had attended had a similar feeling of distress, particularly among older people, who were particularly worried by the unfamiliar notion of apps and applying digitally.) A woman in her 30s was worried about whether she should transfer her business out of the country.The German diplomat presiding over the occasion (who asked not to be named) exhibited a mournful sense of humour at some of the questions.“What happens to German civil servants?” someone asked.“I would love to know that, too!” the diplomat replied.“Can I come into the country after Brexit?” one woman asked.“Yes, unless you scare the people are the border into thinking you are a threat to national security,” said the diplomat.“Should I stockpile food?” another wanted to know, to wry laughter from the room.“The exciting thing is that you’re jumping into a big black hole,” the diplomat replied.There were questions about eligibility to healthcare in a no-deal scenario, questions about how to apply for dual nationality and questions about how UK pensions would be uprated if they were paid in Germany. “I have no information whatsoever on how it will pan out. You don’t know what the British government will do,” the diplomat said sadly. Doris Ratnam was at the back of the room, wondering how she was going to organise herself to apply. She had left her small Black Forest village near Baden Baden in 1968, aged 20, hoping to learn English, a language that neither of her parents spoke. She married a Malaysian citizen in London he became naturalised decades ago, but she didn’t want to, because for a long time it was difficult to get British citizenship without losing your German passport. (That changed in the pre-Brexit period.)She felt disheartened at applying for a status she considered to be hers already, as well as alarmed by the digital application. She invited me to watch the process of using the app in May, at her neat north-west London home, reached through a garden of pink roses and trimmed hedges. “I’ve been paying taxes here for 50 years, it should be simple,” she said, offering me coffee and ginger snaps.But her passport could not be read by the app, even though she had travelled through a passport e-gate, which uses the same technology, only four days earlier.The process of applying had made her think about her attitudes to Britishness. “I find it difficult to know after all this time whether I feel at home here. I certainly don’t feel British, like a British person, but I have English friends … I feel in-between I feel both. There’s a saying: the British are too polite to be honest, the Germans are too honest to be polite. I think there is something in it.”On the helpline, after much time listening to jangly hold music, the Home Office helper was both polite and honest, but had no answer as to why the app was not reading the digital code. She was advised to seek out one of the 80 designated EU settlement scheme scanning offices (in council offices and town hall register offices) where the passport could be scanned manually.It took weeks for Ratnam to get an appointment at Ealing town hall, but she finally went on 4 July, consulting a photocopied map to find room 1.13, winding right, then left along echoing corridors, then right, then left again, up some marble steps, past a bust of Chopin through the beautiful, almost empty mock-gothic building, soon to be decommissioned and turned into a boutique hotel. Once we arrived at a small, pink-doored room, the official inside was unable to help, also attempting to swipe the passport on a phone until the system locked her out, too. So Ratnam then sat in the waiting room on the phone to the resolution centre in Liverpool for another 40 minutes , asking for help. “I can only advise that the application is locked for 24 hours. We can’t override that,” an official said. “For the time being there is nothing further we can do to help.”“I’m just fed up,” Ratnam said, a red flush of worry creeping up her neck. “I’m getting worked up I can’t even get my words out. I don’t want to keep trying.”She organised a second appointment at the town hall on 10 July. The passport was finally scanned, quite easily, that day, but two days later she received an email asking her to upload an image of her old passport showing a historic stamp giving her indefinite leave to remain. The same email told her that the Home Office could find no record of her indefinite leave to remain and wanted to “confirm that you are related to your EU family member as claimed”. The email was a mistake. She couldn’t work out how to upload the passport there was another long phone call to Liverpool on 15 July, after which she managed to send off the picture.“I can hear it in your voice, how anxious you are,” a call handler told her.“Why can’t you just check my HMRC records?” Ratnam asked. “I’ve been paying tax for long enough.”On 16 July, an email arrived telling her that her documents had been sent in an “unsupported format and we have been unable to attach the files to your application”. But puzzlingly, a minute later, a second email arrived, saying that her “application to the EU Settlement Scheme has been successful”.Ratnam has managed to secure her status. Nothing catastrophic went wrong with her application – just a series of irritations that sucked up her time and lowered her mood. Similar irritations will be felt by tens of thousands of others going through the process, reinforcing a sense of alienation. “I’m annoyed that I had to do it after 50 years here. There were mistakes and it was stressful. I don’t feel welcome having to go through a process like that.”Campaigners worry most about those who do not realise they need to apply, or those who have difficulties converting their pre-settled status into the permanent settled status in the years that follow Brexit. Nicolas Hatton of the 3million charity warns: “On 1 January 2021, if there is no deal, and you haven’t applied, you will be an illegal immigrant. The hostile environment is no joke. That’s when the timebomb will explode.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc96a16dfed7c8a44b3f89b2a4c5658400864642/0_130_5576_3345/master/5576.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=224615a91da94e06192826b94a8a6235","title":"no deal brexit would push national debt to levels last seen in 60s","story":"IFS says public borrowing will more than double next year whatever the Brexit resultEmergency tax cuts and higher public spending to offset the impact of a no-deal Brexit would send government debt to its highest level in more than half a century, according to Britain’s leading experts on the public finances.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the scale of the government response required to firefight a flatlining economy in the event of a disorderly departure from the EU would come with a hefty price tag for the public purse.In a warning to Boris Johnson as his Brexit plan risked unravelling in the face of stiff opposition at home and abroad, the thinktank said government borrowing was already set to more than double next year regardless of the outcome of negotiations with Brussels.Coming as the prime minister increases funding for healthcare, schools and police, the IFS said a mini-boom in public spending would be followed by another bust because the government would likely struggle to handle the impact of no-deal Brexit, which would shrink the size of the economy and cause debt levels to rise.In a warning that a new wave of austerity could be introduced in the future to limit further debt increases, Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS, said: “You could well be on an upward spiral of debt and deficit – and in a world in which we have to go through another period of austerity to undo it.”Against a backdrop of mounting speculation over possible tax giveaways ahead of an election, including potential for a cut in fuel duty for motorists, Paul Johnson warned the prime minister that such moves would be dangerous given the heightened level of uncertainty facing the economy and the future state of the public finances.“The government is now adrift without any effective fiscal anchor. Given the extraordinary level of uncertainty and risks facing the economy and public finances, it should not be looking to offer further permanent overall tax giveaways in any forthcoming budget,” he added.In analysis ahead of a government budget this autumn, the IFS said the deficit – the shortfall between government spending and income from taxes – was already on track to rise to more than £50bn next year from £29.3bn currently, as a result of changes in the treatment of student loans in the national accounts and as Boris Johnson ramps up public spending.However, it said no-deal Brexit could cause economic growth to flatline in 2020-21, even if the Bank of England cut interest rates and the government stepped in with emergency tax cuts and higher spending.The budget deficit peaked in 2009-10 after the banking crisis at almost £160bn, before gradually falling as David Cameron and George Osborne cut spending using a policy of austerity to reduce it.The government’s tax and spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, forecast this year that the deficit should fall to £21.2bn in 2020-21. However, it made its estimate in March on the basis of a smooth Brexit deal.After a decade of austerity the IFS said the government’s near-£14bn spending plans outlined by Sajid Javid, the chancellor, at last month’s spending round for 2020-21 would only return public funding for services as a percentage of national income to levels seen in 2006-07.It said the plans for day-to-day spending next year had taken Conservative policy close to offering the same level of funding for public services implied by Labour’s 2017 manifesto.The IFS said the government had in effect abandoned the former chancellor Philip Hammond’s borrowing rules, including a Conservative manifesto pledge to eliminate the deficit entirely by the mid-2020s.A spokesperson for the Treasury said: “September’s spending round supported the people’s priorities of health, education and the police within the existing fiscal rules, as we said it would be.“Beyond that, the chancellor has already said that we will be reviewing the fiscal framework as we turn the page on austerity. In so doing we will retain a fiscal anchor to public spending so that decisions are taken with a view to the long-term sustainability of the public finances.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f6e5732944a966ecdc27991abc6dbfb2d33a4f0/26_0_593_356/master/593.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a4b08d62929ff38c775cfabffa95cbb","title":"it was pure method grayling but the tories were wishing for arcuri","story":"At Brexit questions, James Duddridge was excruciating as he stood in at the dispatch boxA star is born. For a couple of months now, the government has been sending emails to casting agents, begging them to find a replacement for Chris Grayling. A minister so useless, so hapless that every appearance in the Commons is guaranteed to be a box office disaster. Many have been called, yet no one has quite come up to scratch. Not even Priti Patel or Liz Truss. Or James Cleverly with his definitive decisiveness graph. AKA My Graph by J Cleverly (aged 11 ¾). Stupidly on the x-axis and Cleverly on the y-axis – with next to nothing registering on the y.But James Duddridge, a junior minister in the Brexit department, looks as if he might be the real deal. In this, his second audition standing in for Steve Barclay inside a week, he revealed his true potential. A man for whom practice makes progressively less perfect.The incompetence could be taken as a given – that’s standard government issue. But what Duddridge brought to his role this time was pure method Grayling. The sense of peevishness that only comes from someone too stupid to realise just how out of their depth they are. The sweaty shiftiness of a man who is dimly aware he is crashing and burning but can’t put his finger on why. It can’t be long before he goes full Grayling and develops a nervous tic. The wobbling cheek was one of the few signs of intelligent life in the former transport secretary.Quite what Duddridge has done to have been thrown under a bus twice in such quick succession is as yet unclear. The chief whip must have some devastating kompromat on him. But at least he’s providing some entertainment at a time of national crisis. He was in the Commons to answer an urgent question from Keir Starmer, requesting the government allow parliament to see the full 44-page legal text of the new withdrawal agreement the EU was in the process of rejecting, rather than just the seven-page summary it had so far been shown. The shadow Brexit secretary was understandably suspicious that there might be something of a mismatch between the two. Not least on provisions for a hard border and the erosion of workers’ rights.“Don’t tell him, Duddridge,” yelled a handful of Tory MPs, who had been briefed to spread the word that only a fool would show their hand by making public a document that had already been seen by the EU27. Just in case the EU leaders hadn’t actually got round to examining it that closely. Besides, only traitors and close family wouldn’t trust the prime minister. The patriotic thing to do was to back the deal without reading it.It quickly became clear that not even Duddridge – especially Duddridge – had been considered senior enough in government to be allowed to see the legal text. Which made him the ideal man to answer the question as he couldn’t inadvertently reveal anything incriminating. Except he was peculiarly inept in failing to give any even halfway credible reasons for not releasing the text. There would be no infrastructure at the border apart from the infrastructure at the border. Workers’ rights would actually be improved by deregulation. He was following in the footsteps of the Master. The One True Grayling.Halfway through this excruciating ordeal, the few remaining Tory MPs were beginning to see what Boris Johnson had seen in Jennifer Arcuri and were wishing it was her at the dispatch box and not Duddridge. At least in her interview with Piers Morgan and Susannah Reid on Good Morning Britain she had shown some style as she failed to answer any questions and could bullshit with the best of them. By the end she had failed to deny having sex with the prime minister nine times and had left most viewers wondering if it had been Morgan who had been having the affair with the prime minister and not her. After all, he’d already been kissing Donald Trump’s arse for years.How different it could have been with Arcuri in the chamber.“Will you publish the legal text?” said Starmer.“You’ve been saying that for 10 minutes,” Arcuri would have replied. “Are you in love with me? Do you want to have sex with me?”“Will you publish the legal text?” said Hilary Benn.“I like to talk about Shakespeare. Come to one of my Google Hangouts.”“Will you publish the legal text?” asked Jo Swinson.“Can we talk about your sex life? I can’t help it if I’m a very successful entrepreneur whom blond, married men go crazy for.”“OK, OK,” Chris Bryant would have then yelled. “You win. Forget the legal text. Just please take the idea of Boris pole dancing in a bikini out of my head.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a919a62d4e277c78348ecdbe7167c9ff69f085c/0_74_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=813998de9f5cf40328de8cddad7605c0","title":"talking horses mark johnston could set another winners record this week","story":"The Yorkshire-based trainer needs just five more winners this year to match the tally of 235 set by Richard Hannon SrMark Johnston stands on the brink of another record, just a year after becoming the trainer with most winners in British racing history. The Middleham man has had 230 winners this year and needs just five more to match the Flat-racing record of 235.That record has stood since 2013, when Richard Hannon Sr set it in his final season before handing on the licence to his son. Richard Fahey matched it a couple of years later, though it took him until after Christmas to get there and he had a handful of runners up to New Year’s Eve in an attempt to break it.It is amazing that Johnston has got so close to the record just a week into October. But, like all Flat stables, his operation slows down at this time of year and nothing can be taken for granted. As recently as 2014, he garnered just five winners from the final three months of the year.“I’m not thinking of it,” Johnston said, when asked about the record a month ago. “If it happens, it happens.” But surely he can’t avoid thinking about it now, not least because journalists at the races keep mentioning it.I’d guess he had a sinking feeling last week, when he went six days between Huboor winning at Newmarket and Asian Angel scoring at Southwell. But there have been another couple since then, including a Listed prize for Main Edition, so hopefully Johnston is breathing easier.He can’t bag the record on Tuesday, because the abandonment of waterlogged Catterick means he doesn’t have enough runners. But he could creep up so close behind it as to make the end of the hunt a formality, as three of his four runners at Brighton and Chelmsford are priced at 2-1 or shorter.He has another seven declared on Wednesday and plenty of possibles for later in the week. Good luck to him, to all his runners and to everyone at Kingsley Park who has put the stable in this position.Racing goes ahead at Leicester, which means we get to see if Eponina (5.05) can build on the promise she showed last time when beaten half a length at Thirsk. That was her best effort since midsummer, when she made all on soft ground at Chester. This step back down to seven furlongs should help and 11-2 looks big to me.Stallone is the obvious one, having run well in a much hotter race last week. But an extra furlong on this ground is no joke, so soon after such an effort, and his stable hasn’t had a winner for six weeks.Tarboosh (2.55) is the nap at even money, earlier on the card. This is more competitive than your average three-runner race but it was easy to like the way he sluiced through the mud at Beverley a fortnight ago.The ground should be much less testing at Brighton, where Global Agreement (2.00) is interesting at 9-2. The chestnut had no luck on his handicap debut when drawn wide at Bath and had to go all around the houses on his way to finishing a close fourth. It was an excellent effort and he can fare better from the same mark here.Chelmsford also stages a three-runner race, in which Habub (6.10) is the lowest-rated in the line-up. But he’s won on the surface and, most importantly, looks like getting the lead to himself, which should make him really dangerous under the in-form Jim Crowley. He’s 6-4 from 2-1 after early support.Catterick abandoned due to waterlogging"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aeea94a8894e133efc4dbaf3301aa23ca08f878a/0_215_5895_3537/master/5895.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=760847d9cb378ad3f01e097b89175e58","title":"the hundred sees ecb double down on ludicrous marketing drivel spin cricket","story":"The ECB has been burrowing itself into a Hundred-shaped hole, and instead of seeking a way out it ordered up a diggerSince it was first announced, back in the heady, innocent days when it lacked a name and the England and Wales Cricket Board was assumed to be gestating nothing more revolutionary than a new Twenty20 competition, the thing we now refer to as The Hundred has been hounded by sceptics.One criticism in particular has recurred intriguingly. Back in April 2018 an unnamed county representative at the meeting where the ECB’s plans were first announced described it to the Evening Standard as being “like something out of W1A”. This March a county executive told the Independent, on the subject of ongoing discussions about team names: “Honestly, it’s like something out of W1A at times.” In April a county executive told the Sunday Times that at one meeting, “I thought I’d walked onto the set of W1A”. This all suggests two things: that a single county executive with a particular fondness for excruciating BBC comedies has repeatedly said similar things to different journalists under the cover of anonymity and that, whether the quotes come from one inidual or several, the process of creating the competition has at times been painfully cringeworthy, marked in particular – as was the TV series – by the adoption of befuddling marketspeak.Fast forward to last week’s announcement of the “brand identities” of the eight participating teams, which featured Rob Calder, the tournament’s commercial director, awkwardly ad-libbing in an east London warehouse while assistants desperately attempted to coax some action from a video that was refusing to play. There seems little doubt what our mysterious county executive would have to say about that particular scene.The ECB has come to resemble the desperate schoolteacher who imagines his students will be suddenly enthralled by Shakespeare if they are told to consider him a lyricist and read his sonnets over a hip-hop beat. In its case, it is convinced that cricket’s fortunes will be transformed when the players are finally free to wear truly garish colours and the logo of a popular prawn cocktail-flavoured snack. When Virat Kohli announced last year that he would be playing no part in the competition, he used one phrase that for many rang particularly true: “I feel somewhere the commercial aspect is taking over the real quality of cricket and that hurts me.”It was into this environment that the ECB launched the eight teams last week. A less charitable observer would decry their continued attempts at “positioning”, but in many endeavours – we’ll leave Brexit out of this if you don’t mind – there comes a point where even if you consider something misguided, you must grudgingly admire the belief of those who continue to pursue it with absolute conviction. Because far from attempting to mollify the naysayers, the ECB’s snook-cockers turned the irritating market-speak dial to 11, added some loud colours, shouty fonts and an advertising deal with precisely the kind of company for whom the type of people already criticising them would be guaranteed to further criticise them, and sat back to enjoy the pyrotechnics.In particular, the final team names and the descriptions of their characteristics on the tournament’s official website were so extraordinarily inane they read like the deliberate and really quite aggressive provocation of the doomsters and gloomsters who have been so upset by this project from its very conception. It is, to be sure, difficult to pithily describe the make-up of teams that haven’t yet been made up, but even so this was quite the achievement.Manchester Originals are “celebrating a global city of firsts” and “laughing in the face of limits”. Birmingham Phoenix are “a celebration of the strength in ersity, because different is good”. Northern Superchargers are “powered by positivity and people who get stuff done”. Southern Brave are “endlessly curious, with an insatiable appetite for adventure”. Trent Rockets will launch “the biggest party in the country” exclusively for those “who don’t mind having the most fun”. Welsh Fire are “burning bright with intense passion and relentless energy” with – and this phrase might have felt particularly meaningful for whoever penned it – a “hunger to prove the haters wrong”.Given the opportunity to change people’s perceptions the ECB, which had been repeatedly criticised for using ludicrous marketing-drivel during private meetings, had used even more ludicrous marketing-drivel in public. These tactics seemed extraordinary, but then a few hours after the ECB’s press conference wound down a different one took place on a different continent in which a president under fire for making objectionable requests of Ukraine in private decided that the best way to beat off that allegation would be to also and more publicly make the same requests of China. The ECB continues to be criticised for its approach in creating the Hundred, but at least it knows President Trump would be fan.It is clear that no amount of parody or protest will change its path now. The ECB has been burrowing itself into a Hundred-shaped hole, and instead of seeking a way out it ordered up a digger.

Eight of his tales (performed in Russian with English surtitles) are now being presented by Moscow’s Theatre of Nations and I found them utterly enchanting. Comparisons have been made with Chekhov, but I was more often reminded of Nikolai Gogol’s vivid realism and fascination with human folly.Like Gogol’s The Overcoat, many of the stories are about an ungovernable obsession. In one a villager spends 65 roubles – half the price of a motor scooter – on buying a pair of stylish leather boots for his wife only to find they don’t fit her. In another, a worker blows the family savings on a microscope and is forever haunted by the presence of germs and bugs. But the most moving story, in its mixture of sadness and gaiety, is the final one in which a jailbird pointlessly escapes prison with only two weeks of his sentence left, purely to return to his native village: the aching need for a sight of a beloved family and place is beautifully caught.Wisely the Latvian director, Alvis Hermanis, makes no attempt to swathe the tales in peasant earthiness. The stage is dominated by a long wooden bench and blown-up photographs of contemporary villagers, while the eight-strong cast sport modern Muscovite clothes. That creates a lively tension between the stories’ evocation of Soviet life and today’s world, and the only frustration lies in the fact that the actors are not identified by their roles.It is, however, possible to pick out Evgeny Mironov, artistic director of the Theatre of Nations, who plays a number of Shukshin’s wise fools with astonishing versatility. One moment he is a doting cuckold still dreaming of his late wife, the next a social parasite who expresses his despair through ceaseless dancing. But the whole company is vivaciously gifted and if they bring the same elan to Chekhov’s Ivanov later in the week, it should be eminently worth catching.• At the Barbican, London, until 9 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06cd580dea24ce9b26eb9b8ca36ddf588b147ca1/155_322_4637_2782/master/4637.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e2e6db1c3d8578fa5b5eb0ba99489c7","title":"send tip small european ski resort win 200 pund hotel voucher","story":"Tell us about a favourite quieter resort in Europe with a relaxed atmosphere and some local flavourIt could be a bijou ski area tucked away in an obscure valley, an accidental find while heading off cross-country, or a less developed area with an old chairlift away from the main resort starting in a hamlet.

Nowhere more so than in the Highlands, where wild camping is legal and bothies aboundIn the dog days of summer 2016 I rode my bike from Taynuilt on Loch Etive to Findhorn on the Moray Firth using the wildest and loneliest ways I could find. Logging and estate tracks, stalkers’ paths, drovers’ and 18th-century military roads and disused railways, as well as modern cycle paths and tarmac took me from one coast of Scotland to the other. At the time, the adventure was simply an act of care for myself after months in a job I had to drive to, following decades of cycling to work. I was sad and weak as a result of hours wasted on the motorway, and waking up on 24 June to learn the result of the Brexit referendum left me needing time alone with my own country.Riding a bike on wild paths turns what might be a slog on foot into a pleasurable amble. If you’re walking for several days in Scotland, the weight of food, fuel, camping kit and bad-weather clothing can be a real barrier to enjoyment. On a bike, I let the wheels take the load and put my effort into the pedals, revelling in the simple majesty of moving myself and my essentials through the landscape. It leaves time and energy for other pursuits. I’ve packed a wetsuit in the past, for dips in remote river pools.So many people have cottoned on to this that bicycles, electronics, bags and camping kit now come in space-age designs with astronomical prices. And while some of that stuff is lovely, none of it is essential to a satisfying and safe bikepacking trip into the wild. All you need is a solid bike with chunky tyres and a means of carting ordinary camping gear: panniers, or a single-wheel trailer for longer trips. One constant is a decent map, as it’s all too easy to get carried away down the wrong forest path.Any part of my coast-to-coast route would make a great overnight bikepacking trip, but one that stands out in its versatility is the first part – up Loch Etive and into Glen Kinglass. It’s easiest to start from the right bank of the River Awe, after the A85 bridge: from here I soon plunged off the tarmac on to a forest road, leaving the scant traces of civilisation behind. The track twists and turns, dips and rises along the eastern shore of the sea loch. It never rises to more than 50 metres but does so often and steeply, and the surface is loose. I found myself working harder and progressing more slowly than expected. But so what?As I looked around I saw things that are more obvious from the saddle than on foot. After the first climb, you can pretty much see the whole sea loch stretching to the north-west. Looking down, you notice that Loch Etive is a proper Nordic fjord, a steep-sided gouge in the edge of the Grampians. Low-lying grassland is fringed with scrubby oaks and sandy bays fringed with yellow flag iris.At Ardmaddy, I turned inland up the River Kinglass, a deep, dark channel with a magnificent conical mountain in the distance: Stob Dubh, summit of Buachaille Etive Beag, overlooking the pass of Glen Coe. Heading inland, I freewheeled down to the timber bridge and paused to look over the side, hypnotised by the peaty water, eyes scouring the bed for resting Atlantic salmon.In Scotland you can camp responsibly on most open ground. The lower stretches of the Kinglass abound with perfect spots, with lush grass and the last remnants of the Atlantic temperate rainforest clinging to the foothills of the Ben Starav. I like to stretch out and feel for stones and hollows before I pitch my tent, and orient it for the best morning view. The bike goes out to pasture and the stove goes on, the lid gently chiming as water boils for pasta.But there’s another possibility in Scotland: bothies. If you ride light and don’t mind who you share a roof with, these basic shelters are free for any passerby. When I got to the one in Glen Kinglass – a cruck-framed cottage – it was deserted, so I laid my sleeping mat on the bare earth floor, effectively camping indoors – and away from the midges. The bothy is set back from the track among broadleaved woods. The crag above is cut in two by the gorge of the Allt Narrachan and reminds me of a Chinese silk painting, the diagonal of the stream flicking side to side before leaping off into a waterfall with trees on crazy ledges either side. Next day you can ride back the way you came or head on to Bridge of Orchy and Tyndrum for the train back to Taynuilt. It’s a wild trail with unbridged rivers and sketchy tracks at best. But the thing with bikepacking is that you go where you fancy and take risks and perils on the chin. It’s your choice and there are no rules. You have options that don’t make sense on foot.

The NBA distanced itself from Morey’s position in response to complaints from NBA sponsors in China and Chinese media companies refusing to broadcast Rockets games.“We too love money more than freedom and democracy. Xi doesn’t look just like Winnie the Pooh at all,” the statement continued, referring to China’s ban on the AA Milne character, after widespread circulation of memes comparing China’s president Xi Jinping to the honey-loving teddy bear.The statement continued: “Tune in to our 300th episode this Wednesday at 10! Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn’s sorghum harvest be bountiful!

He conceived it as an annual celebration of the contributions of Africa, Africans and people of African descent to world civilisation from antiquity to the present.It took its cue from the established Black History Month that had taken\u0026nbsp place in the US every February since it was first adopted by staff and students at Kent State University in Ohio in 1970, and which had built into a national movement.Its origins go back to 1926, when the second week in February was designated as a week to celebrate and discuss African-Americans\u0027 contribution to history.One of the key reasons for starting Black History Month in the UK was the under-representation of BAME people in the mainstream British history taught in schools, and to ensure that the history and heritage of the African diaspora was preserved and celebrated.This year, as every year, the focus will be on pivotal and well-documented figures such as Martin Luther King, Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman. But there are others whose often radical work is frequently forgotten. In an effort to honour at least some of them, we asked black historians and cultural figures to nominate their own heroes and watershed events.Wedderburn was a 19th-century political firebrand, who was so powerful that he was put on a secret British government list of potentially dangerous reformers. He pushed for the end of slavery and the redistribution of wealth in Britain, publishing a book, The Horrors of Slavery, in 1824 and being arrested multiple times for his activism, which was considered “blasphemous”. He was controversial, but he was also part of a posse of people of colour who were all radical not only defending themselves, but trying to uplift all marginalised people.He was a real revolutionary, and I have no idea why he has been forgotten. People can learn from him today because he stood up to the government of the day in a form of radical rhetoric that challenged his environment. He spoke truth to power. He wanted the government to be egalitarian, and he wasn’t just looking out for black people. In today’s terms, we would call him intersectional, but he was doing that back then and focusing on people’s dignity, advocating for it from the pulpit and in print.Kwame Kwei-Armah is the artistic director of the Young VicSeptimius Severus, born in what is now Libya in 145, was the first black Roman emperor. His reign came after Marcus Aurelius, and he began what is seen as the last dynasty of the empire: the Severan dynasty. He was known for being a ruthless military leader, but is not well remembered, perhaps because of his race and because he has been overshadowed by flamboyant emperors such as Caesar and Nero.There can be a dichotomy in black history – you are either the hero or the victim – yet here is someone who was immensely powerful and privileged, and an uncompromising man of his time.When you think of the Roman empire, you never think of someone who was born in northern Africa, yet the empire was so vast that it sprawled beyond what we now call the west. There wasn’t as much of a rigid boundary between the continents then that is a mere hierarchy we have since developed. Through Severus, we can see that those boundaries are artificial and that people of African descent held positions of great power throughout history.Olivette Otele is a professor of history at Bath Spa UniversityThere was a pivotal moment in my life, and in British life, in 1975 when a group of black mothers in Lewisham, south-east London, got together to campaign against the “sus” law that gave police the power to arrest anyone they suspected was loitering with intent to commit certain offences. This power was disproportionately used against young black men. One Tuesday night in February, these women came together and simply said “no”. They wanted to save their sons, and from that grew a whole movement.I was a trainee lawyer at the time, and they came to me to ask for help. The campaign grew to involve churches and all the political parties and trade unions, until in 1980 it went before a home affairs select committee and it was finally recommended that the law be repealed.It was a landmark for me in the history of black organisations in Britain. There is never any substitute for grassroots activism and organising. Power concedes nothing without a demand it never has and it never will.Paul Boateng is a Labour peer and former cabinet ministerThe Haitian revolution of 1791 to 1804 is the only successful slave rebellion in history. Part of the reason for its success is that it brought together all the enslaved people in the country. That was cemented through a Vodou ceremony on the night of 21 August 1791 at Bois Caïman, at which those present took an oath to take revenge on their French masters.One of the things slavery did was to get rid of the African-ness of the enslaved – they would take away their names, and slaves weren’t allowed to mix with each other, speak their original language or keep their original religion. Many of the slaves in Haiti were African-born, so taking part in this ceremony, led by the high priest Dutty Boukman and priestess Cécile Fatiman, gave them licence to retain their traditions.Vodou has its roots in the tribal religions of West Africa, and these slaves had brought them to Haiti to form the cultural practices of Vodou that we know today. It was empowering, and ultimately led them to revolt. Figures such as Toussaint L’Ouverture are remembered as the leaders, yet this grassroots African spirituality was equally important.We now have a misguided aversion to Vodou, a concept that it is witchcraft, but this is the spiritual belief of an entire people, and it shouldn’t be denigrated. Being aware of your traditions and heritage is really important. It’s not witchcraft – it’s about connecting with African roots and keeping that alive.Kehinde Andrews is a professor of black studies at Birmingham UniversityI grew up hearing a lot about Claudia Jones, who died in 1964 when I was 10. My parents would tell me how she had founded the Caribbean carnival, the precursor to Notting Hill carnival.But that was not the important thing for me. Instead, it was that, throughout her political activism, first as a black feminist leader in the Communist party in the US in the 1940s and then as a communist activist in Britain after being deported in 1955, she always spoke fearlessly about the women’s struggle.She really made the connections between race, gender and class – she was intersectional before that was really understood as a term. She was in a party dominated by men, and she was front and centre arguing about the need not only for working-class representation, but also for women’s inclusion and for people of colour.The other thing that resonates is that she was born in the Caribbean and then went to the US before coming to Britain, and so her life represents the African diaspora. She arrived in Britain at the height of Windrush racism in the mid-50s and fought to oppose the restrictions on Commonwealth citizens coming to Britain. The fact that Commonwealth people who have spent most of their lives in Britain are still being deported today, as in the Windrush scandal, is something that she would have been disgusted by. Hers is a legacy we must remember and continue to emulate.Valerie Amos is the director of Soas University of LondonGeorge Washington Carver was an inventor and agricultural scientist whose work in the early 20th century ultimately gave us peanut butter as well as 300 other products derived from peanuts, including soaps, flour and insulation. He gave it all away, dedicating his patents to the American people.He is no different to other achievers of African American descent who have not been given their due space and place in history. I was contacted in 2004 by English Heritage it had only 15 plaques to people of colour in England. That is why we started the blue plaque campaign to have people of black descent recognised. In the years since, we have put up more than 50, as well as two statues – one of which is a memorial in Windrush Square in Brixton to the African-Caribbean soldiers who fought in the first and second world wars.When you memorialise historic locations, and people such as Carver, you celebrate our common heritage. People should be more aware of who we live among and our shared histories.Jak Beula is the founder of the Nubian Jak Community TrustAlice Kinloch was a South African activist who came to Britain in the late 1890s and helped to found the African Association, although that is usually credited to a man, Henry Sylvester-Williams. The African Association convened the First Pan-African Conference, which was held in London in 1900. This was the first major event to use the term pan-African and to gather people from all over the diaspora to speak with one voice.Kinloch has been written out of history, and not much is known about her – I have never even seen a picture of her – but she played a leading role at a time when few African women were active in politics in Britain or elsewhere.Hakim Adi is a professor of the history of Africa and the African diaspora at the University of ChichesterGeorge William Gordon was hanged after the Morant Bay rebellion of 1865, when hundreds of Jamaicans protested against the abject poverty of colonial rule. A mixed-race Jamaican and a British subject, Gordon was accused of having planned the rebellion, although his only “crime” was to speak out against planter rule and colonial misgovernance.His swift hanging caused a huge controversy in Britain. He became a martyr around whom there emerged the first rumblings of solidarity across race lines. There were working-class meetings around the country to commemorate his death and to organise protests. People even held mock funerals for him and argued that although he was a different colour, he was still an Englishman, and that anyone could become a target of the empire.Priyamvada Gopal is a reader in Anglophone and related literature at the University of Cambridge"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2da0c308acc9bbd1a7e9793d4c7ac04eaa70eaac/510_0_2946_1767/master/2946.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c3d8fe56a166e8139ed405b091ad594","title":"new zealand wrestles with 250th anniversary of james cooks arrival","story":"Replica of the Endeavour sails coastline as part of flotilla that has been met with a mix of celebration and griefA replica of Captain James Cook’s Endeavour has docked in Gisborne 250 years after the British navigator landed in New Zealand and named the cove he first sighted Poverty Bay.The replica is part of a flotilla, known as Tuia 250, that has been sailing around New Zealand on a taxpayer-funded voyage in memory of Cook’s arrival in New Zealand.Dame Jenny Shipley, who is co-chair of Tuia 250, acknowledged that for many indigenous New Zealanders the commemoration celebrations are tinged with grief, as nine Māori lost their lives in the first encounter with Cook and his men, and eventually the Māori people lost their sovereignty.“I’ve been very proud of both Māori and Pākehā, the way they’ve come to this and rather than arguing the facts of history, have tried to explore the emotions that it’s evoked and that’s been the experience here this week,” she said.“It’s quite right that 250 years on some people are really proud and want to move on, they see this as a huge contribution to society, others see it as a tragic intervention.“It is not a bad thing if people want to express their differences and New Zealanders are ready to grow up and do that,” Shipley said as she welcomed the Endeavour into port.“If there are protests, of course they’re entitled to express their view, but I can tell you there are many in both of the iwi who also want to move forward and there’s got to be space for everybody.”Some iwi – tribal Māori – have opposed the commemoration celebrations, and said that spending taxpayer money marking the colonisation of Māori land is wrong.At least one town banned the ship from docking after an outcry from the local Māori community.Ten thousand people gathered in Gisborne to welcome the ship but the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, was noticeably absent. She was meeting with the visiting Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte.Ardern told RNZ that it was important New Zealanders faced up to uncomfortable realities around Cook’s arrival in New Zealand, and she had already spent two days in Gisborne over the weekend. Ardern said her decision not to attend today’s commemoration should not be read as political move. “There are things that need to be talked about when we talk about the 250th anniversary. Never before has the story fully been told of the loss of life when Cook arrived,” Ardern said.“This is the chance to talk about the reality of New Zealand’s history, to acknowledge it, to be open about it. That might attract some protests but that is all part of the conversation.”People in Gisborne expressed mixed emotions about the arrival of the replica Endeavour.“He killed some of our ancestors. Why it is even coming here?

Hello, it’s Warren Murray helping you lift yourself up by the bootstraps this Tuesday morning.Sir Lynton Crosby’s company CTF Partners is under investigation for potential illegal lobbying over its employees’ work for senior Conservatives including Boris Johnson. CTF staff members worked closely with Tory MPs – including some current ministers – to undermine Theresa May’s Brexit deal, while several senior employees took leave to run Johnson’s Tory leadership campaign. has exposed CTF’s work on campaigns for the Saudi Arabian government, major fossil fuel producers, anti-cycling campaigners, tobacco firms and sugary drinks producers. Now the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists has used, for only the fourth time, its powers to formally demand CTF Partners provide detailed evidence that the aims of such clients did not influence staff’s unpaid work with politicians including the PM. Crosby’s company has denied claims it could have broken the law, insisting senior employees’ decision to volunteer on Johnson’s Tory leadership campaign was unconnected with their day jobs. But the investigation could be an incentive for Downing Street to keep Johnson away from his longtime political adviser Crosby. There are reports the pair have fallen out, with Johnson turning instead to his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, and his own partner, Carrie Symonds.Trump isolated amid Syria chaos – The Turkish defence ministry has declared “all preparations for a possible military operation into north-eastern Syria are completed”, as Donald Trump faces a political backlash from close Republican allies after his decision to withdraw forces from the countries’ border. The president is accused of betraying Kurdish fighters who led the defeat of Isis and leaving them to face a potential Turkish invasion alone. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have said the fate of tens of thousands of suspected Islamic State fighters and their families in its custody is uncertain. It is unclear if Turkey would take custody of them. In Washington the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said: “A precipitous withdrawal of US forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran and the Assad regime. And it would increase the risk that Isis and other terrorist groups regroup.” The Republican senator and Trump loyalist Lindsey Graham said: “This decision to abandon our Kurdish allies and turn Syria over to Russia, Iran and Turkey will put every radical Islamist on steroids. Shot in the arm to the bad guys. Devastating for the good guys.”Brexit debt warning – Emergency tax cuts and higher public spending needed to offset a no-deal Brexit would send government debt to its highest level in more than half a century and could end up forcing a new wave of austerity cuts even as the government moves to increases funding for healthcare, schools and police, according to Britain’s leading experts on the public finances. In a warning to Boris Johnson as his Brexit plan faces stiff opposition at home and abroad, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said government borrowing was already set to more than double in 2020, hard Brexit or not.

They included Sarah Lasenby, an 81-year-old retired social worker from Oxford, and Phil Kingston, 83, who was arrested at the Treasury for spray-painting “Life, not death for my grandchildren” in red.Outside the MoD, activists attached themselves to cars before being removed by police using buzzsaws. Officers removed a man who had attached himself to a tipi frame on Westminster Bridge, while others who had glued themselves to scaffolding in Trafalgar Square were taken away. Boris Johnson derided the protesters as “uncooperative crusties” who should stop blocking the streets of the capital with their “heaving hemp-smelling bivouacs”. At the launch of a  editor’s book about Margaret Thatcher, the PM reportedly taunted protesters that his predecessor had cared about greenhouse gases before they did.Celebration and grief – A touring replica of Captain James Cook’s Endeavour has docked in Gisborne 250 years after the British navigator landed in New Zealand and named the cove he first sighted Poverty Bay.

The companies include Zhejiang Dahua Technology, IFLYTEK Co, Xiamen Meiya Pico Information Co and Yixin Science and Technology Co.The department filing said the “entities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.”The list includes municipal and county public security bureaus and the Xinjiang Police College.US officials said the announcement was not tied to this week’s resumption of trade talks with China. Being added to the “Entity List” bars companies or other entities from buying parts and components from US companies without US government approval.The Commerce Department previously added Huawei Technologies Co and more than 100 affiliates to the Entity List.Hikvision did not immediately comment on the Commerce Department’s move. The Chinese embassy in Washington also did not immediately comment.In April, a bipartisan group of US lawmakers urged the move against Chinese companies it called “complicit in human rights abuses” and specifically cited Hikvision and Dahua.China faces growing condemnation from Western capitals and rights groups for setting up facilities that UN experts describe as mass detention centres holding more than one million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week at the Vatican that “when the state rules absolutely, it demands its citizens worship government, not God. That’s why China has put more than one million Uighur Muslims ... in internment camps and is why it throws Christian pastors in jail.”In August, the Trump administration released an interim rule banning federal purchases of telecommunications equipment from five Chinese companies, including Huawei and Hikvision.Huawei has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government, military or intelligence services and has filed a lawsuit against the US government’s restrictions."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Campaigners say pension is for people \u0026lsquoinjured through no fault of their own\u0026rsquoMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe will deliver his speech in D\u0026aacuteil at 1pmHaving a positive attitude about yourself can help you to perform better under stressThree wards cleared after electrical fire at Our Lady\u0026rsquos Hospital, Navan, broke out at 6amDay begins early with Paschal Donohoe briefing Cabinet about budget packageThe Denham Fellowship helps people from disadvantaged areas to pursue law careerLimited liability partnership means partners will not be personally liable for a firm\u0026rsquos debtsSome 16 per cent of men leave home before 6am compared to eight per cent of womenHard drives owned by lead investigator on Pat Finucane murder \u0026lsquowiped clean\u0026rsquoUnion inspector at Dublin Port says the problems are a lack of training, no mandatory safety regulations and a \u0026lsquofractured\u0026rsquo workforceRise in commercial stamp duty to help cover cost of more care hours, garda\u0026iacute and allowancesDavid Drum (57) facing 93 charges alleging he stole funds from St Macartan\u0026rsquos CathedralTrade union calls on Irish Government to consider measures to protect incomesEoghan Murphy threatens funding withdrawal if deal blockedInstructor and flying partner died when light aircraft crashed shortly after take-offUK financial \u0026lsquosweeteners\u0026rsquo for Border customs checks not of interest to Republic, says CoveneyAdjudicators to inspect towns in Wicklow, Limerick, Laois, Longford this monthDublin City Council expects to have 12 additional staff to enforce rules on short-term letsThree out of four drivers\u0026rsquo samples which did not exceed alcohol limits broke drug limits"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit a day in the life of an irish border crossing","story":"Ambrose “Bo” McGurgan is checking the tyres on his six-axle lorry at the Applegreen truck stop near Castlebellingham, Co Louth, south of the Irish Border. It is the only check he will undergo before crossing over into Northern Ireland.From the end of this month all that could change with the UK’s exit from the EU on October 31st, the date British prime minister Boris Johnson wants Brexit to happen.McGurgan fears the return of the dreaded customs checks of more than a quarter century ago. He remembers the hard border when 300 or 400 trucks could be parked up for hours awaiting customs clearance.“It will be going back to square one, like in the 70s. It would be a disaster. You could be sitting all day in Dundalk waiting to get cleared,” he tells The .It is 11am on a Monday and the Armagh man has been working for six hours and has already lifted and “tipped” a trailer in Dublin and is heading across the Border for another delivery in Newtownards, Co Down.He is hauling a mixed load of food and industrial goods – sauces and engineering bolts – but requires no paperwork as he drives, unhindered, across an open border between two jurisdictions currently within the EU. A return to the border of the past, that McGurgan waited hours to cross. is very real again.Johnson’s government proposed to the EU last week to replace the contentious backstop guarantee to avoid a hard Irish border with a plan to impose a new customs border on the island of Ireland.The deluge of paperwork, the queues of lorries, the hours-long delays, the potential targeting of customs officers by people upset with the return of a visible border “would be a disaster,” says McGurgan.“People don’t realise how bad it is going to be. We, the older generation, we have done it all. We know how bad it is. There will be customs men shot. There will be. Everybody is fighting for a loaf,” he said.McGurgan’s truck was one of 6,639 goods vehicles to cross the Border on the A1 dual-carriageway between Dublin and Belfast last Monday. This is the busiest crossing on the Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland. Traffic counters operated by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the agency monitoring the State’s roads, show that on average five goods vehicles crossed this point of the Border every minute on Monday.This is where the impact of the UK leaving without a deal has the potential to cause the most complications.Next to McGurgan’s truck is fellow haulier Brendan McParland, also a veteran Border-crosser. He is heading to Dungannon, Co Tyrone, with a load of peat after dropping plasterboard in Athy, Co Kildare.He usually hauls European steel, landed at Warrenpoint in Co Down, across the Border to Dublin, Kilkenny or Carlow. Normally he can complete two return runs to Dublin in one day from Warrenpoint.“If the Border was to come, you couldn’t guarantee you would even get one load done,” he said, munching on a sandwich in the cab of his lorry.Michael Harbinson is one of several lorry drivers stopped at Applegreen transporting Coca-Cola products from its manufacturing facility in Knockmore Hill outside Belfast to customers in the Republic.He believes an all-island economic unit is the way to avoid a hard Border. Not everyone wants this when it comes to both customs and EU single market rules north and south. The DUP also wants Northern Ireland to be able to vote to opt in to an all-island zone covering EU single market rules for goods every four years.“If the North takes a deal still tied with the South, it is the best of both worlds. It is the DUP who is ruining it. They just stand firm in their stance,” said Harbinson.At the last junction before the southern M1-N1 crosses the Border and turns into the northern A1 there is a fuel service station. It lies between Jonesborough, Co Armagh, and Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.Colin Byrne, one of the pump attendants of the junction 20 service station, has no clue how the UK and EU would manage this Border if Britain leaves without a deal.“That’s the six million dollar question. Sure how many back roads are there across the Border. It is not doable, simply not doable,” he said.Johnson has ruled out customs checks at or near the Border but has not specified in his plan where “designated locations” for some required checks might be. Byrne offers a foretaste of how checks might work: “every once in a while,” he says, the Garda and customs check vehicles at the southbound exit 18 off the M1 into Dundalk. “If you saw the mayhem that that causes,” he said.On the bridge over the A1 dual-carriageway next to the Carrickdale Hotel there is a constant drone of noise as an “artic” or smaller “rigid” lorry or a light goods vehicle is always coming or going.This is the north-south White Van Man highway.Between 5am and 7pm last Monday – the busiest period of the day – 5,722 goods vehicles cross the Border. That is one goods vehicle every eight seconds. This traffic is split 50:50 in either direction.“It shows trade is equally balanced going in either direction,” said Séamus Leheny, policy manager of the Freight Transport Association, speaking loudly to be heard over the hum of traffic on the bridge.“It is the artery of trade on the island of Ireland. It connects the two largest cities and to have any type of barrier on this, or ersions, or checks, it would inhabit trade and growth economically on either side of the Border here.”Interrupting the flow of traffic here would have a huge impact, he says lorries would “soon stack up” and could be waiting hours if they had to have paperwork inspected or their load physically inspected.The stakes on finding a fix to the Brexit-Border conundrum are high. Leheny explains that five times as much freight crosses the Irish Border than moves between Northern Ireland and Britain, the North’s biggest market, but it is lower in value because it is mostly ingredients and components, and not completed products.“What we make in Northern Ireland, it is comprised of bits and pieces sourced from every corner of the island of Ireland. If we have a hard border, the existence of those products that we make in Northern Ireland are jeopardised because you would have delays, tariffs and the sanitary controls as well,” he said.In the retail game, this Border crossing is an essential supply chain route for multinationals. Northern Ireland supermarkets are stocked from distribution centres in the Republic, and vice versa. Then there are the food products made with ingredients coming from both north and south of the Border.Aodhán Michael Connolly, director of Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, says that a supermarket chicken salad sandwich can have ingredients involving six border movements (north-south and east-west, between the North and Britain), while “the humble cottage pie” can have eight, including a cheese topping produced and processed on different sides of the Border. Each movement involves tariffs so the overall costs could be huge.“That border crossing isn’t just to move goods A to B. It is a lifeline to the supply chain and to those small and medium-sized enterprises right down to the farmers who are in our supply chain,” he said. “If there isn’t frictionless movement across that border, each of those costs will have to go down the supply chain and it is going to make things tougher for the Northern Ireland consumer.”Connolly sees Johnson’s plan as “unworkable” if it is the final deal because a customs border would amount to a hard border, but it is “progress” to open negotiations because it includes an all-island zone for goods.Driving one of his nine trucks across the Border on the A1, Declan Trainor, a cattle and goods haulier, believes the island of Ireland should be “treated as a whole and as one island”.He has no idea how the Border, just a few hundred metres from his office at Carrickcarnan, will look on November 1st, or how he will be able to continue transporting tiles from mainland Europe to Northern Ireland.“It is the unknown. That is the scary part. The Government hasn’t really said how to prepare for it. They are only guessing themselves now so how are you supposed to prepare?” he said. “You don’t know whether it is a dance you are going to or a war. Sure how do you dress for it?”Speaking a few days later, Trainor says Johnson’s “two borders for four years” proposal has left him even more confused. It has also made people who rely on free trade and free movement of goods across the Border “desperate,” he said.“Whatever concern we had, we are more concerned now,” he said.How busy is the M1A1\u0026nbspcrossing?The Border crossing on the M1 motorwayA1 dual-carriageway between Dublin and Belfast is the busiest thoroughfare along the 499-kilometre open frontier between the Republic and Northern Ireland.The four-lane crossing between Newry and Dundalk is about five times busier than the next busiest crossing over the Blackwater river between Emyvale, Co Monaghan, and Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone, based on traffic figures counted daily by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the State agency that manages the Irish road network.The agency uses a system of counters under the surface of strategically important roads across the country that can differentiate vehicles by wheel axle lengths. This allows the agency to gather data and analyse the volume of traffic and type of vehicles passing on the road for every hour of every day.The counter at Junction 20 on the A1 at Ravensdale between Jonesborough, Co Armagh, and Carrickcarnan, Co Louth, showed that Monday, September 30th – a month before the UK’s scheduled exit from the EU – was a typically busy day for traffic for this major transport route on the island of Ireland.Some 25,301 vehicles crossed the Border over the 24-hour period: 18,175 cars, 6,639 goods vehicles (including the heaviest articulated lorries), 318 buses and 24 motorbikes. That means 17 vehicles crossed the Border on average every minute last Monday. One goods vehicle crossed the Border every 12 seconds.Hauliers, traders and businesses along the Border say any kind of delays stopping traffic on this corridor after Brexit would quickly result in heavy congestion and tailbacks.The busiest times of day are during the morning rush-hour between 8am and 9am, when traffic volumes peaked at 1,935 vehicles, and the late afternoon peak between 4pm and 5pm at 1,897 vehicles.The bulk of the traffic crosses the Border between the hours of 7am and 7pm when 19,625 vehicles were counted last Monday, or on average of 1,635 an hour.The traffic is evenly split between northbound and southbound vehicles. However, more than twice as many goods vehicles head southbound between 5am and 9am – making deliveries to the Republic or transporting goods to Dublin Port in time to make the 8am ferry departures to England out of Dublin Port.This route is a critical artery for goods travelling from Northern Ireland south into the Republic. Some 3,425 goods vehicles crossed the Border heading south into the Republic last Monday.This worked out an average of 143 per hour. In other words, one goods vehicle crossed the Border into the Republic on the main Dublin-Belfast road every 25 seconds last Monday.To put this in a national context, this part of the A1 is almost as busy or busier every day than the main Dublin to Galway M4 road at Kinnegad (26,400 vehicles on average a day), the main Dublin to Cork M7 road at Portlaoise (25,700 vehicles) and than the main Dublin to Wexford M11 road at Arklow (22,800 vehicles).Cross-Border workersTen minutes drive south of the Border, dozens of parked cars – nearly all Northern Irish-registered vehicles – line either side of the road off Junction 17 of the M1 near Dundalk in Co Louth.They belong to Northern Irish tradesmen, mostly from across the Border in south Armagh, who park and car-pool into the Republic for work. They are mostly construction works, plumbers and electricians.“There are thousands of people going to and from work every day, crossing the Border every couple of minutes. There are thousands and thousands of guys down south working and Dublin is most of where the work is,” said Neil Byrne, a plumber from Mullaghbane near Forkhill.The Armagh man usually arrives at around 5.50am to park his car and catch his lift to Dublin. He has worked “all over the south” including in Kildare and Athlone.Byrne says he and his fellow commuters to the Republic are concerned about a crash-out Brexit and the return of a hard border resulting in hours and hours of traffic delays crossing the Border.He doesn’t believe a hard border would work it does not make sense to have one, he says. “It is one small country in my opinion: it doesn’t matter whether you are north or south, Ireland is Ireland and you have to get to your work regardless,” he said.Delays and traffic jams are not his only worry.“If there’s a Border, it has the whole issue of the Troubles starting again because in my own personal opinion it is going to happen the exact same way it did back then: customs guys get attacked, then there is a police presence, then they get attacked and then there is a military presence,” he said. “It doesn’t take much to set it off.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Based on this advice, the department believes the issue is confined to the senders’ email”. It acknowledged that the committees had attempted to apply before the deadline and have informed them that arrangements are being made for the six locations to be visited.The six committees have welcomed the decision and the department said “the adjudicators, in formulating their reports, will be mindful of the fact that their assessments are taking place in October, rather than during the summer months”. If there are any prizewinners among the six they will be presented at the regional awards ceremonies later this year.“If, as a result of the adjudications which are now to be undertaken, a medal is awarded to any of the towns affected it will not displace any existing medal winners that have already been announced,” as there are multiple medal winners who reach the required standard."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4043713.1570527953!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how long has the science of forecasting weather been around","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWaves crash agains the sea wall in Lahinch, Co Clare as thousands of homes and businesses were left without power as Storm Lorenzo passed across Ireland. Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireThe twitter response to Met Éireann’s recent forecasting around Storm Lorenzo encapsulated much of our views of weather forecasting in general. There were the doubters and the critics, people who looked out their window and declared that this was “much ado about nothing”. And then here were the chancers, hoping for a day off work – “Cmon lads cancel Friday ffs” .We may not take it too seriously, but in a country that loves to talk about weather many of us are avid consumers of the weather forecast. Folklore about how to predict the weather based on observations of, for example, animal behaviour, is probably as old as human society. But how long has the science of forecasting been going on?Medieval scholars tried to use astrology to predict weather. They linked the locations of particular planets in the sky with weather events such as heavy rain or strong winds. According to astrologers, each planet or celestial body had certain characteristics that determined the type of weather it would bring when it was positioned in the sky in a way that amplified its influence on earth.Where a planet was in relation to particular constellations of stars or to the other planets would help to define how influential it was on the weather. As health and disease was often linked to weather, physicians were interested in how the alignment of the planets might affect outbreaks of disease.Historian Stuart Jenks has noted that this kind of weather prediction showed little care for the economic impacts of weather events and was more an intellectual endeavour for educated elites. In other words, no farmer was using the alignment of Jupiter and the moon to decide whether to cut his hay this week or not.By the middle of the 19th century there were a great many more instruments to draw upon when predicting the weather and there was a much greater focus on the economic potential of weather forecasting. For European governments in particular, the central importance of shipping to national economies and the maintenance of empires provided an impetus to the development of meteorology and particularly storm prediction.In the United Kingdom, Admiral Robert FitzRoy (former commander of HMS Beagle) was appointed head of a meteorological service managed by the Board of Trade. Initially the meteorological department simply collected weather reports from ships and tried to help train ships’ captains so that they could avoid (or prepare for) dangerous weather en route. But FitzRoy was soon trying to use his accumulated data to predict weather patterns and to prevent disasters at sea when ships encountered unexpected storms.By the 1860s, FitzRoy had developed a basic system of weather forecasting for the waters around the UK in which predictions were shared between stations using the telegraph. Wind measurements and barometric pressure were collected from stations along the coast and used to calculate storm warnings.These stations then displayed flags devised by FitzRoy in order to inform sailors of the weather. Such predictions were basic, not indicating that a wind of a particular strength would come from a particular direction. Nonetheless, they proved extremely useful to sailors and FitzRoy believed they had a significant impact in preventing wrecks and loss of life.Just like our modern weather forecasting system, FitzRoy faced a number of critics. He was not a scientist and the theory underlining his storm warning and weather predictions was hazy at best.Scientists such as Francis Galton attacked his methods and demanded that the storm warnings and other weather forecasting be suspended until a more scientific means of prediction could be developed. Galton created a critique of FitzRoy’s accuracy that, historian Jim Burton has suggested, may have distorted the picture to suit his own purposes.The storm warnings were temporarily suspended, but sailors were among the first to protest at the withdrawal of the service and they were eventually reinstated. Sailors, unlike Galton, were willing to endure the occasional mistake because in general forecasts improved their ability to do their jobs safely. Fortunately weather forecasting and long-range modelling have become much more reliable in the meantime.Dr Juliana Adelman lectures in history at Dublin City University"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Extinction Rebellion protests take over London\u0026#39s Smithfield Market - latest newsWhat do Extinction Rebellion want from their protests - and where in London are they taking place?Switching parties \u0026#39the new norm\u0026#39 as current electorate is named the most volatile in modern timesPentagon tries to row back Trump green light of \u0026#39destabilising\u0026#39 Turkish assault on SyriaDowning Street prepares for Brexit talks to collapse, as Number 10 source says party will fight election on no deal platformWhat will happen to Sealand, the world\u0026#39s smallest micronation, after Brexit?\u0026#39We good now, China?

The YPG had also agreed to allow joint US-Turkey patrols as part of the security mechanism.Mr Erdogan told Mr Trump that the US moved too slowly to set up the zone, expressing his anger that the US security bureaucracy, namely the Pentagon, was seemingly stalling the zone\u0027s full implementation.Observers said it may have goaded Mr Trump, who does not like to be thought of as being hamstrung by policymakers.Mr Trump has attempted to mitigate the fallout, tweeting yesterday that Ankara must watch its step.Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey\u0026#39s president, holds up a map of his proposed \u0026#34safe zone\u0026#34 while speaking during the UN General Assembly meeting in New York“If Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I’ve done before!),” he wrote in a grandiose tweet.He also claimed to have the support of his coalition allies, saying the UK was among those parties who agreed with the policy shift.“A lot of people have their opinion. I could name many who are extremely thrilled that we’re coming home ,” he said at the White House.“The UK is very thrilled at this decision. As you know, they have soldiers over there also. And others. But many people agree with it very strongly. I understand both sides of it very well.”He has been criticised from all corners, including from Republican allies.Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, an outspoken defender of the president, said abandonment of the Kurds would be “a disaster in the making”, he said, and “a stain on America’s honour”.Nikki Haley, his former ambassador at the United Nations, said: “We must always have the backs of our allies, if we expect them to have our back.  The Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against ISIS in Syria. Leaving them to die is a big mistake.”However, Turkey said on Tuesday that it is ready at the border for an assault, which Mr Erdogan has been warning could come any day.Sources in Syria have told the  the Kurds had been acting in good faith complying with the security mechanism, believing if they did so they would have the US’s continued support.“We feel as if the whole time Turkey had another plan of its own, that the patrols were only for reconnaissance, and now we have no defences on the border,” one official said.Extinction Rebellion protests take over London\u0026#39s Smithfield Market - latest newsWhat do Extinction Rebellion want from their protests - and where in London are they taking place?Switching parties \u0026#39the new norm\u0026#39 as current electorate is named the most volatile in modern timesDowning Street prepares for Brexit talks to collapse, as Number 10 source says party will fight election on no deal platformWhat will happen to Sealand, the world\u0026#39s smallest micronation, after Brexit?\u0026#39We good now, China?

According to less timely official data, online sales have been growing strongly compared with 2018 until at least August, the last month covered by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).“Ongoing Brexit uncertainty is clearly having a material impact on the consumer psyche,” said\u0026nbspPaul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG.Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive, agreed, noting that many consumers held off from non-essential purchases or shopped\u0026nbsparound for bigger discounts. Out of 13 product categories in the BRC figures, only sales of food and household appliances showed growth on either measure.Created with Sketch.

However, year-on-year growth in retail sales has slowed sharply from a peak in March to stand at 2.7 per cent in August,\u0026nbspaccording to data.On the less volatile three-month measure, retail sales inched up only 0.6 per cent in the three months to August compared with the previous three months, the ONS said. That was only a slight improvement on July’s 0.5 per cent rise, which was the weakest increase since December.The BRC-KPMG Retail Sales Monitor covered five weeks between 25 August and 28 September.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s not as glamorous as it sounds,” she said. “If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u0027t. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, \u0027What is it?\u0027 And they said, \u0027You look like you\u0027ve been whipped a million times. Your back is covered in a thousand red scratches.”During the filming of the sequel to Steven Spielberg’s Jaws, cast members were terrified when real hammerhead sharks started circling them in the sea. The trouble was that their screams went unheard. The crew didn’t think they were in real danger to start with because it was written into the script that they yelled for help at that point.330 Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren – Rocky IVThe fourth in the Rocky film franchise to focus on the boxing career of the fictional Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, has some gripping and authentic-looking fight scenes. It’s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week.Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour. That is one reason why Paramount was nervous about getting him involved in Francis Ford Coppola’s mafia film. It didn’t start well, when on the first day of shooting, the actor who played the patriarch in the family, Vito Corleone, missed his overnight flight from LA to New York. His scene was rescheduled for the next day, but it cost producers $40,000.In his autobiography, rapper Gucci Mane said he was so tired on set of Harmony Korine’s crime film Spring Breakers, that he fell asleep during his big sex scene. The rapper, who plays Big Arch, a rival drug dealer of James Franco’s Alien character in the film, is seen having sex with one woman, while another sucks his toes. “I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I was knocked out, snoring . . . Harmony kept having to wake me up for takes.” In another interview, he explained why he was so exhausted. “I had a concert down there in St Petersburg, Florida, one of the days I had to shoot a scene. Same night. We started shooting at 10 o\u0027clock in the evening until 1 or 2 o\u0027clock.”The action star broke his ankle while doing his own stunt on set of the sixth Mission Impossible. The scene sees Cruise completing a fast rooftop jump from one building to another, when his foot slams into the side of the wall. But instead of collapsing in a heap, he keeps going as if nothing has happened, until the end of the scene when he can be seen hobbling away. He said: “I knew instantly my ankle was broken and I really didn’t want to do it again so just got up and carried on with the take. I said, ‘It’s broken. That’s a wrap. Take me to hospital’ and then everyone got on the phone and made their vacation arrangement.”730 Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen – Masters of SexCaplan was nervous when she had to take her clothes off in front of co-star Sheen in the TV series. It made her feel better that they were both shaky. But then disaster struck. “And we complete the scene, I place the hand on my breast and they yell “Cut” and he immediately walks over to a garbage can and throws up.“ Turns out Sheen had eaten something that upset his stomach, but Caplan didn\u0027t know that. She said: ”My whole self-confidence plummeted to the ground and I realised that I\u0027m a monster and anybody who touches me will immediately start vomiting and that’s just the way it\u0027s going to be.”830 Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley – The Vampire DiariesNina Dobrev accidentally broke Paul Wesley\u0027s finger while shooting a sex scene in The Vampire Diaries.930 Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan - 50 Shades of GreyObviously this could be a load of hype to promote the first erotic film in the franchise, but there were certainly a lot of terrible sex scenes in which things could go wrong. Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, becomes romantically linked to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and they act out their BDSM desires. Johnson, who wore a modesty thong glued to her body while Dornan wore a “wee bag” to protect his modesty, said: “I got whiplash once from him throwing me on the bed. So f***ing painful. I wish we had a gag reel from the shoot.”Michael Imperioli is best known for his role as Tony Soprano’s protégé, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. During the filming of his death scene in Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas, Imperioli cut his hand on a glass and was taken to hospital, where the doctors sped in to treat his fake bullet wounds.During the filming of Groundhog Day, Murray was more irritable than usual as he was going through a orce and was prone to disappearing from set. He had been asked to get an assistant to ease communication between him, the director Harold Raims and the studio. He was against the idea, so he hired somebody who was deaf and spoke only in sign language, which nobody on set, including Murray, could understand. Ramis said: “Bill said, ‘Don’t worry, I\u0027m going to learn sign language.’ And I think it was so inconvenient that in a couple of weeks, he gave that up. That’s anti-communication, you know? Let’s not talk.”It was a small mishap for Dunham when her nude patch kept falling off in scenes that required nudity. Dunham, who plays aspiring writer Hannah in her comedy-drama TV series Girls, said: “I stopped wearing the nude patch after the first season of Girls. There’s not one guy who works on that show who hasn’t seen the inside of my vagina. You glue it over your vagina. It gets sweaty and always falls off. My male co-stars, at the end of the day, don’t care.”In one scene of Quentin Tarantino’s 2015 Western thriller, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue plays a guitar. It is a vintage Martin guitar from the 19th century, worth roughly $40,000, which had been loaned out from the Martin Museum in Pennsylvania. But a misunderstanding on Russell’s part led to an expensive mistake. The valuable guitar was meant to be swapped over with a replica prop when he snatched it from her. Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting “Music time is over”. As a result, the Martin Museum – which called the guitar a priceless, irreplaceable artefact – vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again.1430  Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore – Maps to the StarsThe Twilight and Lost City of Z actor played Jerome, a limousine driver and struggling actor, in David Cronenberg’s acerbic Hollywood satire. It was while he got intimate in the back of a car with Moore’s character, a washed-up actress, that he ran into problems and started sweating profusely. “I sweat like a f***ing crazy person,” he said. “I was trying to literally catch drops of sweat to stop them hitting her back. Afterwards she was like, \u0027Are you having a panic attack?\u0027 It was so embarrassing.”1530 Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and other DrugsHathaway accidentally stripped off too soon when she thought cameras were rolling during the filming of Love and other Drugs. She stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the erotic film based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. “I have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, and I thought we were filming,” she said. “But it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people!”In a 2007 episode of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica TV series, Olmos’s character William Adama, the commanding officer of BS Galactica, is playing around with a model ship when he gets carried away by improvising and smashes it to smithereens. The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000.1730 Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During WartimeDuring a sex scene against a wall for the 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey\u0027s co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. “We had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,” she said. “They said ‘Action’ and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor. It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I\u0027ll never forget.”1830 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-UpThe Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. “In the scene, she’s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she’s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,” he said. “And I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I’ve done.”1930 Sean Connery and Lana Turner – Another Time, Another PlaceSean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner’s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend’s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner’s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US – but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide.2030 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking DeadThe long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who  were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered – but then as they were “humping”, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: “Then we just started laughing, because it\u0027s ridiculous. It\u0027s two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.”During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn’t part of the crew or cast but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates.Not really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene, in which he says, “It’s in. Oh, my God, it’s in.” “She got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,” Mintz-Plasse said. “Afterwards we didn\u0027t talk about it we still don\u0027t speak about that moment.”2330 Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone – The SpecialistStallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. “Ok. Let it be known, I didn’t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won’t take it off. I promised her I wouldn’t take any liberties, so what’s the problem? She said, ‘I’m just sick of nudity.’ I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else’s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.”2430 Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard – The Legend of TarzanApparently Robbie – who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. “I didn’t injure Alexander,” she said. “And I didn’t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he’s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.”Cavill says he had to “apologise profusely” after he got aroused on set, adding that “It had only happened to him once”. “A girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn\u0027t rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She\u0027s basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.” He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. “All you’re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.” But he added: “It’s not great when you’re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?” It’s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria’s Gabrielle Solis. He said: “We were rehearsing and then the director was like, \u0027OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set\u0027, and I was like, \u0027I need a minute.\u0027“ He added: “It doesn\u0027t happen that frequently” because ”there are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.2730 Christopher Guest and Cary Elwes – The Princess BrideWhen you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner’s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was “messing around” between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant’s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. “I was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes – you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).”The star was filming the scene in which he storms off after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting “Hey Malkovich, think fast!” Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role.2930 Viggo Mortensen – The Lord of the RingsWhen Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor. This behaviour would seem like an appropriate response to the grief his character feels but in reality, the actor had actually broken two toes while kicking his helmet.3030 The entire cast of RoarBut whatever the mishap, nothing can surely be as bad as it was on set for director Noel Marshall’s family, who were cast in his 1981 adventure comedy film Roar? During filming, his then wife Tippi Hendren and her daughter Melanie Griffith, as well as his two sons, John and Jerry, were mauled by lions. Heddren suffered multiple scalp wounds while Marshall was bitten so many times, he ended up hospitalised with gangrene.130 Margot Robbie – The Wolf of Wall StreetThe actor says that acting in the scene where she has sex with Leonardo DiCaprio on a bed of money was really painful in The Wolf of Wall Street. “I got a million paper cuts on my back from all that money! It\u0027s not as glamorous as it sounds,” she said. “If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u0027t.

I promised her I wouldn’t take any liberties, so what’s the problem? She said, ‘I’m just sick of nudity.’ I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else’s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.”2430 Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard – The Legend of TarzanApparently Robbie – who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. “I didn’t injure Alexander,” she said. “And I didn’t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he’s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.”Cavill says he had to “apologise profusely” after he got aroused on set, adding that “It had only happened to him once”. “A girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn\u0027t rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She\u0027s basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.” He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. “All you’re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.” But he added: “It’s not great when you’re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?” It’s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria’s Gabrielle Solis. He said: “We were rehearsing and then the director was like, \u0027OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set\u0027, and I was like, \u0027I need a minute.\u0027“ He added: “It doesn\u0027t happen that frequently” because ”there are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.2730 Christopher Guest and Cary Elwes – The Princess BrideWhen you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner’s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was “messing around” between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant’s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. “I was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes – you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).”The star was filming the scene in which he storms off after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting “Hey Malkovich, think fast!” Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role.2930 Viggo Mortensen – The Lord of the RingsWhen Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor. This behaviour would seem like an appropriate response to the grief his character feels but in reality, the actor had actually broken two toes while kicking his helmet.3030 The entire cast of RoarBut whatever the mishap, nothing can surely be as bad as it was on set for director Noel Marshall’s family, who were cast in his 1981 adventure comedy film Roar? During filming, his then wife Tippi Hendren and her daughter Melanie Griffith, as well as his two sons, John and Jerry, were mauled by lions. Heddren suffered multiple scalp wounds while Marshall was bitten so many times, he ended up hospitalised with gangrene.In 2018, pictures of Winne the Pooh were blocked in China after people began to compare him to the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.\u0026nbsp“Some people say Pooh looks like the Chinese president, so we’re illegal in China now,” Piglet explains.\u0026nbsp“What kind of madhouse is this?” asks Randy.\u0026nbspSince the episode aired in the US, searches for\u0026nbspSouth Park\u0026nbspon the Chinese website Weibo shows “no relevant results have been found”.

It\u0027s not as glamorous as it sounds,” she said. “If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u0027t. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, \u0027What is it?\u0027 And they said, \u0027You look like you\u0027ve been whipped a million times. Your back is covered in a thousand red scratches.”During the filming of the sequel to Steven Spielberg’s Jaws, cast members were terrified when real hammerhead sharks started circling them in the sea. The trouble was that their screams went unheard. The crew didn’t think they were in real danger to start with because it was written into the script that they yelled for help at that point.330 Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren – Rocky IVThe fourth in the Rocky film franchise to focus on the boxing career of the fictional Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, has some gripping and authentic-looking fight scenes. It’s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week.Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour. That is one reason why Paramount was nervous about getting him involved in Francis Ford Coppola’s mafia film. It didn’t start well, when on the first day of shooting, the actor who played the patriarch in the family, Vito Corleone, missed his overnight flight from LA to New York. His scene was rescheduled for the next day, but it cost producers $40,000.In his autobiography, rapper Gucci Mane said he was so tired on set of Harmony Korine’s crime film Spring Breakers, that he fell asleep during his big sex scene. The rapper, who plays Big Arch, a rival drug dealer of James Franco’s Alien character in the film, is seen having sex with one woman, while another sucks his toes. “I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I was knocked out, snoring . . . Harmony kept having to wake me up for takes.” In another interview, he explained why he was so exhausted. “I had a concert down there in St Petersburg, Florida, one of the days I had to shoot a scene. Same night. We started shooting at 10 o\u0027clock in the evening until 1 or 2 o\u0027clock.”The action star broke his ankle while doing his own stunt on set of the sixth Mission Impossible. The scene sees Cruise completing a fast rooftop jump from one building to another, when his foot slams into the side of the wall. But instead of collapsing in a heap, he keeps going as if nothing has happened, until the end of the scene when he can be seen hobbling away. He said: “I knew instantly my ankle was broken and I really didn’t want to do it again so just got up and carried on with the take. I said, ‘It’s broken. That’s a wrap. Take me to hospital’ and then everyone got on the phone and made their vacation arrangement.”730 Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen – Masters of SexCaplan was nervous when she had to take her clothes off in front of co-star Sheen in the TV series. It made her feel better that they were both shaky. But then disaster struck. “And we complete the scene, I place the hand on my breast and they yell “Cut” and he immediately walks over to a garbage can and throws up.“ Turns out Sheen had eaten something that upset his stomach, but Caplan didn\u0027t know that. She said: ”My whole self-confidence plummeted to the ground and I realised that I\u0027m a monster and anybody who touches me will immediately start vomiting and that’s just the way it\u0027s going to be.”830 Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley – The Vampire DiariesNina Dobrev accidentally broke Paul Wesley\u0027s finger while shooting a sex scene in The Vampire Diaries.930 Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan - 50 Shades of GreyObviously this could be a load of hype to promote the first erotic film in the franchise, but there were certainly a lot of terrible sex scenes in which things could go wrong. Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, becomes romantically linked to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and they act out their BDSM desires. Johnson, who wore a modesty thong glued to her body while Dornan wore a “wee bag” to protect his modesty, said: “I got whiplash once from him throwing me on the bed. So f***ing painful. I wish we had a gag reel from the shoot.”Michael Imperioli is best known for his role as Tony Soprano’s protégé, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. During the filming of his death scene in Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas, Imperioli cut his hand on a glass and was taken to hospital, where the doctors sped in to treat his fake bullet wounds.During the filming of Groundhog Day, Murray was more irritable than usual as he was going through a orce and was prone to disappearing from set. He had been asked to get an assistant to ease communication between him, the director Harold Raims and the studio. He was against the idea, so he hired somebody who was deaf and spoke only in sign language, which nobody on set, including Murray, could understand. Ramis said: “Bill said, ‘Don’t worry, I\u0027m going to learn sign language.’ And I think it was so inconvenient that in a couple of weeks, he gave that up. That’s anti-communication, you know? Let’s not talk.”It was a small mishap for Dunham when her nude patch kept falling off in scenes that required nudity. Dunham, who plays aspiring writer Hannah in her comedy-drama TV series Girls, said: “I stopped wearing the nude patch after the first season of Girls. There’s not one guy who works on that show who hasn’t seen the inside of my vagina. You glue it over your vagina. It gets sweaty and always falls off. My male co-stars, at the end of the day, don’t care.”In one scene of Quentin Tarantino’s 2015 Western thriller, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue plays a guitar. It is a vintage Martin guitar from the 19th century, worth roughly $40,000, which had been loaned out from the Martin Museum in Pennsylvania. But a misunderstanding on Russell’s part led to an expensive mistake. The valuable guitar was meant to be swapped over with a replica prop when he snatched it from her. Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting “Music time is over”. As a result, the Martin Museum – which called the guitar a priceless, irreplaceable artefact – vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again.1430  Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore – Maps to the StarsThe Twilight and Lost City of Z actor played Jerome, a limousine driver and struggling actor, in David Cronenberg’s acerbic Hollywood satire. It was while he got intimate in the back of a car with Moore’s character, a washed-up actress, that he ran into problems and started sweating profusely. “I sweat like a f***ing crazy person,” he said. “I was trying to literally catch drops of sweat to stop them hitting her back. Afterwards she was like, \u0027Are you having a panic attack?\u0027 It was so embarrassing.”1530 Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and other DrugsHathaway accidentally stripped off too soon when she thought cameras were rolling during the filming of Love and other Drugs. She stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the erotic film based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. “I have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, and I thought we were filming,” she said. “But it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people!”In a 2007 episode of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica TV series, Olmos’s character William Adama, the commanding officer of BS Galactica, is playing around with a model ship when he gets carried away by improvising and smashes it to smithereens. The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000.1730 Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During WartimeDuring a sex scene against a wall for the 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey\u0027s co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. “We had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,” she said. “They said ‘Action’ and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor. It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I\u0027ll never forget.”1830 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-UpThe Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. “In the scene, she’s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she’s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,” he said. “And I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I’ve done.”1930 Sean Connery and Lana Turner – Another Time, Another PlaceSean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner’s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend’s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner’s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US – but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide.2030 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking DeadThe long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who  were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered – but then as they were “humping”, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: “Then we just started laughing, because it\u0027s ridiculous. It\u0027s two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.”During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn’t part of the crew or cast but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates.Not really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene, in which he says, “It’s in. Oh, my God, it’s in.” “She got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,” Mintz-Plasse said. “Afterwards we didn\u0027t talk about it we still don\u0027t speak about that moment.”2330 Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone – The SpecialistStallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. “Ok. Let it be known, I didn’t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won’t take it off. I promised her I wouldn’t take any liberties, so what’s the problem? She said, ‘I’m just sick of nudity.’ I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else’s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.”2430 Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard – The Legend of TarzanApparently Robbie – who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. “I didn’t injure Alexander,” she said. “And I didn’t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he’s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.”Cavill says he had to “apologise profusely” after he got aroused on set, adding that “It had only happened to him once”. “A girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn\u0027t rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She\u0027s basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.” He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. “All you’re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.” But he added: “It’s not great when you’re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?” It’s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria’s Gabrielle Solis. He said: “We were rehearsing and then the director was like, \u0027OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set\u0027, and I was like, \u0027I need a minute.\u0027“ He added: “It doesn\u0027t happen that frequently” because ”there are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.2730 Christopher Guest and Cary Elwes – The Princess BrideWhen you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner’s The Princess Bride, it really happened.

The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role.2930 Viggo Mortensen – The Lord of the RingsWhen Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor. This behaviour would seem like an appropriate response to the grief his character feels but in reality, the actor had actually broken two toes while kicking his helmet.3030 The entire cast of RoarBut whatever the mishap, nothing can surely be as bad as it was on set for director Noel Marshall’s family, who were cast in his 1981 adventure comedy film Roar?

She said: ”My whole self-confidence plummeted to the ground and I realised that I\u0027m a monster and anybody who touches me will immediately start vomiting and that’s just the way it\u0027s going to be.”830 Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley – The Vampire DiariesNina Dobrev accidentally broke Paul Wesley\u0027s finger while shooting a sex scene in The Vampire Diaries.930 Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan - 50 Shades of GreyObviously this could be a load of hype to promote the first erotic film in the franchise, but there were certainly a lot of terrible sex scenes in which things could go wrong. Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, becomes romantically linked to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and they act out their BDSM desires. Johnson, who wore a modesty thong glued to her body while Dornan wore a “wee bag” to protect his modesty, said: “I got whiplash once from him throwing me on the bed. So f***ing painful. I wish we had a gag reel from the shoot.”Michael Imperioli is best known for his role as Tony Soprano’s protégé, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. During the filming of his death scene in Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas, Imperioli cut his hand on a glass and was taken to hospital, where the doctors sped in to treat his fake bullet wounds.During the filming of Groundhog Day, Murray was more irritable than usual as he was going through a orce and was prone to disappearing from set. He had been asked to get an assistant to ease communication between him, the director Harold Raims and the studio. He was against the idea, so he hired somebody who was deaf and spoke only in sign language, which nobody on set, including Murray, could understand. Ramis said: “Bill said, ‘Don’t worry, I\u0027m going to learn sign language.’ And I think it was so inconvenient that in a couple of weeks, he gave that up. That’s anti-communication, you know? Let’s not talk.”It was a small mishap for Dunham when her nude patch kept falling off in scenes that required nudity. Dunham, who plays aspiring writer Hannah in her comedy-drama TV series Girls, said: “I stopped wearing the nude patch after the first season of Girls. There’s not one guy who works on that show who hasn’t seen the inside of my vagina. You glue it over your vagina. It gets sweaty and always falls off. My male co-stars, at the end of the day, don’t care.”In one scene of Quentin Tarantino’s 2015 Western thriller, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue plays a guitar. It is a vintage Martin guitar from the 19th century, worth roughly $40,000, which had been loaned out from the Martin Museum in Pennsylvania. But a misunderstanding on Russell’s part led to an expensive mistake. The valuable guitar was meant to be swapped over with a replica prop when he snatched it from her. Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting “Music time is over”. As a result, the Martin Museum – which called the guitar a priceless, irreplaceable artefact – vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again.1430  Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore – Maps to the StarsThe Twilight and Lost City of Z actor played Jerome, a limousine driver and struggling actor, in David Cronenberg’s acerbic Hollywood satire. It was while he got intimate in the back of a car with Moore’s character, a washed-up actress, that he ran into problems and started sweating profusely. “I sweat like a f***ing crazy person,” he said. “I was trying to literally catch drops of sweat to stop them hitting her back. Afterwards she was like, \u0027Are you having a panic attack?\u0027 It was so embarrassing.”1530 Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and other DrugsHathaway accidentally stripped off too soon when she thought cameras were rolling during the filming of Love and other Drugs. She stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the erotic film based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. “I have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, and I thought we were filming,” she said. “But it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people!”In a 2007 episode of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica TV series, Olmos’s character William Adama, the commanding officer of BS Galactica, is playing around with a model ship when he gets carried away by improvising and smashes it to smithereens. The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000.1730 Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During WartimeDuring a sex scene against a wall for the 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey\u0027s co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. “We had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,” she said. “They said ‘Action’ and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor. It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I\u0027ll never forget.”1830 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-UpThe Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. “In the scene, she’s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she’s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,” he said. “And I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I’ve done.”1930 Sean Connery and Lana Turner – Another Time, Another PlaceSean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner’s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend’s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner’s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US – but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide.2030 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking DeadThe long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who  were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered – but then as they were “humping”, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: “Then we just started laughing, because it\u0027s ridiculous. It\u0027s two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.”During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn’t part of the crew or cast but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates.Not really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene, in which he says, “It’s in. Oh, my God, it’s in.” “She got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,” Mintz-Plasse said. “Afterwards we didn\u0027t talk about it we still don\u0027t speak about that moment.”2330 Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone – The SpecialistStallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. “Ok. Let it be known, I didn’t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won’t take it off. I promised her I wouldn’t take any liberties, so what’s the problem? She said, ‘I’m just sick of nudity.’ I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else’s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.”2430 Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard – The Legend of TarzanApparently Robbie – who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. “I didn’t injure Alexander,” she said. “And I didn’t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he’s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.”Cavill says he had to “apologise profusely” after he got aroused on set, adding that “It had only happened to him once”. “A girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn\u0027t rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She\u0027s basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.” He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. “All you’re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.” But he added: “It’s not great when you’re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?” It’s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria’s Gabrielle Solis. He said: “We were rehearsing and then the director was like, \u0027OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set\u0027, and I was like, \u0027I need a minute.\u0027“ He added: “It doesn\u0027t happen that frequently” because ”there are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.2730 Christopher Guest and Cary Elwes – The Princess BrideWhen you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner’s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was “messing around” between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant’s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. “I was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes – you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).”The star was filming the scene in which he storms off after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting “Hey Malkovich, think fast!” Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role.2930 Viggo Mortensen – The Lord of the RingsWhen Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor. This behaviour would seem like an appropriate response to the grief his character feels but in reality, the actor had actually broken two toes while kicking his helmet.3030 The entire cast of RoarBut whatever the mishap, nothing can surely be as bad as it was on set for director Noel Marshall’s family, who were cast in his 1981 adventure comedy film Roar? During filming, his then wife Tippi Hendren and her daughter Melanie Griffith, as well as his two sons, John and Jerry, were mauled by lions. Heddren suffered multiple scalp wounds while Marshall was bitten so many times, he ended up hospitalised with gangrene.According to Variety, Netflix is also working with independent chains\u0026nbspto screen the film.Scorsese and Netflix are keen for The Irishman to show in theatres so that it qualifies for the Oscars, but standard cinema agreements usually dictate that producers must wait 90 days to screen a film on a streaming platform – not three weeks.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She added: “It’s very likely that it just made a navigational error.”The humpback is believed to have been first spotted on Saturday in Gravesend, near to the location\u0026nbspwhere a beluga whale was first spotted in London last year. The beluga – later dubbed Benny – spent months swimming in the Thames before leaving the capital early this year.Shipping operators have been warned of the presence of the humpback, which\u0026nbspPLA\u0026nbspspokesman Martin\u0026nbspGarside\u0026nbspsaid was thought to be between 5m and\u0026nbsp10m\u0026nbspin length.He told\u0026nbspThe Independent: “We hope it swims out on the next tide but it has been with us for at least two days now.”Why is there an Arctic beluga whale swimming in the Thames?Mr Garside said about one whale a year made its way into the Thames, although it is the first time a humpback has been spotted in the river in London for a decade.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They are sighted only sporadically in the UK, usually off the coast of Scotland.In 2006, a northern bottlenose whale was spotted in the Thames in central London.The whale, which was too weak to find its way back out of the river on its own, died despite\u0026nbsprescuers’ attempts to transport it back to sea.In 2009,\u0026nbspa\u0026nbsphumpback\u0026nbspwhale was found washed up on the shore of the Thames in Kent having seemingly died from starvation.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I\u0027m sorry,\u0027\u0026nbspsays politician before taking out headset and walking off setFormer Tory MP Harvey Proctor has stormed out of a BBC\u0026nbspinterview over\u0026nbspScotland Yard\u0027s botched handling of the fake Westminster paedophile ring.Mr Proctor, who was falsely accused by fantasist Carl Beech, walked out of an interview with BBC Breakfast presenter Naga Munchetty\u0026nbspafter complaining he had not been allowed to speak.I\u0027m not having this,\u0026nbspI\u0027m sorry, he said, before removing his earpiece and walking off the set.The former MP was among several high-profile figures named by Beech when he reported\u0026nbspallegations of historic sex abuse following the broadcast of a television documentary on Jimmy Savile in 2012.Beech, 51, was later jailed for 18 years for making false allegations.‘Unwarranted belief’ in paedophile fantasist caused failed probeA probe by former High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques said the failed £4.5m Operation Midland probe resulted in search warrants for innocent suspects - including Mr Proctor -\u0026nbspbeing “obtained unlawfully”.The interview began with Mr Proctor describing how it felt to be caught up in the politan Police\u0027s disastrous investigation into false claims of a VIP Westminster paedophile ring.He said: What happened to me was that I lost my job, my home and my repute as a result of a fantasist who were believed by the politan Police.Mr Proctor then clashed with Ms Munchetty\u0026nbspafter he said\u0026nbsppolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick should be brought onto the programme to\u0026nbspdebate the force\u0027s handling of the case.He said: I respect your work very much but you must not invite\u0026nbsppeople onto your programme and then not allow them to speak.Ms Munchetty replied: I am allowing you\u0026nbspto speak and I will allow you to speak but I also need to give a right to reply rather than letting you say things that are potentially incorrect or when people don\u0027t have a right to reply.He retorted: I\u0027m not having this, I\u0027m sorry.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Jed Foster, 20, has appeared at Reading Magristrates\u0027 Court where denied any involvement with the murderA fire that broke out at the site of Village Bakery on Coed Aben Road, Wrexham Industrial Estate in WalesIn recent weeks, the party has seen its ranks swollen by the arrival of ex-Tories Sarah Wollaston, Sam Gyimah and Phillip Lee as well as Chuka Umunna, Angela Smith and Luciana Berger, previously of Labour. Ms Allen’s arrival brings the Lib Dem tally in the Commons to 19.Ms Swinson said she was “in discussions” with potential switchers and “always hopeful of further defections”, but declined to say whether new recruits were in the pipeline.And Ms Allen, who has been sitting as an independent since quitting Change UK in June,\u0026nbspsaid she was “absolutely” in touch with serving Tory MPs who shared her concerns over the direction the party was taking under Mr Johnson.“I’m not saying everybody should casually resign the whip, but for me it was the right thing and I know that in other MPs’ hearts they know it’s the right thing to do,” she said. “There has got to be at least 20.”Asked if she expected any to follow her, she replied: “I couldn’t say for sure that any will. I’d like to say yes, but one of the things that’s disappointed me most since I became an MP is the lack of bravery that there is.”Liberal Democrats to stand aside in seat of ex-Tory Dominic GrieveLib Dems will halt Brexit ‘on day one’ if they win election – SwinsonCan the Liberal Democrats turn momentum into votes?New Liberal Democrat MP says she expects other MPs to defectMs Swinson said she had been working with her new MP for “a long time” on issues like the campaign for a Final Say referendum, and the pair have been “in close contact” over a possible defection since\u0026nbspMs Allen left Change.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailAnd Ms Allen revealed that she was considering an eventual move to the Lib Dems even while she was leader of Change UK during its disastrous\u0026nbspEuropean election campaign, when she clashed with Anna Soubry over her suggestion supporters should vote tactically for other anti-Brexit parties.“I was talking about an alignment in the centre ground from the very beginning,” she said. “It was a question for me of whether having a holding position as an independent group would make it easier for other MPs to jump, but in the end not many did.”Ms Allen said she held off her move to the Lib Dems until the Unite to Remain movement\u0026nbsp – which she formed to promote pro-EU electoral pacts at the coming election – was securely established.She vowed she would “absolutely” contest the seat she has held since 2015 in the election – telling The Independent: “I wouldn’t stand anywhere else,” – and insisted she was hopeful of overturning a towering Tory majority of almost 16,000 from 2017.Swinson\u0026nbspstands with her latest recruit on Monday (Lucy Young)“The constituency is probably close to 70 per cent Remain, and from the moment I left the Conservatives I have literally had thousands of emails from constituents and people coming up to me in the street saying they are grateful I had put the national interest first,” she said.She insisted that she would not stand down to spark a by-election, pointing out that she used her own literature in the 2017 poll rather than the pro-Brexit material put out by Tory central office.And she said there were “dozens” of traditional Tory heartland constituencies like hers which are now vulnerable to Lib Dems because their voters are turned off by the narrow Eurosceptic views of the Johnson administration.Naming Winchester and Guildford, as well as some of the seats of the 21 no-deal rebels who have been barred from standing for the Tories at the election, Ms Allen said: “There are an awful lot of places where compassionate, moderate, centre-ground, progressive voters have previously backed the Conservatives.“The Tory Party has completely turned its back on those voters and there is a real chance – with the Lib Dems offering that kind of politics – those seats could be lost to them.“The most terrifying thing to me is that Boris Johnson seems to care not one jot about those voters or the MPs who have been loyal to him. His approach is to attack the Labour heartlands instead. But you win elections on the centre ground.”AFPGetty)Ms Allen was marked out as an independent voice on the Tories’ centrist wing from her maiden speech in the Commons, when she was critical of the party’s approach to welfare – something she admits “probably limited my opportunities for promotion”.A former entrepreneur, who put her business on hold to enter politics, said she was attracted by the compassionate and pro-business agenda pursued by the coalition government under David Cameron.“The Conservative Party since then has changed beyond recognition,” she said.“I don’t see that I have changed at all, it is the party that has changed irreparably. The party that I joined doesn’t exist any more. It is self-imploding, it is turning into the new Brexit Party.”And she said it was a “very, very risky” question whether the Conservative Party would even survive its current traumas.“The loud, bullying voices of the European Research Group have been allowed to capture the party and push it to the precipice of a no-deal Brexit, which would be unbelievably damaging for our economy, our society and our Union.\u0026nbspAnybody who shares ‘One Nation’\u0026nbspvalues does not have a home there any more.”By contrast, she said the Lib Dems under Ms Swinson offer “an incredibly positive beacon for what our future could be”, not only on Brexit, but also social justice, compassionate welfare and honesty over spending on the NHS and social care.Ms Allen’s defection was announced hours after the latest talks between opposition leaders seeking a means to prevent no-deal Brexit broke-up without progress on the key issue of the leadership of a possible caretaker government to extend Article 50 talks.Ms Swinson said there were still “constructive” discussions happening, but said that if Labour stuck to its position that only Jeremy Corbyn could head a temporary caretaker administration, then “it won’t happen because we know what the numbers are of people unwilling to back him – not just Liberal Democrats but also rebel Conservatives and the increasingly large number of MPs who have left Labour or are still in the Labour Party but cannot contemplate Corbyn in No 10”.This is not Jennifer Arcuri\u0027s scandal, it is Boris Johnson\u0027sThe Lib\u0026nbspDem\u0026nbspleader said she could name “a dozen”\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspwho could fill the role of caretaker PM, but said this was only one of a number of routes open to those opposing no deal.Progress on issues like the\u0026nbspBenn\u0026nbspAct, to prevent Mr Johnson opting for no deal without parliamentary approval, had been made not in meetings of opposition leaders but in a wider group including rebel Tories and Labour backbenchers, she pointed out.Stressing that the Lib\u0026nbspDem\u0026nbspdoor remains open to future defectors, Ms\u0026nbspSwinson\u0026nbspsaid: “It remains the case that there are lots of\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspwho are unhappy with the current direction of both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn and who share our values of internationals and a fairer and more inclusive society and want to stop Brexit and create a more positive future for our country.“Obviously, I hope more of them will be joining us, but these things happen in their own time.”Asked if she was actively talking with potential defectors, she replied: “I’m always in discussions.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

there is “an element of misogyny” in efforts by grassroots activists to unseat four of the party’s female MPs.And Tracy Brabin said that the party should support MPs facing deselection after speaking out about antisemitism.Emma Lewell-Buck last night became the fourth Labour MP to lose a “trigger ballot” of local party branches, though the vote may be contested after a tied result forced a rerun.Alongside high-profile Jewish MP Margaret Hodge (Barking), Hull North’s Diana Johnson and Roger Godsiff in Birmingham Hall Green , the South Shields MP must now must fight an open selection contest to retain her position as Labour candidate in the upcoming general election.Another female Jewish MP, Louise Ellman, is the subject of motions from her local party calling for her resignation.Ms Lewell-Buck said she had faced opposition from “an angry cohort of men” in her constituency since fighting the seat in a by-election in 2013, and said Labour women faced particular problems in areas where there is “a longstanding culture of misogyny”.Created with Sketch.Brexit and climate protests at Labour party conference: In pictures Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created

According to less timely official data, online sales have been growing strongly compared with 2018 until at least August, the last month covered by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).“Ongoing Brexit uncertainty is clearly having a material impact on the consumer psyche,” said\u0026nbspPaul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG.Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive, agreed, noting that many consumers held off from non-essential purchases or shopped\u0026nbsparound for bigger discounts. Out of 13 product categories in the BRC figures, only sales of food and household appliances showed growth on either measure.Created with Sketch.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesDemand for new ranges of autumn clothing was also dented by warm weather in September, Ms Dickinson said.“With four months of negative sales growth since March, the ongoing political gridlock surrounding Brexit is harming both consumers and retailers,” she added.“Clarity is needed over our future trading relationship with our closest neighbours, and it is vitally important that Britain does not leave the EU without a deal.”Retail sales and broader consumer spending have been a bright spot in an otherwise fragile UK economy this year. However, year-on-year growth in retail sales has slowed sharply from a peak in March to stand at 2.7 per cent in August,\u0026nbspaccording to data.On the less volatile three-month measure, retail sales inched up only 0.6 per cent in the three months to August compared with the previous three months, the ONS said. That was only a slight improvement on July’s 0.5 per cent rise, which was the weakest increase since December.The BRC-KPMG Retail Sales Monitor covered five weeks between 25 August and 28 September.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As we are all too aware, their triumph has been overshadowed by a decision to take legal action against The Mail on Sunday over a story that everyone but them had forgotten about and with every chance they might lose.Whoever happens to be right or wrong, I find the situation desperately sad.Meghan and her dad could end up having to face each other in court. It would be the sort of ghastly media circus Harry wants to protect her from. It should never have been allowed to get so out of hand.I believe that they need to think long and hard about what they want for their future happiness and that of their baby son. It would be a huge decision to walk away from public le and become plain Mr and Mrs Windsor, but it may be for the best.I am well aware it’s a dficult one. As new parents, they want to make the world a better place for their baby. They are in a uniquely privileged position to do an incredible amount of good.But we have Harry confessing he finds it tough to get out of bed in the morning and revealing that Meghan has been left bruised and battered by criticism in newspapers and magazines, and presumably by online trolls.So I reckon they need to do some serious soul-searching and ask themselves whether the wounding criticism outweighs the potential for making a dference.I think even Harry would agree that it would be unrealistic of them to expect the kind of North Korean fawning press enjoyed by Kim Jong-un.If they make mistakes they will be called out, and they have made some howlers.Flying on private jets while scolding the rest of us about our carbon footprint is not a good look.“Do as I say and not as I do” muddies the waters and dilutes their good intentions.I do sympathise with Meghan. It must have been upsetting to see a private letter she sent to her father appear in print.But we are told that a desperate Thomas Markle gave itto the newspaper concerned, presumably as some sort of misguided attempt to make contact with his estranged daughter.There’s no denying Thomas has been an idiot, with set-up paparazzi photos, plus interviews bemoaning he has lost touch with Meghan. Every time he opens his mouth, the gulf between them grows wider. Harry hasn’t even met his father-in-law. Even the birth of Archie didn’t heal the rt.If Harry’s mum was alive it would all have been very dferent. Canny Diana would have dazzled Thomas and welcomed him to the family. She would have protected her son and burnished the Meghan and Harry fairytale.Harry mentions his mum in the statement he made justying the decision to take legal action, and he is absolutely spot on about how she was pursued and hounded.It should be pointed out, however, that it was foreign paparazzi out to make a fast buck who pursued her on the night she died. The accident was fatal because she wasn’t wearing a seatbelt and the driver of her car was drunk.Harry must realise that his wonderful Invictus Games and important work highlighting mental health would not be as le-changing or effectivethe media wasn’t there to cover the events.I understand why he is angry. He is protective of his we and finds it unbearable to see her upset.Like most people in the public eye, I have been subjected to deeply distressing and inaccurate media coverage, although nothing remotely on the scale suffered by members of the Royal Family.It’s tempting to hit back, but I’ve always thought it comes with the territory, andyou and those you care about know the truth that’s all that matters.Harry and Meghan are rich enough in their own right to live extremely comfortablythey gave up being royals.They could freely live anywhere in the world and Archie could grow up without any media scrutiny.If they don’t care about the fame and being “celebrities” then surely it’s a no-brainer.It would be a real shame as they have such a lot to offer but no one wants them to be miserable or even resentful.They’ve a whole lot of thinking to do.Since I turned  my mantra has been “a little bit of what you fancy does you good”.In the past decade I haven’t denied myself anythingand as a result have never felt healthier.All things in moderation hasn’t let me down yet and there really is nothing like a bacon roll slathered in butter with a fried egg on top. Unless it is a juicy steak washed down with a very large glass of red.As long as you aren’t ­having deep-fried lard three times a day then I say go for it – and ignore the faddy-food police.AMID the posturing, the bickering, the juvenile name-calling and the sheer ineptitude of our Parliament, there was one shining moment of clarity and authenticity this week.It came in the shape of Labour MP Rosie Duffield, who bravely stood up in the House of Commons and spoke about her own experience during a debate on the domestic abuse bill.It was honest, deeply moving and extremely important.Rosie is an admirable, decent person who articulated not only her own experiences, but also those who have no voice and who might not have bruises but are bleeding inside.She spoke about how abusers seek power and how they control their victims.It left fellow MPs in tears and reminded all of them that there is a hell of a lot more to do than just resolving bloody Brexit.Rosie is the sort of MP we deserve, andthis bill doesn’t go through it will be a national disgrace.I only wish there were more politicians like her.I HAVE been banging on about how deliciously seductive Sky Atlantic’s Succession is since it first burst on to our screens last year, and it looks like everyone  is now catching up.Our own Brian Cox is superb as Logan Roy, the ruthless billionaire who refuses to name the heir to his multinational business.Everyone is hideous, devious, ghastly and selfish, and the whole thing is compulsively addictive, right from the jarring theme tune to the end-of-episode clfhanger.It’s a bit like a really twisted King Lear, and Cox has never been better.This week the whole episode was dedicated to my adopted city of Dundee and the clan descended there from their NY base to “honour” Logan Roy.I was beyond excited to see Dundee University, the Discovery ship and the newly opened VA featured in this glossy, snarky American drama.Only one bum note.Logan’s hideous son Roman tries to wriggle into his father’s good books by buying him a Scottish football team.He merely incurs his wrath by purchasing deadly rivals Hearts instead of Hibs. It would have been far more effectivethe little weasel had bought my beloved Dundee United instead of Hearts.In real le, Cox is a massive Dundee fan and that would have been a wonderful nod to art imitating real le.BIG congrats to Westle’s Mark Feehily and his fiancé Cailean O’Neill, who welcomed their baby girl into the world this week.Mark was always the quiet one in the band, partly because he wasn’t able to talk about being gay when Westle were packaged as heart-throbs for teenage girls.Mark and Cailean have described themselves as “the happiest dads in the world”.I’m delighted Mark found his soulmate and that they’ve started a family together. I wish them all the very best.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Only six balls remain to be played with Britain’s star batsman standing at the crease — Boris Johnson.England’s World Cup triumph was achieved against the odds and so the passage of our nation towards Brexit has been a slog.However, the PM, unflappable and unflinching in the face of sledging from all sides, has been transformative in reshaping our fortunes.Now he stands before us with something the doubters, despoilers and delayers thought he could never achieve — a workable proposal that both delivers on the referendum and takes into account the legitimate concerns on the Irish border.Under Boris’s deal the UK would leave the EU’s customs union and the single market.It would restore the supremacy of British law over EU law and free the country from the intrusion of the meddling European Court of Justice.It would allow free trade deals to be agreed with friends and partners across the world, reinvigorating global relationships with allies old and new.It would end the payment of vast sums of hard-earned taxpayers’ money and deliver the Brexit that the British people were promised.MPs across Parliament are already starting to show that they are prepared to put partisan dferences to one side to unite behind the deal.Now it is time for the rest of the EU to do the same, to put an end to the toing and froing, the talks and the emergency summits, the snail filled — and snail-paced — diplomatic dinners and take the path out of this cul-de-sac which has now been cleared for them by Boris Johnson.We stand on the brink of an historic month, where all sides have the chance to prove they can put statecraft above squabbling, consensus above conflict, and diplomacy above ision.

This animal is darker.All we know at this stage is it is dark-coloured.There are ying estimates of size, between five metres and  metres.That is consistent in description with a humpback and also other types, including a minke whale.We are working with British Divers Marine Le Rescue, who are monitoring the behaviour of the whale and the type of species.It is not an everyday sight, although we have had a number of whales in the Thames.Mr Garside added that it was too soon to assess how long the whale could be in the river for.The British Divers Marine Le Rescue service confirmed the sighting of the whale.A member of the team said: We observed the humpback whale in the Thames Estuary for just over three hours today, the whale was ing and surfacing at approximately - minute intervals, slowly moving down river with the outgoing tide.Stuart Cheyney, , of Erith, said: “It was feeding and spouting. You could see it with the naked eye, it was brilliant.”Car worker Shaun O’Riordan, , saw the whale surfacing in Dagenham. He said: “I’d seen a few seals, even some dolphins but never a whale in the Thames.”Tim Piles, , of Greenhithe, said: “I’ve been on a boat to see whales — you don’t expect it here.”Experts said there was hope that it is healthy, as it is ing and surfacing in the ­normal way, every five minutes.Julia Cable, from British Divers Marine Le Rescue, said: “We hope it will not be staying in the river for long although there is ample food.“It’s come from the Channel or North Sea and could have had navigational problems.”: A bottlenose whale, nicknamed Whaley caused hysteria in London when she swam upstream for three days. She sadly died from a heart attack after being rescued.: A young humpback whale was washed ashore at Dartford.

And hoping to hell she doesn’t suddenly draw Will Carling in that sandpit of hers.Which, mercully, she didn’t. There was just a hospice, a candle and two little heads who were probably William and Harry, but could just as easily have been Wayne Sleep and Simon Le Bon.It passed without major diplomatic incident, though. As did the rest of Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions’ final, where viewers were served up everything from Stavros Flatley and the Ukrainian sandpit woman to Twist And Pulse and the astonishing -year-old German dog dancing girl, Alex Lauenburger, who’s got those mutts of hers drilled like . . . like . . .Well, never mind what she’s got them drilled like. Let’s just say they’ve cocked their little legs all over Pudsey the dog’s grave. There were a couple of failures among the success as well, of course: magician Darcy Oake, who dropped his act in favour of a bereavement story, and American comedian Preacher Lawson.Brilliant, charismatic and funny during the semi-final, Preacher was rushed, confused and barely raised a laugh during the final. Not that any of the judges did him the favour of spelling out the truth. They don’t seem to do that on BGT: The Champions. What they get instead is OTT praise and  hope.Absolutely the oddest thing they did, though, during Saturday’s final, just before Cowell teed up daredevil Bello Nock as “certiably insane”, was getting Ant  Dec to introduce Britain Get Talking, an ITV mental wellness campaign sparked, apparently, by a “ per cent rise in anxiety and depression”.To counter that trend, proceedings were halted and replaced by an awkward silence inside Wembley Arena, so that viewers could communicate with their nearest and dearest, as they probably would’ve done during the following ad break anyway.Opinions on this stunt will, I realise, y wildly. Given there’s no shortage of shows dealing with mental health issues, though, it just looked to me like BGT had jumped on board the virtue-signalling bandwagon.It also flew in the face of light entertainment’s real purpose, to lt the human spirit and remove you from le’s harsh realities for a minute or two.The audience understands thisonly too well, and that’s why Saturday’s top two places were filled by acts who offered no sob stories, just entertainment.Twist And Pulse deservedly won and got the BGT trophy. Stavros Flatley came second, so Deme’s we doesn’t even get that new fridge. What happens to BGT: The Champions next  I’ve no idea and suspect ITV doesn’t either.All we do know for sure, in fact, is the next part of this weird Autumn Cowell trilogy is X Factor: Celebrity, a replacement for the civilian version which was, in part, dragged down by endless audience manipulation and accusations of favouritism.“Megastar” acts on this new show will include Max  Harvey. A new one on me but, lo and behold, turns out they’re managed by Simon Cowell’s mate Tim Byrne, who used to be Creative Director of Syco.ON Friday’s EastEnders Jean Slater said: “I can’t believe they’ve been pretending to like my sausage surprise all these years. It makes me wonder what they think of my fishy basket.”THANKS to Wednesday’s Cape Town jaunt on The Apprentice, I now know there are , shipwrecks off the coast of South Africa, rhinos are not to be confused with elephants and hippos enjoy mating.

No one, least of all the other contestants, should mistake the most sweet-natured man on telly for a fool, though.He has sussed out almost everyone  on The Circle, including catfish Katie Jay, and knows exactly how they will react to his messages before he’s even sent them.I wouldn’t normally advocate a post-reality show career for any of these fame-chasers.

MP Frank Field said the man was denied the crucial aposmobility elementapos of Personal Independence Paymentin the last few months despite having bones coming through the flesh. The Independent MP unfurled photos of the anonymous manaposs gnarled hands and feet in a bid to shock Tory ministers into action. He did not reveal the identity of the -year-old former church minister from Birkenhead, Wirral, or share photos of his face. But speaking to the Mirror after the exchange, the former Labour MP said the man now faces losing his mobility car following the assessment. Mr Field said when the man came into his constituency surgery, he struggled to walk into the room where he was meeting his MP. These are feet the Tories thought were made for walking, the MP said.  Work and Pensions Committee chief Mr Field - who has left the Labour Party - said the man had an underlying condition for  years which then caused rheumatoid arthritis to affect his hands and feet. The MPaposs office said he was diagnosed with an aggressive auto-immune disease in  followed by bronchial asthma. Mr Field told us after the exchange: My constituent has suffered with a long-term degenerative condition. There is no cure. The joints on his hands and feet are locked into one position. He walks with two crutches and requires regular breaks to recover after walking short distances. He falls regularly and is unable to brace himself during his falls. He was recently awarded Personal Independence Payment after a reassessment. He was awarded full care but has lost all his mobility component. This means he will lose his mobility car.    PIP - paid to help with daily costs of being disabled - comes in two parts worth around £ a week. One part is paid for mobility and the other part for aposdaily livingapos. Mr Fieldaposs office said the man was granted the aposdaily livingapos element of PIP but not the separate aposmobilityapos element when he was transferred from older benefit DLA in the last few months. He is now mounting an internal appeal with the DWP. In the Commons, Mr Field added: Might I meet with the minister immediately to give him a file of photographs of constituents who failed to get any mobility component, even when they have feet with the bones coming through the flesh like this one  So that we can have an urgent meeting to show the procedure we all wish to see applying doesnapost actually operate currently. Mr Field obtained permission from the man to publish these photos.  It comes after as almost three-quarters of people who take their PIP claims to an appeal tribunal win their case. DWP minister Justin Tomlinson said: I would be very happy to meet [Mr Field], who I know has a huge amount of expertise in this area. But we do know that those who transfer from [old benefit] DLA to PIP - there are now , claimants who werenapost on enhanced mobility under DLA who now are under PIP. A DWP spokeswoman said the department was urgently investigating Mr Fieldaposs claims. The case was one of a string of distressing benefit cases raised today during Work and Pensions Questions - most of them about Universal Credit . Labour MP Rachel Maskell said: A young constituent couldnapost afford to go to his Universal Credit appointment, was sanction, then lost his home in Yorkaposs resettlement project and ended up on the streets.  When we were told the government would fix the problems with Universal Credit as it was being rolled out, why hasnapost the government stuck to this commitment  Meanwhile, Tory ministers were blasted over the level of back payments to around , severely disabled people who moved to Universal Credit. Emergency rules were approved in July for people who used to receive Severe Disability Premiums. But campaigners say they are not enough, as the maximum £-a-month rates only go to a small fraction of claimants. Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood said: Will the government explain why those payments still do not fully reflect the financial loss those disabled people have suffered  "},{"url":null,"title":"former conservative mp heidi allen","story":"NewsFormer Conservative MP Heidi Allen joins the Liberal DemocratsThe committed Remainers move takes the Lib Dem tally in the Commons to  and has been warmly welcomed by leader Jo SwinsonShareCommentsByGavin Cordon:,  OCT NewsHeidi Allen has joined the Lib Dems \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

It warns that even a benign no-deal Brexit would likely lead to the Treasury borrowing an estimated £ billion, sending debt as a percentage of national income to almost % for the first time since the mid-s.It warns that public spending, which Chancellor Sajid Javid increased this year after almost a decade of austerity, could need to be cut again as the government struggled to deal with the consequences of a smaller economy and higher debt for funding public services in the wake of Britain crashing out fo the EU without a deal. The groupaposs green budget also warned Tory ministers to shelve plans for permanent tax cuts, as it could reduce the cash available to the government to weather any no-deal Brexit storm.An analysis of Britainaposs economic performance by investment bank Citi, as part of the report, said growth in the UK has been weaker than in other G economies since the Brexit referendum un  and national income is already between .% and %lower than it would have been without the EU referendum result.    Paul Johnson, IFS Director, said the governmentaposs commitments would put spending far closer to Labouraposs pledge in their  manesto than anything from the Conservativeaposs last set of election pledges. He added: The government is now adrt without any effective fiscal anchor. Given the extraordinary level of uncertainty and risks facing the economy and public finances, it should not be looking to offer further permanent overall tax giveaways in any forthcoming Budget. In the case of a no-deal Brexit, though, it should be implementing carefully targeted and temporary tax cuts and spending increases where it can effectively support the economy. It will be crucial that these programmes are temporary: an economy that turns out smaller than expected can, in the long run, support less public spending than expected, not more. Christian Schulz, Chief UK Economist at Citi, said:The UK economy is already around £ billion smaller than it would have been without a vote to leave the European Union, with the UK missing out on a bout of global growth. Business investment is up to % lower than it would otherwise have been, hurting productivity and wage growth. Brexit no longer “just” determines future relations with the UK’s biggest trading partner and the transition towards them it is also intertwined with the political outlook and thus broader economic policies.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt was his idols The Beatles who sang “money can’t buy me love” but the ­lyrics could well have been written about Elton John. At first girlfriends, then boyfriends came and went, and his audiences, though adoring, always disappeared home at the end of the night, leaving the singer from Pinner alone with a cavernous emotional void inside. None of them brought the genuine love he craved. So instead, he became a self-confessed shopping addict, hooked on buying possessions by the truckload. This was a man who would take a ­shopping trolley around Cartier. Yet despite his bottomless wallet, he was never able to buy enough to fill the emptiness inside, no matter how many bouquets he ordered to fill his homes. Of course, none of his other ­addictions had managed to satisfy him either. I described yesterday how he told me candidly about his demons – alcohol, cocaine and toxic comfort eating when we met. Thankfully, a stint in rehab helped him conquer them.So what was this elusive love Elton was searching for Feeling let down by his own, I believe for many decades he was looking for the love of surrogate parents. And that, of course, is the greatest irony of all. For ultimately, it turns out it has not been finding stand-in parents, people to pamper, indulge, to infantilise him, which has made Elton truly happy for the first time in his le. It has instead been finding a husband in partner of more than  years and “soul mate”, film producer David Furnish, who is an equal, not a carer or manager.And most surprising of all, it has been becoming a parent himself, to his two young sons Zachary, eight and ­six-year-old Elijah.And I imagine this comes as no bigger surprise to anyone than  year-old Elton, who never saw himself as a dad.    “I always said no to having kids,” he once conceded. “Because I’m too old, too set in my ways, too selfish, and the lestyle doesn’t suit me.” All that began to sht the day he met David in October . “I wanted to meet new people so I rang up a friend in London and said, ‘Could you please rattle some new people together for dinner here Saturday ’” Among those new faces was Canadian advertising executive Furnish, who’d not been particularly keen on coming along. He soon changed his tune - the mutual attraction between the pair was immediate. Elton said: “He had a real job, his own apartment, a car. He was independent. I didn’t need to take care of him.” The next day Elton called David, who is  years his junior, to invite him round for a Chinese takeaway. Right from the start theirs was an equal relationship there was nothing parental or manager superstar about it. That David has refused to be a parent figure to him, has actually been the key to their success. David wasn’t frightened to tell him what was what. We see that very clearly in Tantrums and Tiaras, the candid documentary they made together about Elton in . Elton once said: “I knew he was the one because he is not afraid of me. He always tells me exactly what he thinks.” Yet David and Elton still clearly have a deeply affectionate, romantic relationship. The pair still write each other a letter every Saturday, the weekday they met, no matter where in the world they are. They entered into a civil partnership in , and in  after the law change, got married. “For David and I, being able to openly love and commit to one another, and for that to be recognized and celebrated, is what makes le truly worth living,” Elton wrote afterwards. The stability of their relationship enabled Elton to think the previously unthinkable: becoming a dad. In  he and David attempted unsuccessfully to adopt a little boy called Lev and his brother, who he’d met on a visit to a Ukrainian orphanage. That was a tipping point. Elton said: “This boy was trying to tell me something. He was trying to say, through God or someone , you can be a dad, look at how much pleasure I gave you in an hour and a half.” It finally seemed a natural progression to have their own sons, via the same surrogate they say they “love as a sister” in Calornia, followed shortly. Elton has now made the decision to retire from touring, to be home with his lads in Windsor, to do the school run, making sure they do chores, tidy their rooms, teaching them values of kindness, and watching them play football. Elton the doing father is not the Elton I met. For the first time his le is about other people, not him, and he admits he has never felt so content within an environment which previously would have felt mundane. He explained recently: “It’s fantastic being a dad. But ten years agoyou’d have told me that, I’d have said you’re crazy. I have learned that a parent’s capacity for love is endless.” So in giving so much love, it seems to have finally sated his own need to be loved - something which always struck me as a psychosis, firmly rooted in what he believes was in large part an unhappy childhood.    As I’ve already mentioned, Elton has repeatedly talked about how he feels let down by his parents. The pictures he paints of his mother and father, Sheila and Stanley Dwight are always fraught with emotion. Stanley, he maintains, was cold. He said: “He was a tough and unemotional man. Hard. In the RAF. He was dismissive, disappointed and finally absent. I just wanted him to acknowledge what I’d done. But he never did.” Others have disagreed, and certainly I have been told Stanley would take his son to football matches, and even bought the child prodigy his first piano. But whether completely true, partly true, or not true at all, Elton has held on to the negative. He was much closer to his mother Sheila, but again the relationship seems to have carried its own share of resentment. He now says: “she always seemed to be looking for a reason not to be happy, always seemed to be in search of a fight”. The pair were estranged for years. She infamously invited an Elton lookalike to her th birthday. Sheila maintained she never actually got to meet her grandchildren. Elton on the other hand now says it was her choice not to meet Zachary and Elijah. Elton once explained: “I don’t hate her, but I don’t want her in my le.” She in turn told him: “I love you but I don’t like you at all.” They only reconciled around a year before Sheila’s death in . But a friend of hers who remained in contact until the end confided to me relations were never as good before her death as Elton has painted publicly. One comment Sheila made to the same friend was that ‘Himself’, as she unflatteringly called Elton, only stopped shouting at people when he was performing... With all this personal baggage, perhaps it makes sense that the best remedy for an unhappy childhood, is to give a happy one to others. Just as he’s doing with his two boys. Responsibility for two little people has transformed him from the man-child he’s been most of his le. Until Elton became a father, he could never truly grow up himself. He was stuck.

Emma Moffatt and partner Jordan Burns reserved a new-build home in Huyton, near Liverpool, but asked for several things to be changed before they took the keys. The couple said there had been several issues with builders, Bellway, including that the new plot had a coal shaft close to the property, a misspelled name and claims they were overcharged for flooring. They wrote to chief executive Jason Honeyman asking for a gesture of goodwill infor the errors, the Liverpool Echo reports.  But Ms Moffatt, from Lydiate, near Liverpool, said she was shocked days later when she read the response from the regionaposs managing director, telling her nothing in her complaint warranted a goodwill gesture. The email added that because of the complaintaposs nature and how unhappy she seemed to be Bellway was not the builder for her. The company cancelled the coupleaposs reservation - meaning the house at the Willow Grange development was back on the market.  Ms Moffatt said the couple are now extremely upset and angry, telling the ECHO she had a panic attack when she heard the news. Describing the situation as the worst customer experience, Emma said: I was driving and Jordan rang me to inform me of the news. I had a panic attack on the side of the motorway and my parents had to come and get me, I literally cried the whole night as my dream house had just crumbled in front of my eyes. Ms Moffatt said despite the setback, she rang Bellway in an attempt to salvage the deal and spoke to several officials but said she was spoken to rudely.  I hope nobody  has to go through the stress an upset we have been through, she added. In a statement, Bellway - one of the UKaposs largest house builders - said it would be inappropriate and unprofessional to comment - and that it was incredibly proud of our customer service. Ms Moffatt said the couple were devastated, adding: Mine and my partneraposs dream house, which we have worked so hard for, is gone. We are extremely upset but angry more than anything with how we have been treated. It seems that they thought we are a young couple so let’s bully them out of the house - and this is not ok. Ms Moffatt said the couple had been searching for a property for a year and had visited the Willow Grange development on ious occasions looking for the perfect home. She added: We were looking for a home to start a family in, so after a few months of back and forth, we finally decided on a four-bedroom detached house, so reserved the house. Ms Moffatt said after being shown the plans, they were told there was a mine shaft close to the house - prompting the couple to ask about the risks involved - but said the issue was brushed under the carpet and we still have not received the information.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailItaposs the infectious illness we all suffer when the temperature starts dropping.Sore throats, coughs, runny nose, the shivers and headaches – and not an effective cure in sight.The common cold laughs ­mockingly at us throughout winter – or rather sneezes all over us. And when the snfles strike, you just have to sit it out with plenty of fluids and painkillers - so here are some tactics to keep the rhinovirus infections at bay. Sing while you soap You can catch a cold by inhaling infected ­droplets coughed, sneezed or breathed out by a carrier. But you can also pick up a rhinovirus infection on your hands from ­doorknobs or handrails and trolleys. Some of these viruses can survive on your hands for up to an hour, so try to wash your hands regularly. And do a thorough job. Don’t just run your hands under water. The World Health Organisation recommends  seconds using soap – roughly the time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice. So go for itas you clean palms, backs of hands, in between fingers and thumbs and under the nails. Dry with a paper towel, then use it to turn off the tap.    Don’t touch your face Can’t get to a basin to wash your hands  Then avoid touching your face until you can. Cold viruses enter your body through your mouth, eyes or nose. If you’re prone to nail-biting, use a special bitter-tasting polish to help discourage you from the habit. Wash it hot As well as surviving on hard surfaces, cold and flu viruses linger on fabrics, too. If someone in your house has the snfles, microbiologists suggest skipping the eco-friendly option on your washing machine when doing their clothes, bedding and towels, as the wash temperature won’t be high enough. Instead, go for  degrees. Use a hot cycle in your dryeryou can, to kill off microbes.    Take echinacea The herb has been shown to prevent cold symptoms erupting, says immunologist Dr Ross Walton. In ,  participants took part in the longest and largest trial by the Common Cold Centre in Cardf on the preventative use of echinacea over a four-month period. Dr Walton says: “The development of recurrent colds reduced by %, as well as symptom severity.”He adds that herbal ­medicines that contain all parts of the plant – such as A.Vogel Echinaforce avogel , work best.Go incognitoCover your face and nose with a scarf in cold weather .A Yale University study found the virus flourishes better in the naturally cooler environment of your nasal passages than at a warmer core body ­temperature because the immune response doesn’t work as well in the cold. So keeping nasal passages warm could mean the virus won’t replicate as easily.    Gargle with sea salt water People with the first symptoms of a cold who washed out mucus from the nose and gargled with cooled, boiled salt water reduced their cold virus ­symptoms by two days, Edinburgh researchers found. They were less likely to need medicines. It’s thought sea salt may boost the body’s ­antiviral defences. Keep your feet warm too Research has foundour feet become chilly, blood vessels in our noses constrict. Less blood flow to the nose means fewer cold-fighting white cells will reach it, so any dormant infection is more likely to take hold. Wear socks with at least % wool to keep toes toasty.    Exercise A study in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found people who exercised regularly cut cold risks by half. Try to achieve at least  minutes of moderate aerobic activityevery week. Be an office clean freak Almost half of desks, computer mice and office phones harbour the cold virus, according to research. Desk sharing can expose you to five times more germs thanyou have your own. Pack eco-friendly tissues in your work bag to wipe down your workstation. Stop stressing An experiment that saw people given the cold virus nasally revealed the most stressed were more likely to succumb than those who were relaxed. Researchers concluded that under stress immune system cells produce levels of inflammation that lead to disease. If you are stressed, try yoga or meditation.

The American Bully, now named Teddy, even tried to chew through the door because he was desperate for food and water. The animal was found soaked in his own urine and faeces because his owner went away and didnapost have anyone to look after it. Teddy has since been rescued and is now looking for his forever home.His former owner Celestino Furtado, of Hemswell Avenue in east Hull, has been banned from keeping dogs for five years, Hull Live reports.The -year-old was found guilty of three offences contrary to section  of the Animal Welfare Act , including failing to meet the dog’s need for a suitable environment, adequate care and supervision and an adequate supply of fresh drinking water at Hull Magistrates Court.  A warrant was issued for his arrest and he appeared before the same court on October  to be sentenced. RSPCA Inspector Jilly Dickinson said: “The smell coming out of the unit was unbearable. There was a wooden door inside which Teddy had scratched and chewed along with exposed electrical wires. “It was a warm day and he appeared desperate for water - drinking every bowl we put in front of him. The environment was completely unhygienic and the large build-up of faeces suggested it had not been cleaned in some time.”  Despite previous advice by the RSPCA, Furtado did not keep his dogaposs environment clean and conditions had deteriorated to an unacceptable level.Inspector Dickinson attended Furtado’s business address in Oxford Street, Wincolmlee, in May this year, along with a Welfare Officer from Hull City Council .They found the dog walking in his own urine and faeces, which led to some sores developing on his paws, although they were not infected. Teddy had skin irritation, particularly under his chin.  The smell emanating from the unit was so strong that it could be smelt from outside, the inspector found.

Ben Lacomba contacted Kent Police more than  hours after mum-of-five Sarah Wellgreen had disappeared from the home they shared in New Ash Green, Kent, in October last year. In two emergency calls on October  and lasting  minutes, the -year-old spoke calmly as he described how he had woken at the four-bedroom property the previous morning and realised the -year-old beautician was missing. Her phones and purse were still at the house and her Hyundai car was parked outside. A jury at Woolwich Crown Court, London, listened to the initial  call and then subsequent aposhigh priorityapos call in which Lacomba detailed Sarahaposs aposcomplicated and messyapos lestyle.  He said she had up to seven phones, and claimed she had been stalked and assaulted at work. He also told the operator that her on off partner at the time Neil James was aposparanoidapos and on one occasion had put a tracker on Sarahaposs phone. The court also heard of the fruitless attempts made by Mr James and several members of Sarahaposs family, including her mother Ann Reid and her -year-old son Lewis Burdett, to contact her throughout October . Her phone was going to voicemail and there was no activity on WhatsApp or her Facebook account, the court heard. At one stage Mr James sent a message to his girlfriend asking aposAre you alive apos He and Lewis also contacted Lacomba in their desperate bid to track Sarah down and said they would be contacting police to search for her. At the start of his call on the morning of October  Lacomba, who denies murder, told the operator: She hasnapost gone missing before but her, erm, sheaposs got a bit of a weird le letaposs put it that way.  He described how they shared the house for the sake of their children but that Sarah was apossort of like seeing a few blokesapos other than Mr James, adding aposand so it looks like sheaposs cheating on himapos. Lacomba described how Sarah split her time between living in the family home, at Mr Jamesaposs home in Farnham, Surrey, and in Portsmouth where she worked for Puresun beauty salon. He said she had told him that Mr James, who himself had children from previous relationships, aposput a tracker on her phoneapos. Heaposs really paranoid about her, like where she, like he doesnapost trust her and that...heaposs always like well just like accusing her of stuff like, added Lacomba. She said both his relationships with the kidsapos mums is poor, erm, like they both cheated on him. Lacomba also claimed one of Mr Jamesaposs former partners was also stalking Sarah, sending her photos of her car when she was staying at his house. In a series of questions from the operator, he said Sarah had not left any sign that she was likely to harm herself or any mental health problems. When asked whether he had any idea of her whereabouts, he replied No I donapost, before adding after a pause of several seconds Thataposs why Iaposm phoning you. The operator also asked: Is there a reason that she may have gone missing  Anything going on that might be upsetting or any reason that you know of that she might go missing at all  Lacomba replied: Like I said like, I, I, nothing, well obviously I, I, I find out about like her sort of seeing quite a few blokes sort of thing, erm...

Jason spent four days in hospital and his mum now wants to raise awareness to stop this craze.    A reckless and dangerous viral crazeHospital bosses have warned that more and more teenagers are seriously injuring themselves by taking part in online challenges that encourage them to set themselves on fire. The craze is popular among young people hoping to become social media stars, but unsurprisingly has led to an increase in cases of serious burns. Specialist staff at Morriston Hospital, in Swansea, have acknowledged it is becoming a big problem. Many patients have been left with lelong scars, a plastic surgeon confirmed.  More cases are being seen by medical experts because of the craze, which originally began in  and has been picked up again. While the hospital did not wish to provide details of the dferent challenges, a quick search online reveals the scale of the problem. One challenge, known online as the Fire Challenge, is literally as crazy as it sounds. Youngsters are challenged to pour liquid on themselves and set themselves on fire. This has resulted in people requiring surgery and le-support treatment. previously reported that in August, a -year-old girl from Detroit burned  per cent of her body in the dangerous trend.Timiyah Landers was with two friends at her home in Michigan, and her mother Brandi had just made them pancakes. However minutes after she left the girls alone, there was a aposloud bangapos and Timiyah was engulfed in flames. Her stepfather immediately put her in a bath and splashed water on her body as her mother tore off her burning clothes. Timiyah was taken to hospital and put on a ventilator in intensive care, with her body bandaged from head to her knees.  Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board is issuing a warning and some advice to anyone who has taken part in any of these challenges online. “I can understand there is pressure on young people to gain acceptance or boost their online profiles by doing such risky things as these challenges,” said Jeremy Yarrow, a plastic surgeon at Morriston Hospital. “But from the patients I see, the results can be very dferent, with some requiring le support treatment and many left with lelong scars.” Mr Yarrow added that while most teenagers presenting with burns are treated as outpatients, some are hospitalised for a considerableof time. “In some severe and sometimes le-threatening cases, they are admitted to hospital for long periods of time for complex surgery resulting in long term mental and physical issues,” he said. While the health board would not release specic details of the challenges doing the rounds online, they did confirm that there are “ious” ones being attempted by teenagers.  Ana Biney, a staff nurse at Morriston Hospitalaposs Welsh Centre for Burns and Plastic Surgery, said: “They copy them from social media and YouTube and call them YouTube Challenges. “They film each other doing the challenges and then upload them in the hope they will become social media stars. “We have definitely seen an increase in the number of teenagers who have suffered quite serious burns because of this.” "},{"url":null,"title":"hotel slammed letting newlywed couple","story":"NewsHotel slammed for letting newlywed couple chant f**k the Pope and the IRAThe Belfast Loughshore Hotel, in Northern Ireland, said staff did not want to escalate the situation by stopping the sectarian chantsShareCommentsByMark CorcoranMatthew DreschAndrew Byrne:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video couple-sang-fk-pope-ira-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news hotel-slammed-letting-newlywed-couple-\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Luckily on this occasion the home side were able to clear.What the game needed was something special, something to get the fans on their feet and eventually McDaid would deliver exactly that.A -yard strike would fly past Derek Gaston, crash off the post and find the back of the net in what proved to be the perfect settler for both players and fans.It was at this point Dundee played some of their best stuff and Dorrans was involved when the Dee almost grabbed their second on the stroke of half time. He took a smart free-kick, finding McGhee in the middle of the box before he laid off to McDaid, his strike crashing off Ricky Little when it looked certain to go in.That’s the thing about this team, the philosophy manager McPake wants to use can cause impatience in the stands but when they get going, it can be easy on the eye.Especially with strong midfield players like Dorrans, Shaun Byrne and Paul McGowan pulling the strings.It was another well-worked set-piece which brought a second for Dundee and for McDaid.He found Sean Mackie on the byline who ed it to his fellow-winger before McDaid cut inside and rled a spectacular strike into the top corner to double his tally and better his previous long-range strike in the first half.Despite an attempted comeback from the visitors following the second goal, it was always comfortable for Dundee after they doubled their tally – and they could have had even morenot for some poor decision making.The real test lies ahead, though, as they look to follow this result up with another victory.Each league win so far has been followed up by two poor results – an average that simply cannot continueDundee are to have any hope this season."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5d9b168c2b2db3.50880008.jpg ","title":"ewan gurr decisions on future must put people before profit","story":"Exactly  years ago, I visited India for the first time.I was there on best man duty for a friend but, while there, I decided to take the opportunity to travel and see some of the country.I arranged to spend a few days volunteering for the organisation led by Mother Teresa, pictured, in Kolkata, formerly Calcutta.She died in  but her legacy was clearly alive and volunteering in the House for the Destitute and Dying was a moving experience, as I cared for terminally ill men who died even in my short time there.At the end of day one, I walked around Kolkata and observed a lorry carrying along a kind of old rusty freight with “Dundee” emblazoned on the side in faded white letters.I spoke to some of the locals and discovered that it had been exported from the dying embers of our city’s jute industry in the s.At its peak the jute industry in Dundee employed % of the city’s population – about , people – and brought industrial resilience to the city as well as financial stability to many families.When I ed from India, I wanted something made from jute and ordered a rug for my we via a fairtrade catalogue, which highlighted the origin in Kolkata.It was then, for the first time, I realised that the jute barons’ decision to export the industry from Dundee, motivated by a stated desire to cut costs, had enslaved a whole race of foreign people to poor pay.Fairtrade organisations intervene on unethical working practices in places such as Kolkata to ensure workers are fairly remunerated.Our history highlights how powerful people deindustrialised our city and deprived our people because they saw greater value in exporting and extorting and perceived profit-making as more attractive than poverty-proofing.In doing so, they not only enslaved a race of foreigners but sold off , of our own citizens to competing for jobs that did not exist.It is not hard to understand decades of record unemployment as prosperity vacated the city and poverty moved in like an unwelcome lodger.In his book Disposable People, Kevin Bales, a professor in contemporary slavery, estimates that  million people still experience modern day slavery, who will now include those in Kolkata.Slavery is simply the application of property law to people, and financially-motivated decisions were made in Dundee that sold off the prospect of prosperity for our citizens in a manner closely related to slavery.They did not sell the iniduals personally, but they sold any hope of securing a sustainable future.Dundee has, for too long, been enslaved by some deeply dubious decisions made behind closed doors.I only hope and pray the decisions made going forward prioritise our people rather than profit."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5d970e09780ed3.20535964-843x564.jpg ","title":"new look dundee united aim to exorcise demons at bogey opponents alloa","story":"Dundee United head to the Indodrill Stadium tonight – a scene of real pain for the Tangerines last season.At the start of last term, United drew -

I think he’s had one or two training sessions.“We’ve got the travel, as well, which is a consideration. A long-ish flight back with a hamstring injury.“It might actually benefit him to have a week at home with Aberdeen.“But we’ll look forward to the next squad, hope he gets his fitness up again and I’m sure he’ll be up for consideration and involved again.”Former Aberdeen striker Lawrence Shankland was the surprise choice in Clarke’s squad after netting  goals this season in the Championship for Dundee United.Reid believes his inclusion is refreshing with Shankland reaching this stage via two years with Ayr United following his Pittodrie departure in .Former Irish international Reid added: “He’s obviously been prolic and started the season really well.

If somebody told me at the time I would still be here eight years later I wouldn’t have believed it.“I can go through it season to season so easily – every season has brought something dferent.“There’s only one season I had any regrets about and that’s when we were relegated.“It’s been really good when you take everything into account. We’ve won League Two twice, reached the Challenge Cup final, beat Rangers at Ibrox, beat Hearts, beat Dundee and played Celtic in the Scottish Cup.“There have been a lot of good moments, a lot of good memories.“One season haunts me and I’m determined the same won’t happen again this season.”After a poor start to the - season, Peterhead dispensed with manager John Sheran’s services.McInally remembers being interested in the position once it became available after leaving East Stirlingshire in the summer of .He added: “I spoke to Paul Mathersat the time. He told me how good a job it was.“I put in an application and was interviewed, but it was Paul who told me about how good a club it was and that’s where it came from.“The next thing was I got a phone call from vice-chairman Ian Grant, who was in charge of the process to appoint a new manager.“I met him in Dundee. We hit it off and I got the job.”McInally is relishing this season’s challenge for Peterhead of trying to consolidate their position in League One. And the -year-old says he is proud to still be in the Balmoor dug-out.He said: “The job is challenging in terms of the geography with players, and over the years it’s got harder.“With Cove being in the SPFL it will get harder still. But it’s a challenge to embrace.“I work for such good people, they’re so helpful the things they do for the players and the club.“I can’t speak highly enough of the people that run the club and they should be so proud of themselves for the way they do it.“It does make you proud that I’m at a club that has a wee bit of class about it.“I spent long enough trying to change them!“To not be so homely and welcoming and giving everyone that comes up a meal.“But now I’m with them on it because it makes us a wee bit better as a club.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column august 30 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is sad to see yet another Mid Argyll community organisation fold due to a lack of suitable volunteers.We seem to be so obsessed with staring at our own reflections on mobile phones these days that we are losing sight of the real world.Look around many community groups and you will notice that there are very few volunteers without the odd grey hair.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three.

We are asking adults to step up alongside us and make this a turning point in our history.#Greta Thunberg was welcomed by the Speaker of the House of Commons, the leader of the Labour Party and the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert! How is it that I had never even heard of that curious little bay. There it lay, calm and silvery, like a scene from a theatre.

Around  resident berth holders and more than , visiting leisure craft during the sailing season add considerably to the numbers who arrive at Tarbert and appreciate the attractive surroundings.The present plans for the power line, however, as exhibited by SSEN, will present a view on entering the harbour despoiled by a line of monster pylons.The current proposal suggests that four or five of the -foot pylons will dominate the western skyline. The visual impact of this scheme as presently proposed will have a negative effect on the experience of everyone who lives in, or visits, Tarbert.Tarbert was designated as a conservation area in the s.

Ettrick, Roxburgh and BerwickshireSuccess for MND Blue Badge CampaignLast week in the Scottish Parliament, it was very rewarding to see the Scottish Government finally decide to revise the Blue Badge eligibility criteria for people with MND.Several months ago, I joined forces with Doddie Weir OBE to start a campaign, which called on the Scottish Government to change the criteria for Blue Badges to ensure that people living with MND can gain automatic access.The campaign came about because of a constituent writing to me about their frustrations with the current system, and how the y process of applying for a Blue Badge is incompatible.Currently there is no cure or effective treatment for MND, and the average le expectancy after diagnosis is sadly  months. Given the nature of MND and the timeframe in which someone can become immobile, it is important that le is made as easy as possible for them.People are only eligiblethey are a recipient of the higher rate of the mobility component of Disability Living Allowanceor those who score eight or more on the moving around descriptor for the mobility component of Personal Independence Payment .Back in , Scotlandrsquos blue badge scheme was extended to include carers and relatives of people with conditions such as dementia, autism and Downrsquos Syndrome, but not for MND.Waiting times and application dficulties can all act as barriers to people with MND obtaining a Blue Badge under the current circumstances. Waiting times associated with the processing of Blue Badge applications ies and currently it takes on average around  weeks. Feedback from MND Scotlandrsquos advisers has highlighted that it can take up to two months.During the debate, it was very encouraging to hear the Minister commit to lsquorevise and refreshrsquo the current code of practice in partnership with key organisations, such as MND Scotland. This will allow for a prescription type of approach, which will mean an MND care team can automatically grant a Blue Badge.This was a victory for common sense and it will make a dference to those living with MND. At the heart of it all was allowing people with MND to keep their independence and dignity. The cost of making this change is minimal and the right thing to do.The positivity and tenacity that Doddie Weir has displayed throughout the years, in exceptionally dficult circumstances, is a formidable example to us all.I want to thank him for his unwavering support, and thank MND Scotland, my fellow parliamentary colleagues and my constituents for helping us achieve the aim of the campaign."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-week","story":"This weeks Pet of the Week, from Borders Pet Rescue, is Tony.The charity told us: \"Tony ndash named after Fat Tony from The Simpsons ndash is seven years old and is a very friendly boy who is currently on a bit of a diet as he weighs kg.\"Tony is looking for a home with no other pets.\"If you would like to offer Tony his forever home, please email info@borderspetrescue.org for an application.\""},{"url":null,"title":"borders-families-wanted-star-new-weight-loss-tv-show","story":"IS your child looking to lose weight Well, the makers of hit TV shows The Real Marigold Hotel and Ibiza Weekender are on the lookout for Borders families to take part in a new weight-loss series.Production company Twofour is casting for people aged - who want to cut down.And they will be offered a free and local personal trainer, nutritionist and have their food shop covered for six weeks.The series will be broadcast on Star.A spokesperson said: \"In the series, obese teenagers call on help from mum and dad , to try to reduce their size, which is hitting their health and their happiness.\"With specically tailored nutrition and exercise plans to help them lose the pounds, the families undertake an emotional journey of transformation and discovery, getting to the bottom of their weight gain.\"Working together as a family the teens hope to change their lestyle and get on the right track for a healthier and happier future.\"To take part, email newyou@twofour or contact producers on WhatsApp on ."},{"url":null,"title":"earlier-closing-borders-recycling-centres","story":"RECYCLING centres have resorted to winter opening hours this week with the gates being locked two hours earlier.Despite falling behind other local authority regions with recycling rates, a decision was made by Scottish Borders Council earlier this year to introduce seasonal opening hours.From this week, all recycling centres in the Borders will close at .pm instead of .pm.Councillor Gordon Edgar, spokesman for waste collections, said: ldquoI would like to thank the public for using the community recycling centres so far this year, including the thousands who used the new summer hours to visit after pm, when the centres were previously closed.ldquoWhile there is a change to the weekday opening hours for winter, weekend hours remain unchanged, with all facilities open Saturdays and Sundays, when demand is higher.ldquoI would continue to encourage the public play their part and use our community recycling centres to help the environment and public funding, with a huge iety of items being recycled at our centres."},{"url":null,"title":"pints-plays","story":"AFTER a sell-out performance in March this year, Borders Pub Theatre s to Selkirk and Hawick for its second act.With two performances this month - the first in the County Hotel, Selkirk on October  and the second in The Cornucopia Room, Hawick on October  - the home-grown theatre group will showcase local acting, writing and directing talent.Take  will feature all brand-new short plays from award winning playwright Jules Horne from Hawick among a team of others who have contributed to the two events.Each semi-staged play will be performed by actors Emily Larner and Matthew Burgess and will be directed by Kate Nelson from the Nutshell Theatre.Borders Pub Theatre was created after members took part in a two-year scheme organised by Playwrights Studio Scotland.Both performances on October  and  will start at .pm.The County Hotel also boasts the addition of a raffle to the promised laughs of the evening.Tickets are pound..

After some detailed discussion it was agreed that these affected areas would continue to be mown regularly to maintain the appearance of the park, said Mr Turnbull.But the community council agreed that bioersity could be increased in an area of Haylodge that would not detract from the amenity of open spaces.Mr Turnbull explained: ldquoA suggestion was made that a flat piece of parkland at the extreme western end of the park could be converted into a community orchard where fruit trees that thrive in our climate could be planted, this could include ieties of apple, pears and plums and such like.ldquoIt is reassuring to see that managers in SBC recognise the validity of the communityrsquos concerns and have agreed not to make any changes, as proposed, in the way these areas are currently managed.

Such an orchard would be on a piece of land that doesnt seem to be used very much and it would add a great deal of interest to the park as well as providing fruit for the community."},{"url":null,"title":"gala-stylists-pick-pace-lavender-touch","story":"GALASHIELS hairdressers Sharon Sanderson and William Pearson proved to be a cut above last month as they completed the gruelling Edinburgh Half Marathon.The R and R Hair and Beauty salon stylists spent several months pounding the streets of Gala in training.Their efforts proved worthwhile as both -year-old William and -year-old Sharon reached the finishing line well within their two hour targets.And, so far, they have also raised more than pound for local cancer charity, The Lavender Touch.William told us: \"Both Sharon and I have had people in our lives who have been affected by cancer.\"Ive done Gala Opera for a number of years and got to know our photographer Shiela Scott and the great work that she and Lavender Touch do to help people in the Borders with cancer.\"It was Sharons idea to do the Edinburgh Half Marathon to help the charity and we trained together to get ready for it.\"Weve been overwhelmed by the amount of support weve received, both in the shop and also online.\"Sharon completed the coastal route from Meadowmill to Musselburgh in a time of . while William was a couple of minutes further back with ..Sharon added: \"Lavender Touch provide such a crucial support to iniduals and families going through an extremely dficult time in their le.\"Every single penny makes a huge dference to the lives affected by this horrible disease.\"To support William and Sharon visit their crowdfunding page at www.justgiving crowdfunding stuart-mcdonald-"},{"url":null,"title":"47-year-old-cleared-breaching-alcohol-limit-charge","story":"A JEDBURGH man accused of being in charge of a car while more than five times the legal alcohol limit has been found not guilty at the towns sherf court.Christopher Smethurst, , of Brucefield House, Rennieston, had denied the offence which was said to have happened in High Street, Jedburgh, on June .It was alleged he had a breath alcohol reading of  microgrammes - the legal limit being .But he was found not guilty by Sherf Colin Dunipace following a trial."},{"url":null,"title":"monzani-trio-set-make-music-hawick","story":"CLASSICAL music takes centre stage in Hawick next week with the arrival of three of the countrys leading performers.Flautist Lee Holland, violinist Rachel Spencer and cellist Feargus Egan have all played for the Scottish National Orchestra, the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra.Inidually they have enjoyed illustrious careers and won many prestigious prizes as well as earning scholarships.Together, as the Monzani Trio they bring a fresh insight and personality to their performances.On Saturday, October  they will perform a stunning iety of pieces from some familiar and not-so-familiar composers.Vanda Mercer from Hawick Music Club told us: \"The Monzani Trioall all enjoy a passion for chamber music.\"Their concert programme for the evening takes us on a journey through history and begins with Arangelo Correlli and follows with Josef Haydn.\"La Musica Natturna della Strade di Madrid is next with all the charm lightness and invention of Luigi Boccherini.\"Then George Philipp Telemann, J S Bach Charles Stamitz, James Oswald, Eugene Ysaye, Eddie McGuire, Tilmann Denhard and Bela Bartok.\"This is a wonderful programme that wonrsquot disappoint.\"Tickets, priced at pound for adults and free for all under s, are available from the Heart of Hawick box office.The concert on Saturday, October  is scheduled to start at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"sarah-triumphs-visually-impaired-great-scottish-run","story":"FOR most short-sighted people having your glasses or contact lenses in when taking part in a major running event would be first on the kit list.But as Peebles woman Sarah Keen approached the k start line of the Great Scottish Run on Sunday, she removed hers and set off with a blurry colourful cavalcade of runners.Sarah braved the roads of Glasgow despite not being able to see properly, to raise money and awareness for her two friends who have visual impairments.With her dad Mike McGrath by her side to guide her on the route, Sarah smashed her target and time and raised pound, for DEBRA and the Macular Society.Sarah told us: ldquoThe run went well and there was such a great atmosphere around us with bands and people cheering, not that I was able to see any of it.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box.

A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

What exactly fostered it I cannot say, but for sure the stories of lsquoMadam Butterflyrsquo, a teacher at Preston Lodge, was part of it, and perhaps also the history that I was visibly surrounded by when I left Prestonpans and moved to Edinburghrsquos Old Town as a teenager.What I do remember from these times is a powerful feeling that I was lucky to have this interest. It kept me going when I was having bad times, because there was always something that interested me or stimulated my fascination.I have realised now that part of historyrsquos appeal is the images it creates for us, of a time that is dferent to ours. No matter how many lsquofactsrsquo there may be, itrsquos our imaginative interpretation of them which makes this information interesting or fascinating.This is why archaeology can also be particularly interesting. Itrsquos a tantalising glimpse into the past but leaves lots of scope for our own imaginative recreations. This connects to the fact that we often hold fascination for things we have lost because we cannot physically experience them anymore.For me, this is the case every time I travel through the Hardgate in Haddington. Until the s, a building stood on the east side of the street, where now there is a small grassy park. Locals nicknamed the building Bothwell Castle, although it wasnrsquot a castle in the real sense, but an impressive town house owned by the Cockburns of Sandybed, hence its original name, Sandybed House. Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle. He shows that the lintel above the door into the kitchen lies just under the ground. In fact, the remains of the kitchen are just part of a mass of archaeological finds in the Hardgate, going back to Medieval times.These finds are covered up now, butyou venture yourself to the wee park in the Hardgate you can still see the disturbed ground where they took place.And look closely at the wall by the road, next to the southern entrance. There is a strange curve in the wall here. Thatrsquos because the lower section of this part of the wall is in fact the remains of the circular stair tower of Bothwell Castle.A buddleia butterfly bush was growing by it when I visited last week, but my long-suffering family waited as I ventured under the bush to take a photo of what I believe to be the old stonework of the stair tower.I then told them the story of the spit boy as we sat on the location of the kitchen. The river is just beyond and as we left the park I couldnrsquot get an image of Bothwell dressed as a washer woman out of my head.As I say, history can be fascinating because it stimulates our imaginative interpretation!"},{"url":null,"title":"pipers-become-movie-stars-bands-unusual-new-calendar","story":"Haddington Pipe Band launches its  calendar this weekend, with this yearrsquos taking on a movie theme.The launch is at the townrsquos The Loft Cafe today , where the  shots that were taken for the calendar by photographer Paul Bock will be on show until January.Alastair Bruce, from Haddington Pipe Band, said: ldquoWe decided on a slightly dferent approach this time round and wersquove certainly had a lot of fun putting these shots together.ldquoOur inspiration was iconic film posters so, working with Paul, we have recreated and re-interpreted  well-known posters and given them all a piping and drumming twist, with band members taking the starring roles.ldquoWersquove also put a spin on the titles and the other text which featured on the originals.The group are recreating posters from popular movies including Braveheart, Trainspotting, Harry Potter, Chariots of Fire, The Sound of Music and Pirates of the Caribbean.Alastair added: ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to pay tribute to Paul Bock, who has done an absolutely fantastic job with the shots his creativity was unbelievable.ldquoAimee Colley of Shaw Marketing and Design also did a terric job creating the artwork and Lori Walker was a huge help in turning band members into film stars with her make-up skills.ldquoOf course, the real stars are the band members themselves!ldquoWe are also extremely grateful to the many businesses and organisations who have kindly sponsored the production.

We are told there is a two week wait when all the anecdotal evidence is that it is at least threenot four weeks.A spokesperson from Riverside said: ldquoIn East Lothian, as in many parts of Scotland, people are living longer with increasingly complex health and care needs.ldquoIn response to this growing challenge, Riverside Medical Practice has been working hard over the last few years to transform the way our patients are being cared for, working closely with a wider range of healthcare professionals to ensure the right care is provided by the right person at the time help is needed.ldquoThrough this, the practice has made signicant improvements in providing lsquosame dayrsquo appointments for those whose health concern may be urgent. In addition, through making these positive changes, Riverside has been able to provide more and longer advance bookable GP appointments.ldquoRiverside is growing our team of GPs and has successfully recruited seven new GPs over the last two years.ldquoThe practice is currently going through a period of signicant telephone and clinical systems upgrades that will not only address the limitations patients at the Riverside practice have experienced but will introduce a new low-charge  number.ldquoOnce complete, the upgrades, in line with the new way of working, will provide long-term benefits for all patients in the area.

After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn. Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work. As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather. Other than farmers, I doubt there is any single group more intensely aware of our climate, and the ways in which it is fast changing. For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10508500.jpg?type=article-full","title":"euro-2020-trophy-tour-details-revealed-nationwide-tour","story":"Hampden will host a series of competitive fixtures on the , ,  and  June .

Glasgow, like many other cities, is increasingly aware of the need to promote bioersity. And that means it needs space for pollinators, small mammals and birds, invertebrates and a wide range of plant species.On top of the designated meadows, seeds will be sown on a range of plots that includes parks, road verges and steep slopes that are dficult to maintain.The city in a statement said: ldquoIt is anticipated that the extent of meadow land in the city will grow by one hectare per year, which will mean a further five large-scale meadows to be created over the next four years and eight other sites to be enhanced with additional wildflower planting.The move will mark signicant changes in how open space is managed.Councillor Anna Richardson said: ldquoEven though we live in a highly urban environment, our most recent audit of the cityrsquos bioersity identied , dferent species alive in Glasgow. We have a clear responsibility to nurture bioersity in Glasgow and we can help to do that by creating spaces where a wide range of species can thrive and flourish.ldquoWildflower meadows act as habitats for pollinators, such as bees and butterflies, which are a crucial component in the sustainability of our wider environment. These meadows are also an increasingly attractive addition to our parks and can add colour to otherwise unwelcoming spaces such as central reservations along roads.ldquoBut leaving land to grow more naturally has an additional benefit that allows us to redirect resources to our wider parks operation and help ensure our parks remain one of most loved features of the city.The initiative to extend the coverage of wildflower meadows is part of the cityrsquos Local Bioersity Action Plan, which includes a specic plan to support pollinator species within Glasgow. Taken together, the plans are delivering or working on over  actions to enhance bioersity, assist and develop ecosystems and encourage volunteering across the city.The contribution of voluntary groups such as The Conservation Volunteers and the RSPB has been crucial to the effort to create wildflower meadows.Volunteers have been active in areas such as Robroyston Park, Linn Park, the Cart and Kittoch Site of Special Scientic Interest, Cleddans Burn and Cardowan Moss.Springburn Park is one area that has been earmarked for the development of a new wildflower meadow.The work involves stripping back scrub or cutting grass and removing all the vegetation so that ground suitable for wildflower planting is created.The plan will also see the nursery at Pollok Country Park be used as sowing and growing areas for wildflowers with a focus on nurturing wildflowers that are native to Scotland.Local authorities across the UK are gradually changing how they manage open spaces, such as the verges of roads.Many councils, including Edinburgh, are cutting back on traditional mowing, allowing grass to seed and flowers and other plants to grow.Britainrsquos big roads management regulators, like Highways England and Transport Scotland, last week were given new guidelines under which main road verges will only be cut twice a year, down from the previous four.Glasgow is in a race to be Britainrsquos first city to get to zero net carbon. That includes dramatic plans to re-green what was once the dear, green place.Last month the Herald revealed the city was so keen to plant more trees that it is considering proposals to re-forest its golf courses.Now an influential group of councillors has called for the courses - including the -hole Littlehill, Lethamhill and Linn Park - to be turned into forests, wetlands or even allotmentsthey shut.The councilrsquos climate emergency working group ndash in a major document still under consideration ndash said: ldquoDepending on the outcome of the current public consultation into the future of Glasgowrsquos public golf courses, it may be that some of these under-utilised sites are also repurposed for food growing, tree planting or as a carbon sink."},{"url":null,"title":"Last night s TV - Disclosure  The Seduction Game","story":"BBC, Scotland****WHAT a time to be alive.

His nickname was Addy A-game, real name Adnan Ahmed. You may recall the Glaswegian from a video earlier this year on The Social, a podcast from BBC Scotland.Read more:YouTube pulls pick-up videos after BBC investigationThe Social commissions short videos aimed at the - audience, covering everything from panic attacks to leaving the house with a toddler in tow. Most, it is fair to say, do not rack up huge viewing figures.Then along came the film about Ahmed by Myles Bonnar, a reporter and producer who has worked with the BBC before. Two million hits and one intervention by a First Minister laterand police acted.Police Scotland had been contacted by a whistleblower several months beforehand, but it took the film going viral, and being raised at Holyrood, to get the investigation moving.The story also came to the attention of BBC Scotlandrsquos Disclosure unit, the channelrsquos equivalent to Panorama. In what was a first for BBC Scotland, the short film for The Social was developed into a half hour investigation that was broadened to include London and the pick-up business in general.Panorama became interested, and after investing some money it received a version to show in the rest of the UK. The two programmes, with some dferences, mainly to do with dfering legal systems, aired at the same time last night. ldquoTwo for one no longer applies to just supermarkets: it is the modern, multi-ing way in the media too.Read Alison Rowats TV week:Catherine the Great, World on Fire, The Apprentice, The Capture, reviewsBonnar spoke to two young women who had been approached by Ahmed in Glasgow. Chillingly, he had secretly filmed the encounters stupidly, he had uploaded them on to the web. We saw one woman being polite but clearly trying to distance herself from him. She had, she explained later, been trying to spare his feelings.Digging deeper, Bonnar discovered a ldquoseduction industry worth, he said, pound million. It was not clear how he arrived at such a precise figure, but there were training courses advertised on the web ranging from pound for a weekend up to pound for a week abroad.Bonnar enrolled on a course and went to London to learn from a couple of self-styled Lotharios. He went undercover, which consisted of shaving his beard, changing his name, and wearing a hidden camera. Not quite Serpico, but then he was hardly dealing with the sharpest pencils in the case.After rattling along for the first half, there was a drop in pace when Bonnar ed to Glasgow to show a crosssection of young people some clips from filming. They were duly horried and angry. Who knows why, other than filling time, we needed to have such reactions set out when the viewer was doubtless feeling the same way.Otherwise, the interviews, one with an academic who had researched the industry, added context and an explanation of the law in this area. But where was the chasedown, the scene without which no piece of popular reportage is complete Bonnar supplied it at the end, confronting his ldquotutors with a confidence that hinted he will go far in this investigative journalism game. ldquoItrsquos disgusting what you guys do, said one of the exposed without a trace of irony.As for Ahmed, he was convicted last month of threatening and abusive behaviour and is awaiting sentence.

Hard smacking is already illegal but to the middle-class anti-smacking zealots, that was not enough. Children, they argue, need ldquoequal protection from assault.The very language they use is alien to the millions of parents who occasionally smack, rather than ldquoassault, their children. Parents know that smacking a child is a form of discipline done out of love and concern rather than something that is abusive and criminal.The zealots talk about children and adults asthey are the same, needing ldquoequal protection under the law. But ordinary people, indeed society knows that children are not the same as adults. We cannot ground adults, confiscate their phones or send them to their room. If we did we would be breaking the law.It is debatable whether smacking is the best form of discipline for children.

Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable. For items like tea bags, coffee grounds or banana skins, recycling food waste is a vital piece of the puzzle in tackling the climate emergency.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The public is being asked to look out for squirrels  both red and grey  for the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey. \"  \"  Join in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey this weekviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"dav\"  Residents urged to support Recycle Week viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"According to the Scottish Government’s  Scottish Household survey, only  per cent of Scottish households say they recycle their food waste, despite around  per cent having access to a food recycling caddy."},{"url":null,"title":"inverurie screwfix shop is approved","story":"Councillors have approved plans for the erection of a shop on the site of the former IK Motors yard on Inverurie#s Blackhall Industrial Estate.Aberdeenshire Council’s Garioch Area Committee heard on Tuesday that the site, which was formerly used for car sales by IK Motors, is currently unused with all sales now taking place at Highclere Business Park.The new building will be occupied by Screwfix and while the main market served by the company is trade sales, the premises would also be open to members of the public Monday to Friday from am to pm, Saturday from am to pm and Sunday from am to pm.Councillors heard that the proposal would create  jobs.The wider site currently accommodates a number of outlets including the likes of Morrisons, the Strathburn Hotel, Firework Scotland Ltd, Magpie Second Hand Furniture, William Wilson Plumbing Centre andthe Fly Cup Coffee Shop.

Spending on these ads, often targeted to specic groups, has totalled more than £. million since last October.And while much of the attention has focused on the big parties and pressure groups on either side of the Brexit ide, the data also reveals the thousands of adverts placed at a local level, often seeking to influence constituents on what can appear to be seemingly mundane neighbourhood issues.Under new rules Facebook introduced in October , anyone placing a political advert must declare who paid for it.Our investigation identied around  ads on the pages of local politicians and councils which were run without these disclaimers – including  placed on behalf of sitting MPs.There is no suggestion that any of the adverts had been deliberate attempts to deceive constituents. They were all found and removed by Facebook.Most adverts placed by or on behalf of Scottish MPs from October  to September , , were for amounts less than £.There were a few exceptions – £ spent by Gordon Conservatives, £ by Lib Dem leader and East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, £ by Angus Conservatives, £ by the Perth and Kinross Conservative Association, £ by Linlithgow MP Martyn Day, and £ by the Conservative Party.For MSPs, the majority also spent sums less than £ promoting material on Facebook.The exceptions were former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson , Anas Sarwar , Johann Lamont , Liam Kerr , Alex Rowley , Alexander BurnettPeter Chapman , Beatrice Wishart , Richard Leonard , and West Lothian Courier Partners .Two Scottish local authorities spent money with Facebook – City of Edinburgh Counciland the SNP Group on North Ayrshire Council .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"\"  Nicola Sturgeon: the Scottish Parliament’s greatest achievements viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Two Scottish politicans each had a Facebook advert removed as it appeared without a disclaimer – Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East MP Stuart McDonald and Martin Docherty-Hughes, MP for West Dunbartonshire.Unsurprisingly the biggest spenders on Facebook over the past year have included ious Brexit campaigns – People’s Vote UK , Best for BritainandBritain’s Future .Production company Slainte Media spent £, promoting former First Minister Alex Salmond’s televisionchat show.A Westminster Government spokesperson said: “There should be greater transparency in political advertising, which is why we have already pledged to introduce the requirement for digital election material to be clearly branded.

He stated that the application went against ious aspects of council planning policy. He had been seconded by Councillor Owen Tierney.Councillors then voted by ten votes to four to approve the development.• A planning application for the erection of   kV electricity substation at Dounreay, Caithness, which connects to the subsea cable across the Pentland Firth and forms part of the high voltage electricity transmission network and the “National Development”, was consented on September  by Highland Council.Further details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While Be Reasonable Scotland is concerned this new law will turn ‘good’ parents into criminals.This is a concern I share. I have vivid memories of my mum walloping me as a mouthy teenager – but should she have been prosecuted  Absolutely not, she was a great mum, and will be mortiedshe reads this article.: Scotland becomes first part of UK to ban smacking of children: Smacking laws in Scotland: current regulations, proposed changes and how the rest of the UK matches upBack in the s, hitting your kids was standard practice. Things have changed since then, as has language we use. We now talk about ‘smacking’ children, as opposed to hitting them just as we call those things we put our expensive cross-breed puppies in, crates instead of cages. It softens the blow, so to speak.Smacking our own kidsThe fact is, many of us have been driven to give our kids a smack at some point. According to a report by four leading Scottish children’s charities around % of parents in the UK have used physical punishment, with children aged three to seven the most likely to be on the receiving end.The numbers don’t surprise me. Nor do the ages of the children, as this is the time when parenting can be the most challenging. My son was three when I smacked him. Six years on, it still makes me shudder with regret.We were at the start of our holiday and had been travelling for around eight hours. I needed to change his nappy, but he wouldn’t let me. He wouldn’t stop shouting, he wouldn’t listen, he wouldn’t do a single thing I asked. So, in desperation, I smacked his very well padded bottom .And you know what  He stopped. Everything went quiet. And for a split second I felt relief. And victory. But then he turned to me and said ‘don’t you hit me’. Well, he did have a point… And then we both sobbed.A flash of furyThe essential problem with smacking or hitting your child is that it’s done in a moment of madness. It’s a flash of fury and frustration, when all other options have failed.This is what ‘time out’ was created for. It’s not just about punishing the child, it’s about giving the parent time to take a breath and calm their thoughts. There are countless times I have shut myself in the kitchen cupboard, so I can silently scream into the fridge, or bang my head against the cornflakes.I will do everything I can to avoid hitting my children because I know, in my gut, that violence is wrong. I tell me children on a daily basis not to hit each other, so how can I justy doing the same to them  We shouldn’t hit our children just because society or the law say it’s ok, or because they aren’t big enough to hit us back.In fact that is the very reason we shouldn’t hit them. Even when pushed to the limits by a tyrannical toddler, we don’t have the right to use physical violence. Just as those teachers back in the s had no right to hit our children.Many parents today look back on those times with disbelief and horror, and I wonder years from now our children will feel the same about those dark days when parents hit their children.Maybe this change in law marks the beginning of a new era of positive parenting.

It is self-evidently not necessary to dress in designer clothes and shoes or receive nail treatments funded from the public purse in order to be an effective representative for Glasgow.ldquoAt a time when the SNP are slashing funding to local government and services in our communities are under so much pressure, it is an obscene waste of taxpayersrsquo money and grossly unfair for the Provost to be spending more in one day than most workers earn in a week on a spending spree at John Lewis.ldquoThe SNP came to power in Glasgow two years ago promising to end the excesses of Labour rule in the city and bring transparency, openness and accessibility to the running of the council.

Details revealed Ms Bolander spent £, on alcohol since taking office in .Today a council spokesman said: ldquoThe national committee that oversees councillorsrsquo pay recognises that the requirement to represent their city at hundreds of events means Lord Provosts often incur personal expenses.ldquoFor that reason, the Scottish Government allocates a civic allowance to each council.

Gareth’s identity was revealed in a News Letter article and the story was picked up by This Morning who invited him and his we Kirsty to appear on the show this morning.Lea also appeared on the show along with her sister Shannon and niece Akeelah, who slept soundly throughout the interview. Gareth Bronte on This MorningIt was to be the first time the family had met Gareth and his we Kirsty in the flesh.It made for an emotional segment on the show as presenters Phil Scholfield and Holly Willoughby introduced the story which was captioned ‘A Random ‘Slice’ Of Birthday Kindness’. Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

He was the le and soul of anywhere he walked into.“He was full of confidence, a real lovely lad. He did a bit of MMA fighting too – he was like a big gladiator and all the lads would have looked up to him.

It comes after a major backlash from other Northern Ireland parties, as well as the Irish Government, to proposals that would see Stormont vote every four years on whether to stay aligned with the EUs single market rules. The current set-up of the Assembly, which hasnt sat in over two years, would allow the DUP to control the decision. But Mr Barclay said: \"The key issue is the principle of consent, thats why the backstop was rejected three times, that was the concern in terms of both sides in Northern Ireland not approving of the backstop.\"So the key is the principle of consent, now of course in the mechanism, as part of the intensive negotiations we could look at that and discuss that.\"The comments open up a potential line of discussion for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who could meet later this week. Mr Varadkar is expected to hold talks with the PM amid reports that other EU leaders including Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron are refusing to meet him. The French President did speak with Mr Johnson by telephone last night but Downing Street suggested afterwards that they made little progress. Mr Johnson told his counterpart that the EU should not be lured into the mistaken belief that Brexit will be delayed beyond October . Downing Street warned Brussels it would be an \"historic misunderstanding\" to believe the so-called Benn Act could prevent a no-deal Brexit, despite being designed to do so.If a deal is not reached by October  then Mr Johnson is legally required to seek an extension. A Cabinet minister said yesterday that the Government has \"no plan\" for what might happenParliament blocks the UK leaving the EU at the end of the month.Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said delivering Brexit on October  was the \"sole focus\" of ministers, who he said would do \"absolutely everything in our power\" to meet the deadline. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is set to meet the leaders of other Opposition parties early this week to decide on their next steps towards avoiding a no-deal Brexit. \"Its already clear that Johnsons proposal would slash food safety and standards, exposing us to, among other things, chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef, currently banned under EU standards. Thats what a Trump Deal Brexit would mean in practice,\" said Mr Corbyn.\"And on environmental protections, Johnsons proposals would mean the UK ditching the highest standards on things like air pollution or chemical safety,\" he added. Meanwhile, suggestions that the UK could try to disrupt the workings of the EUthey were forced into an extension have been rejected by MEPs. Conservative MP Steve Baker even suggested that the Brexit Partys Nigel Farage could be nominated as the UKs Commissioner. \"I think we should appoint somebody with about  years experience... we should appoint somebody whos incredibly well-known throughout the institutions, somebody who can be absolutely relied upon at all times to support our exit from the European Union,\" he said.Fine Gael MEP Frances Fitzgerald said there was no chance Mr Farage would survive the necessary appointment process. Like nominees from all other  member states, he would be subject to an assessment hearing in the European Parliament. \"We havent seen anything yetwe see Farage before a parliament hearing. It would certainly be a circus, which is not what we need,\" Ms Fitzgerald said.

clean-shaven.He later brought an employment tribunal case against then-Chief Constable George Hamilton claiming he had been discriminated against, a view which was supported by an employment tribunal.The PSNI has said it is aware of the tribunals findings and said it is currently examining the detail.Speaking to BBC News NI, Constable Downey said: \"To be turfed out of the unit, with little or no notice, for refusal to shave off a moustache, which doesnt affect the equipment Ive been issued with, is total madness.\"Read MoreMoustache would have to be a ‘belter’ to impair PSNI

implemented in  for some units in the PSNI due to health and safety concerns.The updated policy required these officers to \"remain clean shaven whilst on duty\" for health and safety reasons.The case centred over whether respiratory masks used in certain police units, and which are supposed to be airtight, can be used safelythe officer has facial hair.Expert advice to the tribunal  previously claimed men would need \"a moustache like a walrus\" for the equipment not to work properly.\"The policy itself was being enforced against men under health and safety grounds, and yet females within our unit had hair in contravention of the same policy, not facial hair but head hair, where there was a grab risk,\" Constable Downey said.\"So the policy was being enforced against men and not against female officers.\"Constable Downey said he tried to accommodate the policy by shaving his beard to a moustache but was also asked to remove that.\"As an older person with a receding hairline and alopecia who is slightly overweight all I can do is grow a bit of fur on my top lip, and to have that removed for absolutely no reason is wrong,\" he said.The unanimous decision of the tribunal was that Constable Downey was discriminated against contrary to the Sex DiscriminationOrder .He was awarded over £, for hurt feelings and loss of earnings.Niall McMullan from Worthingtons SolicitorsNiall McMullan from Worthingtons Solicitors, who represented Constable Downey, said it was an important ruling.\"This is a signicant ruling by the industrial tribunal, because it has essentially declared that the current PSNI policy is discriminating indirectly against males, in as far as the application of the policy is concerned,\" he said.\"I would like to see serious steps taken by the PSNI in relation to this decision.\"The tribunal were unequivocal in so far as they want the PSNI to review this decision and to ensure it has a less discriminatory effect on not just my

I hope this rallying cry will focus enough attention and support to ensure its survival and prosperity.\" data-dfpadtargetingPeadar Heffron joined the Police Service of Northern Ireland in A serving officer who has been a long-standing member of the PSNI GAC told the Irish News the club provided a \"safe haven and home to many gaels unable to continue playing with their own clubs for ious reasons, not least security\".\"Like any GAA club, it has given its members lelong friendships and memories,\" he said.The officer, who cannot be identied for security reasons, said at its peak the football team had  players - \"most of whom had previously played at a reasonable club level\".He said the attempted murder of Catholic officer Peadar Heffron in January , who was the then-captain of the team, and the murder of Ronan Kerr, who was from a GAA family, the next year, hit the team hard.It led them to consider closing PSNI GAC, which fields both football and hurling teams, due to fears for players lives.\"At that time, each member of the club had to decide whether they wished to continue their association, identying themselves as Irish Catholic police officers,\" he said.\"Defiantly, when the time came for the next football training a few months later we had a massive turn out, not matched before or since.\"We have played twice on the hallowed turf of Croke Park and competed against our colleagues An Garda Síochána, London politan and NYPD every two years in an international police tournament whilst also playing local club teams in counties Antrim and Down.\"Devastatingly, there has been a slow decline in the clubs fortunes in recent years.\"Since the end of   recruitment the football team has had little to no new blood. Our most recent signings have been open minded colleagues from non-GAA backgrounds willing to give the sport a go.\"They have been brilliant for us and it must be said, very talented footballers.\"With no police officers coming from a GAA background or willing to try the sport, our team has grown old. The average age of the team is now mid to late thirties with a core of players that have been together for the last decade.\"We struggle to get games at the best of times as clubs have reservations about playing us and also have their own season fixtures to contend with.\"This is the first year in memory that we have had to cancel organised games because we cannot field a team, let alone a squad.\"The officer also criticised what he described as \"aggressive and rude\" treatment by civilian staff when attending training.\"I have literally watched a number of them approach my car smiling and friendly, only to become rude and obnoxious, treating me with suspicion as they set eyes on my GAA gear [PSNI GAA gear] as I attend for training.\"However ... you will see a number of civilian soccer teams using the facilities whilst wearing their Glasgow Rangers soccer jerseys without issue.\"Around % of PSNI officers are currently from the Catholic community, while Catholics make up around % of the population of Northern Ireland.In August, Chief Constable Simon Byrne said the PSNI was \"not yet back at the point\" where - recruitment of Protestant and Catholics was needed.The Chief Constable said he wanted to \"convince the people that hold me to account that we have tried every means possible to encourage people from both the Catholic community and also the working-class loyalist community, who I think need a stronger voice in policing\".The PSNI officer who did not wish to be named said: \"It is no exaggeration to say that at least  per cent of all new recruits placed in my district since the end of   are from a Protestant and or unionist background.\"With the lack of Catholic recruits presently, the number of gaels joining the PSNI is non-existent\".He said despite requests and other sports receiving financial support, players due to travel to New York this year for the Police Games have funded the trip themselves to the tune of £, each, which is subsidised by a small amount of sponsorship from GAA supporting businesses.\"All of these ongoing issues will bring an end to the PSNI GAA club,\" the officer said.A police spokesman said: \"PSNI officers are encouraged to join the GAA club, as well as other sports clubs, within the service. The GAA club has seen an increase in support in recent years and continues to play matches against other blue light services and organisations.\""},{"url":null,"title":"government no brexit tariffs on republic goods into northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Teachers have also remained within schools that primarily cater to the same background as their own, the report found.The findings, based on research by Ulster University, have been published in the British Journal of Educational Studies.Historically, Protestant and Catholic children have attended dferent schools - with most of the former attending controlled schools and the latter choosing Catholic maintained schools.Department of Education figures for the  academic year show that .% of those attending controlled schools last year were Protestant, % were Catholic and .% were either of other faiths or had no recorded religious background.The authors of the paper, \"Education policies and teacher deployment in Northern Ireland: ethnic separation, cultural encapsulation and community cross-over,\" found that just as there is separation of pupils, ided schools are staffed, on the whole, by a community consistent workforce of teachers. Northern Ireland has an exemption from fair employment legislation for teacher recruitment, allowing schools to preferentially employ teachers from just one of the communities.Matthew Milliken and his colleagues in Ulster Universitys UNESCO Centre wanted to determine whether more teachers in Northern Ireland were now teaching across the sectarian ide since the last study on this question was conducted back in .They designed an online survey and then contacted all the schools in Northern Ireland to request that teachers in both part-time and full-time roles complete it.To achieve as high a response rate as possible, the survey didnt ask respondents which community they identied with, but what type of schools they went to during their education, whether controlled, maintained or integrated. The type of primary school they attended was then used as a proxy for community identity.Just over , teachers completed the survey, representing around % of Northern Irelands teaching population. Their responses revealed that teachers in Catholic primary schoolswere most likely to have stayed within their community, with % of teachers having only attended and taught at Catholic schools. For teachers in Protestant primary schools, the figures were similar with % having only attended and taught at Protestant schools. In post-primary schools the figures were much lower - % of teachers at Catholic post-primary schools and nine per cent at Protestant post-primary.The study revealed that one in five teachers had no education experience outside their community of origin but around % were currently working in schools outside of their community of origin. Mr Milliken said further research is required to investigate whether this cultural encapsulation is hampering efforts to foster reconciliation between the two communities.\"This research has shown that the chill factor that was understood to have maintained the sectoral separation of teachers by religion community background would appear to have thawed to some extent,\" he added."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38573501.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/_106835320_neurologyreview.jpg","title":"neurology appointment waiting list doubles in northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Its little wonder that the public have so little faith in the service being provided to people with learning disabilities when this type of information is coming to light through the media.\"This was also a safeguarding matter and should have been treated as such to establishany of the inappropriate behaviour was witnessed by the children being treated there.\"If ever there was proof of the requirement for a public inquiry into Muckamore Abbey, this is it.\"Solicitor Claire McKeegan, who represents a number of relatives of Muckamore patients, said: \"The families are deeply upset and angry to be told that this inidual was permitted to work at Muckamore.\"It further highlights the systemic failings of the Belfast Trust.\"It is unthinkable that an inidual who is the subject of an investigation in one institution could work in another within the same trust and particularly in a setting where patients are so vulnerable.\"The families have questions that must be answered surrounding the practices and decision making that led to this crisis. They insist on a full public inquiry.\"An investigation into allegations of improper behaviour by Mr Houston while he was working at the Iveagh Centre was carried out by the Belfast Trust throughout June and July .However, the trust did not refer him to the NMC until December .A Belfast Trust spokesman said: \"We take all allegations of misconduct extremely seriously and immediately launched an internal investigation. \"We did not hesitate to refer this member of staff to the regulator, which in this instance was the NMC.\"Following the investigations and subsequent hearing the staff member was dismissed.\"Despite repeated requests, the trust would not clary whether the action it took arose as a result of allegations Mr Houston faced from his time working at the Iveagh or Muckamore Abbey.Mr Houston appeared in front of an NMC fitness to practise  last week where he was found guilty of a range of sexually motivated behaviour. The  said Mr Houstons conduct \"related to a pattern of behaviour over a period of some  months\" and continued even after his victims asked him to stop.The  also ruled it had the potential to place patients at Iveagh Centre at \"potential risk of harm\".In deciding to suspend Mr Houstons licence to practise for  months instead of issuing a striking off order, the  noted there were no concerns about his clinical skills and that the misconduct, whilst serious, \"was not fundamentally incompatible with you continuing to be a registered nurse and that the public interest considerations in this case could be satisfied by a less severe outcome than permanent removal from the register\".The  noted there was no direct involvement of patients, no criminal conviction and Mr Houston was not registered as a sex offender.It also said Mr Houston had engaged with the NMC, had shown insight and expressed remorse.\"The  concluded that it would be appropriate and proportionate, in all the circumstances, to give you the opportunity to reflect further on your actions, in order to fully appreciate the concerns identied in your practice,\" it added."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

It wasnt until a suicide bid on the Foyle Bridge in his s that he discovered he was bipolar and started to receive help.As far away from the relentless pace of football as possible, his stunning wildle shots are the result of spending endless hours in wait for the perfect moment. From befriending a fox for months to waiting hours to see birds of prey, many thought the patience needed was beyond him.He said: \"You get a rush out of it which is hard to explain. I would get into a hide Ive made at am and still be there at pm and nothing turns up.\"If you told that to people they would think you were crazy. But its my way of clearing my mind as Im usually a  miles an hour with the bipolar.\"His first success came after waiting eight hours to see a kingfisher.\"I got just four frames and he flew off. The excitement of getting those photographs was unreal, it was nearly the same as scoring a goal for Ballymena,\" Dessie added.Still regularly working as a sports photographer covering football and GAA, he said his \"ultimate dream\" would be to travel to Canada to capture a brown bear fishing. He said an unhappy time at St Marys High School in Limavady created a hunger to prove himself early on.He added: \"I dont blame the school, but in those daysyou were disruptive you were kept in the corner and not allowed to do anything. That made me more determined and shaped the person I am today.\"Recalling his near suicide, he said it gave him a greater understanding of the struggles faced by others.\"If I ever heard of people committing suicide in the past I thought they were selfish,\" he said.\"But I was standing on the Foyle Bridge and didnt even know it. If I had stepped over the edge I wouldnt even have realised. I was driving to Derry and the only thing I could do was stop the van and walk over to the rails.\"The only reason it didnt happen was because somebody beeped the horn at me asto say: Get out of that state.\"He managed to drive back to the far side and call his we Anne-Marie for help.\"Im married  years now and I have the best we, shes unreal. \"She never says a bad word to me, I have the longest leash on the planet. She always says I work by the Moon - when its full Im not wise.\"After attending weekly cognitive behaviour therapy sessions for over two years, he now feels able to deal with his bad days.\"I always knew there was something wrong. I had all this energy and the energy had nowhere to go,\" he said. \"I still get days when Im down, but now I just grab the camera and just sit down and relax. I always tell the we where I am because I dont want her worrying. Butyou meet me theres always a smile on my face. Ive no exams but I can talk the leg off a donkey.

Other members carried a coffin with ‘NHS’ and ‘DIGNITY written on the side of it.Other messages on fake gravestones signied the death of human rights, mental healthcare, funding in education and health, and the loss of housing and welfare rights.It most certainly caught the attention of weekend shoppers who seemed confused as to whether or not it was a real funeral until they read the messages.At the Guildhall an excerpt from the film I Daniel Blake was played. It is from the funeral scene where his friend Katie reads the eulogy, including the speech Daniel had intended to read at an appeal for his jobseeker’s allowance.The speech describes his feelings about how the welfare system failed him by treating him like a dog instead of a man proud to have paid his dues to society.AAC member, Kat Healy, took to the steps of the Guildhall first to thank those who turned out for the march. In the spirit of the original civil rights march people were taking a stand against injustice, she said.People Before Profit Councillor, Shaun Harkin, also reflected on the march in  which “changed history here in the North of Ireland”. He said the numbers turning out to protest at present don’t accurately represent the depth of “anger” in the local community which is “growing and growing”.Cllr Harkin added that it is important to put pressure on “leaders” to address the devastation felt by local communities.‘Direct Action’googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAnother AAC member from Strabane, Michael Mclaughlin, told the crowd that he has been fighting against welfare reform for the best part of a decade.“The system is broken,” he said, and is part of an “ideological attack” on the working class. He referred to a research paper published by a university in Sheffield which studied the impact of welfare reform in the UK.A table included in that report which took in all  local authorities in the UK at the time, shows that people living in Derry and Strabane will be impacted the most with working age adults anticipated to be £ worse off per annum. Blackpool sits at the top of the table, Derry is second, Strabane third and Belfast is fourth.Mr McLaughlin said people can point the finger at Stormont but also need to look “closer to home”. It is time to “inject radicalism into activism”, he said, by getting working class people out on the streets and occupying offices were these cuts are being implemented.“We need to organise a direct action campaign against neo-liberalism, against austerity and expose and call out the parties that have let everybody down.”Member of the Irish Travelling Community, Martin McDonagh, said he was proud to be taking action and made clear that his community has felt the impact of cuts more than most.Becca Bor of Alliance for Choice slammed the two-child policy and benefit cap which she said have “massively increased” child poverty. Although primarily campaigning for free safe legal and local abortion in Ireland, the group has also fought “tooth and nail” against welfare reform, she said.She added that families are having to “scrape” money together essentials and said there is a need to fight so that women and families “have what they need”.The final speaker on the day, Goretti Horgan, of Derry Trades Union Council said large families have been impacted most by benefit caps and self-employed workers such as taxi drivers.She urged people to join a trade union, saying weekends off, holiday pay and sick pay wouldn’t exist without trade unions. “Don’t believe the hype when the Tories say they’re bringing in a living wage, read the small print, they’re saying it will happen in five years by which time normal wage increases will have brought it to that level,” she concluded."},{"url":null,"title":"foyleside student night set biggest best yet","story":" Magician Joel Mawhinney who will be performing mindblowing tricks to students on Foylesides Student NightThere will also be music from Q Radio, giveaways from Red Bull and VIP passes provided by Derry’s top student bars on the night to get students ready for some post-shopping drinks.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTo keep the students refreshed throughout their shopping spree there will be popcorn, slush drinks, a pick ‘n’ mix cart and doughnut walls – there really is something for everyone!Fergal Rafferty, Centre Manager of Foyleside, said: “For this year’s student night, we wanted to introduce entertaining and collaborative activities to get the students excited and encouraged to make great memories with their new peers – as well as grab a few bargains!

The musket and a creative writing workshop as part of the course inspired Greer to write a poem included in the booklet.Course co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said it was a pleasure to coordinate it, explaining that the  participants came from erse backgrounds.ldquoI was fascinated to see how their learning developed over the course, Shirley said. Many discoveries were made and insights gained into the period but, more importantly, into our attitudes and opinions about this part of the past.ldquoBy choosing the title lsquoour shared historyrsquo for the booklet, the participants demonstrated a key part of the learning, showing how intertwined our past is. I was pleased to see friendships developing during the course and a sense of achievement in the creation of the booklet.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey mdash who opened the conference mdashpraised the impact the PEACE IV project has had on the community.He said that exploring the legacy of the rebellion and the development of the United Irishmen provided participants with an insight into the heritage of their areas and into the very important topic of challenging preconceptions about history, in particular, the areas of shared and contested history.Cllr Casey said the event also provided participants with a chance to work together ldquoacross the community to discover their own stories and those of neighbouring and dferent communities.Further projects on Crime and Punishment in County Down and lsquoPreserving or Plundering rsquo: Museum Collecting from Hans Sloane to Modern Museumsrsquo will take place next year.

He felt that the delay had caused great inconvenience to a great number of people, who were expected to be moved.CROSSGAR mdash For the third successive year Crossgar soprano Rosemary McKibben has won a major inidual award at the Waterford International Festival of Light Opera.Following her lsquoBest Female Singerrsquo award in , Rosemany retained the Frank Ryan Cup for the lsquoBest Irish Singerrsquo which she won last year.The Belfast Operatic Companyrsquos lsquoMikadorsquo, in which she appeared, took third place at the st anniversary festival.Rosemary also figured prominently in the quartet which was awarded the Wallace Memorial Trophy for the lsquobest concerted itemrsquo and the company lted two other major awards to make its trip to Waterford well worthwhile.Rosemaryrsquos next major engagement is in the demanding role of Donna Elviva in Mozartrsquos Don Giovanni which is to be presented by the Studio Opera Group in Belfast later this month. This opera will also be presented in Down High School, Downpatrick.DUNDRUM mdash Local councillor Mr Jarlath Carey is to meet local planners soon in an attempt to save a major housing project in Dundrum.Mr Carey will be accompanied by Newcastle councillor Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghue, and Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamon OrsquoNeill, who all condemned a refusal by planners this week to allow the project to go ahead.The project is to develop a -acre site to provide about  new private homes and it has been turned down because it is too big.The planners say the proposed development would be out of scale and character with the existing village and would be prominent in the villagersquos landscape.The have also said the site is outside the area considered suitable for future development in Dundrum.A planning spokesman told local councillors at a meeting on Monday that the bulk of new development of this type should be directed at district towns such as Downpatrick rather that to smaller towns like Dundrum.Mr Carey called on councillors to support a plea to planners to reconsider their decision and said he didnrsquot support the philosophy that larger development projects should go to larger towns.TANNAGHMORE mdash A landmark in the Tannaghmore district for the past century was thoughtlessly destroyed this week mdash not by vandals but by DoE workmen.The landmark took the form of a holly tree, which was shaped like an igloo, and had a seat cut inside it, but it was destroyed when workmen carried out hedge trimming operations in the area.The tree, referred to as the lsquoCourting Treersquo or lsquoCourting Denrsquo by generations, had been maintained for many years by Eddie Kelly. He took pride and delight in looking after the tree, and trimmed it three years a year.A feature in the countryside in the Tannaghmore Road area, the tree was once a rendezvous for the couples of yesteryear. The tradition was thatyou were first at the den, you were set for the night!Many couples fromthe nearly Castlenavan, Seaforde, Loughinisland and Drumaness areas visited the tree regularly, particularly around the turn of the century and after.Now, however, the tree is ruined. The hedge-trimming saw the tree almost dissected and what remains could never be trained back to its former self.This ended the lsquoCourting Treersquosrsquo legend and thatrsquos why residents on the Tannaghmore Road are angry mdash that canrsquot understand how the workmen allowed such destruction to take place.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Police in Ballynahinch are anxious to trace a lsquobogus doctorrsquo who entered the home of an elderly man at Magherahamlet and stole pound.The lsquodoctorrsquo, about  years old, average height, and slim build, was wearing a long, dark coloured coat when he broke into the house on Saturday afternoon.

2019 Spa.jpg","title":"Spa resident’s delight after ‘nightmare’ over sewer issue resolved  ","story":"A CRUCIAL meeting has taken place to establish the scale of work required at a private housing development at the Spa to bring sewers, a sewage pumping station, roads and footpaths up to standard.Residents who live at the Carnglave Manor development say they have had to experience ldquonightmare conditions for the past six years and are pleased that the Department of Infrastructure is to formally adopt the estate, which will mean it will be responsible for its upkeep.In December , Stuart Boyd and his young family moved into the estate but what followed was years of ongoing drainage issues due to a fault with a pumping station, with the problem exacerbated by the fact part of the  year-old development had not been adopted by the relevant departmental bodies.Mr Boyd mdash whose family home sits in the middle of the development mdash is the first to be affected by ongoing technical issues with the water pump that regulates drainage, with Carnglave Manor also affected by flooding problems due to heavy rainfall which results in drains overflowing and sandbags being used to stop water reaching residentsrsquo homes.The frustrated resident revealed that within weeks of moving into the new family home, issues started to arise, with the first problem starting in the en-suite shower where water was not fully draining away after the shower had been turned off. Mr Boyd said he checked for blockages but discovered none.The en-suite toilet started to experience problems by not fully draining after flushing, with water rising to the top of the rim. Then a second toilet became affected with the same issue and could not be used.Mr Boyd contacted NI Water and was informed that the problem could not be investigated fully due to the fact that part of the development had not been adopted and that the issue was ldquohistorical.However, emergency action was taken for the problem to be resolved temporarily and the drains were cleared.A matter of weeks later, the same issue happened again and Mr Boyd made contact with the developer who informed him of a ldquoquick fix to resolve the problem.ldquoI was told by the developer that to sort the problem was to restart the sewage station pump by pressing buttons on an electrical , he said.ldquoThis worked fine over the years but became tedious as I had to do it so often. When my we was heavily pregnant with our third child two years ago the problem happened again, but the switch I normally pressed failed to work.Mr Boyd said repairs were then carried out and steps seemed to be taking place to adopt the street in Carnglave Manor. He was also concerned that despite being told a formal adoption would take place, nothing happened.The resident contacted Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis to investigate the issue and is delighted that things are now moving in the right direction as a result of him putting pressure on the relevant departments.Cllr Lewis described the adoption of Carnglave Manor as ldquoan immediate necessity for the progression of completion and resident safety and that the issue had been allowed to go on for too long. He said a process had begun to access so-called bond monies to carry out the necessary repairs.Cllr Lewis added: ldquoThere are a number of issues with the equipment which remain unresolved and NI Water and roads officials have been working in collaboration toward ensuring that bond monies paid by the contractor are utilised to ensure that necessary repairs are carried out which would bring the pumping station up to spec for adoption.The councillor said he was ldquohorried to discover Mr Boyd had been educated on the operation of the pumping equipment to ensure proper drainage which sometimes involved him walking down the street in the middle of the night to reset the electronic pump.ldquoI am also advised that residents have in previous years unblocked drains and battled flood waters they have been living in absolute horror. The purchase of a family home should be joyous, exciting and fulfilling. Instead, residents have had to endure misery, worry, stress strain and hassle.Cllr Lewis confirmed that due to frequent periods of heavy flooding in the development he has contacted Rivers Agency requesting flood maps to assessthe area is prone to or at risk of flooding and has asked Land and Property Services to explore the possibility of a rates rebate for Carnglave Manor residents.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure said she aware of the situation at Carnglave Manor and, as the developer had failed to complete the site to the appropriate standard, had initiated enforcement action.ldquoThis is with a view to carrying out the necessary works to bring the sewers, sewerage pumping station and roads footways up to adoption standard, she explained.The spokeswoman added: ldquoThe Department is meeting with Northern Ireland Water this week to fully establish the extent of defects in the sewers and sewerage pumping station.

After each appearance in front of their juvenile worships the offending drivers then watch graphic road safety videos featuring more children, with the goal to change driver behaviour.Those behind the scheme say itrsquos a simple but effective idea where PSNI road safety officers will liaise with particular schools about running kidsrsquo courts or teachers as part of road safety classes.When the go-ahead for the scheme is given, police turn up outside schools on the given morning and anyone they detect ndash as long as they are not travelling inordinately fast mdash will have the option there and then of appearing in front of the children, or taking the fine and penalty points.The PSNI is supporting the new initiative, which has proved successful in other areas, with officers hoping that meeting children face-to-face will change driversrsquo behaviour.The districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnershipis driving the change for an increased focus on road safety across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area with the emphasis on reducing speed to make the areas safer for drivers and pedestrians.And the organisation is fully behind the kidsrsquo court scheme which provides children with an opportunity to talk directly to drivers and send a very clear message about road safety.In addition to the kidsrsquo courts, other measures the PCSP wants to provide include a general road safety awareness campaign across the district, distribution of school safety signs and the installation of speed indicator devices.Local politicians describe the kidsrsquo court initiative as ldquoproactive and say that it will highlight to drivers the vulnerability of children aged between three and  who attend primary schools across the district.They say children will effectively be educating drivers who have exceeded the speed limit outside their respective schools to the potential of what could have happened. Politicians say the scheme is not trying to catch people out, but make the roads safer for everyone.Local councillors Oonagh Hanlon and Willie Clarke have welcomed the new initiative and hope people across the district will be more road safety aware. They believe that working with young people is a very effective way to deliver the road safety message.In addition, they also believe thatthe kidsrsquo court is successful in changing the mindset of even a few drivers it will help make busy roads outside primary schools much safer.Cllr Hanlon said she has been contacted by many primary schools in rural areas, requesting assistance with road safety around their respective locations.She said that with large volumes of children being ped off and picked up within short timeframes, the school run can become a ldquodangerous experience for young pupils in particular.Cllr Hanlon continued: ldquoSchool safety signs will be a visual reminder for drivers to exercise extra caution. Motorists caught speeding outside a primary school will be given the option of avoiding a fine by attending a special lsquokidsrsquo courtsrsquo where the judges are children.ldquoIn front of a  of young pupils, drivers will have to explain why they have broken the speed limit and itrsquos hoped that face-to-face interaction will change driversrsquo behaviour.She added: ldquoThis concept not only empowers our young people but also challenges motorists from a childrsquos perspective on why they would break rules which endanger their safety.Cllr Clarke said road safety was an issue he had campaigned on tirelessly over the years and particularly welcomed the introduction of speed indicator devices across the district.He added: ldquoThis has proved every successful in other areas in reducing speed and increasing safety on our roads..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/10502074.jpg","title":"bandstand baby witch","story":"Who are the members of your band and what instrument do they play How would you describe your sound What local gigs do you have coming up What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences What inspires your songwriting What is your dream gig What is the best thing about performing Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She gets a bit heavier when she’s wet.“There’s the big MUFC crest on her that puts on another few pounds and then the logos and the writing adds some more.”Keith Norris and Martin Faceman Cleary in Keith created the banner along with fellow Northern Ireland man Martin ‘Faceman’ Cleary, two friends of dferent religions.

After he died I never went to a Manchester United game for a few years. I couldn’t face going over without him.“The last time I actually spoke to him was from Santiago Bernabeu stadium in Madrid.“Faceman was a legend. Everyone liked him. He got on well with the fans, the players past and present. He was so friendly and down the middle.“I was talked into going back and bringing Big Lily in his memory.“All endeavours are dedicated to his memory.”The flag has many famous friends – from footballers including Gary Neville, Raul Gonzalez and Cristiano Ronaldo – to dignitaries such as Dieter Reiter, Lord Mayor of Munich, Mark Magowan, President of Western Australia and former Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, all of whom contribute to an upcoming film about Big Lily.Speaking at Hotel Football at Malta Supporters Club Keith said: “Supporters from across the world love Big Lily for the passion she evokes and what she represents. “Manchester United’s -year-old Malta Supporters Club invited Big Lily to lead their anniversary celebrations in June and the club was first recipient of a ‘Wee Lily’ commemorative flag.“Big Lily was one of the main guests at the anniversary dinner along with Gary Neville, Nicky Butt, Wilf McGuinness and his son Paul. It was awesome.”Perth Manchester United Supporters Club – who in July hosted Manchester United’s pre season tour – had Big Lily lead a fans’ parade to the Optus Stadium.The club was also presented with a tribute flag with the words ‘Pride of Down Under’ emblazoned on it. Most recently Houston Reds – a Manchester United fans group in Texas – held ain which a Wee Lily flag donated by Keith and personally signed by Eric Cantona raised , dollars for the Snowdrop Foundation in aid of paediatric Children’s Cancer Charity in Houston.Keith, who attended his first Manchester United game in , said: “Because of the flag we’ve got to know a lot of Manchester United fans. “How I know it’s struck a chord is it’s been invited to all sorts of occasions. It was invited to a cremation in January.”The flag now features in the peace section of Belfast’s International Wall Mural where it will be viewed by many of the city’s . million annual visitors.The flags on the mural are from the dferent countries that the Big Lily flag has visited - Catalonia, Japan, Australia, America, Italy, Germany, Poland, Russia, Brazil, Spain.The mural will be part of an ongoing year-long documentary about the influence Big Lily has around the world.Keith said: “We have filmed amazing characters and events which portray the global passion for Manchester United in a unique manner. “This mural will be an integral part of the film and Big Lily’s journey. Further filming is scheduled for USA and Scandinavia. “We are seeking to attach influential movers and shakers in the film industry including global broadcaster and distribution partners”.“We started filming in Munich last year at the memorial service. Last year was the first year we took the flag.“Ronaldo is going to be in the film too as is Raul and Hierro.”Of the peace wall mural and documentary he said: “Big Lily represents Manchester United Supporters, irrespective of creed, colour or ethnic background. “Faceman would have been so proud, as I am, of this amazing tribute to Big Lily and the fact that we, in some small way, contributed to meaningful friendship across the ide in Northern Ireland and across the world. “To think of United’s Big Lily on a wall dedicated to peace and a tourist attraction is truly amazing. “The documentary will tell the story of Big Lily’s origins and many global footballing friendships through a shared love of everything Manchester United.”He said: “The flag is representative of the friendship between Martin and I. There’s a plethora of people involved who think the same way as we do. It’s not just hands across the ide, it’s hand across the sea.

Eight Manchester United ‘Busby Babes’ were among the fatalities.Real Madrid played five friendly games from  to  and the funds went to United to support the club after Munich.There are now a series of smaller tribute flags dedicated to Manchester United legends including George Best, Harry Gregg and Eric Cantona.Clubs who have an association with Manchester United have also been presented with ‘Wee Lily’ flags.They include Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Kyoto Sanga.Smaller versions of Big Lily have also been made for club stalwarts such as Jimmy Murphy, who carried the flag for Manchester United after the Munich air crash. There is also a tribute flag to the Busby Babes, which leads a procession each February at the site of the  crash in Trudering Riem, Munich.Keith, pictured above with Cristiano Ronaldo, said: “We now have  smaller flags all dedicated to our heroes. For example Harry Gregg, Gary Neville, Lou Macari, Sammy McIlroy.“I’m enjoying meeting so many people to present the flags. “Harry Gregg has been described a reluctant hero. He’s now a very good friend.“It’s moving when you see people like Harry Gregg getting emotional because we’ve made a flag with his name on it saying ‘Legend’.“We were at Liam Whelan’s grave in Dublin. His brother and sister took my hand and thanked me for keeping the memory of their brother alive.“It’s so deep, there’s so many layers to it. It’s those things that spur you on.”Christopher McCollumn was never more happy than when he was in Manchester watching his beloved Red Devils.The Bangor teen who became friends with many of the club’s players including David Beckham and Roy Keane died at the age of  from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.On the th anniversary of his death last month Keith Norris visited Christopher’s mum and dad Geraldine and Gerry to present them with one of the ‘Wee Lily’ flags to honour their son’s memory.Gerry said: “Christopher loved seeing Big Lily at the matches and looking out for it on TV.”“When I met Keith at unveiling of George Best statueI told him Christopher’s story and he asked could he feature it in the documentary that was being made.“When he came to our house to film he presented us with a Wee Lily flag and a letter from Ole Gunnar Solksjaer.”Christopher’s dad said: “His whole le was United. He wasn’t diagnosed until he was five but you could see he had problems. By age eight he was in a wheelchair. Even though he had this passion for football he never played. He was quite lucky because he started supporting United in the nineties whenever they were winning everything.”The first United player Christopher met was Lee Sharpe at ain the Europa Hotel and he fixed it for Christopher to come to a game at Old Trafford and meet the rest of the team at the club’s training ground. Further trips to meet the players were facilitated by coach Jimmy Curran.Such was Christopher’s relationship with the players that when he needed help to get a new wheelchair the family got a £, cheque from Gary Neville and Roy Keane.Gerry said: “Christopher said to me many times that he thought the players were his friends. So many of them knew him by name and made time to come and speak to him.“We always knew he had a le limiting disability though when he diedit did come out of the blue.“After Christopher died we were at a retirementfor Jimmy . Roy Keane came over and asked how we were coping with Christopher’s loss. There’s people in your street don’t say that to you. He’s somebody who Christopher admired for his determination.“He met David Beckham four times. On one of the occasions he was outside a hotel, he saw Christopher and came over. He didn’t have to come over. He remembered his name and asked him how he was. That was a very special moment for somebody at  or  years of age.”Busby Babes Wee Lily in MunichBig Lily and Wee Lily flagsGary Neville with Big Lily in WhiteheadKeith Norris with Cristiano RonaldoDavid Beckham with Christopher McCollumtry catch  TrendingIts official -

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath.

Any proposals would be subject to full consultation, meaning all interested parties would have an opportunity to share their views before any decision is made.ldquoShould proposals progress, they would also be subject to separate planning consultation.ldquoThis would include consideration of highways and traffic concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Armagh crossroads, plagued with a high level of accidents, is to get a reduced speed limit after intense lobbying by residents.Local MLA William Irwin has been at the forefront of the campaign to have traffic calming at Ardress crossroads.The DUP MLA welcomed additional signage and awareness works at the notorious junction.Crash after crash has beenhighlighted by the MLA and he has echoed the warnings by local residents that ‘sooner or later someone will get killed’.Mr Irwin has been consistently lobbying for improvements and he welcomed what he called a “very focused lobby” from residents in the vicinity in assisting in relaying real concerns over safety at the crossroads.Mr Irwin said: “These additional works including the implementation of a mph speed limit and extra signage and road markings is very welcomed and I thank Transport NI for their continued efforts in this regard.”He continued: “There has been a high level of collisions at this location and I know that residents and road users generally have been really concerned that sooner or later a fatality will occur. “A number of improvements have been made in recent times however, worryingly, accidents still occur at an alarming rate. “Residents have been very proactive in their lobby and I have joined fully with them in continuing my lobby for improvements. “This is seeing results which is pleasing to see from a safety point of view,” said the DUP MLA.Mr Irwin said:“Additional signs have been erected including a speed limit and there are more warning markings etc to be added to all approaches to the crossroads.“And I am hopeful that this will help in alerting drivers to the fact that they must stop at the junction and wait until the route is clear. “I will continue with the residents to monitor this issue and continue to raise their concerns going forward.” PSNI probe ‘serious’ assaults which left victims hospitalisedThieves ransack woman’ home while she was out on volunteer community work

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get.

The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.

Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election.
