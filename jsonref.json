The BBC put Evans onto the Radio 2 breakfast show eight years agoIt is also a huge disappointment to the audience when someone leaves a role they do brilliantly well. Evans is one of the all-time greats of radio presentation, and still firing on all cylinders. His worth seems more apparent than ever in the times we\u0027re living through. While the news programmes chunter on about the ups and downs of Westminster politics or the latest warnings from Brussels about Brexit, and the world seems gloomier by the day, Evans\u0027s show is sunny and high-spirited.Some may still resist his charms, but for an overwhelming majority he has created a morning family — reinforced by the way he involves his own children as a modern, slightly imperfect dad.This week, once again, his nine-year-old son Noah has been asking some of the questions and assisting with corny jokes that show every sign of having been supplied by his father. But on these airwaves there are no domestic rows and the energy level is always fizzing.          Chris Evans and his wife, Natasha, leave Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey with their newborn twins, and Eli, six, and Noah, nineThis is no mean achievement for someone starting at 6.30am for a three-hour show, five days a week and Evans attracts an audience of all ages.The students I talk to as Master of Selwyn College, Cambridge, will mention Evans\u0027 name much more frequently than those of the news agenda-setters on Radio 4 or whoever is currently doing the Radio 1 breakfast show.The sobbing you hear is therefore not just from listeners but from BBC bosses who are losing one of their main assets to a direct rival.The Evans ratings have had a slight wobble recently and dipped below 9 million a week, but they still beat all other radio programmes and are two million ahead of Radio 4\u0027s flagship Today. They also dwarf almost all television audiences in this multi-channel world.This success shouldn\u0027t obscure the gamble that the BBC took in putting Evans onto the Radio 2 breakfast show eight years ago.He was taking over from the ultimate broadcasting icon, Sir Terry Wogan and there was the starkest of contrasts between a laid-back wordsmith Irishman and a hyperactive and sometimes rebellious DJ who had made his reputation in shows for young people.The shift was from Wogan\u0027s one-to-one conversational style into Evans\u0027 morning \u0027zoo\u0027 with seemingly a cast of thousands but what they both had was a warmth and an invitation to be part of their club, and that has retained the loyalty of listeners.I had some experience of the Evans\u0027 style when he was part of the line-up for the London 2012 Olympics, which I was running for the BBC.We wanted to build up excitement for the Games across all the BBC\u0027s services, and Evans did that in spades on Radio 2. His show was relocated to the Olympic Park, and I went along for the duty \u0027BBC suit\u0027 interview on the morning of the opening ceremony.I\u0027m taking a guess that there were a few million other people he\u0027d rather have been talking to, but he was glowing in his welcome without being sycophantic and impishly intelligent in his questioning. It was one of those rare occasions when a boss could be part of a feelgood experience.Like Wogan, he makes you feel part of his clubBut the flip side of the Evans Olympic experience happened later in the Games. BBC management had taken a tough line in resisting a bombardment of suggestions from Downing Street that the then prime minister David Cameron would be the perfect guest for our Olympic programming.There must have been something about the record audiences on TV and radio, and the national exuberance, that the Conservatives wanted to convert into political advantage – and we were determined to keep this kind of politics away from the sport.We bopped on the head every offer from No. 10, and we sternly told producers that interview bids for the PM were not allowed.    Evans is seen out and about this week in London. His audience figures dwarf almost all television audiences in this multi-channel world, ex-BBC bigwig Roger Mosey saysIt therefore came as something of a surprise to wake up in my BBC-rented flat in Hackney one morning during the Games to hear David Cameron chirping away happily on the Chris Evans show — and not from Downing Street but from the Olympic Park, where he had been respectfully let in by our security team.There were some perfectly fair questions from his host, but Cameron was living Downing Street\u0027s dream: linking himself with the success of the Games on the nation\u0027s most popular radio show.A good old-fashioned internal BBC row then took place.From Prince Harry to pop queens, he has pulling powerOn our morning editorial conference call with the director-general, the Evans show was in the dock. Decrees of condemnation were issued instant inquests were launched. The circumstances were murky, but it seemed that this was largely Evans\u0027 own initiative.In normal circumstances, we would have been delighted that a presenter had the kind of contacts that could get the prime minister into a peak-time special appearance and, six years on, I would give Evans full credit for that if not for adherence to editorial policy.Evans\u0027 pulling power has continued with Prince Harry as a studio guest announcing the Invictus Games for wounded, injured or sick service personnel and veterans, or helping out with the travel news in contemporary royal fashion, alongside the daily interviews with the more routine kings and queens of pop.BBC bosses are accused of using Katya and Seann Walsh kiss...Convicted sex offender who told vigilantes it \u0027doesn\u0027t...Share this articleInsiders say that it is not always a bed of roses working on the Evans show.His rebelliousness was at its peak in his Radio 1 days when he had a falling out with his boss, whom he nicknamed on air as \u0027the fat controller\u0027.He is reported to have mellowed with age, but \u0027a rollercoaster\u0027 is one description of a typical working day when he moved to Radio 2.Evans drives himself hard and has a head full of creative ideas, and it can be a tough ask for the people charged with turning those into programme items.The bad times could be pretty bad, say some, though characteristically the rewards from Evans were high, too. A team Christmas dinner, at his expense, would shun all the BBC-favoured restaurants around Broadcasting House and be held at a luxurious Heston Blumenthal restaurant instead.Perhaps it\u0027s no surprise that many of Evans\u0027 team are moving with him to Virgin.Mind you, Evans can afford the largesse. His wealth is estimated in the Sunday Times Rich List at more than £50million, and at his peak he was earning more than £2.2m a year from the BBC.

Flores, for one, bottom-lined how he flipped on a kingpin this way: \u0027I was trying to set him up.\u0027Martinez, 52, was in court on December 10, testifying that, starting in 2000, he oversaw a Guzman scheme to transport cocaine all the way from Mexico to the New York City area by train using cooking oil tankers with secret compartments. He estimated he made as much as $20million from the cocaine train operation before he decided to quit because of \u0027too much pressure\u0027 from Guzman over losses from seizures.\u0027They wanted to kill me because I had lost the train route,\u0027 Martinez said. \u0027I just didn\u0027t want to keep going.\u0027While on the stand, Martinez - who made more money than he knew what to do with - said that he had used some of the cash to buy soccer teams in Mexico, earning him the nickname \u0027El Futbolista,\u0027 which means \u0027soccer player\u0027.           A courtroom drawing of Pedro Flores (right) testifying during Guzman\u0027s trial on December 18  Pedro Flores (left) and twin brother Margarito Flores, were known as \u0027the twins\u0027 in the Sinaloa cartel circle. Guzman sought them out for their expertise in distributing cocaine to urban centers in the U.S.     Jorge Milton Cifuentes Villa was among those testifying against former boss Guzman during his Brooklyn trial. Cifuentes is seen here in 2012 as he\u0027s deported from Venezuela to Columbia          Tirso Martinez Sanchez (on December 10) testified about running a cocaine train for GuzmanNotorious drug lord El Chapo is reduced to TEARS after...Actress Kate del Castillo sues the Mexican government for...Share this articleThe downside of all that drug train wealth, however, was a gambling habit that led him to lose a bundle betting on cock fights.Martinez also told the courtroom about  some of the occupational hazards of living life as an outlaw: He said one of his former bosses shot himself in the head in a drunken ploy to avoid arrest, while another died on the operating table during a plastic surgery procedure to alter his appearance - an outcome that didn\u0027t stop Martinez from getting his own face redone.Unlike Martinez, 55-year-old Cifuentes seemed to have had a slightly less flashy experience while working for Guzman. During his testimony December 13, Cifuentes outlined extreme family dysfunction, describing how his father drafted him at just four years old to help move illegal cigarettes and booze through the port in Medellin, Colombia.Cifuentes testified that many of his eight siblings were in the drug trade and that they had \u0027conflicts like any other family.\u0027 He admitted on cross-examination that his brother had ordered the killing of his nephew, but he explained it was because the nephew wanted to kidnap his own grandmother.Cifuentes eventually began shipping Colombian cocaine to the Sinaloa cartel using airplanes made of carbon to deflect radar detection. He described meeting Guzman at his ranch in 2003 where there was a celebration for the second anniversary of the the drug lord\u0027s escape from prison.Getting there wasn\u0027t easy: A small plane took him to a landing strip that was so short and sharply inclined that he started praying and telling himself that if he survived he would buy Guzman a helicopter so he \u0027would fly in a more civilized way.\u0027          Guzman (in 2016) faces life behind bars if convicted of operating a continuing criminal enterprise, murder conspiracy, and other charges          Guzman (in January 2017) as he\u0027s extradited from Mexico to the US to face charges in New YorkAt another meeting in 2009, Cifuentes said he shared a joint with Guzman, who asked how strong it was before he took a smoke. He wasn\u0027t impressed. \u0027This does nothing to me,\u0027 he said. Also testifying against Guzman recently was Pedro Flores. He and his twin brother, Margarito Flores, were known simply as \u0027the twins\u0027 in Sinaloa cartel circle - identical twin brothers from the streets of Chicago who became so good at distributing cocaine to urban centers in the U.S. that Guzman sought them out.Pedro took the witness stand December 18 to testify about their wildly lucrative business partnership with Guzman, still exhibiting a sense of awe about the defendant not shown by more-hardened cooperators. While others simply referred to Guzman as Chapo, Spanish for \u0027shorty,\u0027 Pedro kept calling him \u0027The Man.\u0027Pedro, 37, described how, after becoming a fugitive in Mexico, he and his brother continued running their U.S. network with enough success that he was summoned to a meeting with Guzman in mountains in Sinaloa. He and Guzman\u0027s cohorts were driving up a road to the compound when he was startled to see a naked man, apparently being tortured.\u0027He was tied to a tree with a chain,\u0027 Perdo said, adding that he never learned what happened to him.In another odd twist, he recounted discussing concerns about the \u0027cover loads\u0027 used to disguise drug shipments stashed in trucks - in this instance, 150 live sheep he had to pay $10,000 to put out to pasture.The stresses of the job and the dangers of a bloody civil war within the cartel convinced Pedro to commit mutiny by contacting U.S narcotics agents. He agreed to record telephone calls, played for the jury, in which an unsuspecting Guzman could be heard calling him his \u0027amigo.\u0027By associating with Guzman, Pedro said, \u0027I couldn\u0027t promise my family a tomorrow, you know?\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Corbyn criticised saying ahead Brexit PM","story":"    JK Rowling struck out at Jeremy Corbyn in a biblical-style series of tweetsJK Rowling struck out at Jeremy Corbyn in a biblical-style series of tweets after the Labour leader said he would pursue Brexit if his party won a snap election.  Remain supporters heaped criticism on Mr Corbyn after he said he would recommend his party \u0027go back and renegotiate\u0027 a Brexit deal in time for Britain to leave the EU.Speaking to the Guardian, the Leader of the Opposition failed to  commit his party to backing Remain if a second referendum was called - and hit out at EU laws on state aid which he said blocked investment.But his remarks were attacked by the Harry Potter author in a 16-part Twitter thread she titled \u0027The Visitation of The Corbynites\u0027.After criticising \u0027Saint Jeremy\u0027 in her opening tweets, Ms Rowling continued: \u0027And she did answer, How shall the poor fare under Brexit, which thy Saint hath always in his secret heart desired, yet he hath not admitted what was in his heart, lest fewer attend his next Sermon on the Glastonbury B Stage. \u0027And they did answer, Saint Jeremy will achieve a miracle, and he shall bring forth a Jobs First Brexit and all the land shall rejoice.

Timetables are placed in guests\u0027 rooms, for instance, to ensure no one is late for drinks and meals. And if you are a Los Angeles native still learning to navigate The Firm\u0027s infinitely complex social mores, it is more daunting still.          The main house of the Sandringham Estate (pictured) is small by Royal standards, with accommodation described as \u0027cramped\u0027Having her sister-in-law close at hand would help. But then few doubt that a froideur between the two duchesses does exist, even if it has sometimes been overplayed. Sources say Meghan and Kate are \u0027very different people\u0027 and simply \u0027don\u0027t get on\u0027. It also emerged that Kate was left \u0027in tears\u0027 after a fitting for Princess Charlotte\u0027s bridesmaid\u0027s dress before Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding in May.One Royal insider gives a prosaic explanation for the Sussexes\u0027 seasonal sleeping arrangements. Last Christmas it was felt that allowing Harry and Meghan, then unmarried, to spend the night at the main house would be inappropriate. Inviting Meghan to share in the festivities in the first place had been a break with convention – there was no need to shatter protocol completely. Anmer Hall offered the perfect solution.But their marriage changed everything. It would now be unusual, said the source, for the couple not to stay with the Queen.Even so, it is a decision that will inevitably stoke further speculation. Certainly it is unlikely to halt the drip, drip of \u0027War of the Waleses\u0027 stories.How Meghan, naturally forthright, must be struggling to hold her tongue.          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex stayed with the Cambridges at the nearby Anmer Hall (pictured) last ChristmasIt was reported last week that she put paid to her husband\u0027s plans to join the traditional Boxing Day pheasant shoot at Sandringham, just as she did last year, because of her opposition to bloodsports.Insiders now say this claim, which adds another layer to the notion of Meghan as dictatorial – \u0027What Meghan wants, Meghan gets,\u0027 as Harry is said to have put it – is wrong.Harry did indeed miss last year\u0027s shoot, but only because he had to drive to London for a meeting the following day. And this year nothing has yet been decided, according to a Palace source.True, the Duchess is an ardent animal lover but she is understood to be relaxed about Harry\u0027s hobby. So much so that on several occasions this year she has accompanied her husband on shoots, even though she has not actively participated herself. The most recent was earlier this month at a friend\u0027s Wiltshire estate.A source said shooting is \u0027ingrained in Harry\u0027s nature\u0027, adding that \u0027Meghan would never try to change that about him\u0027.The only public window into the Royal Family\u0027s Christmas will be the 11am annual outing to St Mary Magdalene Church on the big day itself. After last year\u0027s service, Meghan clung to Harry\u0027s arm, walking among the crowds alongside William and Kate, cementing her place in the so-called \u0027Fab Four\u0027.          One Royal insider said it was felt last year that allowing Harry and Meghan, then unmarried, to spend the night at the main house would be inappropriateThe message from senior courtiers is to expect the same united front this year, not to mention some carefully chosen outfits. With every scrap of body language likely to be scrutinised, neither duchess is likely to betray any hint of friction.Meghan is an actress after all, and the Duchess of Cambridge is also a seasoned performer who rarely puts a foot wrong.\u0027It will all be friendly – there is no way that you are going to be unfriendly to someone on Christmas Day,\u0027 said an insider. \u0027Especially when Meghan looks like she is about to have a baby at any minute. All will be smiles.\u0027There was one small hitch outside the church last year. Meghan\u0027s curtsy to the Queen ended up being more of a wobbly bob. In comparison, Kate\u0027s was executed perfectly. It is impossible to imagine that the Duchess of Sussex will make the same mistake this year.The regimented schedule begins on Christmas Eve when the Royal clan arrive at Sandringham in order of seniority, with Charles and Camilla the last to appear, mid-afternoon. This prevents the chaos of everyone pitching up at the same time and limits pressure on staff.Despite the scale of the event, the Queen is keen that as many staff as possible enjoy Christmas with their own families, and has a scaled-down retinue.          But Harry and Meghan\u0027s move to Sandringham could be interpreted as a snub amid rumours of tension between the two couplesOn arrival, the Royals are shown to their rooms. There are thought to be 29 bedrooms in the house, including some for staff.Each of the Queen\u0027s children have their own room. Her grandchildren are all treated equally. Those likely to have servants\u0027 rooms include the Queen\u0027s nephew, the Earl of Snowdon, his wife Serena and their children. His sister Lady Sarah Chatto, her husband Daniel and two children are also likely to be included.The family follow the German tradition of opening presents on Christmas Eve. Small jokey gifts are preferred. Harry was once given a \u0027grow-your-own girlfriend\u0027 kit from Kate, while he is said to have given his grandmother a shower cap.Princess Diana famously made a faux pas during her first Christmas by attempting to impress with cashmere sweaters.A source said: \u0027The Royal Family is very frugal when it comes to Christmas, it tends to be nothing lavish – that is taboo. With the children, it is slightly different – they will get the sort of presents most children expect.\u0027After briefly retiring to their rooms, the family reappear for a black-tie dinner. The Duke of Edinburgh, now 97, will spend some time at Wood Farm on the estate, a modest refuge of tranquillity that he has enjoyed for many years.He was seen nearby yesterday, driving himself around in a Land Rover. But tomorrow he will join the Queen in the main house.Across Christmas, numerous outfit changes are required, with the Duchess of York once complaining that she was obliged to change her clothes seven times in 24 hours.While this will probably not be a concern for fashion addict Meghan, she will have to adhere to the usual Royal dress code – particularly as a house guest of the Queen. The black nail polish she showcased at a recent awards ceremony would be considered attention-seeking.Next morning the Royals wake up to stockings by their beds filled with small gifts and fruit, before enjoying a full English breakfast served at around 8am. Getting ready for church is the next task. After the service, which Prince Philip is expected to attend this year, everyone returns to the main house for drinks before Christmas lunch.Despite the formality of the occasion, there is no seating plan and no starter.Guests are served turkey, which is carved by the head chef at the table, followed by Christmas pudding and a cheese course.There may be time for the family to wander around the grounds, but they are back by 3pm for the Queen\u0027s Christmas message. After a tea at 4pm, featuring Christmas cake, mince pies and a chocolate yule log, Meghan – who is luckily eating for two – will sit down to another meal at 8pm a buffet of cold meats, salads and potatoes.          After Christmas, the Cambridges are expected to take George, Charlotte and Louis to the Middleton home in Bucklebury, BerkshireThe family will always find time for parlour games, with charades a particular favourite.The rules continue until bedtime, with no one allowed to retire before Her Majesty, who has been known to stay up until midnight.A Royal insider said: \u0027Everybody is on parade when they go to Sandringham. This is not a family sitting around having a jolly time relaxing. They are all eyeing each other up and seeing who is up and who is down the pecking order. It\u0027s full of tension.\u0027Rather like Camilla, who is said to hate Sandringham, Harry and Meghan will be out of the door as fast as they possibly can.\u0027After Christmas, the Cambridges are expected to take George, Charlotte and Louis to the Middleton home in Bucklebury, Berkshire.The Sussexes, meanwhile, will probably head to their bolthole in the Cotswolds. It is likely that at some point they will see Doria, Meghan\u0027s mother, who last week was still in Los Angeles but is expected to be flying in to the UK at some point during the holiday.While Doria would have been made welcome at Sandringham she will not be attending the activities there.\u0027Meghan certainty wants her mother around at Christmas, particularly as her father is making such a nuisance of himself at the moment,\u0027 said the insider.\u0027Meghan is isolated, things aren\u0027t going as well as they should be – she needs her mum.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Lin Manuel Miranda missed chance perform Hamilton Beyonc Jay Z fever","story":"    The Hamilton genius shared his misfortune while discussing the musical\u0027s impact on the Graham Norton Show on Friday nightMiranda was mentioning how tough it was to do the eight-performances-a-week while also dealing with the growing popularity of the show. He added: \u0027My wife was like, Stay in bed!\u0027 But I was like, I can do it, I can do it!

Admiring colleagues called it the ‘bang! wallop!’ approach.His breakthrough came when the party captured Eastbourne from the Tories in October 1990, in the wake of the IRA killing of Ian Gow, Mrs Thatcher’s parliamentary private secretary.Ashdown polled as the most popular leader of a national party.When it was disclosed in 1992 that he had had a five-month affair with his former secretary, Patricia Howard, the ‘Paddy Pantsdown’ monicker led to a torrent of mocking headlines but, perversely, a further increase in his personal poll ratings.          Ashdown, right, pictured in Borneo, was also in the Special Boat Service His wife of 30 years, Jane, forgave him, however, and his constituency party rallied to his support.He went on to turn the party into a political force that could not be ignored during the late 1990s, at the same time as Tony Blair was performing similar feats with Labour.    The Sun dubbed him \u0027Paddy Pantsdown\u0027 after breaking news of the five-month affair he had with his secretary, although the former Commando changed his answer machine message as a result of the scandal to \u0027Hello, this is Paddy Ashdown. Please leave a message after the high moral tone\u0027          Yet, despite the affair, Ashdown\u0027s wife Jane, left, stood by her husband, right, who continued as Lib Dem leader until 1998And the two forces nearly combined: after Ashdown announced his decision to quit as party leader in 1999, boasting that he had brought it in the space of 12 years from near-extinction to a position in 1997 with 46 MPs in the House of Commons, it was revealed that he had been involved in secret ‘coalition’ talks with Blair before the 1997 General Election in which Labour secured a landslide victory.But Blair decided that Ashdown’s lack of experience in running a big department counted against him. His hopes for a big international post, such as leading Nato, were also scotched.Instead, he evolved into a grandee figurehead for the party, commanding a level of respect which his successors could never match.Born Jeremy John Durham Ashdown in Delhi in 1941 to an Irish family, he preferred the homespun Paddy, his schoolboy nickname.          Ashdown was a hugely-respected figure on the world stage despite never being a Government minister He was described as a swashbuckling, rangy and handsome figure, who became the youngest commander in the SBS after joining the Royal Marines in 1959. After learning Malay, he studied Chinese for two-and-a-half years before transferring to MI6 in Geneva. But he became restless in the ascetic Swiss city and decided to return to England to attempt to launch a political career from the dole queue.A former Labour supporter, he started to move to the Right, explaining: ‘I discovered that I had never really been a socialist’.In 1976 he won the Liberal Party candidacy for Yeovil – a seemingly impregnable Tory stronghold – and worked for years to take the constituency, failing in 1979, but claiming it in 1983.He and his young family had gone through a brutally tough period. He had to make ends meet with a series of short-term jobs including working for a sheepskin coat-makers, Westland Helicopters and as a youth worker for Dorset County Council. He was also unemployed for six-months.‘Nothing I have ever done was as hard as that,’ he said once. ‘It unmanned me.’He hated the Commons at first, and struggled in the chamber, so strove to fashion the energetic everyman image instead.His brash bravado – and insistence that Labour was doomed and the Liberal Democrats would replace them – carried him through his difficult early years as leader as he tried to reshape a party described at the time as ‘confused, demoralised, starved for money and in the grip of a bitter identity crisis’.          When he took over as leader of the Social and Liberal Democrats – the Lib Dems – in July 1988, the party was on the brink of extinction, languishing at five per cent in the polls, neck-and-neck with the Greens, and earning it the soubriquet of the ‘dead parrot’ party from Margaret ThatcherThe position he took after the Tiananmen Square massacre – that Hong Kong citizens should be allowed to come to Britain – made many Liberals feel the party had recovered its soul, while the first Gulf War gave him a chance to showcase his military experience as he set up his own ‘war cabinet’ and sped between TV and radio studios.He never lived down the ‘Pantsdown’ nickname and it was painful: particularly because he had used happy family snaps on his personal election material. In one interview he claimed that it had drawn him closer to his wife, saying: ‘Most people think I am a rampant carnivore, but there is an oddly feminine quality to my character.’          In 1988, Ashdown, pictured with his wife Jane, was elected leader of the newly created Social and Liberal Democratic Party which saw a merger between the SDP and the Liberals          In his final months, Ashdown had been co-ordinating talks between politicians about creating a new centrist party to oppose Brexit After resigning the leadership in 1999, he was elevated to the peerage as Lord Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon and spent much of the subsequent period concentrating on his interest in Bosnia. In March 2002, he testified as a witness for the prosecution at the trial of Slobodan Milosevic at the International Criminal Tribunal.After taking up the post of High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina in May 2002, he was sometimes described mockingly as ‘the Viceroy of Bosnia’ by critics because of his allegedly high-handed approach to the post. He left that job in May 2006.In 2007, it was reported that Gordon Brown, then the Labour Prime Minister, had offered Ashdown the job of Northern Ireland Secretary. However, Menzies Campbell, then leader of the Lib Dems, did not want members of his party to hold office in a Labour Government.          Ashdown, pictured here with John Major and Tony Blair survived the scandal over his affair with his secretary It was widely thought he would be offered a Cabinet post in the Conservative-Lib Dem Coalition Government formed in 2010 – but again he was to be disappointed.Ashdown spent his final months playing a key behind-the-scenes role in attempting to reshape the political landscape again by holding talks with anti-Corbyn Labour MPs about a new party.          As leader of the Liberal Democrats, he had hoped for a hung parliament, so his party could hold the balance of power and change the electoral system to proportional representation to further boost his party\u0027s prospectsHe also became reflective about the personal and political forces which formed him, including the tragedies of his younger brother Richard dying when he was just 11 months old in India, his brother Robert succumbing to leukaemia when he was 14 and a sister dying in a car crash.‘Losing three children was very hard on my parents, who turned to spiritualism for comfort. Those losses affected me too, of course. I have always felt great anxiety when any of the children or grandchildren have been ill,’ he said.He had met his wife when he was 20 and she was 21. In 2014, he described her as ‘the bedrock of my existence but admitted: ‘Sometimes she has said she could have done with fewer adventures during our marriage.’Asked whether he was a good father he said: ‘I made space for my children to have their own lives, but my political ambitions swallowed a lot of the time I could have spent being with them.‘Jane gets much more of the credit for bringing up two wonderful children. I adore being a grandfather’.          He finished his military service, pictured here with the Royal Marines standing on a Land Rover in Belfast. He served in Northern Ireland between 1970 and 1972 "},{"url":null,"title":"Councils order families not recycle wrapping paper Christmas cards","story":"    Thousands of tons of recyclable paper had to be dumped last year because people had mixed it with shiny wrapping, which is covered in plastic, and glitter-covered cardsBritain will throw away 40 square miles of wrapping paper this Christmas, enough to cover Manchester. Most councils ask householders to separate glitter and metallic foil paper from their recyclable paper, but people often get this wrong.Santas of all shapes and sizes march through Crimea as...It’s official!

Grim deeds we thought had been banished to the dark past                         If they have one type of autism, called pathological demand avoidance – traits seen in the awful case of Bethany, one of the first autistic teenagers I reported on, who was locked in seclusion and fed through a hatch – they may need coaxing rather than coercion. So when they have anxieties, it is hard to think of anything worse than confining them in chaotic places filled with troubled psychiatric patients and where staff often lack correct training.Then, when these people go to pieces, they lock them up in tiny cells and treat them like dangerous animals.Their families also suffer. Many disintegrate under the immense stress of seeing their beloved children suffer systemic abuse or forcibly sedated into zombies.There is a clear pattern. Parents seek help as children hit adolescence and become bigger. They trust experts who say it will just take a few weeks in an assessment and treatment unit. Then the teenagers and young adults are snared for years.

These are simply people with alternative needs, outlooks and perceptions who are being detained without dignity or justice.Men and women handle incarceration differently. Men can become more angry and aggressive. Women, often placed with patients who are self-harming or suffering eating disorders, start mimicking such behaviour to fit in. Such incarceration is like a spiral of cruelty.It locks innocent people in unsuitable places that intensify mental stresses, which then make it harder for them to win freedom.This is all bad enough. But it gets worse. For there is a whiff of corruption emerging from this system as rapacious private firms muscle in on the system, raking off vast profits while having the power to determine if people can escape their clutches.Multinationals, hedge funds and private equity groups are buying up psychiatric units holding these people and opening new centres – yet Ministers have repeatedly promised to empty them since the Winterbourne View abuse scandal in 2011. No wonder: they earn fees of up to £2,007 a day per patient while paying support staff scarcely more than minimum wage. So we have the sickening sight of the Priory Group owner giving £8.2 million to its sacked US boss while paying £8.50 an hour to carers.This money comes from the NHS, although it is often far cheaper, more effective and definitely more humane to provide proper community support. But this comes from cash-strapped councils, so many prefer to dump the problem on the NHS. Children’s mental health services are also badly underfunded, so some also shift problems by sectioning challenging teenagers. One such distressing case came to my attention last week when I discovered that a nine-year-old boy with autism was nearly sent to an adult secure unit recently. ‘Everyone was saying they could not cope,’ said Michael Richards, a senior social worker in Berkshire. ‘But the last resort should not have been a psychiatric hospital.’With the help of experts, tiny changes at home – such as fixing meal times and shifting the boy into his own bedroom – ensured that after three months his behaviour improved and medication stopped. ‘Small things can be very meaningful for an autistic person but there is systemic failure in many places,’ said Mr Richards.Yet, once again, for all the lofty talk of transforming care, politicians have kicked this into touch. Health Secretary Matt Hancock promised to act after reading my reports – then pathetically ordered another limited review that does not report finally until 2020.Meanwhile, MPs debated a bill last week regarding treatment of people who lack capacity to give consent that makes it easier to hold people for longer periods while doing little to stop conflicts of interest for private firms with power to deprive citizens of their liberty. There are many causes of this crisis, from incompetence and complacency through to a disturbing lack of compassion. But hidden away behind locked doors, barbarism is being inflicted on people with autism and learning disabilities.At this time of family celebration, remember these traumatised citizens and families ripped apart by the state under the guise of ‘care’. Then think of that famous saying that you measure a nation’s worth by how it treats its weakest members – and ask what this scandal tells us about 21st Century Britain?"},{"url":null,"title":"ANDREW GREEN Government caved pressure employers","story":"    Home Secretary Sajid Javid presented a new White Paper that sets out plans that will open up Britain for business while taking back much-needed control of our bordersTo be blunt, the Government has caved in to pressure from employers without regard for the interests of British workers, particularly those of our young people looking for decent careers.The fact of the matter is that migration to Britain from countries outside the EU now makes up three-quarters of the total – yet for several years now Ministers have done nothing useful to clamp down on the loopholes and abuses in the system and they show little sign of doing so in future.Those in power know very well that they are on thin ice. The sheer scale of immigration is a real and entirely legitimate concern to the public. The net annual figure peaked at a third of a million a couple of years ago. No wonder nearly two-thirds of the people of Great Britain think immigration has been too high over the past decade.They have good reason for alarm. Since 2001, immigration has been adding one million to our population every three years.They might not have the precise statistics to hand but ordinary members of the public are well aware that the roads and trains are getting ever more crowded.          Theresa May has been determined to face down the Treasury and others who say that immigration is an undiluted good for our economyMany are concerned about getting on to the housing ladder but they know that the demand arising from immigration is no help. Official housing projections show that if net migration to England were to continue at 210,000 a year, we would have to build about 90,000 homes a year – a new home every six minutes day and night.To be fair to Theresa May, she has been determined to face down the Treasury and others who say that immigration is an undiluted good for our economy and has attempted to stick to the Conservative manifesto pledge of reducing net migration to the tens of thousands. Yet she has not had the Cabinet support she deserves.Take Sajid Javid, the Home Secretary and the man in charge of border controls. He refused eight times on Radio 4’s Today programme to confirm the target – only to be publicly slapped down by the Prime Minister in Parliament that very day.Hoist by their own backstop: Ireland faces being hammered...NO cap on immigration after Brexit: EU workers will STILL be...Share this articleDoes he seriously intend to reduce immigration? Do his colleagues? On the face of it, the Government White Paper seems sensible enough. The major change it proposes is that EU citizens and those from outside the EU will be treated in the same way from January 2021 when the proposed transition period (from EU membership to full Brexit) comes to an end.The route for skilled workers will be widened and there will be a new ‘temporary’ route for low-skilled workers.But the detail of these arrangements tells a very different story.One problem is this: under huge pressure from industry, the Government has thrown open the doors to ‘skilled’ workers.           With the apparent support of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, there is now talk of a threshold of £21,000And the definition of ‘skilled’ has been reduced from degree to A-Level or its equivalent – a change that will open millions of jobs in the UK to people worldwide who are looking for a better life.It gets worse. The Government is proposing that there will no longer be any need for employers to advertise posts in the UK before rushing to recruit from overseas. In other words, anybody will be free to bring in a ‘skilled’ worker, provided that they claim they will pay them £30,000 a year or more.And even that limit is under intense pressure from industry, apparently with the support of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond. There is now talk of a threshold of £21,000, which is hardly a hurdle at all, especially as it is very easy to manipulate salaries by including housing allowances and other expenses. Most worrying of all, there will be no cap on numbers. The plans get no better when it comes to low-skilled migration. It is proposed that visas will be limited to 12 months, after which the holder is supposed to return home for a one-year ‘cooling off’ period.But how the Government expects to ensure that they leave on time is anyone’s guess. What we do know is that this is a blatant attempt to fiddle immigration statistics which have long been such an embarrassment to the Government.Here is how it will work. When foreign travellers arrive at a port or airport, a sample will be asked whether they intend to stay for a year or more. If they say yes they are included as international migrants. But these people will say no and will not be included in the migration statistics. Amazingly, this route will also be uncapped.What happens if they overstay? Nothing. The Government does not have the resources to locate them, let alone remove them.Their capacity to remove immigration offenders and former prisoners is only about 9,000 a year, so the result will be that they add to the population of illegal immigrants that former senior Home Office officials have already estimated at more than a million.None of this is about controlling immigration. It is quite the opposite – it is abdicating control.It is not as if our existing EU workforce is departing in droves. In the last available year, 74,000 more EU citizens arrived than left. This is down from the peak of 190,000 a couple of years ago – a fall that may be due to uncertainty about the future, a drop in the value of the pound or a mini-boom in Poland – but there is no reason to expect a sudden exodus.In any case, low-skilled and low-paid workers, while adding to total production, do not add to productivity per head, which is what really matters. Indeed, low-paid EU workers are subsidised by the Treasury with working-age benefits to the tune of £4.7 billion a year in 2015-16 – or nearly £13 million a day. This is serious money.Meanwhile, a pool of low-wage migrants discourages employers from investing in the productivity of the existing workforce. Is this why apprenticeship training by British employers has fallen through the floor?Then there is the persistent and growing problem of non-EU migration, which is now running at 250,000 a year, the highest for 14 years. This is a huge issue that must be tackled and which now requires a very different approach. For a start, the ‘skilled’ route must not be diluted. It must remain at degree level and the numbers must be capped.There should also be a medium skilled route confined to, for example, plumbers and electricians, and limited to EU workers for a specific period of stay. We do not believe there should be any route for the unskilled aside from the occasional, very carefully controlled, scheme.There is plenty more we could and should do. We should demand higher standards of English from spouses intending to come to Britain from abroad. We should interview foreign students before they arrive to ensure they are legitimate. We should tighten up border controls that mean we can never be entirely clear who has entered or who has left the country.Meanwhile, there is a serious risk that the system now proposed could spin out of control.The public have made their concerns very clear. If the Government continues to ride roughshod over them, they will pay a very high price, and will deserve to do so. "},{"url":null,"title":"BBC drama king screenwriter claims women bosses forcing make female characters feisty","story":"    In his illustrious 50-year career, screenwriter Andrew Davies has forged a formidable reputation for creating strong female charactersIn his illustrious 50-year career, screenwriter Andrew Davies has forged a formidable reputation for creating strong female characters.But now he says he is not allowed to make his women anything but feisty – by the powerful female executives who run television.Davies, who is known for adaptations of classics such as Pride And Prejudice and War \u0026amp Peace, says bosses want to see an image of themselves projected on screen, and veto any \u0027droopy, soppy\u0027 girls he wants to pen.He said: \u0027I started writing lead characters for women who disconcerted men quite early on in my career.

It was taken in December 1962 at Witley station not far from Godalming in Surrey. Another photo from the same roll of film appeared on the front page of the paper on the first Sunday of that month. In that one, the Santa Claus was climbing into the first-class carriage of the London-bound train. The picture caption suggested that he was making an early start to the festive season in order to “avoid Dr Beeching’s railway closures” – the infamous plan to cull branch lines and local stations that transformed the network the following year.When she took these pictures, Jane Bown was only a decade into what became a 65-year career with this paper that only ended when she died aged 89 in 2014. Among those who paid tribute to her was Lord Snowdon, who described her as a “kind of English Cartier-Bresson”. This picture might be exhibit A in supporting Snowdon’s judgment.Bown was never without her camera, usually carried in a wicker shopping bag, and she lived for juxtapositions like this one. Her very English take on Cartier-Bresson’s “decisive moment” invariably involved the sharpest eye for the ironies of social class. The incongruities of off-duty Santas are familiar her delight at this picture would have been in the supporting cast, however: the affable mustachioed man with his patched-up walking stick and, in particular, the look of aloof disquiet on the face of his daughter or grand-daughter, in her pony-club boots."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/874d8dd3856b6b9b864ef9c4d668b206a71be1ef/76_1277_3467_2080/master/3467.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ffd2ff11932d764a43a54ee7331bb88","title":"back to the crib north west englands nativities in pictures","story":"Stephen McCoy has been photographing the urban environments and landscapes of the north-west of England for 40 years.

The aide put a beige thermal blanket over her, the kind my mother refused to have in her house. It’s like being smothered by tissue, she said. It feels like bark, she said.“Don’t worry,” the aide said. “We’ll have your mother fixed up in no time.”“I can do it,” I said.I dressed my mother, not as well as the aide would have, but I got her covered up in navy sweatpants and a navy striped T-shirt and a navy headband for her dirty hair. I skipped the underwear. My mother snapped her waistband meaningfully and I took off her slippers, pulled down the pants, stretched my mother out on top of the blanket and put on the new style, less bulky Depends (my mother saw a commercial for these diaper-panties and said, “my people”).My mother didn’t sit up. She pulled at a thread at the bottom of her T-shirt.“Ma, don’t pull it,” I said. “You’ll ruin it.”“Ruin it,” she said. “Then I won’t have this little number for the next occasion? That’s a good one.”She pulled on the thread a little more and rolled over to sit up. She bent over, very nimbly, brought her T-shirt up to her mouth and bit the thread off.Amy Bloom is the author of four novels, two of which have appeared on the New York Times bestseller list, four collections of short stories, a children’s book and a collection of essays. She has been published in the New Yorker, the New York Times magazine and Best American Short Stories collections.\u0026nbspHer work, which has been translated into 15 languages, has been recognised by the US National Book award and the National Book Critics Circle award.\u0026nbspShe also writes for television – her series State of Mind examined the professional life of therapists. Bloom practised as a psychotherapist for  20 years.She is professor of creative writing at Wesleyan University, Connecticut.\u0026nbspIf it’s possible not to know a lot about the person who gave birth to you and raised you for 18 years – and I think it is – I didn’t know a lot about my mother. Other mothers filled their daughters’ ears with hard times or high times, failed birth control and if only I’d married Don Dennehy, the banker. My mother never said a word about what she regretted. Once in a while, she’d remark that she was doing for me what her parents, who died before I was born, had done for her. The bottle, not the breast (It’s not sanitary, she said.). A college education. A nice wedding in a place that wasn’t vulgar. The offer of a baby nurse when Rebecca was born. I turned it down and asked for the money instead and my mother explained, like the English teacher she was, that I should not mistake “equivalent” for “fungible”.My mother taught until she was required to retire and she stayed on to help in the library, and when she couldn’t stand the kids talking and texting and not reading any more she wandered down to the elementary school and became a literacy volunteer. When my father, her biggest fan, died, she became the director of literacy volunteers of Long Island. She never complained about her loneliness or her health or whether or not we visited enough. She never criticised me. She was sad when I told her that Bill and I were getting orced but she took my side and paid my retainer and never mentioned him again, except to say something cheerfully insulting. He wrote her a note expressing a wish to maintain their good relationship and she read it aloud to me, snorted and threw it in the trash.She went to conferences on literacy. She went to one conference for “writers and readers” and came home after the second day. (“Not for me,” she said. “Desperation at every meal.”) When she retired from the literacy volunteers, she said she’d had enough.I’ve read up on dementia, of course, and it turns out there are people so smart they can run through a lot of brain cells before anyone notices. My mother had so many intelligent, more or less appropriate, ingrained responses, along social, intellectual and political lines that most people could talk to her at length and not see that anything was wrong.Her cardiologist called me to apologise. Her internist did, too.“I’m sorry,” he said. “You said you were worried about your mother and I just thought that” – that I was one of those resentful, watchful children, keen to trumpet the signs of parental impairment at the first misplaced wallet – “you were mistaken, maybe jumping the gun. Your mother charmed me. She corrected my grammar. I didn’t see that the underpinning was gone.”Underpinning. Exactly. Le mot juste, my mother would have said.I have been looking for le mot juste to describe Feliks. He is not my mother’s caregiver (that would be me and the aides), he’s not her friend and Feliks is not her boyfriend.There are several ladies here with boyfriends and Mashapee Gardens is more like the high school in which I teach than I’d imagined. Highest rung: attractive woman with attractive boyfriend. Attractive in this case, meaning some kind of teeth, some kind of mobility (well-groomed on a motorised chair is not considered infra dig), some kind of hearing and a general air, because this never changes, of self-confidence.Next rung: attractive woman, unattractive boyfriend. Still, he makes you look good and there is always the possibility that he has hidden charms and assets. Next down: unattractive woman, attractive boyfriend (because at 15 or 85, who wants to be compared to a boyfriend and found wanting, with the strong suggestion that he is just waiting for his peer, his Meghan Markle). Next to last: unattractive woman, unattractive man. Gnomes. Trolls. And even so, the lowest rung is for the woman without a man. If there are men without women, they are on another ladder, entirely, and regarded, at worst, as projects (“He’d be a good-looking man if only he’d do something about the…”) and, at best, as undiscovered gems (“Oh, Gary. Gary? Well, I guess. I see what you mean…) whom the sharper ladies do their best to hide under the nearest bushel, to be examined later, at leisure. Some men are walkers, as if this is Olde New York, and some of the ladies, dressing for dinner in brocade jackets, mine-cut diamonds and orthopaedic sneakers, expecting chairs to be pulled out, act as if it is.My mother wasn’t having any of this. My father died, my daughter read a lovely poem and went back to Brooklyn, my Uncle Jack told a few dirty jokes over drinks, my mother’s best friend, Miriam, drank martinis with her until dawn and when she went back to her apartment, across the hall, my mother sat in her kitchenette with a stack of frozen dinners. Miriam and I nagged her to start going down to the dining room. Mingle, I said, but I stepped back when I said it.After a week, my mother went downstairs. She sat at the smallest, farthest table in the room, a few feet away from the end of the buffet line. Miriam told me that when one of the single men (walking with a cane, no oxygen) sat down next to my mother, which was a major declaration, like handing her a gardenia corsage, my mother told him to find someone else. My mother suggested Miriam, who was on the other side of the table. My mother went to dinner, to make me and Miriam happy, and she mourned hard. She stayed in bed until lunchtime. Having always worn her hair in a shellacked bob, she cut it short and stopped dyeing it. She looked like a great Roman empress and her friends said she was very chic. Very bold, Miriam said to me, and I know what she meant. My mother joined the New York Times discussion group and she watched the news constantly, cursing like a sailor. If it hadn’t been for her hatred of Donald Trump, she would have had no reason to live.And then, this fall, she put on her gardening pants, found her green foam kneeling pads and went to work on a lovely, all-blue flower garden for my father, which we’ll be able to see from her apartment window in the spring.Which is where she met Feliks. Behind the Mashapee Gardens complex there are the younger, rumbling businesses of assisted living: delivery trucks, waste-removal trucks, food and medical supplies, diapers and nutritional supplements. Feliks’s brother, Fyodor (Call me Ted) runs the medical care vans. He gets people to and from doctors’ appointments, home from the hospital, home from the ER visit, if necessary, and anywhere they want to go, if they don’t drive any more and don’t have people who can take them when they need to go. He’s not cheap (according to Miriam) and he is not exactly official but, the word at the facility is that if you wait until the official Mash Gardens shuttle comes to take you to your appointment, you won’t need it. Ted is kind, in that mocking, generous Russian way (as my mother would say, Our people), giving chocolates to people who are probably diabetic, slipping mini-bottles of Absolut into sagging sport coat pockets. The people who ride with him like him.Feliks is Ted Lite. Ted, three inches shorter and without the ambition. I tell my mother Feliks is like the Chekhovian soldier in Three Sisters who keeps taking pictures and buying gifts and really, no one has time for him but that doesn’t stop him from bringing more gifts and being cheerful. I tell her this, because it pleases her when I refer to Chekhov and I want her to keep going to dinner.Feliks first walked with us, on the garden path, in September. He held a baby in his arms, wrapped in a pink-fringed blanket, white booties peeking out, tiny fingers resting on his big, smooth forearm. I saw that I didn’t know anything about Feliks, about this baby, the marriage that might have produced her, his family, his affection for this baby, and his kindness in letting my mother, who loves babies, hold her.He sat on the bench, next to my mother and I sat on the grass, in a good position to catch the baby.Feliks waved me away. “She fine,” he said.I love babies, too. My mother says it’s our secret vice. We’re both English teachers, fair but stern, furious on the subject of grammar and spelling and the attempt to understand the sublime. We love babies, because there’s no need for sternness. Sternness is stupid, with babies. Feed them when they’re hungry. Change them when they’re dirty. Love them. Sing to them. Cuddle them. Blow a few bubbles. My mother’s cut-off age is two and mine is about five. My daughter Rebecca is 26 now and the most I can do is run my hands through her long hair, when it’s loose and cup her beautiful face in my hands, when she lets me, and she does let me, when I visit her, and when she comes home. Twice, we’ve gone to London together, seeing five plays in four days and that was almost just as good as holding a baby. Almost.Since Feliks and the pink baby, his third daughter and his favourite (his words, not mine) I started looking around for a baby for my mother. She’s not ready yet but I can see how she delights in that baby, how her breathing steadies, how she stands a little taller. Not every assisted living place encourages the use of baby dolls but the ones that do “nurture therapy”, encourage them big time. I have been to every e-store and website and watched a lot of “reborn doll” videos. I couldn’t take my eyes off the sweet, sad one of the 96-year-old woman and her reborn doll, who she sleeps with and feeds with the same pretend-milk-in-the-plastic-bottle that I had when I was a little girl. The woman coos and rocks the baby and feeds it and wipes its little rosebud mouth with a napkin, or her finger. Some others are not sweet. They are long, chatty videos of women who describe themselves as collectors, or as parents, or as adoptive parents. A lot of the women talk about their miscarriages. A few women say, resentfully, that they would adopt if they could afford to. Some of the women have someone else (which daughter? what husband?) film them putting the baby in the stroller, tucking a blanket around it and taking it for a walk. On the walk, the women say things like: “Isn’t she adorable?” The doll owners put pink ribbons or flowered headbands on the girl dolls, or, if they are boys, some kind of blue knit hat. The women say, to the camera: “Everyone thinks she’s real, because she is so beautiful.” They talk about how much pleasure and joy and comfort the dolls give them.This is just as horrifying as it sounds, and when you add in the collectors who have confederate flag bunting on the shelves on which they have their seven reborn dolls and the one woman from Spokane who made a video, bragging about spending $10,000 on her dolls, while having two (visibly) jealous children, it’s worse than horrifying and my ability to be neutral – to say the way my mother and I used to: “Well, it’s a big world” – evaporates.The high-end dolls have mohair attached to the scalp. They have dewy skin. Dewy-ish. It’s many layers of paint baked on vinyl. The really good ones are weighted, to about seven pounds and they seem to breathe. (They do not breathe. There is a little automated pump inside their chests, simulating exhaling and inhaling) and they are described as having new baby smell.I would not have done all this research except for Feliks and his daughter. We’d arranged to meet on Fridays, around the middle of the day, right before he started his shift. We’d take a little walk in the garden. My mother would sit on the bench and coo at the baby. One day the baby, Sofia, shat through her diaper. Feliks was horrified. I was spattered. My mother was covered in baby shit from rib to knee and she didn’t mind.“You did that once,” she said. “Right through the cushion and the wicker. It was a tsunami of shit.”Feliks took Sophia to the staff bathroom and I took my mother back to the apartment for the 90 minutes of changing and showering and drying and dressing.My mother lay down and said: “You have to buy a new outfit for her. That one is ruined.” I said it wasn’t ruined, that he’d wash it, or his wife would, and it would be good as new. I said it wasn’t our fault that the baby shat her pants. My mother pointed her finger at me: “Do not be stingy,” she said. “It’s a horrible, horrible quality. We are not stingy people,” she said.I bought a new pink striped onesie for Sofia and I shoved a pair of little pink moccasins and pink and white lacy socks across the counter, so I wouldn’t be stingy.I showed my mother.“Rebecca will look adorable,” she said. “He’ll appreciate it. Ted.”“Feliks,” I said. I went into the kitchenette to make us tea before we walked in the garden. Feliks had made a nice edge to the big oval planting bed my mother had laid out. My mother looked at me and opened her mouth and closed it.“Tea,” I said. “English breakfast?” This is the only kind of tea she drinks any more. Years ago, she had a tea collection from masala chai to wuyi da hong pao and gave me the tins to play with.My mother opened her mouth and she closed it.“Sweetheart,” she said and I knew that she absolutely did not, at that moment, know my name.We kept up with the walks in the garden into November, my mother as wrapped up as Sofia but Feliks stopped bringing the baby, because it was too cold and when there was no baby to see, my mother stopped going outside. She refused to go to the dining room, even when Miriam came and knocked on the door, every night at 5.30. The nurse, who checks on all the residents once a week, told me that my mother’s screaming at the television was bothering her next-door neighbour during the day. I told my mother she needed to keep it down and she said, how quiet should be you at democracy’s… it was on the tip of her tongue.I opened my phone and shopped. Ashlee breathes, coos and has a heartbeat and she’s only $150.00. (Not being stingy.) Reading Ashlee’s reviews (four stars, mostly) directs me to the higher end of baby dolls. Betsy Lee is $300 and she doesn’t breathe or coo but she is hand-painted and the website emphasises the realistic marbling and the lifelike tracery of veins. How do you weight hand-painted versus breathing? Real hair versus heartbeat? I wish my real mother was still with me. We have each stood outside a thousand dressing rooms for each other, over the last 20 years, asking: chic or homeless? Summery or mutton dressed as lamb? And when she said: “Darling, even I am barely old enough for that, put it down”, I did put it down.Betsy Lee takes me back to the cleverest website, advertising the reborn dolls as therapy tools, specifically for patients with dementia. (The women in the advertisements have nicely coiffed grey hair and look deeply happy while cradling the baby. If any website shows contented old men doing the same, I missed it.) The home page is three fat paragraphs about their expertly crafted dolls re-establishing nurturing feelings, providing a sense of purpose and bringing joy to memory care iniduals. So Very Real is the name of the line. Doreena does breathe, her hair is hand-rooted and her head is weighted to require support. Well, my real mother would have said, Isn’t she the whole package?I buy Doreena for $125.00 (on sale for the Christmas season) and I buy her candy-cane striped sleeper, her red hand-knit booties (hand-knit in China by actual children going blind, my real mother would have said) and her red and white reindeer sweater and a matching pom-pom hat, for when we go for walks in the garden.I decide not to wrap Doreena because her purpose is not to be a doll, or a gift, but to be a baby. I arrange her in the Moses basket I have had in the hall closet since Rebecca was a baby. I see that I need a goddamn blanket as well and I order that too, in red, green and white stripes, with one-day shipping. I read up on how to introduce the patient to the doll and when my mother comes out of her bedroom on Christmas morning, in her pink flannel bathrobe, with her matching pink slippers, looking as she always has, I’m ashamed that I ever thought this was a good idea. I sit frozen on the couch, holding Doreena as if she is having gas, face down on my lap. I pat her back.Well, my mother says, Mother and child. Merry Christmas. She picks up Doreena and stands up, holding her as she held Rebecca, and as I’m sure she held me.

For many families, it was part of the yuletide ritual to watch the soap opera centred on the lives of the Grantham family and the servants who waited upon them.Downton was an idealised high-Tory view of the world. The aristos – Lord Grantham in particular – were paternalists, seeing it as their duty to look after the people they employed, provided they worked hard and knew their place. There was harmony between rulers and ruled devotion to duty was rewarded wrongdoing punished. It was David Cameron’s big society in microcosm.In some ways it was interesting to consider the passing of a world that has ceased to be: a Britain of cottage hospitals, white-tie banquets, shooting parties and rich families shuffling between big houses before they were given over to the National Trust. But even more fascinating was to watch Downton and see what hasn’t changed. And the reality is that in the past few decades, the pattern of employment that featured in Downton has made a comeback.Few people these days employ valets, ladies’ maids and grooms. There are very few butlers like Carson knocking about, with a big below-stairs staff to boss about. Instead, today’s wealthy have cleaners, personal trainers, nannies, gardeners and dog walkers. The modern equivalents of Lord Grantham and his family are the financiers running hedge funds and the in-demand City lawyers who are income rich and time poor. They can afford to employ a modern servant class to do their domestic chores and look after their personal needs. The only real difference is that – for the most part – the servants live out rather than under the same roof.This is the flipside to Britain’s full-employment labour market. To be sure, jobs are plentiful and the proportion of the population in work has never been higher. It is a proud boast of the government that unemployment has not been lower since Harold Wilson was prime minister in the mid-1970s.But that was a different world. Jobs back then tended to be full-time workers were more likely to have the protection of a trade union manufacturing accounted for a bigger slice of the economy and paid well owners of companies earned ten times as much as the worker on the shop floor rather than 200 times as much. There were no zero-hour contracts and there was a more equal balance between labour and capital.The idea that the labour market would again be dominated by low-paid domestic service jobs would have seemed unthinkable. Those readers with long enough memories might be able remember a series called Upstairs Downstairs. It covered the same themes and the same period as Downtown but when it ran from 1971 to 1975 the assumption was that the world it depicted was never coming back. Now it has.The 70s were a pivotal period for Britain. From a labour-market perspective they lasted for 16 years between 1969 – when the trade unions saw off Barbara Castle’s In Place of Strife reforms – to 1985, when the miners accepted defeat after a year-long strike.In the intervening period some big shifts occurred: from an economy dominated by manufacturing to one dominated by financial services from a country where the gap between rich and poor had gradually been narrowed to one where inequality was rising rapidly from a world where living standards rose because real incomes were growing to one more dependent on house-price inflation and debt. The power of trade unions was curbed by mass unemployment and legislation.This was when modern Britain was born. Warehouses and call centres eventually replaced the pits and the factories. The City grew in size and influence. The centre of gravity of the economy moved southwards. London established itself as the world’s premier financial centre. The rich – including those attracted to Britain from overseas – became a lot richer. Part-time work increased as the percentage of workers covered by collective bargaining agreements fell.The reason Upstairs Downstairs seemed like a different world in the 1970s was that technological change and public policy had brought about big changes to the labour market. In the 19th Century the bulk of the population worked on the land and, as now, there were fears that mechanisation would lead to mass unemployment. What actually happened was that people left low-paid jobs in the field for better-paid jobs in factories.After the end of the second world war there was a sharp decline in the number of people employed in service. There were other more attractive jobs on offer full employment meant rich households had to pay their staff higher wages an array of labour-saving consumer goods such as washing machines and vacuum cleaners meant fewer servants were needed.However, over the years there has been a bifurcation of the labour market between those working in high-skill, high-wage sectors and those working in low-skill, low-wage sectors. Artificial intelligence will, unless carefully managed, widen the gulf still further.If history is any guide, the coming industrial revolution will create more jobs than it destroys. But it is by no means certain that the jobs being created will be better paid than the ones being destroyed. The opposite will be the case if machines take the place of workers in relatively well paid, if routine, occupations, who are then forced into lower-paid service-sector jobs.And that will be a risk if trade unions remain weak, redistribution is shunned and the owners of the machines capture all the financial benefits. Then, Britain’s Downtonisation will be complete."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbb960a3307b1ab6007165d4b7ce663a9bbef228/0_202_4069_2442/master/4069.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca8f49e9f2d139ab3fe9e139b61e878a","title":"labour leadership is at rock bottom wont be forgiven for conniving in rightwing brexit","story":"The Labour party is united: the vast majority of its MPs, its members and its voters – from all classes – want Britain to stay in the European Union. They recognise that Brexit is a project by the right for the right.For the EU stands for openness, peace, tolerance and the best of the Enlightenment traditions. It is the most successful institutional architecture forging international collaboration yet known. Britain has benefited immeasurably from its membership. It is the European answer to the 21st-century question of how to manage interdependencies between countries – economic, trading, security, financial, scientific – in a world where necessarily they must grow.Those who believe in it as a force for good do not want to go down without a struggle – to wimp out because to have another democratic encounter with the issue is said to be anti-democratic, arousing dark warnings of impending civic unrest from those asked to vote again. A one-off, never to be revisited referendum, as in totalitarian states in the 1930s, has become an irreversible building block for a rightwing world, with the connivance of parts of the old left that hold the same conception of imagined, untrammelled national autonomy as the extreme right.This brutal right, with its increasingly strident nationalist and racist overtones, is not going to go away after Brexit – it will raise the stakes still further, attempting to turn our beloved country into a venomous, intolerant cesspit. It has to be confronted sooner or later. Better sooner.Yet Labour’s leadership refuses to speak for this powerful and growing conviction within its party – in the country, too, with opinion polls hardening in favour of EU membership. As the government amazingly puts the country on to a war footing to manage the fallout of an impending hard Brexit, Labour’s voice is weak and temporising. In his interview with the  Jeremy Corbyn says that even if Labour won a snap general election, it would lead the country out of the EU but with a “better deal” built around a permanent customs union. Ongoing EU membership threatens a socialist programme, he argues, because of state-aid rules. If Theresa May recasts her deal in softer terms, he will back it, he says.His stance is wrong at every level. First, he has just reduced his electoral base to the shrinking Leave vote so that Labour will not and cannot win a general election. Remain voters, now the majority, must find another home. Worse, he is threatening the cohesion of his party by opposing its majority view and the values that support it, just as Brexit is threatening the cohesion of the Conservative party.All members of the Labour party must now examine their conscience: is this what they stand for and believe? The Corbyn deal, which can only be incrementally different from the May deal, will suffer from all the same deficiencies. We are to be associated with our continent as a satellite but not to share in its governance or play a part in shaping its destiny.It betrays a 19th-century view of socialism. What industries are going to be built by direct government subventions? The world of the future is not state-supported steel and cement companies. Britain has the third largest AI industry and could become the global hub for blockchain – all done inside the EU. The task for 21st-century socialism is not to bankroll directly such vigorous businesses. It is to build the architecture to generate more of them, enfranchise workforces, protect the backs of ordinary men and women, put environmental sustainability at the heart of our economy and continually to upgrade the social contract. In this, the EU is our ally, not our foe.The case must be put to the people again, framed by what we now know. It must be allied to a passionate case for reform. The desperate poverty and extraordinary inequalities that disfigure our country and that properly persuaded millions they could not vote for the status quo have to be addressed. Our economy has to be reshaped by an imaginative state our society recast our political institutions reformed.On top, we need two reciprocal commitments from Europe. Freedom of movement is a core freedom, but host societies must have the capacity to regulate inflows of people, otherwise intolerable strains are created. The multiple derogations from freedom of movement used by other EU states must be codified into a new deal that permits Britain, and of course other members, sufficient control of our borders.Second, the EU itself needs a democratic and accountability reboot. We are not recommitting to the same old EU – but one committed to change.This case would best be made by Labour as the centre of a cross-party coalition: it has credibility as a fighter against poverty and abusive capitalism and an advocate for internationalism. But the case for tolerance and openness cannot be made from a tribal silo. I admire Tories such as Phillip Lee, Jo Johnson and Sam Gyimah who have resigned on this issue, and others such as Anna Soubry, Justine Greening, Sarah Wollaston, Ken Clarke and Dominic Grieve. I would be proud to stand and campaign alongside them – and also Nicola Sturgeon, Caroline Lucas and Vince Cable. Any differences are secondary to what unites us. What does our country stand for, what is its future and who are our allies? Not Putin, Xi and Trump."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2444e6cb33e57c9fbd83697c94055d12f8d547f/0_0_1772_1063/master/1772.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18704267343e656010d072503901519c","title":"prepare for a no christmas brexit in 2019","story":"Merry Christmas, Brexit Britain! And a crap EU year!! It’s me, guest Christmas Observer columnist Father Christmas!!! Or Gender-fluid ParentCarer Winterval, as Boris Piccaninny Watermelon Letterbox Cake Disaster Weightloss Haircut Bullshit Johnson probably pretended the EU insisted on calling me, in his lying column in the Daily , Britain’s worst newspaper. But whatever name you know me by, I ho ho ho hate Brexit!While Christmas is expected to progress as usual this year, unless you manage to extricate yourselves from exiting the European Union pronto, Britain had better start making plans for a no-Christmas Brexit in 2019.Stop up your chimneys, deep-freeze your figgy pudding, and stockpile your stockings! And it doesn’t matter who has been naughty and who has been nice!! Because Santa Claus ain’t comin’ to Brexit-town!!!Like a lot of business people whose work involves moving large numbers of goods over a succession of borders, andor the transportation of hoofed livestock across different national boundaries, the possibility of a no-deal Brexit leaves me pretty much up the creek of shite mit keine paddle.The existence of the European Common Aviation Area, for example, has avoided some of the awkwardness that accompanied my circuits of the Earth in the 50s, when I was regularly pursued across Europe by hostile cold war fighter jets, Rudolph’s tedious nose making us an easy target for state-of-the-art missile systems.And, although I do appreciate that many unscrupulous employers exploit this, the fact that the short-term seasonal staffing needs of my Finland workshop can be fulfilled each festive season without friction has meant I have still been able to meet all my toy manufacture and delivery targets, each and every year.And that’s despite needing to service a global Santa‑believing customer base that has expanded significantly, year on year, since I first transitioned myself from a folkloric yuletide nature spirit into a Christianised personification of the winter season, some time in the early 17th century.Take the Irish border question, for example, and it’s a shame you never did. I have no desire to go back to the bad old days of the 70s, when I was shot down between Armagh and Dundalk, kneecapped and then had all my presents stolen and resold to fund the revolutionary struggle. Little Tommy in Cork was crying because he didn’t have a Stretch Armstrong meanwhile a post office north of the border was on fire.And furthermore, at the moment, I can save an enormous amount of time, on what is already a very busy night, if you don’t mind me saying so, by traversing the island of Ireland east to west and back again, as the crow flies, from Belfast in Northern Ireland to Donegal in the Republic of Ireland, without the necessity of customs checks on my gifts (are they up to EU standards?) every time I cross the border, or on my livestock (do they carry foot and mouth disease?), or on my small green-clad seasonal staff (do they have the relevant legal paperwork?).Even assuming that this was all smoothed over by some frictionless arrangement involving yet to be invented technology, which it won’t be in the event of a no-deal Brexit, then there is a further problem. I take off from Lapland, which, as part of Finland, is an EU member state, so it is not even certain whether I will be able to land in Britain at all, unless its future relationship with the European Common Aviation Area is maintained.I wrote to the Department for Exiting the EU, asking, in the event of me not being allowed to fly over the UK after Brexit, if I could do my British deliveries on land? They invited me to enter a lottery for one of only 2,000 European Conference of Ministers of Transport permits, allowing me to complete my cross-channel deliveries by road. Do they know who I am? Clearly not. Do they know it’s Christmas time at all?Put it this way. If you leave the EU with no deal, then I can promise you, people of Britain, that, irrespective of whether you have been naughty, ie you voted to leave, or nice, ie you voted to remain, Christmas 2018 will be the United Kingdom’s last Christmas. And there is no room for further negotiation.If you want to make all that extra work for me, then as far as I am concerned, some other mug can be Britain’s own personal Santa in 2019, ’cos I ain’t doin’ it! Perhaps next Christmas, the job of Father Christmas could be done, in quick succession, by David Davis, Dominic Raab, and then some anonymous fall guy no one’s ever heard of, the Lee Harvey Oswald patsy of Brexit.Clad in a red, white and blue Brexit Santa suit, Raab could fly over the land in his sleigh, scattering valuable medicines and tinned foods to the bedraggled people traversing the ruined Mad Max wasteland of post-Brexit Britain.Or perhaps Boris Johnson could be Santa. He has the physique, and the international aspect of the job would give him a chance to display his well-loved facility for diplomacy in a variety of different nations.Now, in closing, a lot of people ask me: do you exist? To which the simple answer is: no, obviously not. But there is a more complex answer. I do exist, but only if you really, really, really believe in me. And in that respect, I am very similar to Brexit.Father Christmas’s favourite snowflake, Stewart Lee’s last touring standup show, Content Provider, is screened on BBC Two on Saturday 29 December.

He became the first black actor to portray an English monarch for the RSC and got his screen break in the BBC spy drama Spooks. Now based in LA with his family, he was nominated for a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Martin Luther King Jr in Selma. This Christmas, he stars as Javert in the BBC’s six-part adaptation of Les Misérables.Were you a fan of Les Misérables?My only relationship with the story had been the film, so when I was approached about Javert, my mind went to a boo-hiss villain. I was initially trepidatious about playing that kind of one-dimensional character over six hours of television, but that concern was quickly alleviated by reading Andrew Davies’s adaptation, which is much more layered. Then when I read Victor Hugo’s book, I was bowled over by how well Andrew had captured it.Aren’t there similarities between Javert and his nemesis, Valjean?That’s exactly how I see it and that’s certainly alluded to in the novel. In some ways, Valjean represents what Javert could have been. Javert was born in prison to criminals but has chosen the opposite path. You can argue there’s an element of self-hatred there.In your version, there’s also some beard rivalry between them.Well, yeah. And Javert seems obsessed with how strong Valjean is. I feel like they had an arm wrestle at some point and Valjean won.How was it working with Dominic West, who plays Valjean?We’re both ambassadors for the Prince’s Trust so we’d met before, mostly at Buckingham Palace. So it was completely antithetical to meet again amid the mud, blood and sweat of the prison hulks. Dominic’s a phenomenal choice for the role and a great guy. You have to like and trust each other to be that nasty. We spend a lot of time glowering at each other but there are many outtakes of us cracking into giggles.It’s a dramatic version, not a musical one, but could you burst into song if you had to?I like a good warble. I’ve done musicals in the past and intend to do them in future. But here I hope viewers get swept away by the epic storytelling, rather than missing the tunes.Might people criticise the colour-blind casting as “typical BBC political correctness”?You can’t please everyone. Some people will applaud the way we’ve chosen to tell the story. Everyone else can go and read the book.You get to wear a lot of period hats, too.There’s a whole bunch of hat work. I was nervous about the Napoleonic one I wear in the later episodes. That’s a difficult hat to pull off. A bit like wearing one of those paper boats you’d make at primary school.You’ve just finished shooting a film called Come Away. Tell us about that.There’s more hat-work in that, actually. I had a very period summer – parked myself in the 19th century and stayed there. It’s a reimagined origin story of Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan, with them conceived as brother and sister. Angelina Jolie and I play their parents. We suffer a tragedy and our children use their rich imaginations to try and pull us out of despair.Weren’t you already friends with Angelina Jolie via children’s playdates?She’s got six kids, I’ve got four, and they’ve got together in the past to wreak havoc. I’m a producer on Come Away and really had seen Angie mostly as a mother because that had been my interaction with her. I asked her if she’d like to do it and she relished the prospect. She’d never actually played a mother who interacts with her children on screen before. We had a blast.You starred in crime caper Gringo earlier this year. Apparently you made co-star Charlize Theron pee herself?That’s going to be my claim to fame. I’ve never actually seen that happen before – someone literally pee themselves from laughing. It was extraordinary. Lovely Charlize. I’m sure she’s very happy we’re discussing this!You’re British-American-African. Which is worse from your viewpoint, Brexit or Trump?Gosh, they’re both quite egregious in my opinion. At least I don’t have to choose where I live because both places are pretty challenging. You once said you won’t play “the black best friend” or do superhero movies. Do you still have rules about the roles you take?I try to stay away from anything that feels obvious. I don’t want to do anything derivative, cliched or stereotypical because images are political. They inform how people view people like me. My other rule is not to do anything that flies in the face of how I’m raising my kids. I’ll do things that are dark in tone but I gravitate towards things that have redemptive, life-affirming qualities.There’s often talk of who’ll be the first black James Bond but technically you were first, right?I don’t think it’s fair to count an audiobook! That doesn’t quite give me the right to stake a claim. But to me, all that conversation signifies is that the audience is ready to see different kinds of people in those roles. We’re seeing that with our Les Mis, with Black Panther, with all sorts of things. The gatekeepers have had the keys taken away and they’re firmly in the hands of viewers now.

A little more plentiful, yes, but also a tad sweeter. In our house, bottles come out at this time of year that would normally never see the light of day.For every drink I pour, there has to be something to eat. It is a rule, a way of life. Thin slices of jamón ibérico with a tiny glass of sherry, some curls of gravlax with frivolous bubbles, and maybe something along the lines of a punch with plump, parmesan-crusted muffins.There will be warming drinks. Mulled wine is a much misunderstood drink, being used primarily to get everyone pissed, when it deserves a little more reverence and thought. It needs more than a couple of star anise and a cinnamon stick. Such drinks allow – some might say beg for – slightly more delicious accompaniments than they get. A fat slice of gravlax on a square of dark rye perhaps, cured with beetroot juice and juniper berries, or perhaps a tiny pastry parcel of mashed pumpkin.I baked a new batch of crispbreads this week, the texture of pebbledash, knobbly with pumpkin seeds and oats, and used them as a base for a coarse paté of grated beetroot and smoked mackerel. We ate them with glasses of prosecco turned rose pink by the addition of pomegranate juice. There were chubby little muffins, too, studded with pine kernels and rosemary and passed round with glasses of hot cider. A practice run for Boxing Day morning.All that remains now is for me to raise a glass and say thank you for another year and to wish you all a very happy Christmas.We served this with prosecco and pomegranate juice. For 12 glasses, you need a couple of bottles of prosecco, chilled for several hours, and 250ml of pomegranate juice which is about three medium-sized juicy pomegranates. Cut the fruit in half and use a lemon reamer to extract the juice. It’s a messy job, best done over a bowl wearing an apron. Divide the juice between the glasses, then top up with prosecco and serve immediately, before the fizz dies. The crackers, on the other hand, will keep for several days in an airtight tin.Enough for 12 people with drinksFor the crispbreads:plain flour 75grolled oats 20gsea salt 5gsesame seeds 60gpumpkin seeds 60gsunflower seeds 50ggroundnut or vegetable oil 50mlFor the beetroot and mackerel:smoked mackerel fillets 350gdill 20gcrème fraîche 3 heaped tbspraw beetroot 80gSet the oven at 150Cgas mark 2. Line a baking sheet, measuring approximately 40cm x 28cm, with baking parchment. Put the plain flour in a mixing bowl, then add the rolled oats, 5g of sea salt, the sesame, pumpkin and sunflower seeds, then stir in the groundnut oil. Bring the ingredients together with your hands to form a ball of seed-freckled dough, then transfer to the parchment-lined baking sheet.Press the dough with a floured hand to fill the baking sheet. The dough should be very thin. Bake for an hour until crisp, then remove from the oven. Transfer, still on its parchment, to a cooling rack. When cold, break into crackers and store in an airtight tin till needed.To make the mackerel and beetroot paste, discard the skin from the mackerel, then crush the flesh with a fork, checking for any stray bones.Remove the dill fronds from their stalks. Chop the fronds and add to the mackerel together with the crème fraîche. Coarsely grate the beetroot and fold gently and briefly into the mackerel. (If you over-mix, you will end up with a bright pink paste.) Cover and refrigerate until needed.To serve, place mounds of the mackerel and beetroot mixture on to pieces of cracker. You will need approximately 2 tbsp per person.If you don’t mind a bit of last-minute cooking, may I suggest you serve these warm? Light, cheesy, rosemary-scented little cakes, they are infinitely more delicious when served from the oven, like their sweet cousin, the madeleine. You could bake them an hour before you plan to eat, keeping them warm in the switched-off oven or, should the oven be busy, wrapped loosely in tin foil still in their baking tin. Ideally, though, they are meant as breakfast muffins, something to serve on Boxing Day morning.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6.Line 12 bun tins with paper muffin cases. Put the flour in a mixing bowl and combine thoroughly with the caster sugar, baking powder and a pinch of salt. Grate the apple without peeling it. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs then stir in the yogurt. Tear the speck into small, stamp-sized pieces and add to the batter, followed by the grated apple. Fold in the grated cheese, then lightly mix with the dry ingredients.Divide the batter between the muffin cases, add the pine nuts, rosemary and parmesan, then bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes until risen and pale gold.Enough for 6cider 2 litrescinnamon sticks 2 star anise 4cloves 6sloe gin 400mlPour the cider into a large, non-reactive pan, add the cinnamon, star anise and cloves and set over a moderate heat.

Jürgen Klopp and his players can now enter the festive period four points clear of the defending champions at the top of the Premier League. While one point separated the frontrunners City could look forward to rectifying the situation when Liverpool come here in the new year now there might be little they can do if their unbeaten rivals maintain their impressive run of results.City were unrecognisable for large parts of the game and not just because key players were injured or rested. They were unimaginative going forward and sloppy in defence, with Kyle Walker having a game he will want to forget. That is to take nothing away from Crystal Palace, who were organised and effective at both ends and thoroughly deserving of three important points.“When we score three goals away from home I think we can say we deserved it,” the Palace captain Luka Milivojevic said. “Andros Townsend’s goal was amazing.”City’s captain, Fabian Delph, accepted his side had not been at their best. “Palace were stubborn and organised but we started too slowly,” he said. “The ball was not zipping about.”That was certainly true, for the shock of the season took a while to get going, even if a late City goal ensured a dramatic finale. The first half-hour was a test of patience. Palace were content to keep men back, challenging the home side to find a way through, while City’s efforts to make their wealth of possession count were hampered by their being without the spark of ingenuity that David Silva or Kevin De Bruyne would normally supply.It was one of those tepid encounters that needed a goal, though after City finally supplied one after 27 minutes the script took a wholly unexpected twist. Not only did Palace hit back almost straight away, within nine minutes of going behind they were in the lead after Andros Townsend beat Ederson with a delightful left-foot volley from 20 yards out.First things first though. City would not have seen any of that coming when Ilkay Gündoğan strode through a static defence to reach Delph’s cross and beat Vicente Guaita with a firm header. The midfielder ended up unopposed on the six-yard line but had remained onside – the Palace defenders simply failed to pick up his run.The visitors’ only serious threat by that stage had come after six minutes, when John Stones took on a little too much in attempting to justify his selection in midfield and almost presented Wilfried Zaha with an opportunity after being caught in possession in his own half.City could have done with Stones to help out in defence when Palace equalised six minutes after Gündoğan’s goal. Zaha got the better of Aymeric Laporte on the right, then as the ball was transferred across the edge of the area Jeffrey Schlupp found room to get round Walker and make space for a shot past Ederson.Before City had a chance to reply they were suddenly behind and again there were questions to be asked of the defence. A free-kick into the area was not properly cleared and after two weak headers in succession from Gündoğan and Bernardo Silva the ball reached Townsend just outside the area. The winger returned it with a spectacular volley into Ederson’s top-left corner.“It sat up perfectly,” the scorer said. “I knew I couldn’t take a touch as City would have been on me and away on the counter.”Pep Guardiola’s response was to send on Sergio Agüero early in the second half, not for the ineffective Gabriel Jesus as might have been expected, but for Nicolás Otamendi. That meant Stones was back in his usual position just in time to see Palace extend their lead.Aaron Wan-Bissaka took on the defence down the right and from his cutback Townsend was unlucky to see his header strike a post. Walker was overzealous in trying to clear the rebound, jumping in to a tackle and catching Max Meyer in the area, allowing the reliable Milivojevic to score emphatically from the spot.That prompted De Bruyne’s arrival on a rescue mission for the final half-hour, with Riyad Mahrez following him on to the pitch a few minutes later.Until the closing stages the nearest City came to a fightback was a Leroy Sané free-kick that struck an upright, though when De Bruyne beat Guaita five minutes from time with a dipping shot that looked suspiciously like a cross, the crowd woke up to encourage their side to retrieve at least a point.The best chance of City’s final push came in stoppage-time when what was definitely a De Bruyne cross found Jesus on the six-yard line, only for the Brazilian to head over.One heroic block by James Tomkins to deny Gündoğan later, Palace had their victory and a sorry week for Manchester managers was complete."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de65c5675f260fb19911d41a3785a463b237bb9d/514_151_2011_1206/master/2011.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed830515de4bce92f3ad052a48fd10be","title":"peter schmeichel manchester united director football","story":"Peter Schmeichel has called on Manchester United to appoint a director of football and would consider applying for the role if it was advertised.José Mourinho was sacked as United manager earlier this week and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was named as caretaker manager until the end of the season.The club have suggested they will install a director of football and the former Manchester United goalkeeper Schmeichel is considering whether to put himself in the frame.“I’m actually thinking about putting my name in there,” he told BBC Radio 5 Live’s Sportsweek. “What’s really important is to get the Manchester United culture back and the identity back.“I’m considering: ‘Do I have the qualities?’ And if I come up to an answer to that question, then I will put my name in the hat.

It’s been refreshing: fans are actually feeling enthusiastic again. The concern now is whether Emery can maintain the high-energy approach: our defensive issues will become more and more exposed if the squad begins to run out of steam. 810Starsflops Torreira’s infectious garra charrúa intensity and Guendouzi’s fearless zest have made the difference. Emery is still refusing to bend to anyone who fails to buy into his vision – so will that coax Özil and Ramsey out of their insouciant comfort zones, or are they both just marking time until they leave?Happy with the manager? We’re very satisfied – despite being forced to wait until the second half to see our most effective XI, and despite a dearth of clean sheets. His lineups so far have been dictated by our porous rearguard, so we can’t truly judge him until he’s had a couple of transfer windows. 810Favourite moment of the 2018 calendar year Either our euphoric derby comeback at the start of the month, the showpiece of Arsène’s last home game, or le Prof’s poignant curtain call at Huddersfield. A heady mix of hugely conflicting emotions.It’s been refreshing to be nearer the top than the bottom of the table. Apart from the defeats to Burnley and Newcastle, we really haven’t got much to complain about. A more than solid 810.Starsflops David Brooks has been the undoubted star. He really shouldn’t be that good at the age of 21 – he’s been such a positive influence on the way we’re performing. Also key to the success have been Ryan Fraser, Jefferson Lerma and Callum Wilson. On the negative side, Jordon Ibe has been left out of the team – it’s about time he had something to contribute.Happy with the manager? Eddie has really moved the performances on this season and his recruitment has been good. It is only the games against the top six that he has to get better at. 710Moment of 2018 It’s hard to look past that 3-0 away win at Chelsea in January at the start of the year. We weren’t in a good place in the table but that performance proved to the players they could pick up points in any game when they put everything together. Wilson, Josh King and Junior Stanislas were just on fire that day and Chelsea were blown away. It was also a bit of revenge for being knocked out of the Carabao Cup in the quarter-finals.After a tricky start – especially the awful opening-day defeat at Watford – we’re in a pretty good place. Chris Hughton gave the summer signings time to settle in but now they are making their mark. Chelsea were lucky to hold on to win last Sunday while Florin Andone’s goal against Crystal Palace has to be a contender for goal of the season. 810Starsflops Andone is a strong and fast back-up to Glenn Murray Bernardo was outstanding against Chelsea Yves Bissouma runs rings round opponents, and Martin Montoya and Leon Balogun are rocks. The jury’s still out on Alireza Jahanbakhsh, who was starting to look promising when he got injured. Solly March continues to ide opinion but when he’s on form is a delight to watch while Lewis Dunk and Shane Duffy are monsters. Flops? None – though it wouldn’t be a surprise if Jürgen Locadia left in January.Happy with the manager? He has worked wonders, maintained constant progression and created a tremendous atmosphere in the squad. And he really is the nicest man in football. 910Moment of 2018 Watching Palace being taken apart at the Amex was hilarious. Even Zaha and his theatrics couldn’t stop us. But the best moment has to be the 1-0 win over Man United in early May that meant we stayed up – beautiful.Given we finished seventh last season, it’s been a disappointment so far – but there have been signs of improvement. It’s not difficult to see what our problem is – just look at the goals against column. We’ve conceded as many this season as we did in the first 36 games last season. We need to get back to being Burnley and making it difficult for opponents. 510Starsflops There haven’t been any stars, really – though it would be very difficult to criticise Joe Hart despite the number of goals he has conceded. Charlie Taylor is also beginning to establish himself at this level. But others have been way off form – Jack Cork and Chris Wood haven’t reached anything like the levels they did last season.Happy with the manager? Incredibly there have been some dissenting voices, despite the fact he’s taken us up twice, kept us up twice and taken us into Europe. He’s not getting the 10 out of 10 he’s had in the past but he’s still worth a 710. I’m sure he’ll improve on that.Moment of 2018 For me, Thursday 23 August, when we played our away leg against Olympiakos. I saw the home games in European competition in the 1960s and I’d been to Aberdeen four weeks earlier, but to see us playing away in Europe was something very special – something I’ll always remember.The fact that we’re guaranteed not to be bottom at Christmas is a position most Cardiff fans would have taken back in August. Our away form has been disappointing, but the atmosphere at home games has been immense. 710Starsflops Makeshift striker Callum Paterson is becoming a proper cult hero. He’s all action, looks bad-ass and just loves it. I don’t think he can believe how well he’s doing and the love he’s getting from the stands is crazy. Elsewhere, Victor Camarasa delivers consistent quality, but Ken Zohore, who was expected to be our main threat, has offered nothing. Then there’s Gary Madine. He hasn’t had many chances – but a £6m player should be kicking the manager’s door down to get a start.Happy with the manager? Overall, yes. Warnock isn’t perfect – he starts away games set up with little hope of winning – but he’s performed a miracle so far to get us where we are and he’ll be our best manager ever if we stay up. Based on the season so far it can only be 710, but if we survive, it’ll be a maximum score.Moment of 2018 When centre-back Sean Morrison ran the length of the field at Hull to score Cardiff’s second in April and all but seal promotion. One of the best feelings I’ve ever had walking away from an away game. We were going up.It’s a 7.510 so far – a half point deducted for that performance at Wembley last month. Expectations were up in the air at the start of the season, given another managerial change and the way things were left at the end of last term. But between his smoke breaks, Sarri has conveyed plenty of good ideas, and the players have adapted. To get through all competitions without a defeat until the end of November is impressive – and we’ll learn from that Leicester result. A cup run and a top-four finish will feel like job done.Happy with the manager? Smoky Joe’s making sweeping changes in style, so we should know more by the end of this season if he has the players and the tactical nous to really pull it off. 710Moment of 2018 N’Golo Kanté accepting a fan’s invitation for dinner. Oh, and the joy on his face when he was out riding a bicycle with the French team in the summer. The nicest man in football.Apart from a couple of real low moments, we haven’t played that badly this season – but the stats don’t lie. That result at City was stunning, but otherwise we’ve had just a handful of wins, while defeats to sides such as Southampton, Brighton, Wolves and Watford just aren’t acceptable for a club with such a high wage bill. 510Starsflops Aaron Wan-Bissaka has been outstanding: he tops virtually every defensive stat category. It’s remarkable to think he’s just 21 and has made only 23 league appearances. The flops have been up front. Signing Jordan Ayew on loan really hasn’t worked out – he should definitely be sent back to Swansea – while Alexander Sørloth looks out of his depth.Happy with the manager? With the players we have we should be higher. Hodgson’s inflexibility over his subs has melted, but that softening has too often been replaced with a rigid 4-4-2 formation featuring no strikers. It’s no coincidence that we shone at City when he switched to a 4-5-1. 510Moment of 2018 Besides the Etihad, of course, a personal one: I was lucky enough to be at England’s World Cup quarter-final against Sweden. The way the team dominated made it a stress-free, properly joyful experience.Compared with last season’s dross, Marco Silva’s brand of football has been a proper breath of fresh air. The tactical approach, together with the sound recruitment strategy overseen by Marcel Brands, means the club really is moving forward now. We’re not the finished article by any means, but at least we now have some momentum – and we have an identity again. 710Starsflops Richarlison has been a huge factor in what we’ve achieved so far – but the outstanding talent for me is André Gomes, on loan from Barcelona. He’s so cool under pressure, has two great feet and fantastic vision to pick out a pass. Signing him on a permanent basis would be a huge statement of intent.Happy with the manager? He’s overseen a rapid and, so far, successful transition to a new attacking playing style – so it’s a case of so far, so good. The positive way the players seem to have responded to his ideas and philosophy says a lot about his quality as a manager. It’ll be interesting to see what he manages to achieve, with Brands, in the transfer window – we do need another option up front. 710Moment of 2018 Richarlison doing the pigeon dance when he scores.Am I pleased? Not exactly. 210Starsflops It’s fair to say that the latter have outweighed the former. Our summer spree left us with a group of iniduals, not a team. Calum Chambers has blossomed in his new defensive midfield role, Ryan Sessegnon continues to impress, Tom Cairney has his moments and Big Mitro will score if given service. At the other end, Sergio Rico has done well behind a porous back line – but otherwise the list of flops is, alas, a lengthy one. A couple of decent results could still change things, though.Happy with the manager? It’ll have to be a 610 for now, while we see how things develop. We remain extremely grateful to Slavisa Jokanovic for steering us to promotion, and very upset that he was sacked – but something probably did have to give. Only time will tell if Claudio Ranieri can get us out of this mess.Moment of 2018 Our play-off win at Wembley. The explosion of noise from the “white wall” at the end was extraordinary. That glorious feeling of total unity and solidarity doesn’t come around too often – and, as we’ve seen since, is all too easy to squander. Oh, and a personal moment for me – the publication of There’s Only One F In Fulham, a book on our rollercoaster journey over the last 30 years!Our season so far has to be viewed through a prism of overachievement – we really are punching above our weight to be in this ision at all. However, there is still a slight air of frustration as our performances haven’t brought the points they should have done – and that’s mainly down to poor finishing. 610Starsflops Aaron Mooy has been the undoubted star – he’s really been taking his performances to the next level. Unfortunately he’s now heading off with Australia for the Asia Cup which could have a big negative impact on our performances. The biggest flop for me has been Steve Mounié, who’s been busy aiming to beat Ade Akinbiyi’s goal drought record of 1,500 minutes. Mounié has more red cards than goals this season – appalling for a striker.Happy with the manager? By and large Wagner has done well, though there are questions over his game management. His negativity cost us points in home games against Cardiff and Brighton. He must do more to get us scoring. 610Moment of 2018 Was hearing the former Sheffield Wednesday boss Carlos Carvalhal describing how he built a team on a shoestring budget at Hillsborough. It actually made me laugh out loud. If £40m is a shoestring budget in the Championship then I’m a unicorn.• Part two: Leicester to Wolves"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97e1f9c530b620180d83a24079fe3fee82f6702f/0_78_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=492545a1a18f3ed3ffba31d1eadea089","title":"flashpoints of 2018 sergio ramos mo salah champions league final","story":"Continuing our series of controversies that defined the year, Liverpool’s key player was fouled by Real’s controversial hard man in the 22nd minute of the Champions League finalIt was four minutes before the enormity of the situation truly sunk in and a communal gasp came from the sea of red inside Kiev’s Olimpiyskiy Stadium. Mohamed Salah was down for a second time in quick succession, only this time he was down and out of the Champions League final. A season of joy, brilliance and 44 goals had been brought to a premature, painful and tearful halt. Sergio Ramos shared a joke with an assistant referee as the idol of Liverpool and Egypt headed for the tunnel and the worst moment of his career. Real Madrid set course for their 13th European Cup triumph in his absence.Recriminations from the Ramos hold and twist that ended Salah’s final – no foul was awarded on the night by the Serbian referee, Milorad Mazic – started long before the Real captain, almost as though rubbing Liverpool’s noses in it, lifted the trophy for a third consecutive season on 26 May.Within days an Egyptian lawyer, Bassem Wahba, had launched a €1bn lawsuit against Ramos for jeopardising the Egypt captain’s participation in the nation’s first World Cup finals appearance for 28 years. A petition started online calling on Fifa and Uefa to punish the Spain international who, it alleged, “intentionally kept Mohamed Salah’s arm under his armpit, causing dislocation of his shoulder”. Ramos, the petition added, “represents an awful example to future generations of football players. Instead of winning matches fairly, he uses tricks that defy the spirit of the game and fair play.”The petition attracted more than 535,000 names. Even the European Judo Union weighed in. “Waki-gatame is a dangerous technique,” it tweeted of the move that Ramos executed in the final’s 25th minute. “That’s why it’s not allowed in judo to use for transition to ne-waza.”Salah would make the World Cup and score in Egypt’s defeat by Saudi Arabia, albeit below match fitness and having missed the opening game as a consequence of what happened in Ukraine. His right shoulder did not dislocate under Ramos’s armpit. He sprained ligaments in the left shoulder when hitting the ground with the veteran defender on top and still holding on. But there was no consolation for Liverpool. They suffered the fallout while Salah was having his shoulder strapped up, a disconsolate photograph taken with publicity seeking restaurateur Salt Bae and awaiting transfer to hospital.Four minutes earlier it had looked so promising for Jürgen Klopp’s team. They started in the ascendancy against Zinedine Zidane’s reigning European champions, pressing with an aggression and intelligence that had brushed aside Porto, Manchester City and Roma en route to the final. Then everything changed.Salah took on Ramos just inside the Real Madrid half. Down they went and, without the shock that usually accompanies a game-ending injury, the naked eye followed Isco as the Real midfielder collected the loose ball. Only when Mazic stopped play and the Liverpool physio rushed to Salah’s aid did it appear serious. Only when Salah collapsed on his back following a Liverpool corner four minutes later, having initially tried to soldier on, did those inside the Olimpiyskiy Stadium realise the implications for all concerned. Ramos had turned both Liverpool’s most dangerous player and the match, goalless at this point, his way.Other factors were obviously instrumental in Liverpool’s 3-1 defeat. Klopp’s team, with an injury-hit Adam Lallana summonsed to replace the Egypt international, lost conviction and shape along with their leading goalscorer. A calamitous performance from Loris Karius and a 29-minute man-of-the-match display from the substitute Gareth Bale had the greatest effect on the result.Five days later it was discovered Karius had suffered concussion shortly before Karim Benzema’s opening goal after taking a blow to the head from Ramos. Sympathy was not exactly in plentiful supply for the goalkeeper, who was loaned to Besiktas before the summer’s end. It turned out to be the curtain call for Zidane and Cristiano Ronaldo at Real, too.Salah’s injury, and the intent behind it, dominated the aftermath, however. In many respects it still does. Dejan Lovren, the forward’s close friend, appeared to brag on social media only last month about elbowing Ramos during Croatia’s Nations League victory over Spain. Seasoned Liverpool observers would say retribution came first, or certainly quicker, in the days of Graeme Souness, Jimmy Case and other hardened champions.Ramos’s reaction added insult to the injury for Liverpool. He was first to console Salah on the pitch with a pat on the cheeks. He was last through the media mixed zone later that night, declining to stop for reporters who waited more than two hours to ask questions about the incident, although the defender did say: “Yes,” and nod towards the European Cup he was carrying when asked if the English press could have a word. There was a tweet wishing Salah well in his recovery but otherwise it was over a week before Ramos gave his version of events in an interview with the Spanish paper AS.“Bloody hell, they have given this Salah thing a lot of attention,” the Real captain said. “I didn’t want to speak because everything is magnified. I remember the play well: he grabs my arm first and I fell to the other side, the injury happened to the other arm and they said that I gave him a judo hold. After that the goalkeeper said I dazed him with a clash. I spoke with Salah through messages, he was quite good. He could have played on if he got an injection for the second half. I have done it sometimes but when Ramos does something like this, it sticks a little bit more. I am only missing Roberto Firmino saying he got a cold because a drop of my sweat landed on him.”Salah rejected the notion of conciliatory messages or playing on with an injection. “He sent me a message, but I never told him it was OK,” the Liverpool striker said. As for having an injection, he commented: “It’s always OK when the one who made you cry first then makes you laugh.”Klopp delivered his honest opinion on the 25th minute of the final two months later. A week before he did so the Liverpool manager had declined to discuss Kiev at length when sitting down with the media for the first time in pre-season at Melwood. Relaxed while on tour in the US, however, he was much more forthcoming when asked again. He was reluctant to go there at first. “Wow, let’s open that bottle again?” he replied to the specific question of Ramos on Salah. Klopp paused for eight seconds while considering whether indeed to open the bottle. The top came off in the form of a 10-minute, 1,400-word answer.“Ruthless and brutal,” he said. “I’m not sure if it is an experience we will have again – go there and put an elbow to the goalkeeper, put their goalscorer down like a wrestler in midfield and then you win the game. It was a little bit like that – that was the story of the game. Ramos said a lot of things that I didn’t like. As a person I didn’t like the reactions of him. He was like: ‘Whatever, what do they want? It’s normal.’ No it is not normal. It is like we, the world out there, accepts that you use each weapon to win the game.

We ask them how they see their futureAs Hatem al-Far waited with dwindling hope for an Israeli permit that would allow him out of Gaza this Christmas, he showed a picture on his phone of his first grandson, eight-month-old Ibrahim, and wondered when, if ever, he would see him in the flesh.This year Far, 53, has a double reason for wanting permission to leave Gaza: he wants to attend the Greek Orthodox midnight mass in Bethlehem’s Church of the Nativity with his family and attend Ibrahim’s christening, which has been postponed in the hope that his grandfather will make it to the West Bank. “I’m not asking for much,” he said. “I’m living in one Palestinian city, and all I want is to travel to another Palestinian city for a few days.”Compared with the privations suffered by much of Gaza, the problem faced by Far may not sound overly harsh. But the separation threatening the family is symbolic of the plight of Gaza’s Christians, a community smaller, and arguably under greater pressure, than at any time in its history of at least 1,800 years.If he is allowed out to join his wife – who has a Christmas permit and has already left for the West Bank – Far will certainly return to his native Gaza, which, like most Palestinian Christians here, he has no desire to leave for good. He works for the Catholic NGO Caritas, coordinating its mobile clinics in Gaza, including one set up recently to treat those shot by Israeli troops while taking part in border protests against the Gaza blockade, which has cost the lives of 220 Palestinians since March.But three years ago his daughter Sally, 22, used her Christmas exit permit to marry a man from the West Bank and settle in Jenin, where Ibrahim and his older sister were born. Having been granted a Christmas exit permit last year, one of Far’s sons, Randy, 20, also left Gaza and is now living in Ramallah, where he works in a restaurant.Far acknowledged that his youngest son Ramzi, 17, may use the Christmas permit he has been granted to follow his brother. Already an expert player of the qanun, a musical instrument he has studied at Gaza’s Edward Said Conservatory, Ramzi is keen to advance his training.Another son, Rami, 25, is a business graduate with a place on a Christian community job-creation scheme, but with no prospect of a job after that would probably like to do the same if he had a permit, which like his father, he has not – so far – received this year. “You know Gaza,” said Far. “There are no opportunities the economy, safety and security, these are the things young people here worry about.” For Far, it presents a painful dilemma. “I don’t want my four children to be away from me. I want my sons around me. I can’t decide what to tell them. If I say go and it doesn’t work out, then it’s bad. But if I say stay and they have nothing, it’s also bad.”“We are Palestinians first and last,” said Christian activist George Anton. “We are totally suffering from the occupation.”Last month Gaza went to the brink of a fourth war when a botched Israeli intelligence operation was exposed near Khan Yunis, triggering a firefight that left an Israeli colonel and seven Palestinian militants, including a Hamas commander, dead. Hamas fired more than 300 rockets into Israel, while Israeli forces launched their fiercest bombardment of the Strip since 2014.Although the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, swiftly de-escalated the crisis by agreeing to an Egyptian-brokered deal, there is little sign as yet of a more formal ceasefire in return for significant steps to end the blockade.In one sense the Fars’ story is untypical. The large majority of Christians who travel to the holy sites in Jerusalem and Bethlehem return home each year. But the small minority who don’t are part of a much longer story, the shrinking of Gaza’s Christian community over many centuries.Today’s Greek Orthodox church in the Zeitoun district of Gaza City stands on the site from which its fourth-century patron saint began converting local inhabitants from paganism. By the sixth century most Gazans were Christian, following a long era, economically and culturally rich, under the Roman empire. In 570 an Italian pilgrim wrote: “Gaza is a lovely and renowned city, with most noble people distinguished by every kind of liberal accomplishment. They are welcoming to strangers.” (Palestinians in Gaza still are).But although Gazans switched rapidly to Islam after Arab victories in the seventh century, Christianity did not die out. There is archaeological evidence that what rapidly became a minority religion coexisted peacefully with the new Muslim one – as it still does today. But its shrinking has accelerated during the military turbulence of the past half-century.In the mid-1960s, before the six-day war and Gaza’s occupation by Israel, there were about 6,000 Christians in Gaza today there are an estimated 1,100. Samir Tarazi, 60, a member of one of Gaza’s largest Christian extended families, said: “Sometimes you wonder for how long there will still be a community here.”For now, however, it is very much alive. True, there hasn’t been a municipal Christmas tree in Gaza City’s Square of the Unknown Soldier since the beginning of the second intifada in 2000. But they are lit up in every Christian home, even the poorer ones.On Saturday night an elaborately decorated four-metre steel “tree” was unveiled at a celebration for 400 people at the YMCA, which has been at the heart of Gaza’s Christian community since 1954.In the city’s Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, the Gift Palace shop was packed with Chinese-made plastic trees, baubles, Santa hats, and even racy above-the-knee “Father Christmas” nightdresses, all of which appealed, said owner Abdulla Abdel Majd, to Muslims as well as Christians. Majd admitted “a few Sheikhs” had complained about the display, but he was doing a brisk trade, although down on last year.And Christian parents were busy preparing “Barbara”, the squishy cakes of nuts, cinnamon and aniseed that Arab Christians share with family, friends and neighbours between St Barbara’s Day on 4 December and Christmas – which, for the Orthodox, the large majority of Gaza’s Christians, is on 7 January.But religion is at the heart of the celebrations. Last Sunday’s sung mass at the Latin (Catholic) church incorporated the Christmas liturgy in honour of the Italian celebrant, Archbishop Pierbattista Pizzaballa, making his seasonal visit from Jerusalem. While acknowledging it might be a strange time to talk of “joy, hope and peace”, the archbishop told worshippers: “God is not just in heaven but among us. Our faith creates something that goes beyond human possibilities.”He had a point. The churches’ three private schools, whose fees range from $700-$900 a year, serve mostly Muslim pupils, and the Catholic Rosary Sisters provide the sole care for some of the most severely disabled children from across the Strip. A vocational centre run by a Christian Gazan, Iman Jelda, for the Near East Council of Churches serves 140 boys and young men aged 14 to 23, mainly from poor backgrounds, and all Muslims. In the cooling and air-conditioning department – where one trainee, Mohammed Satari, has a degree in accounting but thought he had a “better chance of a job here” – Jelda asked the group how many would like to leave Gaza. All put their hands up.The NECC vocational centre exemplifies the high level of integration Christians enjoy – for the most part – with the wider and overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim community. Not that their relations have always been trouble-free. In 2006, when the Danish publication of cartoons depicting Muhammad sparked outrage, the Latin church received a series of threatening – and unsigned – faxes. In October 2007, the Baptist manager of a Christian bookshop was murdered, apparently by Salafist extremists.After both incidents Hamas pledged to give its protection, and Bassem Naim, an international relations spokesman for the faction, insisted last week: “We are one family. The Christians are part of our society.” Senior Christians insist the relations with Hamas are ones of mutual respect.Christian women who dress less conservatively than many (although by means all) of their Muslim counterparts and never cover their hair, can be subject to limitations. Hijabs are compulsory, for example, at the Islamic University of Gaza (although not at Al-Azhar, which is favoured by many Christian students).Nor, acknowledged Anton, would government ministries “here in Gaza ever hire a lady with uncovered hair … This is our community and this is how the people think. We cannot ignore this.”Dana Tarazi, 25, admitted that, while she drew no complaints in the city centre, she usually got a private taxi to work rather than share with other passengers on a route that passes through more conservative areas.But like some other Christian young women she said that the atmosphere had become more liberal in the past few years. And the majority of friends at her secret Santa party this week would be Muslim.But permits to leave for Bethlehem and Jerusalem at Christmas remain a problem, partly because they ide families. Tarazi, who feared last week that her father, Daoud, would be the only member of her family to secure one, said: “Sometimes there are families where only the children get the permits, so they cannot go.”The Israeli military said it had granted 401 permits to adults and 219 to children under 16. But, perhaps ominously for Far, it warned that if those leaving did not return to Gaza it would “influence” the allocation of permits to their close family members.Archbishop Pizzaballa, when asked about the permits, said: “We shouldn’t have to ask for permission at all. It should be our right. The international community should be doing everything it can to change the humanitarian situation here, including the right of citizens to move.”Although data is hard to come by, many Christians tend to be among the less economically stricken of the broad mass of Gaza’s population, as well as having family and community networks which can welcome them abroad or in the West Bank if they leave.However, there are also poorer ones. Wadir Turk, 52, who is unemployed, and his Egyptian wife Intisar, 45, could hardly afford a Christmas tree this year for their three children on the 1,000 shekels (£210) a month Intisar earns at the Rosary Sisters’ disabled centre and meagre social security payments they receive from the Palestinian Authority.This has not stopped young Palestinian Christians having a positive outlook. Vivian Ayad, 22, insisted that, as long as her Muslim Palestinian friends could not travel in and out of Gaza, they would want to leave – but predicts that after 20 years or so they will ache to come back.While admitting she was “very worried” about the shrinking of Gaza’s Christian community, Ayad – recently married and now completing a five-year pharmacy course at Al-Azhar university – was determined to stay and find a job as a qualified pharmacist. It is a highly responsible job, because many drugs prescribed elsewhere are sold over the counter, especially for poorer customers who cannot afford doctors’ fees. “But I’m a little bit optimistic. I think I can do it,” she said.Dana Tarazi’s mother, Suzan, actually encouraged her two sons and elder daughter to leave – in their cases through Egypt. But she was clear that, if there was a just peace, an end to the Israeli blockade and a future for Gaza, “I will beg them to come back”.Gaza: Preparing for Dawn by Donald Macintyre is published by OneWorld (£10.99).

My Nokia 3210, unveiled the previous year, was state of the art. Competitively priced, lightweight (we thought) … there were even different coloured covers!Fast-forward 18 years and my daughter Alice – 12, new to phone ownership and not easily impressed – is examining this piece of communication history. In her first year of secondary school, with her interests and independence growing fast, Alice uses a smartphone to communicate with friends, organise activities, listen to music and take photos, as well as to contact and be contacted by us.In recent years, parents of communication-hungry tweens faced a predicament: offer their child a smartphone with unfettered access to the world wide web (and everything that comes with it) or pick up an older phone, with limitations imposed by more primitive technology. Now, thankfully, there’s a third way.Alice will be comparing the Nokia with the Verve IMO S2 with monqi – a new phone exclusive to Tesco Mobile, and designed specifically for children and young teenagers easing into mobile technology. How will it and the classic Nokia shape up in her fickle fingers?First up, the Nokia 3210.“It’s really heavy,” she exclaims. “The screen is tiny. It looks old.” She is examining the handset with the sort of sceptical curiosity she might extend towards a fax machine, or acarrier pigeon.“I guess you could call people and text them,” shesays. “Very slowly,” she adds, noticing the three-letters-per-key setup. No emojis. That’s not good. Her face briefly brightens as she spots the hash key. “Wait. What did you actually use that for back then?”The lack of a camera bothers her even more than the no internet access, presumably because the latter is available via our home computer. Not being able to listen to music is another shortcoming.With her reaction so far fairly scathing, it is time to reveal the phone’s killer feature: Snake! This, initially at least, is a hit. “That’s quite good!” she decides, setting about the game. Her initial enthusiasm proves short-lived. “Actually, it’s pretty boring.”Asked when the phone might have been designed, Alice hazards a guess at 1990. At almost triple her lifetime ago, that is ancient history for her.Does the 3210 have “old skool” appeal perhaps? “No,” she says firmly. “Retro is good in clothes, but not in phones.”Case closed. On to the IMO S2 with monqiThis, it would seem, is more like it. “It looks nice. It feels smooth to hold and use and it has a good-size screen – not too big or too small,” says Alice, back in her comfort zone.First of all she checks out the photo options, pulling a series of silly selfie faces. There are two cameras, I tell her, peering at the manual. “Of course there are, front and back,” she says, raising an eyebrow at my ignorance.“It’s really easy to work out,” she says, connecting to the wifi and starting to browse the website of a clothing brand she covets. As well as online window shopping, Alice uses her phone to watch clips from favourite films and musicals, to research and help with homework (foreign language dictionaries for example), and to stream music and contact friends via – parent approved – social media.She makes the odd phone call too, mainly to me, often to ask if she can go to a friend’s, and frequently followed by a call to request a lift home.Taking photos is a favourite pastime, and Alice likes the editing features on the IMO S2. She quickly starts to play around with tints and effects, writing captions and adding characters to her pictures.Intrinsic to the IMO S2 is the monqi operating system, which enables parents – having installed the parent app on their own phones – to monitor and shape how the child’s phone is used.Functions include: setting time limits on usage (remote shut down at homework or dinner time, for instance), blocking unsuitable internet content (monqi’s bespoke browser has built-in filters), monitoring internet and phone usage in real time, and checking on whereabouts. There is also a family chat option – a controlled alternative to third-party messenger apps.“Parental controls are a good idea, especially for younger children when you definitely want to know they are only seeing appropriate things,” says Alice, as she scrolls through the monqi functions.She admits that time limits make sense too. “Especially at first it’s good to make sure it isn’t being used all the time. I do lots of other activities, which keep me busy, but it can sometimes be tempting to have my phone on too long, especially if lots of group conversations are going on.”Having a smartphone has been helpful for settling into secondary school, she says – facilitating new friendships and enabling her to keep in touch with old classmates too.“A smartphone makes it easy to swap numbers and send a message or join a chat with your school friends,” says Alice. “With an old-style phone you would have to call someone direct, and that would feel more daunting,” she adds.The monqi system ensures this is all done safely new contacts are approved through the parent app, so mums and dads get a chance to check they are legitimate and appropriate.The IMO S2 meets with Alice’s approval. “Your parents look after you, and this setup is another way of them doing that. I’d be very happy to have this phone,” she says.Although used to tales of her parents’ seemingly prehistoric analogue childhoods, her foray into early mobile phones has given her a new sense of how technology has changed. “It has made me really appreciate how much we can do now.”Not having today’s smartphone technology would make her life more complicated, she says. “I think we are very lucky today. Maybe those early phones were ok for someone older,” she says in a placatory tone, looking straight at me.I think we have a winner.Visit Tesco Mobile to find out more about the IMO S2 with monqi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0896450882ebe852943fe6091e587c189199152/0_72_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47fc95829c1d7604f2df0a51ea6be8b2","title":"i feel more independent one 11 year old on her first year with a phone","story":"Amelia, aged 11, from Bristol shares her experiences of phone ownership – from the ‘contract’ she signed with her parents to getting lost on the way to schoolI finally got a phone last September, just as I started secondary school. I was one of the last people in my class to get one and it felt like I’d been waiting forever. Most of the others had one in year 6. My parents said I didn’t need one, as I was only walking down the road to school. But I think it would have made sense.Negotiating a contractWe talked a lot before the phone arrived. Mostly about when and where I could use it. But I was happy I was allowed a smartphone! I know one girl who just has this old-looking one. My parents and I decided we’d come up with a kind of contract between us. This is what we agreed:I was mostly OK with the rules. But not the social media one, as loads of my friends have Instagram! It was an improvement on the first version, though. That one said I was only allowed my phone downstairs!Coping with peer pressureThe phone has changed my life. These changes are mostly good, but I do feel that some bits have not gone quite as well. You feel like you can never make a mistake in a message.One of the better things is I feel more independent. I can plan when to see friends without asking my parents. If I walk 40 minutes to school the phone makes me feel safe. When I first started the walk, I took a wrong turning and ended up lost in the docks. All I could see was boats! Thankfully, I could call my dad. He helped me.But I sometimes feel my parents get cross with me more often now. The other day I was on my phone messaging and my mum started getting annoyed. She told me it was unhealthy to spend so much time looking at a screen, and I should “interact more with the real world”. I got angry and shouted back.Getting used to phone lifeAt first I thought it was a bit weird that my parents could look at my phone whenever. But I don’t really care or notice now. I don’t go online much. I mainly use my phone to chat or play games. I use the computer in the kitchen for the internet.Sometimes my phone distracts me. If I’m in the middle of a conversation and I get a message, I’ll turn to my phone instead. And if I hear a notification, I’ll rush to check my phone.But I’d never be without my phone now.Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9ebdfd732764928a71b7c35bef8b8818823df55/0_19_1714_1028/master/1714.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8ab69a94870b46e156bb355d81f43a7","title":"quiz litty shook or goat can you talk tween","story":"Finstagram, spilling tea and looking snatched.

I come from Wales, you do. I’m not posh, I happen to have been a broadcaster for a long time.”“You had a very distinguished father,” Humphrys retorted, referring to Richard Dimbleby OBE MBE, a leading news commentator for the BBC during the 1950s.“Well, that doesn’t make me posh, I had a distinguished father, that’s a ridiculous question,” Dimbleby said. “No, but the point is about the monarchy. I’m not close to the monarchy, I’ve met the Queen probably less often than you. I’ve met her once, I think. I have no connection at all.”“I don’t know why I made that assumption,” Humphrys said, before going on to question Dimbleby on what he thought about the monarchy.Asked what question he would ask himself in an interview, Dimbleby said: “Ever think of stopping? And I’d say ‘no, I just love asking questions, I’m not sure I like answering them.’”Humphrys thanked Dimbleby for guest-editing the Today programme, and noted that he is “positively not posh”.Many listeners were not so convinced. Online responses to the encounter have focused on the differences between the two BBC veterans’ backgrounds and education. Can a former public school boy who studied at Christ Church Oxford, sent a son to Eton, and is married to the granddaughter of an earl really argue he is not among the nation’s social elite?Even Spectator magazine acknowledged that the guest editor was on shaky ground. “Dimbleby is leading the way when it comes to traditional posh credentials at least,” he said. Listener @lucycthomas called for a rematch:It is true that Dimbleby and Humphrys both have Welsh mothers and began their careers as reporters, but there are few other similarities. To the average audience member, however, they may well both qualify as posh, given they have high salaries and speak with the “received pronunciation” favoured for BBC staffers until recent decades.Humphrys, one of five children, was born to a hairdresser and a self-employed French polisher in Adamsdown, Cardiff. When he passed the 11-plus exam he went on to Cardiff high school, then a grammar. Dimbleby, the elder brother of the Any Questions? radio presenter Jonathan Dimbleby, was born in Surrey to the leading BBC correspondent and presenter Richard Dimbleby. After prep school in Sussex, he went to Charterhouse school in Surrey. He read philosophy, politics and economics at Christ Church, Oxford, where he led the college’s student body, edited the student magazine Isis and was a member of the infamous all-male dining and drinking society, the Bullingdon Club. He graduated with a third-class honours degree.His son Henry Dimbleby, a co-founder of the food chain Leon, was revealed by Jacob Rees-Mogg on a Question Time of 2015 to have been his contemporary at Eton.Dimbleby, who was married to the cookery writer Josceline for 33 years, has been married since 2000 to Belinda Giles, the daughter of the former Sunday Times editor Frank, and granddaughter of the 9th earl of De La Warr. He chaired his last Question Time earlier this month and will be replaced by the BBC newsreader and Antiques Roadshow host Fiona Bruce next month.He still enjoys the political cut and thrust, though. A key element of the Today programme he edited was an interview with the editor of the Evening Standard, George Osborne.After questioning the former chancellor about Brexit, he asked the architect of Tory austerity if he felt homeless “deaths in doorways” were “a direct result of the austerity that you imposed”, which Osborne denied.He then asked Osborne to agree that his career after parliament had capitalised on his previous government position by “taking job after job after job and earning millions of pounds a year”.“You became prominent as chancellor and you now swan around the world making speeches and work for Blackrock, and earn several hundred thousand a year from them. It is as though, somehow, the business of going into politics, which you abandoned when it turned against you, was actually a pathway into what you are doing now, making a buck for yourself.”Osborne replied that he would not be editing a newspaper if he was prioritising his income. Dimbleby also revealed his previous attempts to assume high positions at the national broadcaster during the interview. “I twice tried to become director-general and I once tried to become chairman,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d445b90ee5aa17950e85fc83cb85875a0a0bfdb1/0_120_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73463175b419a179afaa6c5aaffea5d6","title":"tell us what was your album of 2018","story":"We will publish a selection of readers’ favourite albums before the end of the yearAfter canvassing over 50 of our music writers and totting up their votes, we’ve announced our 50 best albums of the year, topped by Christine and the Queens’ sensual neo-boogie classic Chris.But a list of 50 –\u0026nbspand you can see the whole thing here – inevitably misses out out dozens of brilliant albums, so we’d love to hear from you about the recordings you think were unfairly overlooked by our vote.

It was Christmas morning. I had just gone through a orce. I was separated from my children, all alone in a hotel, feeling low. In my room, I started to hear music and thought I had left the TV on, but I checked and it was off. It got louder, and I realised it was coming from the hallway, so I opened my door and there was a choir, singing On a Clear Day (You Can See Forever). Duke Ellington was doing one of his sacred concerts at the Presbyterian Church nearby, on Fifth Avenue, had heard I was down, and sent over his choir to cheer me up. It was the most beautiful gift I have ever received.I grew up in the Depression, so the focus was more on family and being together than about gifts piled under the tree. Food was a big part too.I love the way the streets of Manhattan transform at Christmas, how all the shop windows set up their elaborate holiday scenes. I am a painter, too, and have done many winter scenes from my studio window while the snow is coming down. One of my favourites, of Radio City Music Hall in a snowstorm, I chose for my holiday card for the American Cancer Society this year. The money raised goes towards cancer research. I’ve been doing them for 25 years.Why have I made so many Christmas albums? My premise as a performer has always been to make people feel good and holiday songs are like old friends: you may not have heard them in a while, but whenever you do they bring back good memories. They make you feel happy.1. Nat King Cole The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire)Probably my favourite song and no one sang it better than Nat King Cole. I sang it with Diana Krall on TV to celebrate the lighting of the Rockefeller Center tree this year. When Diana sang the line: “To kids from one to 92” in rehearsal, she laughed then hugged me, and I wasn’t sure why. Then she said: “But Tony, you are 92!” I couldn’t believe I finally got a chance to perform that lyric at that age.2. Bing Crosby White ChristmasStill the bestselling single record of all time, by the ultimate master songwriter, Irving Berlin.3. Judy Garland Have Yourself a Merry Little ChristmasHer performance of this song in Meet Me In St Louis is pure magic.4. Tony Tamburello Christmas in Herald SquareA lesser-known holiday song, written by a long-time friend.5. Bing Crosby I’ll Be Home for ChristmasWritten in the 1940s, when it had special meaning, since it’s about a soldier promising to get home in time for the holidays.7. Tony Bennett SnowfallI also love this from the same album: an evocative song that captures the insular feeling you get when you are walking in nature, the snow is falling, and everything gets very quiet and serene.8. Julie Andrews My Favourite ThingsNot typically a holiday song, but I like its positive message… a song to celebrate the season.10. Billie Holiday I’ve Got My Love to Keep Me WarmOne of my favourites to sing at this time of year. I loved Mildred Bailey’s 1937 version too, but nothing can top Billie Holiday’s.Former carol-singing teenage busker, Christmas music aficionado and ex-Pulp frontmanMusic is the best part of Christmas to me, that and twinkling lights. I enjoy finding new Christmas songs. Perhaps it’s because when I was a kid, having Christmas at my grandparents with my mum, they only had two Christmas records. One was called Christmas With the Stars, on Pickwick, which had Max Bygraves and Des O’Connor on it. The other was the Tijuana Brass Christmas album. We played them one after the other all day, so I heard them hundreds of times. Still, I love the familiarity of them.I’ve always wanted to write a Christmas song but never managed it. I loved singing carols at school and always wanted to capture that sort of magic in a song. The closest I got was with Pulp doing a song called Snow in the early 80s, but it was pretty depressing and we never recorded it. So to make up for it I’ve picked 11 Christmas songs, although one’s a 40-second jingle, really. Is that all right?1. Choir of King’s College, Cambridge The Rocking CarolWe did this all the time at school – it reminds me of being little.2. Des O’Connor Yes, There Is a Santa ClausOn my grandparents’ aforementioned Christmas With the Stars album. It features Des convincing a child that Santa exists. And yes, it’s just as bizarre as you’d imagine.3. The Joy Strings O Little Town of BethlehemO Little Town of Bethlehem sung to the tune of the Animals’ House of the Rising Sun – and it works!4. The Radiophonic Workshop Christmas CommercialForty seconds of a cash register singing Jingle Bells which I DJ’d before a Soulwax show last Christmas. Everyone sang along.5. JD Twitch Psylent NightAn ambient Christmassy thing full of atmosphere that came out as a single a few years ago.6. Yoko Ono Listen, The Snow Is FallingThis is a really nice song full of wintry sound effects.7. Beach Boys Morning Christmas (Holy Evening)A really mournful, melancholy one, because that’s what Christmas can be. I mean, even the Christmas story is pretty melancholy – you know where Jesus’s story ends up.8. Rotary Connection Shopping Bag MenagerieAn anti-commercial, psychedelic soul Christmas single. It’s all about people working hard the whole year to buy presents, then their family members going off them in about 20 minutes.9. Velvet Underground JesusSuch a lovely, soft song, all about Jesus getting born.10. Josh T Pearson Sweetheart, I Ain’t Your ChristNot the most romantic song ever, but it mentions Christmas at one point, and lots of relationships get strained at Christmas, or get together at Christmas parties, don’t they?11. Kate Bush Among AngelsLong and spacious and perfect. Takes all your stresses away after Christmas shopping.Saint Etienne singer, celebrating 25 years of their indie festive favourite, I Was Born on Christmas DayI love Christmas, always have done. We used to have raucous ones when I was young. I’m an only child, always surrounded by adults singing and dancing my dad was a director, my mum an actress and they’d bring in all these waifs and strays for the day. There would always be music on: the Beatles, T Rex, the Carpenters, the Stones. On Boxing Day morning, I’d be tiptoeing around empty bottles, full ashtrays and sleeping adults. Not that it’s done me any harm!We still have busy Christmases now – I’ve got a potential 15 guests this year. My sisters-in-law are bringing turkey wrapped in foil and I’m mainly doing things like roast potatoes and pigs in blankets, thank goodness. Christmas is a bit like childbirth – you always go: “I’m never doing this again” but a while later, you just remember the good bits. Saying that, my sons are 16 and 14 now and they’ll be subjected to mum dragging out the board games as usual.1. The Kinks Father ChristmasA hysterical, really new-wave, 1980s Kinks song with a message, telling you to remember “the kids without toys when you’re drinking your wine”.2. Sufjan Stevens Coventry CarolAll Sufjan’s Christmas albums are gorgeous, but this song is especially beautiful.3. Vashti Bunyan Coldest Night of the YearDrifty, slow and wintry, but a little bit saucy as well.4. Elvis Presley Blue ChristmasBecause of the slinky ooooohs!6. The Rolling Stones WinterI love Mick singing: “Yeah, and I wanna wrap my coat around you.” I bet he said that to all the girls!8. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band Santa Claus Is Coming to TownBruce makes the imagery in the song so urgent. I don’t trust anyone who doesn’t love Bruce.9. Beach Boys Little Saint NickAlways gives me a proper shiver.10. Brenda Lee Marshmallow WorldA Christmas without the Phil Spector Christmas album isn’t really Christmas at all.Rising, Christmas-loving R\u0026ampB star, heiress to the pop throne of mum Neneh CherryChristmas – the whole of December, to be honest – is a special, full-on time for my family. My mum’s half Swedish, so we’ve got to do the Swedish Christmas traditions before anything else. That means meeting every Sunday of Advent, lighting a candle, and then their Christmas is actually on Christmas Eve. We have the full works – meatballs, smoked salmon, cabbage and this Swedish soft drink that’s like a weird Coca-Cola. Mum always gets us Christmas pyjamas, which we have to put on. The next morning, it’s British Christmas: more presents, a full house, my mum doing 300 different meals for people who are vegan and gluten-free, plus does amazing roast potatoes. A total legend. She’s got it all on lock.Christmas music is really important in all that. We’re not all standing around the Christmas tree singing or anything, but every year, we play the same albums. Most are classics from the 60s or 70s – it’s like they’ve been with us always, like family. They get played over and over. It’s like a really comforting ritual, reminding us where we are and who we’re with. Christmas is about those memories you have together, isn’t it? They make everything warm.1. Nat King Cole Deck the HallsHis voice is the sound of Christmas for me.2. Jackson 5 I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa ClausI’ve loved this since I was a kid. Michael Jackson at that age is just magical.3. Mariah Carey All I Want for Christmas Is YouThe ultimate Christmas pop song, so well written and put together.5. Destiny’s Child 8 Days of ChristmasI’m a huge fan of R\u0026ampB, so this is a no-brainer.6. Bobby Helms Jingle Bell RockThis always reminds me of the Christmas scene in Mean Girls, which Ariana Grande reinterpreted recently in her video to Thank U, Next.7. Gregory Porter The Christmas Song (live)His voice is so, so timeless.8. Boyz II Men \u0026amp Brian McKnight Let it SnowAnother total R\u0026ampB classic.9. Paul McCartney Wonderful ChristmastimeWhat’s there not to like about this?10. Wham! Last ChristmasNo Christmas top 10 is complete without this banger.US singer-songwriter lover of classic pop and recent Christmas convertI hated Christmas in my 20s. I was single and had just moved to Nashville, where I’d be asked to do these Christmas compilation albums. I’d always write something about being alone or feeling like a weirdo. I remember people in the studio watching me record them and going: “Er, right!” But my family were spread apart, so I felt totally disconnected. And it’s a reflective time – it’s the end of the year and you’re thinking about what you’ve done and what’s to come. That can be tough.But things began changing when I started going to friends for Christmas instead. My parents were into Christmas when I was a kid and it’s still great to see them, but they’re happy for it to be all done in an hour now and then us go and have fun. Anyway, December starts for me with Hanukah now, because my fiance is Jewish. I love the simplicity of it: eight nights, eight candles lit, eight presents. There are practical gifts – socks and pants, things I actually like! Last year, he got me the Boyz II Men Christmas piano book and we spent the whole night playing songs from it. His family go full-on for Christmas, too, playing the Beatles’ Christmas flexi-disc records, plus their tree is always massive. That was a shock.1. Diana Ross This ChristmasStarts slow, picks up and has the best melody ever.2. Barbra Streisand Jingle Bells?A speedy version in a crazy time signature – completely insane.3. Booker T \u0026amp the MGs We Wish You a Merry Christmas Funky instrumental music. I put this on while getting ready.4. Ramsey Lewis Trio Here Comes Santa ClausChristmas jazz piano always works. For me it’s this or Charlie Brown’s Christmas Album.5. James Brown Merry Christmas BabyBecause I love hearing James Brown singing in a jazz style.6. DRAM Silver BellsA hip-hop artist doing a great Christmas duet. With his mom!7. Sharon Jones \u0026amp the Dap-Kings Eight Days (of Hanukah)There aren’t many Hanukah songs, but Sharon Jones wrote a great one.8. Les Paul and Mary Ford White Christmas Duets always get you into the Christmas spirit. 9. The Beach Boys Christmas DayA favourite from my childhood.10. Jimmy Smith and Wes Montgomery Baby It’s Cold Outside More jazz! It really shines at Christmas and the sleigh bells help.Bearded north pole-dweller, master Christmas crooner and slightly Scrooge-like synthesiser fanChristmas is disgusting. Nauseating. It’s all about eating too much, horrible consumerism and death. Still, I enjoy it these days. I go back to my sister’s in Denver, on Christmas Eve, to this little place in the countryside, with this really Christmassy vibe – it reminds me what Christmases used to be like when I was young.They were idyllic. All the excitement going to the basement to get the decorations for the tree. Putting this light-up snowman outside on the porch, with icicles 6ft long hanging above it. My mom was the kind of mom who’d make sticky buns from scratch on Christmas morning, and she’d have canned vegetables for the day months before, so we’d have fresh green beans with our gammon. She died just before Christmas in 1995, but it’s nice that Christmas Eves now have the joy that we had as kids. Christmas Day? That’s at my brother’s with his kids, who are becoming teenagers, tearing open gifts. Much too hectic. Give me peace and some butterscotch pie.Christmas music for me, at its best, comes from the 1960s and 70s when people were still discovering sound, all curious about what was possible to do with it. I hear something like Mariah Carey and something just dies inside of me. We live in such a weird world now with so much of everything, where satellite channels play Christmas music every day, but to me, Christmas is best simple. It’s about adults singing in harmony and older, classic tunes. It’s also people you love getting together and about creating new traditions with family and friends.As for Christmas music – I’m going to do a Christmas album one day and Richard Hawley’s going to be on it. He is! And I’ve picked 12 songs. Sorry. Merry Christmas!1. Esquivel Jingle BellsThe kookiest, weirdest version I’ve ever heard, for a space-age bachelor pad, as they say in the lyrics. It makes me very happy.4. Oscar Peterson What Child Is This?Pure taste. Plus it’s meandering and melancholy, which is what Christmas is.5. Lou Rawls My Christmas, BabyThis is sexy Christmas. This is not for the family.6. Jimmy Smith White ChristmasSixties jazz-organ joy, starting off all slow, before the horns blow up.7. The Moog Machine O Little Town of BethlehemI mean, O Little Town of Bethlehem done on a Moog. What else do you want?8. Joel Paterson Have Yourself a Merry Little ChristmasThis is on an album from last year (Hi-Fi Christmas Guitar) that looks and sounds like it came out in 1961. Imagine if Twin Peaks did Christmas songs. This is it.9. Vince Guaraldi Trio Christmas Time Is Here (vocal version)I’ve been listening to this since I was a child and it never gets old.10. Tammy Wynette Away in a MangerShe looks like Mother Mary on the album cover, but you know she’s got a flask of whisky somewhere.11. Jackie Gleason and his Orchestra Christmas MoonMy Christmas anxiety destroyer, taking me away on soaring, velvety strings.12. Johnny Mathis Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire)I mean, Jeez. Perfect. What Christmas should be.Listen to all the artists’ choices above in the Observer New Review’s mega Christmas playlist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa8cfdbfbdf24b86b8f4a16b3b97259ae42bba65/17_167_2320_1391/master/2320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=189c5ee8a13b137eb967f1688c5da419","title":"frankie boyle review 2018 forget brexit","story":"It’s been tough to find much to laugh about this year. But Britain’s most savage satirist is going to give it a go...Consider the plight of the satirist. I know you’ve got your own plight, and there are only so many plights that you can consider at any one time, and that the plight of the satirist might even seem to you to be one of the easier plights. A satirist, you imagine, is having a pretty heavy week if they do more than pop up on The News Quiz to say that every MP in the DUP looks like a committee member of a bowling club who’s just seen a visitor enter the bar wearing jeans. And now that you put it like that, yes, you’re right, it’s not much of a plight at all, really.The plight of the satirist, such as it is, is a compulsion to look at the grimmest, most important thing they can think of, and then for reasons that probably wouldn’t survive a really good therapist, try to make it funny. To try to address the iniquities of their society, the satirist must manufacture some hope that what they’re doing might make a difference, then type it all up and send it off somewhere before they remember that it never does. Looking back over the events of this year is a bit like holding a doll for a therapist and pointing to where the bad man hurt you. Among the lowlights were:1 Theresa May dancing on stage at the Conservative Party conference (choreographer Ray Harryhausen), looking like an uncloaked Dementor on a hen weekend.2 A group of deranged kippers burning a cardboard effigy of Grenfell tower. They were later quizzed by police, and Kensington and Chelsea council, who asked them to quote for some public housing projects. 3 A senate grilling of Mark Zuckerberg, who gave the general impression of a Batman villain whose backstory is being given puberty-delaying drugs by a paedophile, and who seemed visibly relieved to be questioned on privacy concerns rather than Facebook’s monopoly power.4 The continuing media fascination with Jacob Rees-Mogg, a man who has all the authenticity of a character at a murder-mystery weekend.5 Philip Hammond delivering a budget speech so dry it was sponsored by Vagisil, making watching for 75 minutes feel like a gateway drug for necrophilia.6 The hilarious emergence of the phrase “rules-based international order”, which I like to imagine pronounced with the jaded, lisping irony of Gore Vidal, drunk on his deathbed.7 The Palestinian right-of-return marches that demonstrated the old Israeli proverb, you can’t make an omelette without shooting protesters. Trump said the US was “fully committed to facilitating a lasting peace agreement”. The lasting peace that will come about once Israel has shot all the Palestinians.Beyond that, the year broke down into four seemingly unending and increasingly apocalyptic chapters.Domestically, the year was dominated by the Conservative party successfully externalising its bitter isions on trade. They have never, in their whole history, not been fighting about trade: trade laws are to the Tory party what ownership of the Queen Vic is to EastEnders.Theresa May was always only a placeholder prime minister, something that would appear to make about as much sense as using a slice of Victoria sponge as a bookmark. At the time of going to press, she had survived a vote of no confidence from Tory MPs, and there was the general impression that European leaders had agreed to end freedom of movement just to stop her from visiting them. Throughout the year, Boris Johnson has maintained that dishevelled, confused look of the people at the end of a disaster movie being ferried to the ambulances. He resigned as foreign secretary in July, barking “Chequers is dead” as if he were in an Agatha Christie novel and had just discovered the body of the butler at the bottom of the stairs. Johnson has promised a bonfire of EU regulations, a teetering one, without fencing and namby-pamby safety glasses, so that we can wipe the drifting cinders from our newly liberated eyes screaming, “Fuck you, Brussels! Maybe I want to be blind!” I look forward to a UK without EU red tape, and vegans weeping in supermarkets that resemble a cross between a botanical freak show and a fruit-and-veg hospice.I say, let’s forget the worries of Brexit for a week or two, and just enjoy our last Christmas with running water. Brexit has many downsides, but I think it will be nice for the Irish to watch a British famine. Personally I look forward to a new age where the London Christmas lights won’t be turned on by vacuous celebrities, but by someone found guilty of “talking foreign” and sentenced to complete the circuit. A time where we no longer guess the fluctuations of the market, but our high priests stare into polished heads, newly bald from radiation sickness, and interpret the patterns cast by the light of flickering sewer-fat candles.Paradoxically, I think Brexit will actually lead to less nationalism: economic collapse meaning that borders lose all their current toxicity, as they’re constantly redrawn in a never-ending struggle between regional warlords, antibiotic-resistant microbes and organ-harvesting cyborgs. Our children will have less inclination to dwell on skin colour as they’ll be preoccupied with appeasing the whims of some pitiless, scab-encrusted Cyclops waving a horse’s hoof nailed to a broomstick, roaring for fresh meat as he plays his three-note national anthem on a ribcage xylophone.It is at times like those that we will remember the work of Dominic Raab, who resigned in November, having decided that he could not endorse a deal that he himself had negotiated. Raab didn’t want to be Brexit secretary, but he didn’t have the negotiating skills to decline the job. When Raab took over, I was heartened by the thought that negotiations were being handled by someone with the air of an embattled leisure centre manager, who could be outmanoeuvred by a statue of Stephen Hawking. Surely better withdrawal terms have been negotiated during prison sex. Much of the Brexit discourse has revolved around people who seem inbred telling us that ersity is bad, but there don’t seem to be any easy solutions. In a way, I envy the touching optimism of people who feel that another referendum might clear up all this bad feeling once and for all.The Labour party somehow managed to achieve a Brexit position more incoherent than a government of opportunists at war with itself. There is definitely something odd about Labour supporting free movement for goods and not, well, labour. Meanwhile, May tried to attack Jeremy Corbyn’s handling of antisemitism while in the middle of the Windrush scandal, which was like Pol Pot complaining about gender balance in the films of Martin Scorsese. Corbyn has mastered a lot of things, but strangely not saying shit just to get elected. Mate, say some shit just to get elected: it’s really your only job right now. This needs to go to the top of your to-do list, not somewhere down below “fix the spare room door”.And yet, he has undoubtedly been travestied by a press who must somehow contrive to terrify Middle England with a man who looks as if he celebrates New Year’s Eve by edging the lawn. Corbyn was attacked in August after the Daily Mail printed pictures of him laying a wreath for some Palestinian martyrs. Corbyn argued that, just because he was near the graves of terrorists, didn’t mean he was honouring terrorists. Personally, I’m surprised our politicians find the time to lay so many wreaths when not one of them has poured liquor on the ground for Tupac.Perhaps some idea of how Britain intends to deal with the post-Brexit world is encapsulated in the Dickensian figure of the secretary of state for international trade, Dr Liam Fox, a man for whom Another Day, Another Dollar means the proposed minimum wage in our trade agreement with the US. You might wonder how a former doctor can cheerfully promote arms sales. Luckily, Liam’s brain has plenty of experience hosting seemingly irreconcilable contradictions: such as believing we should all stand on our own two feet, while claiming expenses of three pence for a 100-metre car journey in 2012. Liam Fox manages to be a grotesque moral nihilist and yet, somehow, not even the worst Dr Fox. Like me, he was raised on an Irish Catholic council estate in Scotland. It’s these sliding-doors moments where I have to thank alcoholism for denying me the focus to become a genocidal sociopath.Yet perhaps the clearest signpost to post-Brexit Britain this year lay in Boris Johnson, and later Prince Andrew, advocating the procurement of a new Royal Yacht. Andrew said that, for British exports, it would be a tool in the bag – despite having never used a tool, or carried a bag. There is no doubt that having Prince Andrew on such a boat could boost Britain’s reputation, provided it never docks.Of course it’s hardly the first ship the royals have had: that burned up entering the atmosphere after their journey here from their home planet, Azeroth 9. But how do you respond to the monarchy asking for a £100m boat? The history of European royalty suggests they’re going to be well ahead of any suggestion to “go fuck themselves”. On balance, I say stick with the royal train: we can always add an international dimension just by extending the tracks into the sea.The murder of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi Arabia is another very difficult subject to find the lighter side of, unless someone in the Ecuadorean embassy has clipped the story out and stuck it to the fridge. The 15 Saudi suspects have been banned from entering the UK, which is a shame as the people this hurts the most are the box office staff at Salisbury Cathedral. Turkey wants the murderers tried there, possibly because sticking journalist killers into a Turkish jail will really tidy up the lifers’ wing.You can imagine that this is all quite surreal for the Saudis they behead people in public, and starve the children of Yemen. The idea that they would be lambasted for killing a fully grown man in private with no witnesses must seem ridiculous it would be as if I had got into trouble for saying someone looked like a spoon.The murder was such a calamitous fuck-up from start to finish, I like to think that it’s got David Davis’s fingerprints all over it. Considering the version of events that the Saudis were willing to push, I’d love to see the ones they rejected. “We regret to inform you that Mr Khashoggi perished while attempting to rape an outboard motor.” They killed Khashoggi with a bone saw. No wonder they need to buy arms: their own weaponry seems to be sourced from the Whoops! shelf at Homebase.We apparently “share values” with the Saudis. After they behead someone (48 in the first four months of the year), they sometimes crucify the body in the public square for three days. Watching a horror movie in Saudi Arabia must have all the adrenaline buzz of a local council meeting. I’m guessing the most horrifying film you could screen there would be a remake of The Dukes of Hazzard where Daisy Duke drives her own car.Our government was angry about Khashoggi and sent the Saudis a strongly worded arms invoice. Perhaps it’s unfair to expect Britain to criticise the Saudis. Can we be expected to take the moral high ground when it comes to royal families sanctioning murder? Sadly, the only long-term consequences of Khashoggi being killed will be that, in future, when a Saudi diplomat orders a pizza, the Deliveroo rider will kick it the last few feet to the front door. Despite the long-running, disgraceful and illegal war in Yemen, there is no sign from Britain of a moratorium on weapons sales. So Britain, an international arms dealer, censuring someone for using its products would be as hypocritical as that bit when Willy Wonka rolls his eyes at Augustus Gloop.Saudi’s war in Yemen struggles to get much coverage here, despite the significant role Britain plays sometimes it seems that only journalists getting killed will engage the British press. In the US, the worst person you can kill would be a cop in China, a government official and in the UK, woe betide you if you touch anyone who’s mastered Pitman shorthand.Perhaps the saddest part of this whole business is knowing that there are so few British journalists committed enough to get murdered: you could silence most just by breaking the fingers they use to do select all, copy, paste. Nobody’s going to flay you to death just for barking offers of money through the letterboxes of recently bereaved parents, or trawling for offensive tweets with your free hand. Of course, there are a lot of good journalists. Perhaps journalist is now just too broad a term, in much the way the word actor encompasses everyone from Meryl Streep to Sooty.There’s no point asking how UK arms dealers sleep at night after watching footage from Yemen, as they’ll reply, “Very well: in fact my erection even stops me rolling out of bed.” Yet shouldn’t we, as a society, demand better? If we can set aside the moral element here (and I don’t know that we can, but just as an exercise in trying to recognise the sheer breadth of our current futility, it might prove useful), Britain sees its interests as almost synonymous with an industry that isn’t labour intensive, or environmentally sustainable, and that seems to be riddled with corruption, because it reminds us of what it was like to be powerful.Of course Donald Trump trundled out in front of the cameras like a corpse on a Segway and announced: “We are with Saudi Arabia, we are staying with Saudi Arabia.” I honestly think that the Republican establishment is just coming to terms with how useful Trump is – realising that this troll-doll King Lear, who looks like something you’d pick off a baking tray after cooking pizza above it, can say the things that they themselves would like, or find useful to say, but can’t because of some vestigial attachment to decency. The Republicans’ current attitude to Trump is of turning a blind eye to your racist builder because you just need to get the conservatory finished.Trump has not refashioned the GOP in his own image. He has achieved something more significant: he has managed to maintain a semantic distance from the Republican party despite cheerfully delivering its agenda. Meanwhile, the Democratic establishment has chosen to mirror his attachment to nepotism, entitlement and conspiracy theory – not that the conspiracy theory is necessarily invalid. Trump might, I suppose, be a Russian spy: it would certainly explain why he can’t speak English. It’s not that he’s normalising his own behaviour it’s that, by comparison, he’s normalising that of dreadful people everywhere. Jared Kushner, a bloodless, lipless demon, a dependent clause of the Anti-Life Equation who could be thrown into any Edgar Allan Poe adaptation and trusted to improvise, looks merely emo in comparison.The racial animus that Trump has cynically aggravated saw his supporters protesting Nike’s Colin Kaepernick advert in September. The Nike swoosh is now the sound their products make when they go on fire. One patriot filmed himself destroying his Nike clothing by cutting off the top couple of inches from his socks. Instead of destroying the clothing, he’s created an additional, free set of Nike sweatbands.What does it say about our times that we’re expected to look for moral guidance to corporations like Nike, whose brand message of “Just do it” started out as a looped PA announcement in their Vietnamese trainer factory. I’ve always been wary of Nike – I think because their single tick logo is so reminiscent of the one used in my youth for Bob a Job: just a glimpse of a trainer and I’m back in short trousers, fibre-glassing that pensioner’s loft for a shiny 50 pence piece. (If you’re interested it was 10p for the insulating, 40p for wearing the shorts.)Despite Trump’s rage, the taking-a-knee protests have continued. It’s odd, in most cultures going down on a knee is considered respectful: personally, I expect either a proposal or a medley of hits from Oklahoma. You have to hand it to the president it shows a certain ambition to try to undermine the idea of protest in a country that was founded by, well, Protestants. Trump has tried to make this about respect for a flag I very much doubt he could draw from memory, and for military service that he studiously avoided.Of course the NFL players are not actually protesting the flag. That would be as pointless as arguing with a sock, screaming at a table cloth, or a whole bunch of other stuff Trump probably does on a daily basis. The protest was originally about racial justice, and black people being shot dead by the police. You have to ask yourself how abusive a relationship has to be if even kneeling in silence is too provocative, how you are valued in a country where even the statement that your life matters ignites furious dissent.There is an obvious misogyny to the Trump administration, and the president no doubt has many supporters whose idea of foreplay consists of dropping a rope ladder down a well. This was highlighted by the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court, despite a confirmation hearing where he unspooled like a Columbo villain, bellowing endlessly about his love of beer. Trump ordered an FBI probe during the hearing, an investigation that was concluded with the speed of an airplane edit of CSI Miami. An investigation that ranged from the FBI agent looking at himself in the mirror and noting that Judge Kavanaugh wasn’t at that moment raping him, all the way through to noting that he hadn’t raped anyone during his time on television being questioned by senators.With Kavanaugh now on the bench, the irony for American women is that huge amounts of beer will soon become their only means of abortion. Should he be any kind of judge? There’s an argument that the very last thing you want to hand to any man accused of sex crimes is a hammer, but then again maybe we need his hands where we can see them. Still, it certainly is a very scary time for young men in America. Especially the ones aged 10 that Trump has put in cages.A climate of fearAt least Trump, looking like a cross between Dr Frankenstein’s first attempt and a tiebreak dinner for the contestants on I’m A Celebrity, came up with the solution to politicians only ever making short-term policies: he made sure there will only be a short term. This year he appointed a former energy lobbyist as head of the environmental protection agency, and announced his intention to change regulations that prohibited new coal burning plants. My guess is that the only concession Republicans plan to make to global warming will be to change the lyrics of America The Beautiful to “…from sea to boiling sea”.Climate catastrophe is imminent. Climate change could decimate pollinating species, leading to a world starved of fruit and vegetables. The best way to alert the world to that danger is to hold the next climate conference in Coatbridge, a town so short of fibre many residents can only shit successfully with the aid of a corkscrew. Perhaps we should try to look on the bright side. The colossal internet servers that provide the architecture for the modern world’s de-socialisation are based above the Arctic Circle. Should they burn out through lack of natural cooling, maybe people will look up from their phones and withered genitalia to once more make eye contact.The death of the planet seems almost too big to take in, doesn’t it? The real tragedy is not that we can’t prevent it. The real tragedy, I think, lies in the fact that we can. There are a lot of things we can change through political action, some small, some large, that would add up to saving the Earth.Consider again the plight of the children starving in Yemen. It’s a hard thing to consider. It’s OK to admit that, I think – that it’s hard to empathise: you don’t know much about it, you have your own plight, and it’s a difficult thing to think about. To consider that, in a world that has pub lunches, wristwatches, golden retrievers, the novels of Donna Tartt, the music of Kendrick Lamar, flumes and The Amazing Spider-Man, there is still a plight where you starve to death, as a child, for no reason.I mean, there is a reason, that I suppose has somehow made itself too obvious to mention. The reason is that some people are addicted to money and power, many of them pathologically so, and we let them do what they like. In our name, and with our taxes, we let them kill who they like in the service of their bored, baroque perversity, because we don’t care enough to stop them. We cannot seem to rouse ourselves, even as they move to turn the world into a consuming flame. We are running out of time to save the children of Yemen, and ourselves – and yet we could still, in theory, be redeemed.

Dive into the emerald water. It’s 13 minutes and 70 metres down to lunch. Are you dead yet? Not if you are one of the Bajau “sea nomads” of south-east Asia, who have been free-ing like this for more than 1,000 years, relying on their remarkable physiology, and, as we learned in April, their genes. Humans left Africa 50 millennia ago, encountering new environments that required adaptation to survive. Adaptation is mostly cultural – building shelters, using fire, deciding what to eat, and transmitting instructions from generation to generation. But alongside this are advantageous genetic mutations grasped by natural selection.Finding genetic changes that drive adaptations has become much easier now genomes can be sequenced cheaply, and a study this year of the Bajau people provided a beautiful example. Ultrasound scans revealed enlarged spleens – reflex contraction of this neglected organ helps during ing by pumping oxygenated red blood cells into the circulation. Sequencing Bajau genomes and comparing them with those of their non-ing neighbours revealed genes showing signatures of natural selection, one of which is specifically associated with spleen size. Understanding the e response could have medical applications in acute hypoxia, a common killer in A\u0026ampE.Mark Jobling, professor of genetics, University of LeicesterWhile it is always nice to round off the year with good-news science stories, I feel that the publication of the new UN IPCC (the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report in October was so important and with such huge ramifications that all else pales into insignificance.The report shook the world when it was published on 8 October, suggesting that the time for talking was over and that the window available for us to really act against the worst effects of climate change was closing fast. It stated that “limiting global warming to 1.5C would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society”.Written by 91 scientists and review editors from 40 countries, with over 6,000 scientific references and contributions from thousands of experts worldwide, it explained that we are already seeing the consequences of 1C of global warming: more extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice. It also highlighted how much worse things could get if we do not act immediately.The report examined what it would take to avert disaster and what the consequences could be. But the omens are not good. Global CO2 emissions are on the rise again, as is the popularity of climate change-denying, populist world leaders, which makes everything more difficult. Jim Al-Khalili, professor of theoretical physics at the University of SurreyThese stark statistics help us understand the extent to which we humans now dominate ecosystems. While wildlife documentaries still wow us with images of wonderful wildlife in wild places, these places are shrinking. Almost everywhere, the large mammal you are most likely to encounter is a human or a cow. I hope that being reminded of this will help society take actions to ensure that my son’s children don’t live in a world where wild species are only known from images on soft furnishings.Julia Jones, professor of conservation science, Bangor UniversityGene-editing is a breakthrough in biotechnology, not least in crop improvement. Scientists’ favourite method, CrisprCas9, makes precise changes to inidual genes, even changing a single “letter” of the genetic code. It’s quick, easy and amazingly versatile. A headline story in 2018 was the European court of justice’s ruling that gene-edited crops must be subject to the same cumbersome regulation as older methods of genetic engineering, even though Crispr mutations are no different to those found throughout the natural world. Plant breeders are pressing for this decision to be overturned so farmers and consumers can benefit from improvements in fruit, vegetables and field crops.Any woman who has suffered a miscarriage is likely to worry about what she has done “wrong” a woman at the end of her pregnancy who is afflicted with the serious condition pre-eclampsia will wonder why it afflicted her in particular. Both situations, common as they are and with all their accompanying distress, are likely to arise from problems with the placenta. But it is difficult to determine this, since the human placenta is hardly available off the shelf for easy study.A team of scientists at the University of Cambridge have made a breakthrough permitting them to create a 3D (that’s important in order to simulate reality) “organoid”, clusters of cells derived from the placentas of aborted foetuses. These have been shown to grow and produce proteins, sufficiently mimicking the real thing that a pregnancy test gives a positive result. This mini-placenta, only a millimetre or less across, offers the promise that the origin of the developmental abnormalities that lead to the embryo not correctly implanting in the womb can finally be understood. For many women, this insight could prove transformative. Clearly, there is a long way to go from creating the first mini-placentas to answering the fundamental questions, but this study appears to provide a critical step forward.Athene Donald, professor of experimental physics at the University of CambridgeAs much as I love seeing otherworldly pictures beamed back from the surface of Mars, it was a different sort of space landing that grabbed my attention this year. In June, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s (Jaxa) Hayabusa2 probe rendezvoused with a near-Earth asteroid called Ryugu, some 280m km away. The first pictures beamed back revealed a strange and beautiful diamond-shaped rock ploughing its way through space. Fascinating in and of itself, but the real treat would come in September, when the probe landed two rovers on Ryugu’s surface. The picture above is one of the first ever transmitted from the surface of an asteroid, and I could stare at it for hours. It’s a reminder that while there’s still so much to learn about the universe, the baby steps we’re already taking reveal an awe-inspiring beauty in the most unexpected of places. Hayabusa2 will also be collecting rock samples that might shed light on the potential origins of water and organic compounds (and maybe even life) on Earth, but the journey will be a long and risky one – it’s not scheduled back until December 2020.Dr Pete Etchells, reader in psychology and science communication at Bath Spa UniversityThis year has seen some sobering science stories, not least the increase in cases, sometimes fatal, of preventable diseases such as measles due to vaccine hesitancy and the growing politicisation of the anti-vaccine agenda. My older brother suffered with measles as child and was dangerously ill. He used to describe his fever dreams as the most terrifying experiences of his life. As late as the 1960s, many people still witnessed the potentially catastrophic effects of measles, rubella and whooping cough and there was a huge demand for the development of vaccines to prevent them. The introduction of vaccines dramatically reduced the incidence of infections and fewer people experienced the impact of disease. Now we are seeing a resurgence in preventable diseases such as measles due to vaccine hesitancy. Although there is not one clearly defined anti-vaccine group, six themes emerge:1. Control: the idea that we can take back control of our own bodies through alternative means.2. Parenting style: philosophies that shun mainstream medicine, opting for “natural” remedies.3. The past: previous bad healthcare experiences or a bad experience around vaccination shapes perceptions.4. Risk: misunderstandings about the risks of vaccination versus the risks of disease.5. Fear of chemicals: the fear that the vaccine will introduce toxic chemicals.6. Distrust of government agencies and corporations.By listening to people, it is possible to start to understand what may lie behind their hesitancy. The re-emergence of preventable diseases is a stark reminder of how mistrust, confusion and bad information can spread, and emphasises the importance of experts in the field talking with and listening to the public to enable meaningful dialogue, help reduce propaganda and effect change. Sheena Cruickshank, professor in biomedical sciences and public engagement, University of ManchesterArtificial intelligence (AI) has continued to make great strides in 2018. Although the AI of Blade Runner and Ex Machina remains as distant as ever, the power of so-called “deep neural networks” and “reinforcement learning” to solve complex problems has developed rapidly. Two milestones stand out this year: AlphaZero and AlphaFold, both from the London-based AI firm DeepMind. AlphaZero is the latest iteration of AlphaGo, which catapulted DeepMind to public prominence in 2016 when it beat Go champion Lee Sedol in a series of high-profile matches.AlphaGo worked by training a deep neural network to predict the value of board positions, using millions of past games as training data. This was later improved upon by AlphaGo Zero, which learned purely by playing itself, and now AlphaZero takes things further by training a single network, again entirely through self-play and without any game-specific knowledge, to deliver world-beating performances in three different games: Go, chess, and the Japanese game shogi.This remarkable achievement has also provided glimpses into new “machine-like” ways of thinking: as grandmaster Matthew Sadler put it, “it’s like discovering the secret notebooks of a great player from the past”. AlphaFold takes the same approach beyond the rarefied regime of board games to address a practical problem of real importance: predicting the 3D structure of proteins solely from genetic sequences. Here, the DeepMind software has again achieved world-leading results, bringing important implications for biology and medicine, and showcasing how AI can be used for scientific discovery itself.Anil Seth, professor of cognitive and computational neuroscience, University of Sussex"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93d4320bcd630e3566605b8195ef28eea3f0f087/0_165_3096_1858/master/3096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f126746a48b3ce8b25a318966819730","title":"alastair cook new years honours","story":"My admiration for sportspeople is always at its most intense at this time of year. After all, it’s the season when I can make it to the end of a week and realise that my food consumption, extensive as it was, consisted only of items in varying shades of beige. When I wake to discover mince-pie crumbs in my bed and sometimes in my hair. The only physical exercise I engage in follows a YouTube search on “Yoga for Digestion” and getting the rubbish to the bins feels like the 10,000m, requiring me to pace myself in the early stages and keep a water bottle to hand.In these shortened, darkened days, those who discipline their bodies into marvels of mechanical engineering have my undying respect. The Olympic hopeful, eyes fixed on Tokyo 2020, shaking her head at the plate of satay skewers and leaving the party early so she can still make her 5am ergo, will never cease to amaze and silently shame me. The lower-league footballers boarding the bus for their Boxing Day fixture are instant heroes. I’m never more aware of the ocean of difference in our experience of life than in Christmas week, when professional sportspeople still have the iron will to go outdoors.It is fitting, then, that this is also the time we hang baubles and decorations on those involved in sport for their contributions to our entertainment and general enjoyment of life. Arise, Geraint Thomas, Sports Personality of The Year. Vivat Harry Redknapp, King of the Jungle. It’s been a lean year in the glitterball stakes, admittedly, but Michael Vaughan is still an outside hope for the Strictly … Christmas special.Then there are the collection of capital letters handed out like hangover cures on New Year’s Day – the MBEs, the OBEs, the big K. What English cricket fans didn’t get a warm and melty feeling at the news this week that Alastair Cook is hotly tipped to receive a knighthood? Assuming the reports are accurate, Cook will be the 10th English cricketer to get the full ceremonial sword treatment and it’s hard to imagine it happening to a more deserving or decent guy. Sir (Confirmation Pending) Alastair is the most prolific batsman and second-most successful captain England have had, whose modest bearing and keep‑calm‑and-carry-on demeanour practically demanded its own part in Downton Abbey. He keeps sheep and goes shooting with Sir Ian Botham. What better qualifications could he have?Cook was already, like the former England Women captain Charlotte Edwards, a CBE, so he was presumably used to walking into dinner ahead of Jimmy Anderson OBE. (It’s possible Stuart Broad MBE has to sit at a lower table.) But for an England player to be knighted so soon after the end of his international career is unprecedented. It is less than three months since we were choking up at his final Test century, then quietly sobbing into a hankie at Anderson’s best‑friend tribute. Cricket‑loving Theresa May is believed to have pushed matters along proof that the prime minister can still make things happen, provided they’re actually a good idea in the first place.No one’s pretending that these kind of honours don’t come with their own Santa sack of issues. It doesn’t take a Bill Frindall to analyse the list of sporting knights and dames and deduce that they’re an utter crapshoot or that most of the gongs have been awarded to fairly patrician pastimes. Yachting and motor racing have 15 Ks between them. Boxing has one.But Cook’s elevation puts him in very rare company indeed, not least because almost every one of England’s other cricketing knights is dead. Only Sir Ian is still available for a chat about which side to wear your badge. Or was born after 1932. You sense Cookie could do with a more whimsical nickname if he’s going to fit in with Plum Warner or Gubby Allen or even Sir Henry Dudley Gresham Leveson-Gower, known to his friends as Shrimp.Shrimp was a jolly good fellow, the type who could go up to Magdalen, Oxford, spend four years captaining the Blues and still emerge without a degree. Then there’s Sir Francis Eden Lacey, the first person to be knighted for services to sport, back in 1926. According to Wisden, Lacey was “a stylish bat” and “a capital field” (he also, from his photographs, bore a surprising resemblance to the American actor John C McGinley). He played for Hampshire and scored 2,589 first-class runs at 32.77. Cook scored 10 times as many runs in Tests alone – at 45.35.But then, in the old days, you tended to be knighted for your usefulness in the committee room rather than at the crease. Three years after Lacey, Sir Frederick Toone joined the knightage (real word, I looked it up) for services to cricket despite never playing a first‑class match. Also despite spending the mid-20s under surveillance by MI5 and being a member of the British Fascists.So it could be that Cook, who will continue to play for Essex next year, is the best cricketing decision Her Majesty’s ever made. He’ll certainly be the only knight of the realm to show up for pre-season training at Chelmsford or to perform his chivalric duties to a County Championship audience of five retirees and a cluster of seagulls.Before then, plain-old Alastair will be celebrating Christmas and his birthday (he was born on 25 December 1984). And while most of us are sleeping in or starting the day with a buck’s fizz, he’ll be out there feeding his sheep. For that kind of valour, I wouldn’t be surprised if he joins the late Lord Cowdrey one day, with a peerage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0d8df4ace71a39e96953d17f1c6139084edf761/0_67_3275_1965/master/3275.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ed7b19aa7a5761dc8402385f79ce766","title":"a christmas carol review tramway glasgow neil bartlett","story":"Tramway, GlasgowSound, light and sets brilliantly convey Scrooge’s turn from miserliness to philanthropy in Neil Bartlett’s joyous adaptationCharles Dickens’s 1843 story of the transformation of Ebenezer Scrooge from crabbit miser to genial philanthropist via a series of Christmas Eve encounters with ghosts of past, present and future is a firm favourite at this time of year. The Citizens’ period production of Neil Bartlett’s adaptation, with its exhilaratingly imaginative ensemble – animating puppet spirits incorporating the audience into the Fezziwigs’s festive celebration – shows us why.Rachael Canning’s design leaves the thrust stage almost bare. Against the set-back wall, an outline of a London skyline in front of this a pair of curtains and, to either side, a couple of pianos flanked by other instruments. A cheerfully bustling introduction sees actor-musicians encourage the audience into a singalong (with actions). Then, as the pinched, cheerless figure of Scrooge makes his way on to the stage, a chill creeps through the space. The very air seems to darken where he goes (Lizzie Powell’s lighting) bright music crashes into discord as he passes (Nikola Kodjabashia’s compositions and sound design). Benny Young’s Scrooge, though, is not the monster miser of caricature but the husk of a man, one who crackles to icy cold the generous attempts at human contact proffered by his shivering clerk (Andy Clark) and his resolutely friendly nephew (Reuben Joseph). Scrooge’s thoughts and feelings centre on his money – the clink of his coins echoes through the auditorium as he counts them.Director Dominic Hill and his uniformly excellent company brilliantly contrast warm conviviality and cold self-centredness, through intertwining sound, music, movement and impeccable acting. They communicate Scrooge’s experiences so sensually that we feel with him the truth of the lesson that happiness lies not in things but in shared experience, and rejoice in his return to love and life.• A Christmas Carol is at Tramway, Glasgow, until 6 January"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd2588c2dddb2a1e14531ad85a679dbcc0c41795/0_352_6809_4086/master/6809.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd8c1e9e38e54fd5e8140185c8c07f93","title":"readers travel photography competition december winners","story":"Our final selection of the year ranges from New York cops to Venice shops, camel fairs to penguins.

She accused Sabella before the guilty verdict of causing her anxiety attacks with his articles on the way she was handling public funds or because he mentioned her name in his stories.Magistrates in Palermo on Thursday rejected the charges, which also included defamation, and dismissed Monterosso’s case against Sabella, finding that the journalist’s reporting had been properly carried out.“When my lawyer informed me that I had been accused of stalking and harassment, I thought it was a joke”, Sabella told the .“I was only doing my job, denouncing irregularities in the regional government. And with her accusation, Monterosso has treated me on the same level as a deranged criminal who relentlessly pursues his victims, making their lives impossible.”Monterosso’s accusations drew the ire of journalist associations, which have complained about the practice in Italy of lodging accusations of defamation or libel as a legal manoeuvre to deter or threaten journalists who then often abandon their reporting while under investigation by the magistrates.During his career, Sabella has received nearly 20 lawsuits for defamation. The judges have dismissed the charges in each case.According to statistics gathered by the Italian watchdog association Ossigeno per l’informazione, which monitors threats and violence against journalists, more than 5,000 lawsuits for defamation are filed against Italian journalists every year. Ninety per cent of those actions have are eventually rejected as groundless.The crime of aggravated defamation in Italy is punishable by six years in jail, second in Europe after Slovakia, with seven years.“The situation is even worse for freelance reporters, who are grossly underpaid and often find themselves with legal expenses up to €5,000 for each lawsuit.”The Italian ministry of the interior has begun to address these concerns, having recently instructed local authorities to monitor threats against reporters in their territories.“This is a positive signal from the ministry, despite the fact that Rome has not always set a good example when it comes to defending journalists.”, said Giulio Francese, the president of the Italian journalists’ association in Sicily, whose father was killed by the Mafia in 1979. He was referring to an incident last November involving the deputy minister, Luigi Di Maio, who declared during a press conference that journalists were “negligible jackals” and “the true plague of this country”, accusing them of generating “fake news’’.But the mafia is not the only threat that Italian journalists face. In Italy, investigative journalists are often wiretapped, followed, and intimidated by the authorities with hundreds of Italian journalists subject to searches, confiscations and wiretaps by Italian prosecutors since 2006, according to Ossigeno."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2eb563afc41e360bb39ad90a601421af2744d84b/58_5_4638_2783/master/4638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7e0e5738d32be371e7b8c2228cce8c4","title":"arak krakatoa tsunami in pictures","story":"At least 168 people are dead and 584 injured after a tsunami hit the coastal regions of the Sunda Strait, according to the Indonesian authorities"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Hospital claims interfaith ceremony will mark inauguration of MasterGarda\u0026iacute investigate attack in Blanchardstown on Saturday nightDenis Naughten resigned from Cabinet amid controversy over dinner head with a bidder for contractWoman is left seriously injured following separate road incident in the countyDemonstrators rally in support of Una Gildea over damage to her Dublin 8 houseThree attacks on KBC offices in less than 48 hours amid Roscommon eviction controversyDublin school\u0026rsquos annual Christmas event seeks to raise money for the homelessUnion urges peaceful protest saying \u0026lsquopublic anger\u0026rsquo needs to be recognisedGarda\u0026iacute appeal for information after incident on the Swords Road on ThursdayOrangutan was found starving and dehydrated in Indonesian villageDeclan O\u0026rsquoCallaghan pressured client who faced losing her home as a result of unpaid fundsConfidential memo from Simon Harris says final bill for the facility could be \u0026euro1.73bnSources say 145 GPs have signed a contract to provide termination services to patientsCo Meath community raises funds to give Margaret Lang (58) a funeralLeo Varadkar calls for social media firms to remove some comments on incident in FalskPSNI condemns actions of \u0026lsquomindless thugs\u0026rsquo following shooting incident in the cityCourt hears applicant\u0026rsquos student visa expired in 2011 and she remained in Ireland illegallyDeputy Br\u0026iacuted Smith makes complaint to Ceann ComhairleLast year\u0026rsquos allocation at \u0026euro31.6 million was said by TII to be \u0026lsquototally insufficient\u0026rsquoT\u0026aacutenaiste responds to Rees-Mogg claim that hard Border can be avoided even if no Brexit deal reached"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3740800.1545505729!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"unauthorised demolition of semi d leaves woman s home exposed","story":"Locals from Dublin 8 protest at the site of number 18, O\u0027Donovan Road - where one half of a semi-detached building has been demolished. Video: Ronan McGreevy\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUna Gildea at a protest over an unauthorised demolition that has left her  Dublin 8 house exposed. Photograph: Nick BradshawDozens of people gathered for a protest in Dublin on Saturday in solidarity with a woman whose semi-detached home has been left exposed after a builder demolished the house next door.Una Gildea thought that when the builders moved in to 18 O’Donovan Road, Dublin 8, that they would just demolish a small one-storey extension, as set out in planning permission.Instead, they proceeded to knock down the whole house, leaving her home resembling a broken front tooth. “This has fallen on top of me out of nowhere,” she said. “There is no Government body to help me.”Brian Morrow, a quantity surveyor, was granted planning permission by Dublin City Council to demolish an existing single-storey extension at the back of the house and erect a new two-storey extension in its place.Dublin City Council said it has served two enforcement notices on Mr Morrow to restore the front elevation of the house and to complete the works for which he was originally given planning permission.In a statement, the council added that it had referred the matter to its solicitors to initiate legal proceedings, as the restoration of the facade was not completed by a November 26th deadline.Mr Morrow now has until January 28th to restore the whole house, and building works are being completed at present.Ms Gildea said the demolition work began in September. She became increasingly alarmed as the work went far further than she expected and started to damage the walls of her own home.“I stupidly expected Dublin City Council to step in and prevent it from happening. I really thought they would not let the house be pulled down,” she said.“If I knew then what I know now I would have drawn attention to this sooner.“The whole house shook and I immediately knew something was wrong. They just knocked the building without telling anyone. And it was still attached to my property. It’s a semi-detached house, so our party wall has been exposed since September . . . exposed for winter.”Ms Gildea is an artist and two of her siblings, Kevin and Anne Gildea, are comedians. The family did their best to find some levity in the situation by holding a protest and a festive carol service outside the demolished house on Saturday.Even Santa Claus turned up, lamenting the fact that he could not go down the chimney of 18 O’Donovan Road because it had been demolished along with the rest of the house.Neighbours brought boxes of sweets and biscuits to hand out to those who turned up, and a few dogs even showed up in Christmas outfits.Ms Gildea said the last three months had been “horrendous” but the support of local people had kept her going.“It shows that this is a real community and a real community spirit here. I’m hoping that it will send a strong message to builders who come into communities thinking they can do things like this,” she said.Ms Gildea laid a symbolic wreath at the entrance to the building site and thanked those who turned up.Mr Morrow issued a statement to The  saying that he was in the process of complying with a Dublin City Council enforcement order and those works should be completed in a number of weeks.He said that he demolished the whole house “due to structural and safety concerns associated with retaining the front elevation while constructing the associated alterations as per the planning grant”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3739917.1545428101!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord unveils her political winners losers and total eejits of 2018","story":"Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says he contacted Clare County Council when he was minister for tourism over a wind farm Donald Trump was opposed to when he bought Doonbeg golf course. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Culture Josepha Madigan was forced to deny that she had celebrated Mass in her local parish church when the priest failed to turn up one Saturday evening. Photograph: Ray LohanThis award is claimed outright by a very special group of men and women who exist in a peculiar political limbo reserved for creatures known as Ministers of State.These poor souls yearn for full Cabinet status and live in constant hope that somebody in the Taoiseach’s first XIV will resign, get sacked or run over on Kildare Street by the 67 bus – sooner rather than later.A delegation of Ministers of State from outside the greater Dublin area met Minister of Finance Paschal Donohoe this month and pleaded with him for more expenses as the cost of accommodation in the capital these days is astronomical.Under existing rules, a Minister of State receives a €94,535 salary as a TD and a ministerial payment of up to €35,319, pushing their earning power up to €129,854. They do not enjoy the same expenses regime as backbench TDs, and this rankles.Unfortunately, news of their tête-à-tête leaked and all the juniors got for their trouble was an overwhelming wave of derision from inside and outside Leinster House. Paschal sent them away with a flea in their ear.This one goes to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar who, having survived a toe-curling meeting with a bored-looking Donald Trump in the Oval Office, set off for Capitol Hill for the traditional Speaker’s lunch and lost the run of himself during a speech in front of the president and members of Congress.Launching into an anecdote about a conversation he had when minister for tourism with then businessman Trump, Leo told how the man who would become president asked if he could do anything about the proposed building of wind farms near his newly purchased Doonbeg golf resort in Co Clare.He said he rang Clare County Council on his behalf.“I tried to do what I could do. The planning permission was declined . . . The president has very kindly given me credit for that. I have to say it probably would have been refused anyway,” he added, modestly.And a trip which should have been a success ended up with Leo insisting he did not try to influence the planning process while, back home, Opposition TDs bellowed for an inquiry.This award goes to Helen McEntee, Mairéad McGuinness and Verona Murphy who, on the Brexit front, have been playing a blinder in Europe, and more particularly, in the UK.McEntee, the Minister of State for Europe, has been growing in stature in Brussels as she bats for Ireland in negotiations and at media briefings. She is a very able stand-in for Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney when he can’t attend meetings. She has also handled media situations with bullish UK Brexiteers with understated authority.MEP McGuinness has been a rock of sense in a sea of confusion, misinformation and meat-headed ignorance, calmly stating the case for Ireland and the European Union as Brexiteering MPs and Anglocentric journalists wilfully try to misinterpret her plainly-put statements of truth. Her stock in Europe has never been so high.Wexford woman Murphy, head of the Irish Road Haulage Association, has become a much sought-after commentator about Brexit and its effects on business. Her impressive grasp of her brief and knowledge of the transport sector has left many Leave cheerleaders floundering. So it comes as no surprise to hear that the trucking expert, who puts the articulate into articulated, is currently being courted by the Fine Gael with a view to her running for the Dáil in the next election.Just one other thing. Is it absolutely necessary for Leo Varadkar to have Helen McEntee standing silently at his side during every photo-op in Brussels and at every impromptu doorstep interview? Is her seat in Meath so vulnerable that he has to do the Sinn Féin trick of pushing candidates into every TV shot and camera frame?This goes to Michael Lowry after his Long Walk to Freedom in June when he emerged from Dublin Circuit Criminal Court with a “fantastic result” after “22 years of turmoil”.The Independent TD for Tipperary and former minister for communications, who was excoriated by the Moriarty tribunal for his involvement when minister in the awarding of the State’s second mobile phone licence to Denis O’Brien’s Esat Digifone consortium, left court in “a free man” with nothing but four convictions for tax offences against himself and his refrigeration company along with an overall €25,000 fine and a trifling three-year disqualification from acting as a company director.The runner-up in this category is Shane Ross, who had a run in with his constant tormentor Mattie McGrath in the Dáil canteen after McGrath had been giving him a tough time over his proposed drink-driving law.Mattie was having lunch with his daughter when Ross, aka Winston Churchtown, came tearing around the corner, shouting the odds.“You’re a bollocks. You’re a f***ing bollocks,” Winston told a startled McGrath in the course of an expletive-laden tirade. Winston then disappeared around the corner, only to re-emerge and start the name calling again.But the winner is journalist and anti-abortion activist John Waters, who took the hump during a podcast with Eamon Dunphy and stormed out of the studio.“Aaah, don’t go!” pleaded Dunphy as his guest departed having been asked to define when life begins.“This isn’t a fair interview! You’re a bollocks! You’re a f***ing bollocks! You can f*** off, Eamon! . . . Talk to Una Mullally. F*** off.”This goes to Ivana Bacik for her tireless work, stretching back to her student days, on the abortion campaign. And for her great energy in promoting Votáil 100, the centenary of womens’ suffrage.The winner here is Daily Mail journalist Joanna Bell, who was ejected from the Irish embassy in London last week for her drunken heckling of Ambassador Adrian O’Neill during a reception. Bell, originally from Dundalk, interrupted him as he spoke about the possibility of a second Brexit referendum.Afterwards, she contritely revealed that “a good lunch with an eccentric aristocrat” was the reason for her “excessive robustness.”The eccentric aristocrat, by the way, is the Hon David Roper-Curzon, who is set to be Lord Teynham when his 90-year-old father dies.As she was being escorted down the stairs, Bell shouted: “This is because I am pro-Brexit.” Also on the stairs, but heading in the opposite direction, were Jeffrey and Mary Archer.Mrs Archer shouted after her: “I’m a Brexiteer and I’m not being asked to leave. This is about manners, not politics.”And then Jeffrey cried: “And I’m a Remainer!”No. Not the Pope. Francis delighted his many followers when he visited in September, but what was supposed to be the highlight of his trip – Mass in the Phoenix Park – was something of a damp squib due to rain and a low turnout.The award goes to Minister for Culture Josepha Madigan, who was the subject of one of the most unexpected political stories of the year when she was forced to go public and deny that she had celebrated Mass in her local parish church when the priest failed to turn up one Saturday evening.What actually happened is that she led a prayer service with fellow parishioners in the absence of a priest so that the congregation were able to worship, albeit in a different way, having made their way to church.And she got a rap on the knuckles from Diarmuid Martin, the Archbishop of Dublin, for her trouble.Committees are often overlooked, but certain TDs and senators put in a lot of hours and hard work at this unglamorous end of politics. The Public Accounts Committee is a different animal. It gets a lot of attention and, consequently, it is often used by grandstanding TDs to draw attention to themselves.Catherine Connolly, Independent TD for Galway, has been an outstanding performer at the PAC. She is calm, measured and incisive. She asks her questions and she gets her answers. Job done.If only others – yes, Marc MacSharry, we’re looking at you – could do the same.This one is being shared by Mattie McGrath, Michael Collins and the Healy-Rae brothers. Rarely a day goes by in the Dáil without one of the four kicking up a stink about how rural Ireland is on its last legs, dying on its feet with its people broken and beaten down by “them above in Dublin”. They paint a pitiful situation of life beyond the Pale. If you were to spend too long listening to their bellyaching, you’d begin to wonder why anyone at all wants to live in rural Ireland.There is good and bad in rural and urban living. This forever complaining quartet, despite what its members might believe, doesn’t have the monopoly on bad luck stories in the Dáil Éireann.Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan is still marooned in the Seanad, months into the Upper House’s consideration of the Judicial Appointments Bill. Senators, particularly those with legal backgrounds, are holding up the progress of the Bill by tabling countless amendments and talking for Ireland.They are ably marshalled by senior counsel Michael McDowell, who is having a filibustering field day and enjoying every minute of it. He hasn’t looked so happy in years. What could make him happier? Word is that he would love a Dáil comeback.Meanwhile, Charlie must endure the meanderings with fortitude. It’s Winston Churchtown’s pet project, but he doesn’t have to listen to the senators droning on. Charlie has clocked up almost 70 hours of duty – it’s like he’s doing community service in the Seanad. The debate has reached section 38 of the Bill, and there are more than 60 to consider. And all the while the amendments fly in.Bród and Síoda.By popular acclaim, and a landslide victory, Michael D Higgins.This goes to Simon Harris for his achievement in leading a difficult abortion referendum campaign from the front, steering it to an overwhelming vote by the people to repeal the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution and overseeing the introduction of legislation to allow the provision of abortion services in Ireland. He was present in the Seanad on the night of December 13th, along with those who campaigned for decades for Irish women to have autonomy over their own bodies, when all stages of the Bill passed.The winners are Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney. Despite being rivals for the party leadership last year, the two have worked together very well on the Brexit issue. They have presented a united front and remained steadfastly on message. Their sure-footedness and grasp of the issues is in marked contrast to the Brexit shambles lurching between crisis and farce across the water.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin is the clear winner. From his surprising Dáil announcement in January that he was not only supporting the campaign to repeal the Eighth Amendment but was also in favour of the introduction of abortion within a 12-week time limit, to his decision to continue supporting the Government next year so it can be free to concentrate on Brexit issues, Micheál has put in a strong and principled performance in the thankless and difficult role of leader of the Opposition. He is also saddled with a parliamentary party team which is far from united, with some actively working to undermine his leadership.It may be that he knows he doesn’t have the numbers to come out on top if an election is called in the next 12 months, so stalling in the “national interest” isn’t such a bad idea. And while his decision to support the recommendations of both the Citizens’ Assembly and the Oireachtas committee on abortion was deeply opposed and resented by a large rump in the party, he emerged as the one most in tune with the will of the people.The decision to continue the confidence-and-supply arrangement with Fine Gael may backfire on him, and is very unpopular with many activists, but the public may take a different view and reward him for taking a noble stand at a time when Ireland faces potential grave national crisis."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3740832.1545560332!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar says boat may have sailed on state ownership of broadband","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar said he wanted to make sure the plan was done  at the lowest possible cost to the taxpayer.  Photograph:Tom HonanPA Wire ‘Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said the “boat may have sailed” on the State owning Ireland’s national broadband plan.Mr Vardakar said two auditors, including KPMG, were evaluating the final consortium bid.His comments come a month after a report into the procurement process for the country’s broadband plan found it had not been influenced by former communications minister Denis Naughten or businessman David McCourt.The review by independent assessor Peter Smyth said it was satisfied that neither of the men influenced the tender process after it emerged they had held a number of private meetings and dinners.Mr Naughten resigned his Cabinet seat in October amid the controversy over dinners he held with the head of the last remaining bidder for the multimillion-euro state contract for the rollout of high-speed broadband.Asked whether he was considering revising the terms of the contract so the State would own the broadband infrastructure, Mr Varadkar said: “I’m not sure we can do that at this stage. I’ll have to check that with Richard (Bruton, Communications Minister). The boat may have sailed on that.“The evaluation is under way now on the broadband tender.“That’s being done by KPMG, and also by an external group, so we want to make sure it’s value for money.“We want to make sure that the contractor can deliver. We’ll make a decision, I would anticipate, in the first two months of the new year as to whether we sign that broadband contract or not.“But it is something I’m committed to delivering. We’ve up to 75 per cent coverage across the country when it comes to high-speed broadband.”He said the remaining 25 per cent of the public feel “even more left behind”.“So I really want to get this done,” he said.“I want to make sure that we do it at the lowest possible cost to the taxpayer and that secondly, that we have confidence that the contractor can deliver and will actually be able to get the job done.“We’ll have to make a decision, of course, on broadband, which will be one of the big calls the Government has to make in the first two months of next year.”– PA"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

The Herald Angels Sing\u0027 is incurring the ire of bishops because it removes the reference to Mary\u0027s virginity, with the line Offspring of a virgin\u0027s womb replaced with Offspring of the favoured one.Senior Church of England clergy have warned against using the altered version of Charles Wesley’s Christmas hymn, which has found its way into an increasing number of services.Revd Marcus Walker, rector of Great St Bartholomew in the City of London, said the text change was not heretical but it “plays down the Virgin Birth, plays down the reality of Christ\u0027s birth, and Mary\u0027s femininity – that he came out of a womb this was a real birth from a real woman.The bishop of Crediton, Bishop Jacqueline Searle, said sticking to the original text was vital “because it’s a part of our creed”.“It’s important that we are not squeamish about singing \u0027of a virgin’s womb\u0027, which reflects nothing being impossible with God,” she said.Bishop Searle added that there were different theological ways in which people understand the Virgin Birth today, but it was important that Christmas carols were not tampered with, because altered versions could mislead people less familiar with the Christian faith.“Just because something sounds difficult or new doesn’t mean it needs to be changed.“When we sing our doctrine, it is saying something about what we believe. Especially at this time of year, when lots of people are singing carols, we would like what we’re singing to reflect as accurately as we can the faith we inhabit.”The Bishop of Blackburn, Julian Henderson, also criticised the change, arguing that Wesley’s original “is an essential part of the Christmas story”.Donald Allister, the Bishop of Peterborough, added: “Wesley’s great Christmas carol conveys the true Christmas message joyfully and powerfully. It is a great shame to see any attempt to reduce that message.”Many carol texts have been modernised, reordered, or retranslated from foreign languages over the centuries, but usually without changing their message. Wesley’s original opening line to his carol was “Hark, how all the Welkin Rings”, “welkin” meaning sky or heavens.Recently the texts of some carols have been modified to use “inclusive language” rather than words such as “sons” or “men”.Rev Dr Ian Paul, a theologian and member of the Archbishops\u0027 Council, which oversees Church of England strategy and funding, said the altered version of the carol “avoids the awkward challenge of the Virgin Birth and probably ought to be put in the bin”, and advised anyone putting together a carol service to consult a good-quality printed hymnbook for their texts rather than just search online.A Google search links the changed version to American gospel singer Mahalia Jackson, who recorded \u0027Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\u0027 in the 1960s, though the exact provenance of the altered line is unclear.Rupert Gough, who was directing the choristers after the banquet said: “I see this all the time at weddings – you Google for texts and you think ‘That’s it,’ and it may have come from an American site or whatever, and you find that people tinker with the words.”Andrew Reeves, head server and master of ceremonies at west London’s Holy Trinity church, Sloane Square, said he came across the altered words this week at a company carol service. Staff from the company had sourced the texts for the orders of service but when the congregation came to the unfamiliar line, “everybody was completely thrown,” he said.Church of EnglandPlease review our commenting policyIndonesia tsunami: At least 222 dead and 843 injured after Krakatoa erupts - latest updatesSeventeen singer posts emotional tribute to wife and bandmates washed away by Indonesia tsunamiComment: Sorry BBC.

People are looking to reduce their exposure and closing out high risk sell positions before the holidays and this is creating upward pressure on market prices, which is ultimately resulting in a rally.CoinMarketCap)The dramatic price gains come at the end of a disappointing year for Bitcoin, having traded at close to $20,000 (£15,850) in December 2017.The wildly fluctuating price is not unusual for the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency, with five previous cycles seeing bitcoin fall by an average of 85 per cent each time.Before the latest recovery, the price of bitcoin was around 83 per cent down on its 2017 high.iStock)Opinion is ided over whether bitcoin will return to its previous highs, with some analysts suggesting that bitcoin will eventually become worthless.\u0026nbspOthers are more positive in their forecasts, including Mr McAfee, who famously predicted that one bitcoin will be worth $500,000 (£396,000)\u0026nbspin 2020.If not, I will eat my d**k on national television, he tweeted in July 2017.

But is that reasonable?In 2017 Liam Fox famously claimed that concluding a trade deal with the European Union after Brexit would be the “easiest in human history” because we’d start from a position of already being fully aligned on tariffs and regulation.Such bullishness is notable by its absence now.Indeed, one of the reasons Brexiteers are so alarmed by the Irish “backstop” provision of the withdrawal agreement is that even they doubt that there will be a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU in place by January 2021\u0026nbspwhen the transition is supposed to end.But what are the prospects for trade deals between the UK and the rest of the world after Brexit? What deals could we strike with the likes of China, India, Brazil and other emerging markets?A glance at the international trade secretary’s Twitter feed\u0026nbspshows he remains upbeat on such prospects. Is this warranted?The answer is that it will depend\u0026nbspto a significant extent on what sort of trade deal the UK can get with the EU.Brexit is a mess, so why are MPs not postponing their Christmas break?Other countries are very likely to wait until they see how close we end up to the EU’s single market and the customs union before deciding, as that will impact the cost-benefit calculation of any bilateral UK trade deal for their firms and industries.If we end up closely aligned on customs with the EU that might limit our government’s autonomy to even forge independent trade deals on goods with third countries since we could be imposing the EU’s common external tariff.What about services? Well, presuming we’re out of the single market, that would give us more scope for services trade deals. And it’s true that services are a large and growing share of UK total exports.Yet the problem here is that international trade deals in recent years have been essentially about goods, rather than services.Another snag, at least from the perspective of sovereignty-obsessed Brexiteers, is that a service deal worth having would entail some degree of regulatory harmonisation, for instance recognising each others’ professional qualifications. Is that “taking back control”?Associated to that question is immigration. “A big ask of emerging markets when it comes to trade deals is UK visas for their nationals,” says Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform.That may not go down well with those Brexiteers who want less immigration from developing countries, not more.Finally, there’s “gravity” to think about. It’s an empirical reality that countries tend to do more trade with big economies that are closer to them than those that are further away.Even if we did successfully forge goods and services trade deals with lots of emerging market economies the results might well be disappointing to Brexiteers, like Fox, who have assumed big increases in trade flows.It’s for this reason that almost all Brexit modelling exercises, including the government’s\u0026nbspone, show only a modest gain to UK GDP in the long term from hypothetical post-Brexit trade deals with the rest of the world, with the damage far outweighed by the macroeconomic costs of introducing trade frictions between us and the EU.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

But how could it look under a no-deal Brexit?Items that are grown in the UK won’t be affected, but those that are imported will become more costly as they will be subject to tariffs and other expensive trade barriers.Parsnips and carrots Let’s start with the good news. Parsnips and carrots are grown in abundance in the UK. They are available throughout most of the year and are rarely imported from abroad. So even a Brexit as hard as a raw parsnip is unlikely to affect this popular Christmas side dish.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialPeople with the Brussels sprouts-hating TAS2R38 gene are out of luck. Brussels sprouts are so abundant in the UK that they are actually exported around the world. The topical Christmas cracker joke, “How will Christmas dinner be different after Brexit? No Brussels” is unlikely to be true for the actual vegetable.These are the least recyclable Christmas chocolate wrappersAlthough the UK is a major potato producer, some potatoes and potato products still get imported to meet UK demand. This mainly applies to frozen or processed potato products such as frozen fries. Due to a large harvest in 2016-17, the UK is expected to be a net exporter of fresh potatoes in 2017-18. Fresh potato imports have been predominantly from EU countries, but traditional suppliers such as France appear to have found other markets. UK fresh potato exports are predominantly to the EU (98 per cent).So as long as growing conditions are favourable, there ought to be sufficient fresh UK potatoes to roast for Christmases to come.It is thought that sweet chestnut trees were brought to Britain by the conquering Romans and, like many other immigrants, they have naturalised and become an important part of the food chain. In most years\u0026nbspthe nuts grow to a reasonable size in the south-east of England. But in other areas it is unusual for more than one of the fruits in each husk to reach full size. They are generally not harvested in time for Christmas, but can be preserved by boiling and freezing.The fresh chestnuts you see at Christmas in the UK are mostly sourced from elsewhere in Europe. This is because sweet chestnut trees in the UK are threatened by both fungal blight and, more recently, the oriental chestnut gall wasp.If having reasonably priced quality fresh sweet chestnut imports is important to you at Christmas, Brexit could be a problem.Created with Sketch.

He refuses at first – but when his hair turns white, a beard and belly grow overnight, and children start approaching him with their wish lists, he reluctantly takes the mantle. It’s weirder and darker than it has any right to be, but it’s enjoyable to watch.When writer and director Billy Wilder first watched Brief Encounter, in which two people use a friend’s house to consummate an affair, he wrote in his notebook: “What about the poor schnook who has to crawl into the still-warm bed of the lovers?” The result of that scribble is The Apartment, a film that, with its farcical but well-wrought premise and career-best performances from Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, never puts a foot wrong.320 18. Miracle on 34th Street (1994)Whether you consider this film a heart-warming gem or an insult to the 1947 original might depend on which version you grew up with – but it’s hard to argue with the performances of Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle, and Mara Wilson as the precociously cynical Dorey.Film trailer editor Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and wedding columnist Iris (Kate Winslet) exchange homes over Christmas in an attempt to escape their terrible love lives. This Nancy Meyers classic is as predictable as its fake movie trailers, but it’s warm and witty, with a strange but sweet subplot involving an Oscar-winning nonagenarian.A bizarre and macabre Santa Claus origin story, this Finnish fantasy horror follows a group of Lapland natives who stumble upon the secret of Father Christmas. To say that he’s not the cuddly, benevolent gift-giver we know and love would be an understatement.  To say any more would be to spoil the twisted fun.This low-budget, entirely improvised film from “mumblecore” actor-director Joe Swanberg is an understated and underrated gem. Anna Kendrick is typically charismatic as an irresponsible twenty-something who crashes, uninvited, back into the life of her older brother Jeff (Swanberg), but the film’s secret weapon is a brilliantly nuanced performance from Melanie LynskeyFeaturing a reimagined version of the title song, which Bing Crosby introduced in Holiday Inn over a decade earlier, White Christmas was intended to reunite Crosby with Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Astaire declined the project, and eventually Danny Kaye starred instead, as an aspiring entertainer alongside Crosby. The resulting film was a box office smash and a subsequent classic. Astaire missed out.Whatever side you’re on in the infernal debate over whether it’s actually a Christmas movie (Bruce Willis thinks not), it\u0027s hard to deny that Die Hard is a perfect action movie. That it takes place on Christmas Eve, and features lines like, “Now I have a machine gun, ho-ho-ho”, makes it ideal holiday viewing too – particularly if you’re a little sick of festive slush.Based on Robert Nathan’s 1928 novel, The Bishop’s Wife stars Cary Grant as perhaps the most charming angel to ever grace the silver screen. Taking on human form in order to help a struggling bishop (David Niven) and his fractured marriage, Grant’s Dudley accidentally falls in love with the eponymous Julia (Loretta Young). He’s an angel, though, not a homewrecker, and all is well come Christmas Eve.There have been about a hundred screen adaptations of Charles Dickens’s iconic novella, which sees a penny-pinching miser change his ways after encountering the ghosts of his Christmas past, present and future. Though this made-for-television film is far from the most famous reimagining, it is one of the best – thanks in no small part to perfectly pitched performances from Patrick Stewart and Richard E Grant.1120 10. Meet Me in St. Louis (1944)Sick of playing juvenile roles, Judy Garland nearly turned down her role as the lovesick Esther Smith in this musical comedy. When she finally agreed to do it, the production was marred by her erratic behaviour – she would regularly turn up to set hours late, or not turn up at all. “It was some years later before I really knew what she’d been going through,” her co-star Mary Astor later said, alluding to Garland’s struggles with mental health issues and addiction – but you’d never know any of that watching this warm, charming film. It’s also responsible for one of the best Christmas songs ever made: “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”.Lost in New York (1992): It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Home Alone franchise went on for three films too long – but this first sequel is surprisingly wonderful. Sure, it follows almost the exact same formula as the original, and simply relocates to the Big Apple, but with a formula this good, and with Macaulay Culkin still on board (he wisely bowed out after this one), it’s hard to complain. If you’re after festive cheer, though, you might want to fast forward through Donald Trump’s brief cameo.When it comes to Christmas films, there is no shortage of love and romance – but it’s all overwhelmingly straight. Even Love Actually filmed a queer storyline among its 524 interweaving plots, before deciding it should be cut from the film, leaving that “Colin goes to America” abomination intact. And so Todd Haynes’s Carol, a beautifully shot adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel in which department store worker Therese (Rooney Mara) falls in love with a mysterious older woman (Cate Blanchett) in the run up to Christmas, is a welcome break from heteronorm-nativity.We’ve all read that Jezebel article by now, and know that Love Actually is flawed as hell. But there is far too much to enjoy in this ensemble romcom to write it off – namely Emma Thompson’s extraordinary, rightly revered performance as the wronged wife of Alan Rickman.There are three simple rules to keep a gremlin from wreaking havoc: don’t expose it to the light, don’t get it wet, and never feed it after midnight. Naturally, over the course of this Christmas comedy horror, all three of those rules are broken. The ensuing chaos makes for riotous viewing.Who’s have thought that one of the best interpretations of Charles Dickens’s festive fable would come courtesy of a bunch of wise-cracking puppets? In his role as Ebeneezer Scrooge, Michael Caine vowed to act “like I’m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company”, whatever ridiculous antics were happening around him. His tactic worked.Though this beautiful, wordless animation is not widely known outside the UK – it was first broadcast on the then fledgling Channel 4 in 1982 and then annually ever since – it is well worth 26 minutes of anyone’s time. Revolving around a young boy and a snowman come to life (a little like Jack Frost, except not terrible), the film ends with a breathtaking flourish, as the pair fly over England’s snowy plains to the melancholy strains of “Walking in the Air.This fish-out-of-water tale, in which one of Santa’s elves (Will Ferrell) discovers that he’s actually a human and sets out to New York to find his father, could have been supremely annoying if it weren’t for Ferrell’s absolute commitment to his ludicrous role. Bolstered by strong performances from James Caan, Mary Steenburgen and Zooey Deschanel, Elf manages to be both self-aware and defiantly uncynical.After revelling for a while in every child’s ill-thought-out fantasy – “I made my family disappear,” says Macaulay Culkin’s Kevin when his family accidentally leave on holiday without him – Home Alone then promptly changes tack, inserting two grimy burglars into the mix. Cue some of the most inventive, and surprisingly violent, self-defence techniques you’ve ever seen.Admittedly, for about 120 of this film’s 130-minute running time, it’s really not a wonderful life at all. In fact, this tale of a down-on-his-luck bank clerk (James Stewart) driven to the brink of suicide, before a trainee angel shows him what the world would have been like without him (spoiler: much worse), is deeply emotionally draining. But it’s also warm, funny, timeless, life-affirming, and a deserved classic.When Tim Allen’s Scott Calvin accidentally kills Santa Claus (a nice, light-hearted beginning to a family film) he is expected to take his place. He refuses at first – but when his hair turns white, a beard and belly grow overnight, and children start approaching him with their wish lists, he reluctantly takes the mantle. It’s weirder and darker than it has any right to be, but it’s enjoyable to watch.When writer and director Billy Wilder first watched Brief Encounter, in which two people use a friend’s house to consummate an affair, he wrote in his notebook: “What about the poor schnook who has to crawl into the still-warm bed of the lovers?” The result of that scribble is The Apartment, a film that, with its farcical but well-wrought premise and career-best performances from Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, never puts a foot wrong.320 18. Miracle on 34th Street (1994)Whether you consider this film a heart-warming gem or an insult to the 1947 original might depend on which version you grew up with – but it’s hard to argue with the performances of Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle, and Mara Wilson as the precociously cynical Dorey.Film trailer editor Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and wedding columnist Iris (Kate Winslet) exchange homes over Christmas in an attempt to escape their terrible love lives. This Nancy Meyers classic is as predictable as its fake movie trailers, but it’s warm and witty, with a strange but sweet subplot involving an Oscar-winning nonagenarian.A bizarre and macabre Santa Claus origin story, this Finnish fantasy horror follows a group of Lapland natives who stumble upon the secret of Father Christmas. To say that he’s not the cuddly, benevolent gift-giver we know and love would be an understatement.  To say any more would be to spoil the twisted fun.This low-budget, entirely improvised film from “mumblecore” actor-director Joe Swanberg is an understated and underrated gem. Anna Kendrick is typically charismatic as an irresponsible twenty-something who crashes, uninvited, back into the life of her older brother Jeff (Swanberg), but the film’s secret weapon is a brilliantly nuanced performance from Melanie LynskeyFeaturing a reimagined version of the title song, which Bing Crosby introduced in Holiday Inn over a decade earlier, White Christmas was intended to reunite Crosby with Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Astaire declined the project, and eventually Danny Kaye starred instead, as an aspiring entertainer alongside Crosby. The resulting film was a box office smash and a subsequent classic.

They also make a good option for retaliatory tariffs against the US, the world’s largest cranberry producer. The EU took more than 50 per cent\u0026nbspof US cranberry exports in 2018, with the UK leading the way.That is not to say the UK does not have its own cranberries. The two native cranberry species in the UK are vaccinium oxycoccos (the northern cranberry) and vaccinium microcarpus (the small\u0026nbspcranberry). Wild harvesting used to take place in Scotland but, due to habitat loss, this is no longer done. As a consequence, the cranberries bought in UK stores are the species vaccinium macrocarpon. These are harvested in North America and Eastern Europe using a method that involves flooding the land, which is impractical in the UK.Vaccinium macrocarpon is also grown commercially on Terschelling, an island belonging to the Netherlands. The Netherlands is also a global trade centre for fresh fruit and vegetable imports and exported about €6m (£5.4m) worth of cranberries in 2017 (many of which were grown elsewhere).So the availability of cranberries in the UK is largely dependent on shipments from the EU. This supply chain arrangement may have to change after Brexit, particularly if the UK were to decide not to follow EU trade legislation. Depending on the flavour of Brexit, the costs of establishing a new supply chain independent of EU trade hubs and losing the economies of scale that the EU enjoys as a whole could lead to shortages initially and increased costs in the future.The majority of UK families opt for roast turkey on Christmas day. This will cost them more if there’s a hard Brexit.Turkeys are becoming more expensive to produce in the UK. Turkey producer Kelly Bronze’s prices, for example, are up by about 5.4 per cent\u0026nbspthis year and it has warned that a hard Brexit will affect its business by 70 per cent.A significant cost of producing turkeys in the UK is related to the labour cost of hand plucking. This relies on EU migrant labour and staffing for the Christmas peak and is a real concern. Brexit scenarios considered by farmers’ groups indicate that any deal affecting\u0026nbspthe labour pool is likely to lead to increased prices.For those not paying a premium for hand-plucked turkeys, any Brexit trade deals imposing tariffs or import restrictions on cheaper turkeys from the EU would not make them cheaper for the consumer. A trade deal with the US might provide the option of turkey meat marinated in chlorine – not necessarily to everyone’s taste.Strasbourg attack: Is it safe to visit Christmas markets in Europe?Elderly woman cuts down flashing Christmas lights in middle of nightCassetteboy remixes Die Hard to prove it’s a Christmas filmThe average number of turkeys slaughtered in the UK per week in December 2017 was half a million birds or about 2 million over the month. Allowing for the additional 1.6 million from November, the figure is still more than 6 million short of the estimated 10 million consumed at Christmas.Pigs in blankets The cost and availability of sausages wrapped in bacon is dependent on pork supplies. British farmers currently produce only 40 per cent\u0026nbspof the pork eaten in the UK. The other 60 per cent\u0026nbspcomes from EU countries such as Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands.So, as with turkey, a hard Brexit would lead to a rise in the cost of sausages and bacon due to either import costs or supply and demand issues.Christmas might only come once a year but Brexit is likely to make it even more expensive.Hana Trollman is a PhD researcher at Loughborough University.

He was holding a print-out of the draft of an article I’d written. “You did law, didn’t you,” he stated. It was true, my degree was in law. I nodded.\u0026nbsp“What’s this?” He asked, pointing to his desk. “It’s a desk,” I said. “Well f*****g well say so. Don’t say, ‘it’s got a flat top and four legs, and therefore might be a desk.’ It’s a desk.”I can’t tell you how often I’m reminded of Bambridge’s words. There is hardly a day that goes by when I don’t see a piece of writing or hear a speech that is pure verbiage, and can only have been produced by a lawyer or a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe latest example is particularly shocking. When I last looked, BT was supposed to be a communications company. Okay, telecommunications. But a corporation, nevertheless, that ought to pride itself on directness and speed of delivery. In that context, the ability of the receiver to comprehend should be paramount.\u0026nbspUnited Airlines mocked for corporate speak response to passenger rowSo, take this, from BT as it promises to overhaul its pay policies after the investor backlash following the £2.3m package handed to departing boss Gavin Patterson. The company will consider “a broader range of performance factors and wider circumstances” when determining executive remuneration. It also pointed to “a more structured process to help it step through the application of its discretion in the future.”Eh? Who writes this stuff? Clearly, not someone who believes in telling it how it is, and is unable to say something for definite without suffocating it in qualification. That has to be a lawyer, or as I say, a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe problem with this approach is that it suggests an organisation that is hidebound, stricken with fear, unable to proceed without a high degree of caution, incapable of saying “we screwed up, and we’re sorry”. Patterson received too much –\u0026nbspperhaps not under the strict terms of his contract –\u0026nbspbut, given the company’s poor showing, too much.\u0026nbspDecisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out.But BT cannot admit that, oh no. It won’t try to claw back the money as that would be unseemly, and besides, the lawyers have probably advised that would be difficult. Instead, it attempts to sooth and gloss over with words straight out of the lawyers’ lexicon of “safe” twaddle.\u0026nbspSlight as it is, in the overall picture of a multi-billion pound global empire, BT’s announcement about leaders’ pay is indicative of a loss of way, a lack of confidence. Intuition has succumbed to process.\u0026nbspWith any management there should be room for both, for the heart and the head. Of course, things have to be done properly and carefully, but they also need to be done. Decisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out. It is not the answer.Too often, I’ve seen the lawyers rule the roost. On a product safety issue, where fatalities had ensued, they were reluctant to let the management meet the relatives and express their condolences, because this could lead to an admission of liability. In another episode, involving a food company, they took the same line. Again, after a tragedy, a holiday operator was told on no account to contact the family.\u0026nbspWhile lawyers may give their advice for the best of intentions, to avoid the client being shredded in the law courts, and having to pay out vast sums, they do not afford enough attention to that other court, the one of public opinion –\u0026nbspand the one that these days, especially with instant relaying of news, 24-hour bulletins and social media, is increasingly vital.\u0026nbspThere’s little point in shoring up a legal defence, in cloaking a company’s actions in legal procedure and its outpourings in law-speak, if it simply makes the company the subject of derision, and harms its reputation.\u0026nbspSurely\u0026nbspit’s not beyond the wit of any intelligent C-suite member to say they share the loved ones’ pain, without stating there and then, it was the company’s fault? Likewise, is it really impossible for BT to say it recognises, and is concerned about investors’ frustrations, and will do its utmost to prevent a recurrence?Ask any business chief what keeps them awake at night, and they will say loss of reputation –\u0026nbspto the business, and to them, personally. It’s humans who determine how they and their organisation are judged, the basis for that\u0026nbsp reputation. Be human in everything they do, is the easiest way of achieving plaudits. That means being human in how they communicate, and in their actions.\u0026nbspPlease BT, in future, before you press “send”, stand back and read what you’re about to convey. Listen to the lawyers, but, remember, you’re human and you’re talking to humans.\u0026nbspChris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

A redesign sets out to show that to consumersClick to followThe IndependentWorkers at Suma in Elland, YorkshireWhen Sheree Hatton started working at the whole foods distributor Suma six years ago, she knew it was different to anywhere else she’d ever worked.Hatton lives in Halifax with her husband and young son. In her previous job in advertising and sales for a newspaper, she was\u0026nbspused to a hierarchical business with targets for workers. Suma,\u0026nbspa worker’s co-op where each employee owns a share of the business, offered her a chance to have a say in everything from overall strategy to day-to-day operations.\u0026nbspEating organic food lowers risk of certain cancers, study suggestsCould co-operative shops be the answer to expensive organic foods?Organic food healthier than farmed products, says new research“I knew Suma was different from what I had been used to,” Hatton says. “But the more I learned about co-ops, the more I realised that by feeding into business decisions\u0026nbspyou have an equal opportunity to say how the business should be run.”Suma is known as the largest whole food distributor in the UK. But fewer people know that Suma is also Britain’s biggest workers co-operative, with an annual turnover of £55m. More than 200 people now work at Suma after rapid growth in the last few years.\u0026nbspAll of them are considered equal. Every worker at Suma is paid the same salary of £33,000. They get the opportunity to work in every part of the business – including the canteen kitchen – on rotation at the company offices in Elland, Yorkshire. And they get to vote on business decisions. “We are an equal business and we’re very proud of what we’re doing here,” Hatton says.\u0026nbspBut customers, like Hatton, often aren’t instantly aware of Suma’s co-operative status or what that means, according to a survey they commissioned in 2017. “One of the embarrassing points was that not everyone knew that we are a co-op,” Hatton says. So in 2017, Suma workers decided it was time for a rebrand.\u0026nbspPearlfisher (Courtesy Photo)Suma was started over 40 years ago in the kitchen of a house in Leeds. Reg Taylor, owner of a small retail shop, proposed at a meeting attended by other wholefood shops in the north of England that they set up a wholesaling co-operative, to supply to each other, in 1975.The name Suma was first used when the business moved to a lock-up garage in Leeds. In 1977, the business was sold to seven employees who became the founder members of the Triangle Wholefoods Collective Ltd, trading as Suma.Suma has recently benefited as consumers have become more conscious of their health and the ethics of food, plus the growing popularity of veganism. The business introduced its own vegan line in September 2017. New vegan products, including the 2018 introductions of meat-free mini-burgers in tins, have helped sales grow in the last decade.Suma now sells over 7,000 products. The branding has evolved\u0026nbsphaphazardly as lines have been added. Workers knew from customer feedback that they needed a redesign to create a single identity across all ranges, including essential, body and home. Designers also wanted to position Suma at the forefront of the new movement for sustainability and contemporary food.“We really wanted to show off that it was a co-op,” says Harriet Ferguson, senior designer at Pearlfisher, the agency commissioned to do the work. “The existing identity didn’t really do that.” Pearlfisher designers added a tagline to the logo\u0026nbsp“Co-op since 1977” to make Suma distinctive against competition against younger brands. Then they designed a logo out of different shapes to show the different personalities in the co-op.“We called this our Suma of parts and used these shapes to create the logo type. This\u0026nbspdynamic pattern can be used on the packaging at\u0026nbspdifferent levels,” Ferguson says.Suma’s inhouse design team picked some of the trickiest products for Pearlfisher to work on in the redesign, including fiddly products with small labels, like pate tubes, and some that didn’t obviously fit into one range, like coconut products.Pearlfisher turned their designs into a set of packs for Suma’s inhouse designers to roll out across old and new lines. The agency also introduced colour palettes to make different products more identifiable. They used earthy tones for the basic products, simple colours for unprocessed food and bright, natural colours for processed pastas and peanut butter. For the premium products, like speciality coffee, they used a charcoal colour palette with pops of colour.The most important thing, says David Jenkinson, creative designer at Pearlfisher, was creating a sense of the collective in all the elements. “The new identity embodies the idea that this is a collective of iniduals,” he says. “They are aligned, they sing from the same hymn sheet, but they are different.”The new\u0026nbspcolourful logo, with its tessellating shapes, will be seen on lorries up and down the country and on tins and tubes of Suma products in wholefood stockists\u0026nbspfrom January.\u0026nbspWhole Foods releases its 2019 list of new food trendsA key part of Hatton’s job has been communicating the new design to staff internally. In a company where 200 people can vote on every small change, Suma needed a process to make sure the redesign wasn’t delayed by disagreements. “We didn’t want 200 people deciding what colours to use!” says Hatton. Instead the branding team built a case for the rebrand and wrote a business plan. They took the plan to workers, who voted it through. Then the designers were free to make decisions, with in-house work making sure workers were happy with the results.“It’s probably been a little slower, just generally because we’re trying to get consensus and make sure people are behind everything before we proceed,” Hatton says. Some longstanding members wanted to stick with the existing designs, because they saw that it had worked. Hatton and other Suma members listened to them and tried to alleviate any concerns. “In a typical commercial industry people just get told what is happening,” she says. “The difference is that we want people to be passionate about it.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores.

With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. Disney pulled it out of the bag once again with this tale of\u0026nbspa world run by animals,\u0026nbspin which a bunny (Ginnifer Goodwin) attempts to break out of her rural roots to become a city cop.\u0026nbspOne of the best animations of the decade.\u0026nbspHaving time off work over Christmas provides you with time to catch up with the classics you might not have seen. Start with Rear Window, the Alfred Hitchcock thriller following a housebound photographer who becomes convinced his neighbour has murdered his wife.Gremlins may have seemed like a risky experiment (it’s a creature feature Christmas horror comedy, after all), but it’s one that paid off. When a teenager is given a cute new pet named Gizmo, he’s instructed to follow a set of three rules, which he swiftly breaks. You know the rest...Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Channel 5, 1.05pmIf you’ve not seen this musical – which features a standout performance from screen legend Howard Keel, and deserves as much love as Stanley Donen’s other classic, Singin’ in the Rain – this Christmas is the time to\u0026nbsprectify that oversight.\u0026nbspThe BBC’s big premiere is Disney’s live-action remake of The Jungle Book, which was released to acclaim back in 2016. Director Jon Favreau (Iron Man) did such a good job, the studio handed him the reins for a similar\u0026nbspLion King remake,\u0026nbspwhich will be released in cinemas in the summer of 2019.Naming your favourite Pixar film is an increasingly difficult task, but Monsters, Inc should always be in contention. In it, monster\u0026nbspduo Sulley and Mike Wazowski (brilliantly voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal) live in a city fuelled by children’s screams, which is turned upside down by the arrival of a young girl named Boo.Song of the Sea, Channel 4, 5.40amThis little-seen fantasy film, an Irish co-production, charts the journey of a young boy who discovers that his mute sister is a mythical\u0026nbspselkie. The beautiful hand-drawn animation alone makes it\u0026nbspworth your time.Raiders of the Lost Ark, BBC1, 1.25pmAs is Christmas norm, the BBC will show the original Indiana Jones trilogy over three consecutive nights. Apologies to Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but there’s no denying the franchise\u0026nbsppeaked with its debut – an adventure film unlike any in existence.Saving Mr Banks is a worthy watch if only for the on-screen chemistry between Emma Thompson – here starring as Mary Poppins creator, PL Travers – and Tom Hanks who plays the man responsible for bringing the character\u0026nbspto screen: Walt Disney. John Lee Hancock’s film brings the emotion (all together now) in the most delightful waaaay.The Pirates! In An Adventure with Scientists!, BBC1, 9.25amCast-iron proof that Aardman Animation is every bit as good as\u0026nbspPixar and DreamWorks. This feature takes viewers to the high seas for an adventure centred on Hugh Grant’s kooky captain.Bond 23 may be patchy, but it features several highlights, namely Javier Bardem’s genuinely eerie bad guy. The thrilling opening sequence is\u0026nbspone of the most memorable in 007 history.Jimi: All Is by My Side, BBC2, 12.50amThis music drama was a festival favourite upon its release in 2013. Written by 12 Years a Slave scribe John Ridley, it charts the beginning of Jimi Hendrix’s career, weighted by an impressive lead performance from Outkast’s André Benjamin.\u0026nbspPerhaps the most entertaining Jane Austen adaptation there is. Gwyneth Paltrow leads the troupe as the eponymous character who plays matchmaker in her small community in 19th-century England. Toni Collette and Ewan McGregor also star.Whether you’ve recently seen its new sequel or you’re planning a cinema trip before the new year, Wreck-It Ralph is undoubtedly worth your time. The voice work of John C Reilly and Sarah Silverman – who plays video game character Vanelloppe von Schweetz – is Disney’s most compelling since Goodman and Crystal’s in Monsters, Inc.Watched Rear Window the other day? Now it’s time to tick another Hitchcock classic off the list (or re-watch it for the hundredth time). This regular fixture at the top of “Best of...” lists demands to be devoured.If it seems like\u0026nbspGroundhog Day’s on television at the same time every year, that’s probably the point. Harold Ramis’s seminal comedy – starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell – is as charming now as it was upon its release 25 years ago.\u0026nbspIf you find the Marvel Cinematic Universe slightly impenetrable, but are on the hunt for an undemanding way in, Ant-Man‘s the film for you. Starring Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas, it’s a film that can be enjoyed by all the family, regardless of whether you like superheroes or not.You’ll laugh, you’ll cry and you’ll cheer in this incredible adaptation, which charts the journey of an Irish woman (Dame Judi Dench) searching for her\u0026nbspson, who was\u0026nbsptaken away by nuns at birth. Steve Coogan, who plays the real-life journalist helping her on her way, co-wrote the Oscar-winning script.While Paddington 2 may still have a 100 per cent score on Rotten Tomatoes, don’t go forgetting that its predecessor was equally as glorious. Paul King brilliantly captures the spirit of Michael Bond’s beloved bear, who finds himself taken in by a kindly family in London after straying from his home turf of Peru.It’s been a rough year for the Star Wars saga, with disappointing box office takings for its second spin-off, Solo. However, The Force Awakens remains a glistening jewel that blends the old and new eras effortlessly, thanks to the capable direction of JJ Abrams.John Michael McDonagh – brother of Three Billboards writer-director Martin McDonagh – followed up his razor-sharp directorial debut The Guard with this shocking murder mystery of sorts. it follows Brendan Gleeson’s priest who is warned, in confession by an unknown member of his congregation, that he’ll\u0026nbspbe killed in a week’s time.Created with Sketch.15 Christmas films to watch on Netflix  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Christmas Chronicles, a holiday adventure from producer Chris Columbus (“Home Alone”, Harry Potter) and director Clay Kaytis (The Angry Birds Movie), tells the story of sister and brother, Kate (Darby Camp) and Teddy Pierce (Judah Lewis), whose Christmas Eve plan to catch Santa Claus (Kurt Russell) on camera turns into an unexpected journey that most kids could only dream about.

A second series has been commissioned.  210 9) Cunk on BritainHow much you enjoyed Philomena Cunk\u0027s history of Britain depended on how funny you find Diane Morgan\u0027s resting confused face. I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair.

And I love him and that – I don’t blame him. But I was angry, and I got into trouble,” he says.“I had the Old Bill round my gaff every five minutes. I was a wrong ’un. No one knew how to help me. Then I found a father figure I didn’t even know I needed.“I went for an audition for a play and I met this old geezer who wrote it. He was an East Ender, he was a West Ham fan just like me. He thought I was alright and he gave me the part. Turns out it was a fella called Harold Pinter.“He became the most influential man in my life… He taught me that where I came from didn’t dictate where I went to.”He goes on to add: “Life can get a little stressful and we might get on each other’s nerves a bit, but remember how much there is to be proud of, to be grateful of, and get yourself a Harold, you know, if you can … Merry Christmas, my loves.”Danny Dyer’s Alternative Christmas Message airs on Christmas Day at 3.50pm on Channel 4Enter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Quentin Crisp, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Brigitte Bardot, Edward Snowden and Brendan Cox have all given past speeches.Dyer provided one of the TV highlights of the year\u0026nbspin June when he appeared on ITV’s Good Evening Britain -\u0026nbspas part of a surreal panel also including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and ex-Baywatch star Pamela Anderson – and launched into an impassioned rant against Brexit and former prime minister David Cameron.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Who knows about Brexit? No one has got a fucking clue what Brexit is, yeah.

He’s in Europe, in Nice, with his trotters up, yeah? Where is the geezer?\u0026nbspI think he should be held to account for it.\u0026nbspTwat.”In November, Dyer continued his diatribe against the British political class and the “age of food banks”\u0026nbspin The Big Issue.“Theresa May, bless her, just got that job by default,” he told the magazine. “Boris Johnson running around with his stupid haircut, spouting bollocks. Young people look and think: ‘If these are the people running the country, why shouldn’t I just go and loot and riot?’”“Politicians are just floundering around. They have been given this thing called fucking Brexit because of one man. One man. Who we voted in to be our prime minister, who purely for his own ego decided to call a referendum just to get rid of Nigel Farage.“Well, fuck you\u0026nbspCameron, you posh twat. Sorry. It backfired on him, didn’t it? And what does he do? He fucks off. He doesn’t like the way it went and he fucks off.”The Londoner’s plainspeaking on TV and on Twitter has made him a folk hero over the years and his vitriol on Brexit\u0026nbspsaw him become an immediate fixture in Cold War Steve’s satirical photomontages on Twitter, as high an honour as 2018 had to offer.Dyer – who first rose to fame starring in low-budget Cockney gangster films and as host of Danny Dyer’s Deadliest Men -\u0026nbspwill also address American politics in his Christmas Day broadcast, describing Donald Trump as an “absolute melt”. He previously asked his Twitter followers:\u0026nbsp“Is it me or is this geezer completely off his strange-looking nut?”One of his most famous tweets of all concerned events across the pond in 2012:\u0026nbsp“Can’t believe it’s nearly 11 years since them slags smashed into the Twin Towers. It still freaks my nut\u0026nbspout to this day.”As for the Queen, his rival for viewing figures on 25 December, Dyer is actually distantly related to her, as we learnt from a memorable 2016 instalment of the BBC’s Who Do You Think You Are?, which traced his East End roots back to the Tudor epoch and Edward III, a revelation he was stunned by.“I think I’m going to treat myself to a ruff… Just get a massive ruff, just bowl about with it and if anyone questions it then I’ll explain to them why I’m wearing a ruff,” he said, rather touchingly.\u0026nbspWishing the Queen a happy 90th birthday on an episode of ITV’s Celebrity Juice, he said: “You probably ain’t got a clue who I am… Go out tonight and get off your fucking nut. Enjoy yourself!”The author of The World According to Danny Dyer (2015) has done some of his very best work on social media, routinely dishing out deathless wisdom in his signature style: “I hate that early bird. You know, the one who catches the worm. Get back in ya nest ya feathery little mug.”On Christmas, he posted in 2013:\u0026nbsp“Just whacked me tree up. It’s looking slightly camp this year.\u0026nbspCan’t work out how to give it a pair of bollocks.”On pubs:\u0026nbsp”You’re going in for a drink and a laugh with your mates.

Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.On health and good living:\u0026nbsp“If the body is a temple, mine’s a fucking windowless shed.”He’s always great value on a chat show, whether playing “Play Your Slags Right” with Alan Carr or telling Jonathan Ross: “You know you’ve made it when you’re plotted in your gaff in front of a fire drinking a Slush Puppy.”His acceptance speech at the National Television Awards in 2016 for his role as Mick Carter on EastEnders was also unforgettable:\u0026nbsp“I want to thank me mum and dad for having a roll-about in 1977 and conceiving me!”Aside from David Cameron, Danny Dyer has saved his most devastating put-downs for right-wing columnist Katie Hopkins, who criticised his wife Joanne Mas for proposing to him.“No man wants his wife to have the look of Wilfred Bramble either… strange old world innit,” he replied.Not finished there, Danny subsequently delivered one of the great insults of our time, tweeting:\u0026nbsp“When did Katie Hopkins realise her face looks like someone’s punched a lasagne.

And thus did Charles Dickens become the man who invented Christmas as we know it today.\u0026nbspThe great Dickens scholar FG\u0026nbspKitton said so in an essay in 1903, and the great Downton Abbey actor Dan Stevens proved it to be true by starring in the 2017 film The Man Who Invented Christmas.Charles Dickens: The man who invented Christmas plagiarised JesusAnd yet, bah, humbug and damn those pesky experts: lots of them disagree.\u0026nbspIndeed, no less an authority than the US university-based Dickens Project now advises: “It is the smart thing to say that Dickens was the man who “invented” Christmas.

After A Christmas Carol, people become obsessed with celebrating Christmas.“Before, there were people who were, like Scrooge’s nephew, doing their own family Christmases, but after, suddenly everyone is thinking: ‘We should be doing that.\u0026nbspWhy haven’t we got people coming round and playing blind man’s buff?’“It all starts to get much bigger.”Newspapers began to notice the establishment of “plum pudding clubs” to help less well-heeled Victorians meet the cost of their Christmas dinner, so they too, like the Cratchit family, could hear “the pudding singing in the copper”.\u0026nbspOther clubs helped them buy a goose, maybe even a “prize turkey” as big as the boy asked to fetch it by the reformed Scrooge.And, says Ms Hawksley, fewer employers wanted to look like the unreformed Scrooge: “It became fashionable for people to expect that they could have time off at Christmas.”Nor did Dickens stop at A Christmas Carol.\u0026nbspHe wrote four more Christmas books.\u0026nbspThen in 1850 he brought out the first “Christmas Number” of his newly created magazine Household Words, working with other writers to pack it with stories for the consumption of “the teeming millions”, as Reverend JH\u0026nbspMorgan called the intended readership of the two-penny weekly.He became, as the Morning Chronicle put it, “the chief literary master of the ceremonies for Christmas”.But, Ms Hawksley\u0026nbspemphasises, when he started it all with A Christmas Carol, Dickens had been seeking to do far more than simply become a sidekick to Father Christmas.\u0026nbsp“It was done as a protest,” says Ms Hawksley.\u0026nbsp “Christmas Carol was written from the heart, from Dickens feeling a desperate need to create change.”These were the “hungry Forties”, a decade when Britain was in the grip of economic depression, when harvests failed and food prices were rising beyond the reach of many on low incomes.\u0026nbspIn May 1843 Dickens had railed against the wealthy attendees of a City of London charity dinner, calling them “sleek, slobbering, bow-paunched, overfed, apoplectic, snorting cattle”.\u0026nbspThey offered a stark contrast to the poverty he was encountering with ever greater frequency on his customary long walks through London.Then in October Dickens was invited to give a fundraising speech at the Athenaeum in Manchester.\u0026nbspThis was the same Manchester where Friedrich Engels was beavering away at what would be published as The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844.\u0026nbspEngels sought to shame the Victorian manufacturing class by documenting the “the misery and grime which form the complement of their wealth”.\u0026nbspHe told of workers living in overcrowded slums complete with “foul pools of stagnant urine and excrement”, forced by “barbarous” employers to “work 30 to 40 hours at a stretch”, with child factory hands dying or being reduced to “a crowd of cripples” before they could reach adulthood.\u0026nbspHe wrote A Christmas Carol in just six weeks.\u0026nbsp“He saw galloping poverty,” explains Ms Hawksley, “And a government doing nothing about it.\u0026nbspHe couldn’t let it continue.\u0026nbspHe was desperate to do something.”Into the mouth of Scrooge, Dickens inserted what, in his Manchester speech, he had called the “cruel absurdities” of the age.\u0026nbspTo the charitable gentleman seeking alms for the poor, Scrooge offers only a reference to the treadmill of the workhouse, which was about the only official social security option then available.When the gentleman suggests the poor would rather die than enter the workhouse, Scrooge answers: “If they would rather die, they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.”The remark comes to haunt Scrooge once the ghosts start arriving, but it wasn’t far off what many thought about the poor being an unconscionable drain on the finite resources of a population that could not keep expanding forever.\u0026nbspIn most of his books, Dickens wanted to shame his readers into doing something,” says Ms Hawksley.\u0026nbsp “What he wants people to realise is that every single person is, like Scrooge, responsible for the poor they are ignoring.“The point about Scrooge’s conversion is not that he buys the most expensive turkey.\u0026nbspIt’s that the turkey will feed a family.“For Dickens, it’s not about diamonds, or going out and buying a load of plastic crap like people do at Christmas today.\u0026nbspIt’s about the fact that buying decent food and giving Bob Cratchit a salary increase will save Tiny Tim from dying.”Nowhere, says Ms Hawksley, is the central message of A Christmas Carol more clearly stated than when the Ghost of Christmas Present shows Scrooge two emaciated children, a boy named Ignorance and a girl called Want.\u0026nbsp“Beware of them both,” the spirit tells Scrooge –\u0026nbspand the reader.\u0026nbsp “But most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased.”“Dickens was saying,” explains Ms Hawksley, “that if you let Ignorance and Want grow up like that, they will become the Bill Sykes, the cruel and violent adults, of the future.“Ignorance and Want are, in Dickens’ mind, about the most important characters in the book, the whole message, the whole point of it.”What frustrates her more, however, is that 175 years after Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol, Britain remains blighted by the kind of poverty he was hoping to eradicate.“Dickens was writing about this in 1843,” she says.\u0026nbsp“How in 2018 can we have the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty talking about child poverty in the UK?\u0026nbspHow can there be so many homeless people on the streets of London?“How can I be hearing news stories that Christmas 2018 will be a so-called “bumper year” for the numbers of children suffering in cold houses because people can’t afford to heat their homes?\u0026nbspThere is absolutely no excuse for it when today we have

The Infinity-O screen has already been used on the Samsung Galaxy A8, meaning the other three could be used in the three expected variants of the Galaxy S10.Previous rumours suggest the three iterations will be called the Galaxy S10 Lite, the Galaxy S10\u0026nbspand the Galaxy S10+.The three versions are expected to vary in size and price, ranging from £699 for the cheapest and smallest 128GB S10\u0026nbspLite\u0026nbspversion, to £1,399 for the biggest and most expensive 1TB S10+ version.S10 (Creative Commons, mobil-helden)Other rumours surrounding the Samsung Galaxy S10\u0026nbspsuggest it may feature a self-healing screen, which makes use of a protective material to help prevent scratches.A Samsung patent for the screen describes an anti-fingerprinting composition having a self-healing property, and a film, a laminate, and a device including the anti-fingerprinting composition, for use in a portable electronic device such as a smart phone or tablet.The Galaxy S10\u0026nbspwill be unveiled at a Samsung event ahead of the Mobile World Congress conference in Barcelona, according to sources at a major tech retailer cited by the Gizmodo\u0026nbspwebsite.\u0026nbspSamsung has not revealed the exact date of the release, but the smartphone is expected to be released on 8 March 2019.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/27/17/rts1a6jk.jpg","title":"slack ban accounts us sanctions cuba iran","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

First, there isn’t going to be a New Year election and, even if\u0026nbspMr Corbyn was in charge, Brussels would still demand the same “backstop”\u0026nbspto protect the Irish border in the orce agreement.Either his understanding of the Brexit impasse doesn’t extend beyond key stage one level or he is guilty of the same charge he levels at Theresa May – of running down the clock, rather than making hard choices.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal BrexitLabour’s Brexit policy, such as it is, is set out in the “composite motion” agreed after many hours of agonised bargaining by more than 200 people at the party’s conference in September.It vows to defeat the prime minister’s deal and then “support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote” should Labour not be able to secure a general election.All clear? No, of course not – because, in the three months since, Mr Corbyn has never set out what the other “options” might be, beyond his support for a permanent customs union.Most political observers believe there are three crashing out of the EU with no deal, softer ‘Norway-style’ exit terms (but with the backstop) and a Final Say referendum.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

There are a variety of options, but all have serious problems and would be unlikely to keep everyone happy.Here are the main possibilities – and what’s wrong with them all.The most obvious option is to rerun the 2016 EU referendum question and simply ask people whether they want to remain in the European Union or leave it.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut this question repeats the same mistakes as the last vote: what does “leave” actually mean? The government is currently in deadlock and the referendum is supposed to let the people decide,\u0026nbspbut this question simply doesn’t solve the problem the government is facing. If Leave wins again, we’re back to square one. As a result, it’s unlikely to be asked.\u0026nbspRemain vs Theresa May’s deal vs no dealSplitting out no deal and May’s deal seems to be a logical response to the problems with the last question. Voters would be able to choose between any of the three options.But this would split the Leave vote, leaving Remain to almost certainly win. Most unsustainably, it could even produce a Remain win when the majority of people actually vote for Leave options. Democratically, this is a non-starter\u0026nbspand would reasonably be seen as a stitch-up.‘Do you approve of the Brexit deal negotiated by the government?’The government could simply ask voters to approve or reject the Brexit deal. This suffers from similar problems as the first question: if the deal is rejected, what happens? Do we leave with no deal? Or remain?\u0026nbspIt might prove attractive as a roll of the dice for a government trying to ram through the deal without its MPs – or then again it might not\u0026nbspbecause the public would probably vote it down, according to current polls. This also has no ‘remain’ option so would surely disappoint the main people who want a second referendum – remain voters.One proposal is to ask the questions in two rounds: first, whether voters accept or reject the deal. Then, if it’s rejected, whether they want to remain or leave without a deal.\u0026nbspYou could also ask the questions in a different order if you wanted – leave vs remain first, and then pick between no deal and Therea May’s deal if it’s a Leave vote. But whatever order you ask the questions in, there is a fundamental issue here.Is it really a good idea to put no deal on the ballot paper, and risk giving the government an explicit binding mandate to create food and medicine shortages?\u0026nbspCurrently, parliament can stop a no deal and credibly claim it isn’t what people voted for. But holding this referendum puts economic catastrophe back on the table and could make the situation infinitely worse – which raises the question of why you would want to hold it at all.\u0026nbspPolling suggests that no deal is more popular than May’s deal – it is not impossible that it could win, given voters chose Leave last time.\u0026nbspThis no-deal problem\u0026nbspis a thread that runs through many second referendum options. Explicitly putting it on the ballot paper is probably not a good idea. But not putting it on the ballot paper doesn’t solve the problem.You could ask the three-way question and give\u0026nbspvoters the options of\u0026nbspranking the options, then tally them up using\u0026nbspan alternative vote\u0026nbsp(AV). This is practically the same as two-round voting and has the same problem – no deal is on the ballot.There are also extra problems, such as the fact that AV can produce some quite unintuitive results – and the fact that the system was explicitly rejected for parliamentary elections at a referendum in 2011, so its use would certainly be contested.This is the option favoured by the People’s Vote campaign. In some ways it is the least worst: it rules out no deal. Remainers will like it because it offers them the option of staying. It is also explicit about what each option means, so it solves the deadlock.But it runs the risk of being seen as illegitimate: the fact remains that a not insignificant number of people are actively campaigning for leaving on World Trade Organisation terms without a deal. Many Brexiteers say they see Theresa May’s deal as “no Brexit at all”. They would consider this question a betrayal – forced to choose between two things they don’t want, despite having won the first vote.There is also the question of political deliverability. The country has a Tory government, and if there are two things that the vast majority of Tory MPs don’t want to vote for, they are: Remain, and Theresa May’s deal. So why would they pass a referendum that forces them to choose between two options they hate?Any question with ‘negotiate a different deal’ or ‘Norway’ as an optionThe EU has said it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, so putting it as an option in a referendum would be meaningless. If it was voted for the government would be stuck.Similarly, suggestions that a soft Brexit like the Norway option\u0026nbsp(entry into the European Economic Area) or similar could be on the ballot papers misunderstand the situation. The government needs to pass the withdrawal agreement before April or extend or revoke Article 50. Having a referendum on the future relationship is fine, but it wouldn’t solve the problem\u0026nbspand isn’t an alternative to working out what to do with the withdrawal agreement.So in summary…You either risk causing an economic catastrophe by putting no deal on the ballot paper, you exclude no deal as an option and risk the referendum being seen as illegitimate by the people who won last time, or you don’t solve the actual dilemma the government is currently facing.\u0026nbspThat isn’t to take away from the compelling case for a Final Say referendum, which The Independent\u0026nbsphas campaigned for at length\u0026nbspand collected more than a million signatures in favour of. Done right, another vote\u0026nbspcould solve the UK’s political deadlock, check whether the public still want to leave, and spell out what’s really on offer. But if one is called, the question will have to be chosen carefully, with an awareness of the tradeoffs.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Parliament has taken it. We know the options for Brexit. Parliament will have to decide on one of them. If parliament can’t then it should decide to go back to the people.“Now should be the time of preparation – parliament to make sure it can canvas the options in sensible manner, one by one, to reach agreement on an option or a referendum Europe to ensure that if Britain is ready to think again, Europe is ready also to think again.“All that is necessary is for leadership: in parliament if not in government, and in Europe where despite all the myriad of challenges European leaders have, they should understand that changing Brexit would be the greatest boost to Europe’s economy and politics and that therefore, they need to focus on the part they can play and play it.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

As I understand it he said ‘stupid people’.”The spokesman told reporters: “Lip reading in such circumstances is always open to doubt.”As tempers flared, John Bercow, the Commons speaker, said he did not see or hear the alleged remark, but made clear: “Is that language unacceptable? Yes.”He also urged Mr Corbyn “to return to the chamber” to hear his verdict on what happened later this afternoon, after watching the TV footage.Corbyn\u0027s barely there leadership could lead to mutiny – againLabour \u0027would fall behind Lib Dems\u0027 if Corbyn backs May\u0027s Brexit dealJeremy Corbyn accuses May of presiding over \u0027government in chaos\u0027In a BBC TV studio, Barry Gardiner, a Labour frontbencher and Corbyn ally, said he was “not a lipreader” but agreed it appeared that Mr Corbyn had said “stupid woman”.The row blew up after Ms May likened Mr Corbyn’s attempt to force a confidence vote in her earlier this week to a Christmas pantomime – accusing him of dithering.First he said he would call a no confidence vote, Then he said he wouldn’t. Then he did, but it was not effective. “Oh yes he will, oh no he won’t,” she taunted – saying the Labour leader should “look behind him” at his own despairing MPs.But Mr Corbyn hit back, saying it was the prime minister’s job to deliver the negotiation and, if she was incapable of doing so, she should step aside for someone who can.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereVote of no confidenceOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Yet all too often, their needs are ignored.My own family started as blacksmiths in Uttoxeter, Staffs.In , my father, Joseph Cyril Bamford, rented a lock-up garage for  shillings a week.He developed Europe’s first hydraulic tipping trailer for use by local farmers — and then, in , the backhoe loader, the classic JCB digger.JCB — JC Bamford Excavators Ltd — has produced more than a million machines.We have a turnover of more than £billion and factories around the world.Yet we remain a proud ­family business, headquartered in the Midlands and employing thousands of people there.Ours is not a unique success story. Yet it is rarer than it should be.Our main factory in Staffs used to be surrounded by thriving family manufacturers, mostly in the Black Country, Birmingham and Manchester.Over the decades, they have disappeared — because of tax regimes that made it impossible to pass firms on, or takeovers that stripped away what was special about the company, or government mandarins who thought they knew better what industry needed.In Germany, their world-class manufacturing sector thrives because they champion family firms, not least via tax breaks that make it normal for ownership to move across generations.In Britain, the tax system pushes entrepreneurs to sell up, and family businesses find it harder to get finance.No wonder that fewer than  per cent expect to keep their firm in the family.Yet we at JCB still have many excellent family firms among our suppliers — and our customers.In manufacturing, there are more than a quarter of a million family companies, employing more than a million people in jobs that add real value to the community.And such firms are found in every sector of the economy, not just ours.A company such as JCB is big enough to stand up for, and speak for, itself.But too many small firms do not get a hearing in government.Despite the fact that small and medium-sized enterprises — SMEs — are creating almost three times as many jobs as larger firms, it is the voice of the giants that dominates.Yes, these large firms contribute enormously to the economy, but they tend to be the most comfortable with the status quo.They might moan about regulation but they can afford to deal with it, knowing that it deters their smaller competitors.They see Brexit, for example, in terms of costs, rather than opportunities. This is reflected in government.Theresa May’s approach to Brexit was safety-first, focusing on protecting the cross-border supply chains of the multi-nationals.Yet  per cent of British firms do not export. Their main worries are to do with competition and regulation.But regulation, in particular, is harder to addresswe are still following European rules — as is striking new trade deals.Protecting the big companies means reducing opportunities for little ones.I voted, proudly and publicly, for Leave.I believe there is nothing to fear in trading on World Trade Organisation terms, as we at JCB already do — exporting to, and importing from, dozens of countries around the world.But this is not about Brexit. Millions of business owners throughout the country feel they are not represented or spoken for.Polling by Deltapoll recently found that even Tory voters do not think their party is on the side of small business.For the politicians who listen to these firms, the rewards will be political as well as economic.I have spent my le working in a family business.I believe family businesses, of all sizes, are tied to and invested in their communities in a way other firms can never be.And I worry that Britain has a model of tax, regulation and politics in which everything is arranged to suit the big firms on the FTSE, not those that might one day hope to replace them.Whatever the outcome of the Brexit wrangling, we can only succeed long termwe make Britain the best place in the world to start, run and keep a business of your own.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Others want to strip us of the power to decline the EU’s dodgy deal and get out. It is appalling.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says derailing Brexit would be “dangerous for the fabric of democracy” and “disastrous” for the Tories. He’s right.Some Tory Remainers seem past caring.THE nanny state brigade won’t be satisfied until Mars bars are a ten-quid luxury and broccoli compulsory.The Sun long ago warned that the fizzy drinks tax was a gateway to  punitive levies on every other treat.Sure enough, chief medical officer Sally Davies now wants taxes on chocolate, crisps, milkshakes, even coffee.

above all  is a sign that the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party are prepared to back her Brexit deal.“Without the DUP, they haven’t got a chance of passing it,” warns one Cabinet minister.What, then, do the DUP need to come on board One Secretary of State who has kept open lines of communication with them, tells me that “by grim necessity, they will need something more than cosmetic concessions to vote for the deal”.This minister explains that “the DUP want a bankable reassurance that the backstop won’t be permanent and that there won’t be progressive ergence between Great Britain and Northern Ireland”.The good news for Theresa May is that, according to one of those intimately involved in the negotiations, “the DUP want to sort things out”.“Relations between the leadership and the DUP had been in the deep freeze, they are somewhat better,” one Cabinet minister tells me.Adding that “the carelessness with which some of the principals have been treated has been repaired”.But the bad news for Theresa May is that the changes they want are signicant — and the EU aren’t going to offer them up straight away.The only way to get these changes might be to have Parliament vote for them and tell the EU that this is how the deal can get through and seethey are prepared to cooperate, or whether they’ll crash the entire Brexit negotiation over these additions.But one senior Cabinet minister laments that “Number  is miles away from being in that position”.This Secretary of State is adamant that they are “going to have to move”.Intriguingly, I am told the Irish have, via diplomatic back channels, communicated that one of the reasons they wouldn’t give May what she wanted at last week’s European Council was that they weren’t certain that what she was asking for would satisfy the DUP.I understand that privately senior Irish figures have been making clear thatthey knew precisely what the DUP wanted, they could then engage with that.I am told the Government will devote the dog days between Christmas and New Year to exploring what the DUP will accept, and what the EU can give.Getting the DUP back on board is vital for May because without that there is no chance of reducing the Tory rebellion down to a manageable size.The Tory machine is having a bit of success in whittling down the numbers against May’s deal.One hardcore Brexiteer admits that some backbench rebels “will go a bit soft”.But this sht is not yet anywhere near big enough to save May’s deal.Some in Cabinet are pinning their hopes on “people coming back after Christmas more pragmatic and less militant”.But one of those who has been trying to reduce the rebellion wearily remarks, “I don’t see much evidence of that.”The person who in Parliament, perhaps, knows the Tory Party best tells me that the equation is this: “If they get a legally binding codicil on the backstop, they’ll get it through.If they don’t, they won’t.”Over to you, Mrs May.A TORY MP is already telling colleagues that he has submitted his letter calling for a no-confidence vote in Theresa May next December.It is another reminder that the leadership issue isn’t going to go away.One loyalist Cabinet minister argues thatMay makes it through Brexit, she should then announce the timetable for her departure at conference next year.Having said when she’s off would probably be enough to prevent a confidence vote next December and allow her to leave with some dignity.May, though, is unlikely to bite on this idea.She is extremely resistant to boxing herself in on a departure date.The confidence vote has won May some time.But she won’t make next Decembershe interprets the result as a licence to carry on as before.One senior party figure is already complaining that she’s “not prepared to make the personnel changes that would help her own position”.While one figure inside the Government machine fumes that “the left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing in Number  and that is causing havoc for the rest of us”.Meanwhile, ambitious Cabinet ministers are continuing to lay the ground for their leadership bids.But as one Secretary of State points out, “It is normally the manner and nature of the departure that determines the successor” which is one of the reasons why the coming Tory leadership race will be the most unpredictable contest in living memory.THE Tory rage at Jeremy Corbyn over his alleged “stupid woman” comment at Prime Minister’s Questions was fuelled by a sense that the Speaker John Bercow is biased against them.As Anna Soubry, who is normally infuriating her fellow Tories by calling for a second referendum, pointed out: If it had been a Tory man who had apparently said it about a Labour woman, Bercow would have been all over it.In recent months, senior Labour figures have openly admitted that they are prepared to turn a blind eye to the allegations of bullying against Bercow because they think he’ll help them on Brexit.This is an untenable position – it is like a team keeping a referee on the pitch because they think he’ll give them a penalty in injury time.As Wednesday showed, we are dangerously close to the Tory side of the chamber simply not accepting Bercow’s authority.One senior Tory backbencher, who has defended the Speaker in the past, tells me “it felt like an insurrection”.The tragedy of Bercow’s speakership is that once gone, the chair’s reputation for impartiality will be almost impossible to restore.MPs will never again trust in the neutrality of the Speaker as they once did.THERESA MAY is planning a New Year charm offensive as she tries to persuade Tory MPs to back her Brexit deal.All of them – and their spouses – have been invited to a party in Downing Street in the week of January , which is when the Commons debate on her deal resumes.The implicit message is clear: If the Government falls over Brexit and the Tories tear themselves apart over the issue, then there won’t be any more invites to Number  for you and your partner for a very long time.Whether this is enough to win round any wavering Tory MPs remains to be seen.It is going to take more than a few drinks to make the hardcore Brexiteers swallow their objections to the backstop.EvenTheresa May can win the big vote on her Brexit deal, she won’t be home and dry.Once the vote is won, the withdrawal agreement will have to be turned into law.This will provide plenty of opportunities for guerrilla warfare in Parliament.Cabinet ministers are particularly worried that rebels might put down an amendment making the payment of the £billion orce bill conditional on progress in the trade talks.If that passed, the EU would say that the UK hasn’t ratied the agreement and so there was no deal.Our journalists strive

We have minds of our own, and we need to take responsibility for our own actions.The reappearance of naked prejudice on the terraces can’t be blamed on anyone other than the racists themselves — and the other fans who stay silent instead of calling out the racists.These people should be named and shamed. Social media could be put to good use by posting a rogues’ gallery on every  and the faces of the bigots should be prominent, so that their wives, mothers and children can see what they’ve done. Roll on #stampoutracism.But the mystery is why there is an upsurge in such incidents right now.I, for one, thought that with the determined efforts of the clubs, led by the Kick It Out campaign, such scenes would cease. But I should have known better. Back in the early Seventies I lived ten minutes from Stamford Bridge — but I never went to home games.When it became fashionable to throw darts at our own fans, a black face standing in the Shed was nothing less than a walking bullseye.By the mid-Nineties I hoped it would be OK to bring my seven-year-old daughter and her pals to a game.Surely, there could be no danger in seats below the directors’ boxes, away from the common herd It took  minutes for me to learn the truth as two men in front of us leapt up to abuse the Sheffield Wednesday midfielder Carlton Palmer, screaming “You lanky-legged black ****”.I tapped one on the shoulder. He looked around, saw my face, and immediately apologised profusely. But the damage was done.Three weeks later, I attended a dinner at the City of London’s most glittering venue, the Guildhall.Suddenly, I found myself confronted by a familiar face — one of the same two men who had sat in the stand in front of us.A true racist, yet here he was, suave, suited and booted, at the heart of the British establishment. So much for the idea that all racists are ignorant, lower-class idiots.So what’s happened It seems bizarre that the Premier League, dominated by foreign players, many of them black, should still suffer from prejudice.And with top teams regularly playing in Europe, plus a successful England team nearly half of whose members are black or mixed race it’s hard to see why fans should start throwing bananas on the pitch again.But the truth is that many of the factors that drove racism on the terraces have never gone away, and have never been challenged effectively. Yes, recent political arguments about the EU and about immigration have allowed some of the scumbags who the game thought it had chased away to resurface with renewed bravado.It’s also possible that the increase in the number of fans from Eastern Europe, where attitudes to ersity are decidedly less tolerant, may have had an effect.Perhaps some of the brilliant players from Europe who now grace the English game might put themselves in the front line of their re-education.Butthe game wants to stamp out racism for good it needs to take a long, hard look at itself.In the Premier League, around one in five players are black.The number of black owners and coaches is negligible. This is sending out the worst message imaginable.I welcome the advent of great players like N’Golo Kante, Romelu Lukaku, and Dele Alli. But this is a sport owned and run almost exclusively by white men, who buy and sell black men at will.Yes, of  course, the heaviest weight that the players have to lt is their own multimillion-pound pay packets, so I don’t seek sympathy for them.But basically, football looks like the th-century plantation economy of the American South.It’s time for the game to start taking steps to make sure that its owners, their boards of directors and their executive and coaching staff look more like modern Britain.Arsenal v BurnleyAFC Bournemouth v BrightonCha v Leicester CityHuddersfield Town v SouthamptonManchester City v Crystal PalaceNewcastle United v FulhamWest Ham United v WatfordCardf City v Manchester UnitedIf the people at the top of the game seem to think that it’s OK to treat black people like field slaves, why would they expect the fans to treat the players with respect I saw my first game — Arsenal vs Leicester City — at the old Highbury ground.My dad wanted me to see his hero, the great inside-left George Eastham, in action.He realised that I was too small to see over the parapet, so we took the biggest book we had in the house for me to stand on. I watched Eastham while standing on Uncle Tom’s Cabin, the bestselling anti-slavery novel that had touched off the American Civil War.Maybe every owner needs to be sent a copy of Harriet Beecher Stowe’s book to remind our contemporary plantation bosses that it’s time for them too to confront the bigotry written into the game’s soul.Football’s racism hasn’t gone away, and it never will until we all look at its evil full in the face.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In an exclusive interview with the Sunday Mirror, the Labour leader spelled out his plans for the year ahead. His party has been on a war footing since the last election and he thinks those preparations might come in very useful. On his predictions for , he said: “The Government is going to struggle. It may well resign. There may well be a general election. And I can’t wait.” If Labour wins, he says he already has a Brexit plan –to Brussels and negotiate the best possible deal. And Mr Corbyn insists he will make sure Theresa May’s deal is thrown out by Parliament.   “I’m determined to hold this government to account, vote the deal down and reopen those negotiations,” he declared. “We know what we’re doing. We’re clear on our objectives. This government is getting it badly wrong and a lot of jobs are at riskthey go on like this.” He said the Government had reneged on its vow to hold a meaningful vote and his priority was to secure one soon so the present plan could be voted down. If Britain were to leave the EU, Mr Corbyn added that “on current form we would be very badly off”. He told how a briefing by his shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth had highlighted the dangers of a no-deal Brexit. “Jon gave us an outline at the last Shadow Cabinet meeting of just some problems the NHS would face,” he said.“For example, insulin isn’t made in the UK – it has to be imported from Europe.”   More than a million people with shydiabetes live in the UK, yet the main manufacturers are all based abroad. And Mr Corbyn said quitting the EU without a proper deal would cause other complications.“We’d be stuck in a backstop with no escape unless approved by the EU. Andwe fail to get a deal we’d end up with World Trade Organisation conditions from the end of March. “That would be disastrous for manufacturing. “That’s why I’ve put forward the need for a customs union with the EU and access to the single market.” The May deal will be debated and finally voted on when Parliament s in January. Mr Corbyn said a second referendum was still possible, though he does not feel the House would back such a move. On how he would vote in one, he said: “It would depend what the question was – but we’re quite far from that anyway and I’m not sure there’s the support for it in Parliament.The issue is protecting jobs, manufacturing and the rights and conditions we’ve got – not making us the bargain basement of Europe.” He is confident of being able to shynegotiate successfully with Brussels and would ensure his Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer was involved.  “We’d obviously be doing it jointly,” he said.“I’d be involving my Cabinet in what we did – something Theresa May appears not to do.Keir would be free to travel to Brussels as many times as he likes. The Eurostar is quite good fun.” The final Prime Minister’s Questions of the year saw Mr Corbyn pose a number of queries about Brexit. But they were overshadowed by a row as he was caught on camera muttering something at the Tory benches. Social media was quick to accuse him of mouthing “stupid woman” at the PM. But he says: “I’d put six questions to the Prime Minister. I pointed out they were spending poundbillion of public cash in preparation for a no deal when there are , NHS vacancies and , police officers have lost their jobs. “At the end she and her colleagues – and it all looked pre-orchestrated – turned it into a pantomime. And I just stared at them and muttered to myself, ‘Stupid people’. That’s all. “Minutes later it was all over Twitter. The furore in the media and Parliament after was utterly contrived.”  Mr Corbyn said he was regularly barracked and shouted at during PMQs.“You can’t help but hear it,” he added, “but it doesn’t bother me. I don’t lose sleep on a Tuesday or a Wednesday night. “Or any other night for that matter. If people are shouting at me, they’re usually doing it for a reason.” He contrasted the Commons scenes with another story this week about a homeless man dying at Westminster Tube station – yards from the entrance to Parliament. Mr Corbyn said: “He’s not the first person to die outside Parliament but somehow this is not a story that’s worth talking about. “Hang on, we’re the world’s sixth richest country yet people are out there desperate for something to eat and a warm, dry place to sleep.Like this man. He won’t be the last person to die on our streets.” He told how his Islington constituency has a growing population of outdoor sleepers. “Within five minutes’ walk from here a very large number of people are sleeping rough in Finsbury Park and under the railway bridge there,” he said. “I talk to many of them. “Lots of people round here give them support. That’s great. But they need a place to live.The solution has to be institutionalising food banks and shelters. We need to institutionalise the belief everyone deserves somewhere to live.”  He said meeting a homeless person on a train made him realise how serious the issue is – and he has vowed to end rough sleeping during Labour’s first term.“It’s incredible how people end up on the streets,” said Mr Corbyn. “A guy asked me for some cash on the train last year. I gave him some then asked what happened to him.He told me, ‘A few months ago I felt I was doing well. I got a job as a bar manager, with a flat and decent pay. “Then I found I didn’t actually have a job – I was self-employed so I had no rights.They got rid of me. I explained to my landlord. He said it wasn’t his problem and threw me out.’So in a month this man went from what he thought was secure to sleeping rough.” Mr Corbyn hopes Parliament will give more time to issues affecting the country.“This week there was an hour of Commons time given over to spurious points of order,” he said. “Laura Pidcock raised Universal Credit and poverty but was barracked by Tory MPs.It shows the Tories shypriorities – that they want to ignore the stress people are living under.” "},{"url":null,"title":"yvette cooper its time boost","story":"NewsopinionYvette Cooper: Its time to boost our towns and not lock cash funds in citiesOverall job growth since the last recession has only been half the rate of growth in cities - we need to make sure towns arent left outShareCommentsByYvette CooperMP:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsopinionWe hand out mince pies on Christmas morning in a busy Pontefract centre - and need to support the towns we love \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWe have a nice Christmas tradition in our local Labour Party. Instead of spending Saturday morning in Pontefract and shyCastleford town centres handing out leaflets, we hand out mince pies to say Merry Christmas and thank you instead. Our towns are still busy on Saturday morning but we all know that high streets across the country are facing real pressure as shops close and major retailers pull out. A new report out this week rightly calls for business rates to be cut and overhauled and more support for our town centres. But that’s not enough. The truth is our towns aren’t getting a fair deal. Research done for the Labour Towns group of MPs and councillors found that overall job growth in towns since the last recession has only been half the rate of growth in cities. The economic ide between cities and towns is growing and the Tory Government is making it worse.  Austerity has hit towns and smaller cities hard, so it isn’t just retailers who have been leaving.Often the libraries, police stations, council offices, magistrates courts, swimming pools, community centres, AE or the maternity services have been closed, forcing people to travel to nearby cities instead. Lottery and arts funding is higher in cities too. Manufacturing jobs in towns are being squeezed while new service or creative opportunities are concentrated in cities. Meanwhile most of the transport money goes to London or other major hubs. Buses have been cut.Northern Rail is a nightmare, with passengers having to put up with delays, cancellations, missing carriages and outdated rolling stock. Don’t get me wrong. We need strong and successful cities. Leeds and London, the two cities I know best, are great.  But I grew up in a town and represent four towns – all of which have strong and proud communities, great history and talent for the future, but they need their fair share of investment and opportunity. It’s time to support Britain’s towns. Instead of making everyone travel to cities for public services, we need more in towns. Instead of rolling out new broadband or G infrastructure in cities first, why not start in nearby towns  Instead of always using all the transport money on overruns for big city projects like HS or Crossrail, why not start by improving local trains and buses  The Government seems to thinkyou only support cities, everything will just trickle down and out to the towns, but it hasn’t worked. Let’s have a fair deal to boost our towns and cities together.  Brexit chaos The Government’s Brexit plans are in a total mess. No one likes the Prime Minister’s deal, but she keeps delaying and ruling out every other option, including the Norway option, Canada option or a customs union deal. Cabinet ministers are arguing in public because they can’t agree. If they carry on like this they will push us over a “no deal” clf edge in March. Troops are now on stand-by, medicines are being stockpiled and the NHS, police and businesses are all having to spend billions of pounds preparing for no deal because of this mess.   That money could have been spent on extra nurses or police officers instead. Manufacturers say sudden tarfs and border delays will hit them hard. Police officers say suddenly losing security arrangements will make us less safe. This is totally irresponsible. It’s time for the Government to stop threatening everyone, to rule out “no deal,” and have a proper debate about all the options. We need some common sense in this process before it is too late.

She says for Freya, pretty much every element of Christmas is affected by hearing loss, whether its films without subtitles at the cinema, visiting Santa or increased background noise at events.  We find the sheer volume of activities cause so much fatigue. Each event is harder at Christmas due to increased noise levels, concentration required and amount of people asking her questions, Lynn tells the Mirror.A hearing child can absorb the conversation evenits not directed at them by overhearing, but Freya will ask what has just been said. Evenit wasnt a conversation directed at her its important to repeat it as she has the right to be included. It doesnt matter is a banned phrase in our house - it always does! Lots of us take for granted how easy it is to follow conversations with family and friends, so willingness and patience to repeat phrases for deaf children is crucial. Lynn says some of their favourite activities at Christmas time are dressing up the dogs and watching their favourite festive film The Polar Express - and they can connect it directly to Freyas implants.Although aspects of Christmas are challenge for Freya, she still says she loves it.The eight-year-old tells the Mirror: I wish Christmas would be more quieter so I could hear everything but Christmas is very fun and I have been extremely good this year. Lynn adds: Im proud to be her mum and without being deaf she wouldnt be Freya - she paints a picture when she tells you a story to make sure you understand in the way she sees it and seeing the world though her eyes has given me a new perspective. Parents with deaf children have unique experiences at Christmas time. Stuart Milligan, , and Ros Fowler, , from Stewarton, say that Christmas seems to pass their three-year-old daughter Lois by. At this time of year nurseries are singing songs and telling stories about Santa and doing activities that make Christmas magical for children. Though Lois joins in at nursery, she doesnt understand what it is all about and it can get confused at what is going on around her, Stuart explains. Lois has always loved the sparkly lights so Christmas is great for that but the magic of Santa, of Frosty the Snowman, why you get presents, the trees and decorations and parties, the songs and jingles – its all a mystery for her. The dad says his favourite Christmas memory is from last year, when Lois had her implants switched on for the very first time in mid December after a long battle to get them. Words cant really describe the expression on her face when she discovered our voices, music and the noises of everything around her for the first time.  Stuart says that he felt anxious and uncertain as a parent when deafness was new to the family, as he didnt know what the future would hold for Lois and how her le would be impacted.The family have been proud to see her progress well at nursery and love swimming, gymnastics and dancing - and Stuart believes she can achieve anything she wants to.But he says he wishes people had the patience to make sure deaf children are included at this time of year, when everyone is rushing around to get things sorted. Taking the time to slow down and give a little time to make sure a deaf child understands and feels included is better than any present. The more people that know how to make small changes to their behaviour when with a deaf person, the easier it will be for deaf people to participate, he adds.Lucy Read, Head of Participation at the National Deaf Children’s Society, says there are lots of things people can do to make sure the deaf children in their families, friendship groups and school environments feel included.If everyone works together and picks up some deaf awareness skills, every deaf child can feel part of the celebrations and have the time of their lives this Christmas, she says.The National Deaf Childrens Society has five tips for making sure deaf children are included this Christmas:Deaf children rely on all kinds of signals and clues to communicate, eventhey wear hearing technology. Remember to face them when you’re talking to them, and don’t your hand over your mouth and or talk when you’re eating. If a deaf child misses a joke, or hasnt fully understood a conversation, never say “it doesnt matter.” This can be very upsetting for any deaf person. If it matters enough to share it, share it with them too. A Christmas film is a great way to spend time together, but ensure that the subtitles are available and are set-up and ready to go. No one wants to be an afterthought, or worse still miss out while everyone  enjoys themselves together. Background noise makes things dficult for deaf children. Turn the music down, or better still turn it off and play a game where everyone can be included. Let them choose where to sit at Christmas dinner and ensure the room is well-lit. Dinner is a major highlight and by picking their own seat, a deaf child can be next to the people they find easiest to understand during one of the most dficult parts of the day."},{"url":null,"title":"boy 5 told mum worried","story":"NewsBoy, , told mum he worried about the homeless - so they did something wonderfulKylie OBrien, , of Porthcawl, Wales said her son Osian Harries became concerned about the plight of the homeless after a shopping trip in CardfShareCommentsByPhilip Dewey:,  DEC NewsOsian helped make up  bags of gts and distributed them to the homeless \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA schoolboy has been spreading Christmas cheer to those less fortunate by handing out gts to the homeless.Osian Harries, five, has been on a mission to help give those less fortunate than himself a good Christmas.

Peter and Jean Fowlers Christmas dinner was thrown into turmoil after their local Crawshaws refused to accept their stamps. The couple, from Bransholme, Hull, had saved up for months to treat themselves to a turkey, beef, ham and pork over the festive period. Theyve been told that they wont receive a refund until the new year, and they say theyve been forced to borrow money to pay for their Christmas food, Hull Live reports.   The Fowlers had planned to use their stamps at Crawshaws branch in North Point shopping centre. Mrs Fowler, , said: “I have been buying these stamps since January to pay for all the meat this Christmas, and now I’m being told I can’t use them. “I’m on oxygen at the moment and my husband is out of work, so money is very tight for us and we were relying on these stamps.

Steve Stratton, , quit his job to look after son Joe but was unable to save him from his addiction to prescription drugs, reports Essex Live. Steve said Joe bought hundreds of the pills on the dark web.The -year-old had tried to talk Joe out of his habit but his nightmare came true on September  when he found the body of his son at his flat in Chelmsford, Essex.Steve, who had cared for Joe through his debilitating mental health issues, described the moment he screamed not my boy after finding his son. He admits his le as he knew it ended that day. At an inquest on Friday at Essex Coroner’s Court recorded an open verdict regarding Joes death.   Joe, a -year-old father-of two, had died as a result of taking in a high dose of codeine and pregabalin. But at the heart of his death lies a y battle Joe had with his mental health, his father claims. Steve, a nurse who has worked in mental health himself for around  years, said: Joe started to get really unwell - awful depression, panic attacks, anxiety and this inability to manage situations which people who didn’t suffer from mental health wouldn’t have. Those situations were quite catastrophic for Joe, for some people they would say this is really awful, but for him they were really magnied tenfold. I was leading away from work and having to weigh up a balance in caring for Joe. Then, as we know he got on the wrong side of the law, which I firmly believe was his poor judgement and vulnerability from his mental health. In , when Joe was aged , Steve decided to leave his work in order to become his son’s full time carer. Joe had a few run ins with the law, being spared jail in February  when Steve wrote an emotional letter to the judge. Chelmsford Crown Court heard how the vulnerable -year-old had acted as a custodian for almost pound, of cocaine. He was handed a two-year prison term, suspended for two years, for possessing drugs with an intent to supply. “I did all I could as his dad to look after him and care for him,” Steve said. “That meant getting him rehoused and fighting his corner in terms of benefits and just being there every single day to make sure he had had his medication on time and his meals on time. “He became a massive part of my le, even more than he ever was. “We were inseparable.”   He added: “I rescued him so many times from real depths of depression and I pointed him in what I thought was the right direction. “He had a daughter and he adored her. “The mother of his daughter was really fantastic and she understood and cared for Joe. “She felt it was important that he didn’t have the misery of being excluded because of his mental health. “I looked after him and they would stay at my flat. “Then he met another girl after they split up, and they had a baby - she’s just a year old now - and he adored her.” After fighting his son’s corner for so long Steve managed to get his son a flat of his own in Chelmsford. Joe moved in over the Easter period of this year and Steve says everyone around him felt it would lead to things improving. “You hold onto anything you can but behind the scenes was this gradual deterioration in his mental health and a real problem with the mental health services,” Steve said. “It was such a struggle to get continued mental health treatment, care and support. So it was down to just me and mum. “We know that Joe had an addiction and that had gone from alcohol, to drugs and then he would have these clear periods where he wasn’t interested in anything. “He would get back to the gym, he would go cycling, he would join the boxing club and this kind of went in cycles.” Steve said: “There was a swapping and exchanging of medicine until he was prescribed this medicine called pregabalin. “Pregabalin was what killed him.” He added: “Pregabalin is now a controlled drug.   “When the coroner phoned us and said that was the cause - it was a reaction of the codeine enhanced by the pregabalin. “That’s what killed him.” Joe was going through an intense amount of pain, so much so that his dad suspects he completely mismanaged the amount of drugs he was taking. “Joe would have popped Co-codamol like Smarties to get rid of the pain,” Steve said. “That was part of his mental health. “A week or so before his death I noticed he was quite sedated. “I went to see him and I think now looking back that’s when we said goodbye to each other. “Here in the background was the Grim Reaper and I said ‘I’m worried about you Joe. You’re slipping away from me and I think you’re going to dieyou keep getting confused and taking this medication. “He was buying the same prescription off of the dark web and he wasn’t buying them singularly, he was buying  at a time. “I couldn’t stop him and I said ‘Joe I will stop your benefits, I am your power of attorney’. ‘I’ll take the drugs and I’ll put them down the toilet’. “We tried everything and of course I was met with conflict with him and it just upset him. “Such was his mental illness and his inability to sleep he wanted to sedate himself and have his own control over him. “But he mismanaged it.” Steve continued: “He said to me ‘dad don’t be stupid I’m not going to die - I know what I’m doing’. “I cycled home that night and I was crying. “I was crying thinking that I’d lost my son. “I cuddled him on the doorstep and I knew he’d gone.”   With Joe seemingly on the mend around Easter time, Steve decided to take that opportunity to get back into education and complete a Masters degree. But on the day Joe died, Steve got bogged down with work. “On the day Joe died I was at my laptop and I never saw Joe in the day,” he explained. “I will always live with the fact thatI hadn’t got stuck at that laptop I would have been with Joe and I didn’t go to him. “I just went straight home. “Sometimes he slept for long periods and we would leave him and he would get up in the night and take more sedatives - his prescribed medication. “But when he had his sleep we would get back together and talk. Steve, along with Joe’s mother, discovered his son. It never gets easier hearing how and for Steve it is still a horrendous episode to retell. “His mum then said - as I had keys to the flat - we ought to really go round and see him,” Steve said about that night. “I cycled from mine to Joe’s, it was .pm and a warm evening. “It was the beginning of September and we met at the flat in Wharf Road. “I had butterflies a bit, Mum did as well, and we got up and knocked. “He didn’t answer so I put the key in the door and the chain was on. “I shouted through the door and there was no answer so I smashed the door down. “We went into the front room and he was laying there with his vape in one hand and his mobile phone in the other on his mattress in the front room. “That was very common because he slept in the front room by watching telly. “He was there propped up and I thought he was asleep and I went ‘hey alright boy ’ “Of course as I got closer we saw that he was dead. “I screamed and said ‘not my boy!’ “I ran out into the road, I screamed, and people came out on the balconies. “I went back upstairs and we tried to resuscitate him and the emergency services were on the phone on loudspeaker. “I hit his chest but I knew he was dead and he had been for a long while.” Paramedics and the police both showed up quickly on the day Joe was found - with Steve giving a special mention to those that attended and the amazing work that they do. But the repercussions will be there for ever. “As dramatic as it might seem my le ended that day,” he said. “I never will recover from this, this is what I do everyday. “I just exist at the minute, there’s never a minute where I’m not thinking of him and that exhausts me anyway. “I can’t reach him, I can’t tell him I love him, I can’t phone him, I can’t cuddle him and I can’t care for him. “I have a photo of him and I kiss that photo every night before I go to bed.” Through the pain Steve is now determined to do something good and bring a sense of positivity out of Joe’s untimely death. While his own recovery will take some time - he is planning on spending time at a retreat with other parents who have lost children in January - his attention is turning to raising awareness over mental health and the dangers of prescription drugs. He’s also keen to look after his grandchildren - who he sees a lot of Joe in. “He’s not going to die in vain,” said Steve. “The biggest thing for me is this ease of access to people who buy prescription drugs and how easy it is to get it. “You can find it and you can buy whatever medicines you want. “People can’t get the service they needthey’re ill so they turn themselves to self-medicating and here is the end result. “Drugs like pregabalin, you have to be aware of the interactions, the indications and the management side. “I hope I did all I can to give my son the best le he can - that’s all I wanted to give him in amongst his mental illness. “Some people thought Joe took his le but that wasn’t the case. “But nonetheless its only two or three clicks away to the dark web.” "},{"url":null,"title":"stonehenge winter solstice striking moments","story":"Stonehenge Winter Solstice striking moments as costumed revellers sing and danceHundreds of people vibrantly dressed gathered for the traditional celebrations, marking the longest night of the yearShareCommentsByDanya BazaraaNews ReporterBilly Labrum:,  DEC NewsRevellers in vibrant costumes gathered to mark the Winter Solstice and to witness the sunrise after the longest night of the year.Crowds of people played music and danced at Stonehenge in Wiltshire, where monuments are believed to be aligned to the movements of the sun.Striking photographs show choirs singing, a couple embracing, and many taking a moment of peace by the ancient stones.

Doctors feared that large cysts compressing her airways could potentially lead to fatal breathing problems at birth. Taylor and Cha were given the devastating news that Eden might not make it past her first day. But at .pm on August , , miracle baby Eden defied all the odds and was delivered by C-section in a room full of doctors, paediatric ENT surgeons and NICU nurses.  She was born with a lymphatic malformation in the form of a mass on her neck. Two years, countless hospital visits and nine treatments later, Eden has kept surprising doctors and defying the odds to become a perfect, happy and beautul little girl. Shes also become a big sister to three-month-old Auggie Raye. In a bid to kick the stigma of her disability, Edens mother Cha has opened up about their lives and has started writing a blog about their journey. Providing an intimate, emotional and personal glance at their lives, Cha opens up about everything: from the dark, scary beginnings of her pregnancy, to disgusting comments from trolls the family have encountered online and finally, the beautul young girl Eden has become. Heres a look at just one of Chas inspirational blog posts, which was originally published on the Love What Matters website.The night before she came, we were up late, Cha writes. I was so anxious. I cried so many times that night. I was so scared of the unknown. How could I be excited when I didn’t know what was going to happen to our baby  I felt a whirlwind of emotions, I was SO excited but more fearful. Will she survive  Will she be breathing  Will I get to see her before they take her  There were so many things going through my mind it was impossible for me to go back to sleep. So, I got out of bed and got ready for one of the biggest and most important days of my le. Too shaky and nervous to drive themselves to the hospital, Cha and Taylor were driven by family members and Cha was hooked up to a number of monitors to observe the baby.  It was strange, sitting there just the two of us, waiting to be rolled back to the operating room. We managed a few nervous smiles and laughs. We kept talking and wishing that we’d soon be a family, and that our baby girl would be OK. I wasn’t nervous at this point. I tried to switch off from what was happening - otherwise, I would have gone into complete frantic mode. I don’t think it had quite hit me yet. But it wasnt long before the true reality of the situation started to set in. All the fear and nerves that I carried right through my pregnancy hit me all at once, Cha writes. Taylor tried to help me stay calm, but he was just as nervous.  This was it - there was no turning back, and for a second, I wished I could have stayed in that moment forever. Where I knew I could keep my baby safe breathing inside me. I had carried her for the past nine months and soon doctors would be taking her away from me, ready to try and save her le. Around  doctors and nurses were involved in the delivery of Eden, so much that they filled the whole corridor outside the operating room. It was such a tiny room - I began to feel claustrophobic. I tried my best to not look at how many people were actually in the room as it made the situation a million times scarier. I was rolled onto the cold operating table to begin [the birth]. Was this really happening   Cha was given spinal pain killers and doctors immediately began the C-section surgery. Taylor kept reassuring me that everything was going fine and suddenly - within  minutes of going into the operating room - I heard the most beautul loud cries! I can’t even tell you what I felt at this moment in time, Cha said. Everyone was in complete shock. Our baby was here and she was crying - just like some miracle. No one was expecting it and even some nurses began to cry with us. I was in complete disbelief. It all felt so surreal. I have never felt a flood of joy like I did that moment we heard our daughter cry. It was something we were told was unlikely to happen - even though I spent nine months praying it would. Eden was taken immediately for medical checks, where doctors made sure she was healthy and her airways were clear.  She was then brought briefly back to Cha, before being whisked away once more to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Tears of joy were streaming down our faces and Taylor stroked my hair and askedI was okay. I only had a quick glimpse of Eden as they had to take her down to the NICU. I wanted her to be warm and safe more than I wanted to hold her right away. I was eventually wheeled out of the OR and brought to the recovery ward. It wasnt long before Chas anaesthetic started to wear off, and as the physical pain increased, so did Chas longing to see her newborn baby. I looked at all the other mothers with their babies and I felt helpless, she writes in her blog. My baby was alone with strangers and I no longer had control of anything. ‘When can I see my baby ’ I asked the nurse who was taking my vitals. Around six hours after giving birth, Cha was finally allowed to meet her daughter, and was taken to the NICU by wheelchair. I was finally able to gaze at our baby through a plastic baby incubator, and although there were wires all over her beautul new skin and into her tiny little nose, they never once stole who she was.  She was beautul even with all those tubes and wires, and I just couldn’t believe she was mine. I stroked her head, staring into her tiny incubator and told her how much I loved her. She was our miracle baby. They finally lted her out of her incubator and I got to hold her. I instantly felt whole again. She completed us. I felt a love that I never knew was possible. I got to hold her for nearly an hour before I had to leave her for the night to get my rest. After such a traumatic pregnancy, Cha and Taylor were warned to prepare for the worst. But after just two days in intensive care, little fighter Eden was moved to the ward with Cha before the two of them were allowed home: which meant Cha and her baby spent the same amount of time in hospital as a normal C-section patient. The weeks that followed were long and slow, and at seven weeks old Eden was admitted into Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospital, where she spent nearly a month of her young le.  We did our very best to get her home, Cha said. We fought medical teams and proved our worth. We learned how to care for our daughter beyond the requirements of any parent. We were medically trained. We knew more than some doctors did about her condition. All we knew were hospital walls, MRI scans, and car journeys. I cried every day. We couldn’t have gotten through that time without our family visiting every day. We loved her so much then, as we do now. Finally, baby Eden was allowed home. She came home, and it was a miracle. She defied odds. She proved people wrong. She got rid of tubes and wires like they were nothing at all. We never expected it, but she DID IT. When we found out Eden had a lymphatic malformation, we were scared. We searched the Internet looking for any answers. We were told Eden wouldn’t be normal. We were told she would be malformed. We were told there was a chance she wouldn’t survive.  Cha said doctors were concerned about the size of the mass putting pressure on Edens airways. We were told surgery would be a normal course of le for years to come, she wrote. But, here we are two years on, countless hospital visits and nine treatments later - with our perfect happy little girl. Eden is now two years old and so far has had a total of eight sclerotherapy treatments and a laser and cyst removal on her tongue to help reduce the size of the mass in both her neck and tongue. Shes due to have a tongue reduction in January next year and will eventually undergo serious surgical removal for the remainder of the malformation. I don’t know how its possible, but all of this has just made me love this little girl so much more, Cha writes in her blog. She is such a fighter and my heart grows bigger with love for her every single day.  We won’t let Eden’s illness define her and although we can’t do anything about it, we want to give her the best chance of beating it - physically and emotionally, Cha said. We still have a long journey ahead of us and no-one knows what challenges we may face along the way. We have had to learn to do things we should never have to as parents and we have built up courage that we didn’t know we had. But we have come so far. If I have learned one thing as a mother, its that motherhood is a journey filled with ups and downs. Just when I think I have it all figured out, the game changes, but I still never give up on hope. Above all, rather than trying to be the perfect mother, I try to be the best mother by always giving my best.”This story was was originally published on the Love What Matters website.

The pregnancy really couldn’t have been easier. All the scans were fine and I had no morning sickness to speak of. On the first weekend in August I popped to Southend to see Mum and Dad, but woke early the next day with terrible stomach cramps. When I saw blood in the bathroom I panicked, thinking I was miscarrying. At only  weeks, I couldn’t possibly be going into labour, I told myself. My parents rushed me to Southend University Hospital where, within a few hours, I was told I was already cm dilated. “Your baby’s coming today,” a doctor told me. At  days before the due date, I really thought it was all over, there was no way she could survive. I was given steroids to delay the birth and strengthen her tiny, undeveloped lungs. My husband Will had been seeing friends and rushed to join us at the hospital. I was given just gas and air and, before I knew, it Sophia was born and whisked away to an incubator before I had a chance to see or hold her. She weighed just lb oz and her le really was in the balance. After an initial faint cry, she went silent for several minutes while the doctors tried to start her breathing again. Those seconds and minutes felt like hours and days. I remember shouting through my tears: “Is she okay ” They told me they were “doing their best to stabilise her”.   An ambulance had been pre-booked to whisk her to Royal London Children’s Hospital. I seriously thought she would die in that ambulance, so told Will he had to go with her and leave me. Mercully, Sophia clung on. And later that day, Sunday August , I was discharged and allowed to go and see my daughter for the first time. She just seemed so impossibly fragile. Even reaching into the incubator to hold her hand I feared that I would hurt her. Doctors would only tell me they were “taking it day by day”. Somehow, the unknown was so much more frightening than a more concrete prognosis, however bad. It was over  minutes from home, so Will and I were offered a place in Stevenson House – a “home from home” next to the hospital provided by the Sick shyChildren’s Trust. It meant we were just minutes from Sophia during those next few precarious weeks. I remember so many hours sitting by her incubator, barely able to see her through umpteen tubes going into her tiny body. Being able to get some rest and talk to parents going through a similar hell was invaluable for our sanity. The first major hurdle was getting her to breathe on her own. Sophia had patent ductus shyarteriosus , where a valve in her heart didn’t close properly, causing her heart and lungs to go into overdrive. She was also diagnosed with acute renal failure, pneumonia, chronic lung disease and a grade two bleed on her brain. While the bleed was resolved, we still don’t know what the long-term implications might be. Her kidney problems meant she couldn’t feed for a few days and she lost almost all the weight she’d put on since birth – the very last thing she needed.  Amazingly, on September , we were told she was well enough to be transferred to our local hospital, Broomfield, in Chelmsford, Essex. She was still in high dependency, but less critical. But just as we thought we were on the up, she developed chronic reflux, which at times caused her to stopped breathing. Alarm bells would ring and doctors and nurses raced to save her. I thought each time that this was it, our daughter’s fight was over. But Sophia wasn’t going to give up easily. Thickener was added to her milk to stop the reflux. And on December  we were told we could finally take her home.

It was once one of the countrys grandest residences, but now little remains of the property. For the last four decades people have been walking their dogs around Cammo Estate on the outskirts ofEdinburgh– unaware of the incredible story behind the eccentric family who once lived there. The lives of Cammo’s infamous last residents, the Maitland-Tennent family, read like the script of a Hollywood movie, the Sunday Mail reports. A new book tells the how the family was torn apart by orce, feuds and financial scandal. From the feisty and reclusive “Black Widow” Margaret to her outlandish dog lover son Percival, who let Cammo House rot after his mother’s death, until now, their remarkable story has remained untold.   But thanks to author Simon Baillie’s new book The Private World of Cammo, the Maitland-Tennents and their intriguing legacy will not be forgotten. Simon, , from Edinburgh’s Blackhall, said: “I became obsessed with Cammo and its heritage in  when I went to the estate with a neighbour to walk his dog. “All that remained of the ruined house was part of the facade but it got me wondering who might have lived there. I was intrigued. “I started doing research in Edinburgh Central Library and discovered cuttings about the Maitland-Tennents – the last family to live there – and photos of the house in its glory days.”   The former antique dealer leads an intriguing double le with his day job as head gardener at another grand Scottish residence –Montrose’sDunninald Castle. He said: “Once I started, I could not stop. Finding out as much as I could about the eccentric family and the estate became my le’s mission. The more I discovered, the more I wanted to share with others.” Cammo House, which was built in  by John Menzies, was bought in  by Margaret Maitland-Tennent, whose father had accumulated his fortune from sheep farming in Australia.   Simon said: “Margaret was a sure headed and determined young lady who wed bank clerk David Bennett Clark in . When they married, a contract was drawn up stating he would never be entitled to the pound, fortune that Margaret would inherit one day. “The marriage was turbulent as David wanted control of the money. In  she orced him, which was not socially acceptable at the time. “He moved to England and she lived on at Cammo with her two sons, Robert and Percival.” He added: “In , Margaret and the boys travelled to New Zealand, Australia and Japan. While they were overseas, their estranged father died. “It’s not known what happened between Margaret and her eldest son on this trip but Robert refused tohome with them, and went to live in the United States. “She promptly wrote him out of her will, a decision he would continue to challenge unsuccessfully until his death in the US in .”   Although they continued to travel, Margaret and Percival led a reclusive le at Cammo, only venturing out to get groceries and shop at Jenners. Headstrong Margaret ended up in the cells overnight after she refused to reveal to the government the amount of funds held by her in banks in America and Canada. Simon said: “Margaret dressed from head to toe in black, earning herself the nickname the Black Widow. She and Percival were inseparable and would go to Jenners, where staff would bring items to a private room for them to peruse. “Percival was obsessed with cars. He would drive them until they were done and then dumped them behind the house to rot. “The pair might have been quite a sight. She was a formidable woman who stuck to her guns, hence why she ended up in jail for refusing to declare her worth.”   He added: “When she died in , aged , Margaret was buried under the lawn to the west of the house. This was the last interment in private ground in Scotland. “After her death, the estate, which was already very run down, was estimated to be worth pound, and passed in its entirety to Percival, much to the distress of Robert, who would have probably done a better job of preserving Cammo House than his brother. “For the next  years, Percival let the house go to rack and ruin, letting his  dogs run wild and defecate in all the rooms, while he lodged in the gate lodge with the Little family. “After Margaret’s death, Cammo became the target of looters, who carried off many valuable antiques, furniture and paintings. “Percival didn’t try to stop the burglars because he was afraid they would hurt his dogs – and one morning he was found tethered to a tree after being attacked by them.” After his death in , Percival bequeathed the house to the National Trust for Scotland but it was in such a bad state of repair they didn’t know how to proceed.   Twice in , the house was set on fire deliberately by vandals and in  it was semi-demolished. In , the National Trust gted Cammo for pound to Edinburgh District Council. They, in turn, founded the UK’s first wilderness park, a country walking area for the people of Edinburgh. Simon, whose book is available for pre-order, said: “It’s devastating what happened to that beautul house. So much social history and architecture lost and destroyed. What remains reveals nothing about its former splendour or the people who lived there. “I hope my book will help bring the history of Cammo back to le and make the people who visit the estate every day think about the infamous Maitland Tennents who gted them their park.” "},{"url":null,"title":"selfless mother carried dying child","story":"NewsNew baby joy for selfless mum who carried girl she knew would die to save other kidsEXCLUSIVE: Hayley Martin used her own suffering and pain to help other children in need - and now she is celebrating another bundle of joy on the wayShareCommentsByEmily Hall:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC News \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum who carried her dying baby to term in the hope of giving other sick tots a chance of le has revealed she is expecting another little girl. This time last year Hayley Martin was preparing to give birth to Ava-Joy. Heartbreakingly, the little one had been diagnosed with a fatal condition shyhalfway through the pregnancy. Hayley and her husband Scott were told they could opt for a shytermination. Instead they decided to go ahead with the birth – so Ava’s organs might be donated to desperately ill babies. But Ava, who survived for  shyminutes was underweight for a donor and died in her parents’ arms.   Now Hayley has revealed she is  weeks pregnant and is due to give birth just  days after what would have been Ava’s first birthday. And she plans to train as a shybereavement midwe to help others in similar heartbreaking situations. Speaking to the Sunday People, which first revealed her incredible story, Hayley said: “There has been such pain for us as a family this year. “But I couldn’t be more overjoyed to be carrying this baby. She’s a gt. “It’s not been all sunshine and roses, though. Any pregnancy after loss is nerve-racking as you’re waiting for something to go wrong. Every kick, I can’t help but think about Ava, who should be here with us.” The baby will be called Harriet, with middle names Hope and Ava in shymemory of the sister she will never know. She weighs lb – and all tests have come back normal. Harriet is due to arrive by planned caesarean on January  at Hull Royal Infirmary – the same hospital where Ava was born on January  this year. Ava had bilateral renal agenesis, which means she had no kidneys. It is always fatal. Hayley and Scott had learned of her condition when they went to find out the sex at her shy-week scan.   They were told she would shyslowly suffocate after birth and that a termination would be the most appropriate action. But in an incredible show of personal strength, the couple shydecided to carry her as far as shypossible in the hope she could donate her organs. They were devastated when she was born shyweighing around g below the .kg minimum for being a viable donor. The couple later found Hayley had a hernia from her previous caesarian – and the surgery to fix it would stop her carrying another child. Scott, , said: “We were in no rush to try again. After Ava I thought I didn’t want to try any more. I couldn’t take the heartache. But it was now or never and we decided to give it one more roll of the dice. “We knew we wanted another baby – and here we are.” The couple also have children Kiowa, eight, Layla, six, and Oliver, three. Hayley, , said because of their experience with Ava, Harriet’s scans had been brought forward. She said: “Instead of waiting until  weeks they allowed us to have one at  weeks to check there were kidneys and a bladder, which there were. “I could have passed out from happiness.”   She hopes her experience will be invaluable in her role as a midwe. Hayley said: “It’s not only to be there for the good times, but for when shywomen want someone there who has been through what they’re going through. So when I say shy‘I shyunderstand,’ it’s because I’ve lived it.” The couple, from Hull, say they have learned from having had Ava in their lives. Scott said: “I find it easier to talk to people now. She taught me how to feel a lot more than previously. I was shut off to certain things.” Hayley added: “I’ve suffered from anxiety all my le and let things hold me back. “Ava made me realise you need to make the most of what you have – to love with all your heart and not waste a moment wondering, ‘What  ’” "},{"url":null,"title":"single mum says universal credit","story":"NewsSingle mum says Universal Credit leaves her no choice but to go back to pornEXCLUSIVE: A single mum from south London is preparing toto her former career as a porn star over fears Universal Credit could leave her and her children pennilessShareCommentsByElaine McCahillNews Reporter:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video mother-considering--porn-industry-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA single mum has said Universal Credit could leave her with no choice but toto her former career as a porn star. Emily - not her real name - from south London has said the UK has ed to Victorian England where women have to turn to sex work and X-rated films in order to feed their children. The mum-of-three gave up her porn career for her children but now fears she will have toto adult films just to feed them. The cruel new benefit system is being rolled out in her area and Emily is fearful she could be left waiting weeks on end for her first payment leaving her with no choice but to do porn for quick cash. Emily is a mum-of-three and despite working part-time, she is worried her benefits could be cut under the new system. Have you been affected by Universal Credit  Email webnews@mirror  Her daughter is disabled and Emily says she would rather put herself at risk and do porn than let her childs quality of le suffer. During her s, Emily worked as apornstar and modelled for several lads mags. Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Emily said: “It’s like we’ve ed to Victorian times with mums having to do X-rated videos or prostitute themselves in order to put food in their children’s bellies. How has it come to this  “I don’t want to go back topornbut what  can I do  I’ll make pound for a few scenes and still be home in time to collect my kids from school. At least I have that option to make some good cash, other people don’t.” Emily spent her younger years in care after being abused by members of her family.In her late teens, her then boyfriend convinced her to respond to a call for models in a top lads mag.  She was then offered a large sum of money to star in apornfilm and her X-rated career continued for the next decade. Emily, now is her s, spent years travelling Europe to star in films and while she did not enjoy the work, she did it for the money and the freedom that offered her. “I used to just zone out,” she said. “They used to coerce me into doing things I didn’t want to do but I just thought of the money and got on with it. It did end up causing me a very bad injury...down there. I had to go to hospital, it was really traumatic but I went back for the money. “It felt very glamorous at the time, because I had lovely clothes to wear, had my make-up done, and I felt very special. No one had ever made me feel special.   “I felt good about it at the time but I was younger then. “I was talked into it by the vast amount of money I was offered basically. “It would have been around pound for sex with a male model - hardcore porn. “It’d take a couple of hours, I’d had HIV tests all the time because some of the male models did gay porn as well. “I really liked doing the magazine shoots and that because it wasn’t dangerous. “When you’re on a porn shoot, you put on a persona, it’s like a mask.   “But I look back and I feel ashamed, I was brought up in a very religious household. “I think theres a real stigma about porn in the UK, it’s just not the done thing is it  “People treat me terribly when they find out. Eventually, Emily left thepornindustry and became a lap dancer. But she gave it up when she fell pregnant with her first child and has not looked back since - until now. She said: Once I had my daughter I got a normal job and focused on being a mum, I thought that part of my le was over. Id be disgustedI had to go back. The fear of being left with little or nothing to live on has forced her to get in touch with herporncontacts again in case she needs to make some quick cash.  “I’ve been asked to go back lots of times over the years and I never did it,” she said. “I look back and I’m ashamed of it,I’d been brought up in a nice home and not abused, I might be married and have a nice le. My daughter is disabled, she suffers from a learning disability and goes to special school, I cant work full-time because of child care costs and childminders dont like having her because of her behaviour. I take her to lots of dferent activities like horse riding and swimming which help her and I dont want to have to stop all thatmy benefits are cut. “If I go back to porn I’m putting myself at risk because this is unprotected sex - I’m at risk of HIV and other STIs. “I feel utterly degraded even thinking about going back to it especially because I never thought I would have to do this again. “But I can’t get another job so this is an easy way to make money while the kids are at school.  “I don’t want to go back to it but I’d do anything - even prostitute myself - to feed my kids. “I’d be too embarrassed to queue up at a food bank or beg people to donate gts for my children at Christmas. “I just couldn’t do it, but at least this way I could make enough money to take my daughter to her activities. Her mobility allowance has already been cut and I cant get public transport with her. Emily has even started stockpiling tins of food over fears of not having enough money to feed her kids. “I’ve started buying extra tins and putting them away. People advise you to start stockpiling non-perishables, like beans, tuna etc, so I can have a few week’s worth of food just in case, she said.

I stayed at my nans for a bit before moving to a horrible sh**hole in Kingstanding. I was living off pound in benefits.  I couldnt even afford to get to college and I contemplated not having my baby because I couldnt afford a child. I reached rock-bottom. During a time of desperation Cindy, from Great Barr, Birmingham, was introduced to exotic dancing and web cam work by a friend. I started dancing and a friend of mine suggested Id do web-camming, she added. I was like, Oh my God but I decided to give it a go.

Its all online and it goes ding-ding when someone wants to speak to you. You cant really go off and do other things and it can be quite tedious but I keep them talking for as long as possible, asking them where theyre from and stuff. I type instead of speaking because it takes longer. Everything can come off, bra and knickers. I have to put on the website that Im working that day and Im available. I dont do it all the time because it can be too much, you can lose yourself. Since going public about my work, Ive literally had  or so girls inbox me on Facebook asking about how I got into it and what its like. I tell them its so easy and the money is great but, once you get into it, theres no getting out.  Ive tried other jobs but nothings as easy and so well paid. What Id tell girls is to be very careful, it can take over your le which is why Ive tried to step back a little. Ive been doing it since I was a teenager. Girls I know have gotten into drugs to deal with their work - so it can be a dangerous game. Its my job and now I can afford nicer things in le and I can afford to support my family. Ive got no shame, none whatsoever.   Its a million miles away from where I was thats for sure, sitting there eating noodles at Christmas.

We just need to put it all together and get the three points.“We should be full of confidence the way we played last week because we know not every opposition can withstand the pressure we put on them.“It’s all about our performance, the way we go on the pitch and put into practice what we think we want to do.“The ability we have in the dressing-room, the characters we have, I think we have a really good team whether that’s in terms of spirit or ability.”After injury forced him off in the recent defeat against Ayr and forced him to miss the draw at Morton, Siegrist admits being recalled to the line-up last weekend was a boost for him.So far this term, one of his biggest battles has been to claim a starting place ahead of Matej Rakovan but that was an indication he’s now considered the first choice keeper by boss Robbie Neilson.“I’ve kind of over-extended when I was ing in the game against Ayr and it was a mixture between a knock and a muscle injury. It happens in football, you get injured sometimes and I was happy I was playing again as soon as I was back fit.”"},{"url":null,"title":"excitement as american dive bar opens in dundee city centre","story":"The artist behind a quirky new bar in Dundee says he hopes the pub’s “unique” style will attract people from across the UK.The Abandon Ship Bar at the Waterfront, which opened on Thursday, has replaced Jam Jar, next to the Bird  Bear.Entrepreneur Richard Davies, who launched the Abandon Ship clothing brand seven years ago, says the nightspot is his biggest project yet.He has slaved over the interior of the “American e bar”-themed watering hole, spending a total of  hours hand-painting his unique brand on about  square metres of wall throughout.It will add to the area’s growing nightle with St Andrews Brewing Co to open the city’s largest pub early next year just metres away.The -year-old said: “We are offering something unique.“It’s something I have never really seen anywhere  in Scotland.

Here it is, in full, below.Congratulations on your purchase of Dundee United. I guess the obvious first question is why Dundee United My son Scott and I have been looking for investment in European football for some time. We looked at a lot of dferent options, and we looked at this particular club, the club#s history, the support of the fans, the previous success and rich history.The Irish history appealed because we are of Irish descent. We know the Club had financial issues and that makes it dficult for any Club to be successful.For the Club staff to work within that scenario where there is financial dficulty, you are hampered by that. Decisions are then based on where you are at rather than the best interests of the Club. We felt it was a sleeping giant and we could come in with our advisors and use our business experience to make a dference and get Dundee United back where it needs to be.How much did buying United cost you I will not answer that question directly but what I will say is I have seen some numbers thrown about out there and I wish we were buying it for as little as that! It comes to a combination of money paid to shareholders, money put in for the retirement of debt and a commitment to working capital to ensure funds going forward to do what we need to do to be successful.How long has buying a sporting opportunity in Europe been an interest or passion for you It has been there for several years. Scott#s passion for European football goes back much longer than that. It was his passion that rubbed off on me. His English team is Newcastle United, and we caught a match a few years back and had a lot of fun. In the last year, we really took the interest seriously.Are you looking to make money from this deal Yes. This isn#t a hobby for us, and we expect to make money long-term but, let me say, for that to happen we need to be competing in the Ladbrokes Premiership on a continual basis.How much do you know about Dundee United and Scottish football I know a ton. We spent a tremendous amount of time and money doing our due diligence. Legally, on the business side and on the performance side. We know a lot about Dundee United, and we have researched Scottish football, and we know where we are and where we want to go. We have an excellent plan to get where we want to go.Do you expect to own Dundee United for several years Yes. I expect to own the team long-term.What would you say to reassure Dundee United fans about the long-term future of the Club I guess what I would say is based on the due diligence conducted, spending a lot of time and money researching, we know what we are getting into. This isn#t just a passing fancy where we are going to get in and discover something that would create any issues for us. We are confident about what we are getting into and where we want to go. We would not invest in the Clubwe weren#t convinced about the long-term future of the Club.How does this purchase affect the structure of the Club Mike Martin has stepped down as Chairman, and I would like to recognise the work Mike has done during the process. He is a big fan of the Club, and he has steadied the ship since his appointment in March.As new owners, we are going to take it in a dferent direction. We plan to appoint a Managing Director who will be in charge of running the Club and he will be responsible for the aspects of the commercial and business side of the Club.We will also have a Sporting Director who will be responsible for all the performance aspects of the Club. He will work with Robbie Neilson efficiently and effectively from the Club’s standpoint.We will be making some announcements in the very near future regarding this.What type of Chairman would you describe yourself So I’ll be the Chairman and my son Scott will be the quasi-Vice Chairman. He will sit on the board with me. From a Club perspective, people can expect that I#ll be interested in all that is going on I will be very supportive of what#s going on and who is doing it I will be available whenever, but I will not be a micro-manager. We will have what we think are the right persons in the right positions to be a successful Club and I will absolutely expect results.From a fan perspective, I will be a low profile Chairman and fans will hear more from the Club leadership in the new structure than they will from me.Do you plan to work remotely Yes. I will work remotely and travel over as much as possible. Scott and I have talked about this. We will have board meetings that we will come over for, but we will try to tag-team and come across at separate times, so at least one of us is here as often as possible.How can you get a feel for the Clubyou aren#t over in Dundee With today#s technology it is almost asyou are over there but having the right people in the right positions is what matters. Jimmy Fyffe and David Dorward are still on the board, and we anticipate one or two other people to be on the board from the Dundee area. It is essential for the fans to know we will definitely have local representation and they will be in constant communications.There are American owners at Dundee FC, also within the city. So let me ask this directly. Do you have any plans to merge the clubs No. None whatsoever.Do you have any links at all with the owners of Dundee FC No, I have never met them, and quite frankly I do not even know who they are.Do you have any links to the previous owners of the Club including Stephen Thompson No, I have heard his name, but I have never met or had a discussion with Stephen Thompson. Obviously, I have met Mike Martin and Jimmy Fyffe.You have an interest in a Baseball team. What experience have you gained that will stand you in good stead for a football team based in Dundee I believe firmly, that a person needs to know their limitations. As Chairman and owner that is the situation. As far as performance of the squad aspect of the Club is concerned, I expect to be consulted with, I will be involved and interested in decisions, but in reality, I will defer the main decisions to those that know the game much better than I do. As I said previously, I#m not going to micro-manage. I expect to be much more involved in the business side.Have you spoken to the Head Coach and can you confirm that you see him leading the team forward So when I travelled across recently, I was introduced to Robbie, but quite frankly I don#t even think he knew who I was! I just happened to be a visitor who was introduced. That#s been the extent so far, but in answer to your question, I absolutely do believe he is the man to lead the team forward. He has made a positive impact since his arrival, and he has proven himself with Hearts before.Will he be given financial backing to help in the task of getting the Club back into the Ladbrokes Premiership I guess what I’d say is that it is not an open chequebook, but we absolutely intend to invest the necessary funds to get us into a position to get promoted. Equally important is when we get up we stay there.You will appreciate supporters will be curious and apprehensive about motives. How do you plan to communicate with fans of Dundee United Talk is cheap. What I would say to our supporters is judge us by our actions and, even more importantly judge us on our results. Obviously, due to the structure that I#ve discussed earlier, we will be implementing changes, and the fans will hear from the Club leadership rather than me.What targets do you intend to set for the team and the Club as a whole Let me answer it this way. We are looking at short-term and longer-term targets. The short-term objective is simple # promotion to the Premiership. We expect it is this year absolutely. We need to be United and have the one vision, # success # and get to the Premiership. The timing of the transaction is excellent. We have a transfer window shortly in January, and this will allow us to get with Robbie and figure out the team, andwe need to make some changes, we are ready and willing to do that.Longer-term, maybe three to five years, we need to be competing in the top six of the Premiership. We want to be competing in European competition and challenging in the cups. That#s our ultimate goal."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"teen-bakes-grandads-ashes-into-biscuits-and-shares-with-classmates","story":"A high school student mixed her cremated grandfatherrsquos ashes into homemade sugar biscuits and shared them with several classmates, police in Calornia said on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-charles-rennie-mackintosh-statue-given-cone-treatment-10-days-after-being-unveiled","story":"THE city looks to have quickly taken its newest statue to heart - as itrsquos given the Glasgow cone treatment."},{"url":null,"title":"better-bus-services-are-arriving-says-boss","story":"Bus bosses say passengers will quickly begin to see improvements from a multi-million pound investment."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-wagamama-staff-have-spring-in-their-step-after-christmas-bonus-announcement","story":"Staff at three Glasgow restaurants are over the moon after finding out they will be given Christmas bonuses worth up to pound,."},{"url":null,"title":"planning-boost-in-bid-to-build-new-suburb-in-glasgows-north-east","story":"A BID for  new homes in north Glasgow has taken a leap forward."},{"url":null,"title":"bongos-bingo-behind-one-of-glasgows-wildest-club-nights","story":"SINCE first hitting Glasgow back in , Bongos Bingo has become a regular fixture on the social calendar having racked up more than a dozen events in this year alone."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-star-leigh-griffiths-returns-to-social-media","story":"CELTIC ace Leigh Grfiths has broken his social media silence for the first time since stepping away from the club due to ongoing personal issues."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-and-australias-argument-over-tom-rogic-is-a-real-soap-opera","story":"GRAHAM Arnold was granted face-time with Brendan Rodgers on his recent visit to Scotland and came away unexpectedly with an extra player in Martin Boyle."},{"url":null,"title":"airnbnb-glasgow-city-council-bans-estate-agent-from-running-holiday-let","story":"AN estate agent has been banned from running an Airbnb let in a residential block on Glasgowrsquos West End in a landmark case."},{"url":null,"title":"deliveroo-glasgow-delivery-drivers-sacked-en-masse-just-days-before-christmas","story":"TWENTY courier drivers have been sacked just days before Christmas after being accused of fraud by a worldwide delivery service."},{"url":null,"title":"as-the-world-was-partying-we-were-welcoming-babies-meet-the-staff-in-charge-of-glasgows-festive-deliveries","story":"WHILE most of us are opening presents and tucking into turkey, staff at Glasgowrsquos maternity hospitals will be making sure the cityrsquos very special Christmas deliveries have a safe arrival.

The minister did not seem to realise that many living in my constituency donrsquot feel they have benefited from the city deal and this must change.In his question, Mr Stone said: ldquoA whole shed load of money has been spent in Inverness but precious little has been spent in the out laying areas.

We all saw the benefits of having had a left-back in Max andwe can get something like that it might be something we would look at.”Lowe has made  appearances for the Dons this season and has been a regular starter in recent months.Derby boss Lampard opted not to extend Lowe’s loan deal because he is short on left-back options. Scotland international left-back Craig Forsyth suffered a serious knee injury this month that is expected to keep him out for the rest of the campaign.Swedish international Marcus Olsson is still recovering from a long-term knee injury, leaving Scott Malone as the only senior left-back available.McInnes said: “Derby have injury issues with a couple of their left-backs.“Max is going back to play. The feedback is that he is not just going back to sit on the bench.“They have been watching him closely and they see the development in him and how well he has done for us.“I am not surprised Derby feel he can go back there and play now.”While McInnes aims to bring in another left-back in January, he insists there is no panic to land the right candidate as there are players who can operate in that position already at the club.Andy Considine, currently playing at right centre-back while Mikey Devlin is out injured until the new year, has played left-back in recent seasons.McInnes said: “There are people in the building that can play left-back.“We will have defenders coming back in January as well with Mikey Devlin, Mark Reynolds and Tommie Hoban, which helps that side of it.”Centre-back Reynolds ed to full-training yesterday for the first time since undergoing knee surgery in July.McInnes said: “Mark was back in full training and it is brilliant to have him back.“He has been there or thereabouts with us for the last few weeks doing bits and pieces.”Aberdeen will today face Hearts in the knowledge a fourth straight win will keep them in the mix at the top of the Premiership.They are just three points behind leaders Celtic, who they host on Boxing Day.Hearts are reeling after suffering a - loss to Livingston and McInnes expects a reaction.He said: “When you lose that type of game all you do is work even harder.“Hearts have had a whole week to get ready for this game so I am pretty sure they will have been working and getting organised to try to come up here to be harder to play against.“On the back of that matchI don’t think it makes our game any easier.“When you lose like that you expect a reaction from your team and Hearts are too good a team not to have a reaction.“They have too much experience and ability and a good manager who will get them back to winning ways before long. We just have to hope it is after today.”The top five of the Premiership is so congested the Dons could conceivably be sitting top of the table at New Yearthey can maintain their winning streak before the winter shutdown.McInnes refuses to look that far ahead.He said: “It is good that we are in and around it but we are just looking at the next game against Hearts.“However, there is no doubting we can clearly see the benefits of getting consecutive wins.”McInnes has challenged the Reds to beat Hearts today to reach the -point mark at the Premiership’s halfway stage.He said: “We felt it was important to hit the  points after  games.“Hearts is the th game of the Premiership and the halfway stage and it’s normally where we are, on target to break  points.“I said to the players prior to the St Mirren game they have three games to get to  points.“We’ve had those two wins since then, and have taken nine points since Livingston .“Now we go and try to get the next three against Hearts.“If we can win to get that it will give a more familiar reflection of what we normally produce at that halfway stage.”Winger Gary Mackay-Steven is out of today’s clash as he is still recovering from concussion having been knocked unconscious in the - Betfred Cup loss to Celtic on December .He could be fit to face Celtic at Pittodrie on Boxing Day.

A government that can lead us through the Brexit impasse that currently exists.“We are at risk of leaving the EU without a deal, a position I hope we can all agree would be disastrous, not just for the people of Aberdeen, but the UK as a whole.”Speaking after the meeting, Ms Laing said she had hoped the SNP would back her call for a general election.She added: “Unfortunately the rhetoric that comes with the SNP was fully on show today in that they say in public they want a general election but when they get an opportunity to vote for one they vote against it.”Backing a people’s vote, SNP group leader Stephen Flynn said the council had to defend the % of the city’s population who are EU nationals.He added: “Any Brexit at this stage is likely to damage Aberdeen.“Democracy is to go to the people and ask for their views.”He was backed up by EU citizen and SNP councillor Christian Allard, a Frenchman who said he would not be willing to apply to live in Scotland – where he has made a le for  years.However, Douglas Lumsden, Conservative group leader and co-leader of the council, said councillors should take no action, adding they should be “more concerned by Mastrick and not Maastricht”. Mr Lumsden, who said he voted to remain in the EU referendum, added: “A total of .m people voted to leave the EU. For the sake of democracy it must be delivered and it will be delivered.”He added the motion was “absolutely pointless”, claiming a second referendum would be a “disaster for democracy”.Liberal Democrat group leader Ian Yuill said: “We now know that promises made about Brexit, like £ million a week extra for the NHS and getting a deal with the ‘exact same benefits’ as EU membership, cannot be kept.“Since the start of the month it has become blindingly clear that the Brexit process is a mess and the Prime Minister’s exit deal is clearly doomed.“A people’s vote would put the UK’s citizens back in control and give everyone the chance to decide whether the Prime Minister’s deal is good for the country andthe UK should leave the EU on those terms.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/12/ee-cr-111218-01-003.jpg-789x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet can you give one of these animals a new home dec15","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable animals from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home  vw, px\"  Lovely laidback ladies Ruby and Sophie are looking for a forever home together.The pair, who are  years old, still enjoy their walks but also like a sofa day too.Someone who is at home most of the time would be ideal for these girls, who are likely to follow their new owner around the home.The pooches, who are not suited to a household with children, will need to be kept on a hypoallergenic diet. vw, px\"  Gorgeous girl Freya is looking for a new owner who can take her on lots of country walks.The six-year-old, who has been neutered, has previously beem around children and will need an owner with experience of the breed.Freya is also used to other dogs but can can be quite vocal with them until she gets to know them.Can you give her a home  vw, px\"  Handsome lad Louie is on the prowl for a new home where he can get outdoors to explore.Although six-month-old Louie can be quite a feisty boy, he also adores receiving cuddles.And when it comes to playtime, this cute cat has lightning reflexes.It is not knownLouie has previously been around other animals or children.Can you give him a home Mrs Murray#s Home for Stray Dogs and CatsTel:   "},{"url":null,"title":"homes halted as flats miscounted by builder","story":"A housebuilder has been forced to resubmit a planning application – after miscalculating the number of homes to be built.Dandara lodged plans to build  homes at the site south of Hazledene Road, but emails from a planning officer at Aberdeen City Council have shown that the firm made an error in its initial application – applying for  homes instead of .The correspondence, from a senior planning officer in the council, shows that a review of the documents revealed that nine flats had not been accounted for in the new application.It said: “In reviewing the numbers for this, I noticed that the description doesn’t tally with the commentary in the supporting statement – it seems that the nine flats haven’t been counted, so the application should be described as  units, not .”According to the emails, the firm will need to resubmit a revised application and will also need to noty neighbours again.They said: “I’ve contacted Dandara, and we will be arranging for a revised application form, payment of the dference in application fee, and renotication re-advertisement once that has been received, solocal residents wonder why there is another notication coming through the door, that’s all it is.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 48","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCongratulations are due to a number of local people this week.We#re surrounded by heroes every day, most of whom are unsung, but David MacInnes was quite rightly recognised last week for his work in boosting the cause of stem cell research and donation.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta. This was a fitting finish to the Championship at Leuchars with very fast stages and a good test of manand machine in equal measures.Photographs by West Coast Photos."},{"url":null,"title":"speedy kirsty points the way ahead for dad","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAt the age of , Kirsty Mochrie made her first outing as navigator for Innes Mochrie at the  Kingdom Stages rally.Seasoned campaigner Innes, who happens to be Kirsty#s dad, was well guided around the course in their Kilmory Coachworks .Kirsty#s gran Libby told the Advertiser: #She just loved it.

Alternatively write to: Argyllshire Advertiser,  Argyll Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, PA NBSir,As reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Christmas came early for local causes in Argyll recently when the Co-op revealed a £, festive funding boost.The money was shared by three organisations, all of whom are making a real dference to communities throughout the region. These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Flower Club members welcomed Sandra Robertson from Dumfries to their annual open evening on Monday December .A packed house watched with interest as Sandra created amazing Christmas-themed displays.Lucky raffle winners left with beautul arrangements that, with care and attention, could see them through Christmas.Sandra, who won Best in Show  at Gardening Scotland with a James Bond inspired arrangement, was an excellent demonstrator and told many humorous stories of her #flower le# to an enthralled and appreciative audience."},{"url":null,"title":"the adventures of mr toad a ribbitting performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBy Anne BeckittThe Mid Argyll Musical Society recently showcased their production of The Adventures of Mr Toad in Ardrishaig Hall to great acclaim.The praise was well-justied for the whole production was a shining example of what real teamwork can make from good material.The cast included primary and secondary students as well as adults, covering very ied levels of stage experience, yet they all worked together with a smoothness that appeared effortless but was, in fact, the result of much care and expert guidance.The chorus was as well rehearsed as the principal characters, and the evident enjoyment of every actor and singer meant the audience could relax totally and enjoy it all.Even lost lines, and the problems of dealing bravely with injuries were easily managed with good humour that won all hearts. That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

The combination of problems forced the family to live in the bedroom of their house where the damp was less severe.After seven months of negotiating, Gary and Lindsay have moved out of the house into a privately let property close to Oban.At the time ACHA chief executive Alastair McGregor said: ‘The association will provide compensation through our redress policy to Mr Smith for his inconvenience. The association is committed to getting this matter concluded as soon as possible and for Mr Smith and his family to enjoy the facilities in their new home in the very near future.’In a letter to Mr McGregor, Gary said: ‘I am disgusted the way me and my family have been treated. If this is what you call habitable condition I wouldn’t like to see what ACHA classes as inhabitable.’Since the Argyllshire Advertiser published the article, Gary maintains the holes in the side of the building have not been filled, the damp not dealt with, nor has black mould in the bedroom.He said: #When they got someone to look at it he just wanted to plaster over the problem. That won#t solve the damp in the whole house.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste. Complaints to health bosses also show “blood spillages are often left untreated all day, despite being seen by supervisors”. Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing.

Headmaster Simon Johnston opened the new building, called Craigweil Lodge, last week. He believes it is a signicant step and provides extra classroom space and better single campus. He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road.

Being a volunteer befriender is a hugely rewarding experience.The service is already making a dference to those affected by Alzheimerrsquos in the Eildon and Cheviot area.Befriender Allan Dorward was matched with partner Kay three months ago.Kayrsquos we Moira said: ldquoFinding a befriender for my husband has been a great help to myself and him.ldquoIt was through a friend that I discovered we could have this service. If I need to go out anywhere and donrsquot want to leave Kay alone I can call on Allan who will either take him out or stay in the house with him.ldquoThrough the summer Allan took Kay bowling and now he takes him curling at the ice rink on Saturday mornings. They also attend walking football.ldquoAllan picks Kay up and brings him home after the game which is a great help to me. I would recommend this service to anyone who is caring for someone with dementia.Another person benefitting from Alzheimer Scotlandrsquos befriending service is Mary who receives visits from volunteer befriender Heather Johnstone.Maryrsquos daughter said: ldquoFor many years my mother has not been able to leave the house unless taken out by me and had no-one to speak to other than me and my partner.ldquoShe is now living with us and has been partnered with her befriender Heather, who she says she has no dficulty in speaking to.ldquoShe looks forward to their conversations and going out for a coffee and a scone. This then leaves me to enjoy a bit of free time without having to worry about her.ldquoThis one to one arrangement works well for my mother, who is very deaf, rather than a group situation where she would not be able to participate.Anybody interested in becoming a befriender can email borders@alzscot.org or call   for more information.

the architects and builders of Abbotsford, and original installers of the Portcullis Gate December , .The Portcullis Gate, made of oak and wrought iron, was designed by Scott between  and , creating a grand entrance for visitors to his home.It remained an integral part of Scotts lsquoconundrum castle.But it had suffered many years of continuing deterioration, reaching the point where conservation was critical to avoid it falling apart.Keith, great-great-grandson of Thomas Smith, was delighted to keep the family connection with the gate and told the invited audience of Abbotsford donors and Friends about the link between theSmith family, Darnick and Abbotsford.Keith said: ldquoAbbotsford is a joy.\"My family and others from Darnick are proud to have played a part in its construction.\"The gates are a tribute to local craftsmen - ancient and modern.Initial plans by The Abbotsford Trust, to replace the old wood and repair the wrought ironwork on the gate, were revised when research by The Scottish Conservation Studio revealed the Portcullis Gate was not a mismatch of wood of ying quality as originally thought, but was in fact all original wood from Scottrsquos time.The project turned into one of conservation rather than replacement.Pippa Coles, Abbotsfordrsquos Gardens Heritage Development Manager, said: ldquoWe are thrilled to see the gate back in position and looking as Scott intended.\"Earlier this year, I read in John Smithrsquos diary that the gate had originally arrived on December , , so I felt it was a fitting date for their , and it was extra special that Keith, Johnrsquos descendant could join us.ldquoWe are very grateful to our funders and donors who made this important conservation project possible.\"We hope visitors to Abbotsford in the New Year, when we reopen in March, will enjoy walking through the grand entrance, just as Scottrsquos guests did nearly  years ago.The skilled restoration work was undertaken by Charles Taylor Woodwork, based in Dalkeith.The gates were removed last December, dried out and then dismantled and recorded before work began.The original wooden frame was badly damaged and has been replaced, while the internal lattice work has been restored by splicing in good wood from the old frame.Despite its name, the Portcullis Gate is hinged and not raised and dropped by a pulley system.It derives its name from its design, which references the style of a portcullis, an image of which is also carved above the gate.Scottrsquos use of this defensive symbol at the main entry to his home suggests that he viewed Abbotsford as a personal sanctuary.The portcullis image was also used by Scott on his personal book bindings in his library, where the symbol is accompanied by the Latin motto Clausus Tutus Ero , signalling Scottrsquos attitude to Abbotsford as a place of safety from the outside world.Due to its symbolic recurrence throughout Abbotsford, the Portcullis Gate is considered by many to be one of the homersquos most important features.It not only serves as an image of grandeur for guests arriving at Abbotsford, but also symbolises Scottrsquos intentions for Abbotsford as a place of retreat from the chaos of the outside world.The gate was so iconic that it was photographed by William Fox Talbot in October,  for his book The Sun Pictures of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"thea-and-thomas-are-the-most-popular-baby-names-in-the-borders","story":"BORDERS parents have gone against the grain when choosing baby names this year.The most popular choice for new-born girls in the region during the past  months is Thea -

However, the change in use had gone unnoticed by Scottish Borders Council, until concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received a notice from the council outlining its grievances. It reads: ldquoIt appears to the council that a breach of planning control has occurred within the last ten yearsldquoIn terms of the character of the property, the house, while having nine bedrooms is advertised as being able to accommodate - guests, with the master bedroom being advertised with six double beds along with another of the bedrooms being advertised as having four double beds, which is not normally found in a residential property.ldquoThe characteristic of the use, where guests are generally visiting for a short period of time, and the numbers of guests being accommodated, has led to an increase in late night activity and disturbance within the area, to the detriment of the neighbouring residential amenity.ldquoAs stated above the use is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity, with regular reports of late night disturbances being made to ious council departments, including environmental health and the anti-social behaviour team as well numerous complaints to Police Scotland.Mr Cameron has subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.Acting on Mr Cameronrsquos behalf, Edinburgh-based solicitors MHD Law have submitted an appeal statement to the DPEA.It reads: ldquoIt is alleged in the notice that a lsquomaterial change of usersquo of the property has taken place.ldquoHowever, Mr Cameron has been using the property as accommodation for short stay visitors since , and so for over ten years. In terms of the town and country planning act, no enforcement action may be taken by the local authority lsquoafter the end of the period of  years beginning with the date of the breachrsquo.ldquoMr Cameron therefore submits that the local authority is now barred from taking enforcement action, given that the use of the property as accommodation for short stay visitors has been in place for more than the period of ten years specied there.ldquoThe planning enforcement notice says that the use of the property for short term visitor stays lsquois having a detrimental impact on residential amenity.ldquoMr Cameron had been made aware of neighbour complaints and so reasonably assumed thathe addressed the causes of activities giving rise to those complaints he could reassure the council he was taking the matter seriously and minimising the impact of the behaviour complained of.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.However, the council has not backed down, and in their own submission to the Scottish Government, council planning officers state that because Mr Cameron still used the lodge as his main residence until , the ten year limitation on change of use enforcement had not come into effect.Ron Kirk, Scottish Borders Councilrsquos managing solicitor, wrote to the DPEA: ldquoBy his own admission, as set out in his e-mail to the council on  September , theappellant confirms that the property was still being used as a main residence up to a period of time within .ldquoThe council respectfully submits that an uninterrupted period of use could not have been established whilst the property was still the appellantrsquos main residence and therefore the relevant trigger point for the ten year period in terms of the town and country planning act was the date in  when the material change of use commenced.ldquoIt is acknowledged that the appellant has sought to address concerns surrounding the anti-social behaviour and the consequent effects this is having on the amenity of the residential area resulting from the use of the dwellinghouse, it is the view of the council that these matter are not a relevant consideration in respect of this appeal given that the appellant has accepted use of the dwellinghouse for short terms commercial visitor accommodation is a breach of planning control.Mr Kirk concludes his statement by saying that ldquoit is the position of the council that in order to remedy the breach of planning control in respect of an authorised use the only available route is to cease the unauthorised use and revert the back to the established use, meaning thatthe council is successful in its enforcement Mr Cameron will have to cease using the property for short-term lets.Having received both sides of the argument, the Scottish Governmentrsquosplanning officers will now conduct a site visit at Linton Lodge and make a judgement on the case, which is expected by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"community-rallies-to-support-the-family-of-amanda-cox","story":"A HUGE community effort to support the family of Amanda Cox will continue this evening.The

Irsquom all for what is being proposed but in the interest of fairness we need to go back to the public on this.However, some councillors have spoked out in opposition to introducing any anti-alcohol by-laws at all.In particular, Jedburgh and District councillor Scott Hamilton said the by-laws would contravene personal liberties, and tabled a motion calling for the proposals to be scrapped altogether.He told fellow councillors: ldquoBy agreeing to move these by-laws forward, we will be starting a process which barbarously pushes back our freedoms and personal liberties.ldquoIt is the freedom of choice which has underpinned the very ethos of le in the western world, and we this morning seek to change a liberty. Granted, it is a small liberty, but it must be treated with utmost care and consideration.ldquoWe need to have a real and considered debate before deciding on this.

I think this helps us grow the Borders on to success.ldquoThe stats sound almost academic and meaningless, but wersquore talking about a development here of hundreds of jobs.ldquoThat is a huge leap for the Borders, especially when these better, higher-paid jobs come in. It gives us a business space of a quality which we donrsquot currently have in the Borders, and it gives us control over a potentially fantastic housing site.ldquoThis is positive and a good news story.Council officers estimate that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, Tweeddale East councillor and opposition leader Stuart Bell claims the estate is valued at much less than the council paid for it.Mr Bell also revealed that Scottish Governmentrsquos district valuation service, a body offering impartial advice on how public money is spent, also told the council the property was not worth what it has paid for it.He told members: ldquoThe Lowood Estate acquisition, which we are undertaking by ourselves, remains a tortured tale.ldquoThe pound.m outlay, plus expenses, plus cost of maintaining the land and assets, plus the cost of borrowing, means wersquoll need to sell it all for over poundm just to break even. ldquoReports we have seen in private say there will also be signicant infrastructure costs to develop the site.ldquoI donrsquot believe this site is worth pound.m when you go into the detail of the terms and conditions of the sale, and that was the opinion of the district valuer, whose assessment with vacant possession, which we will not have, was much lower than pound.m.ldquoEven when adjusted up for a special assumption, the district valuer still valued the land at a price lower than we are paying.ldquoThis is a speculative and risky expenditure of public money at a time when, quite apart from Brexit, there is shuddering uncertainty in markets. ldquoHouse prices and land values can go down as well as up. We should not be spending public money on buying this estate at this time for more than it is worth.ldquoIn what alternative opportunities could we invest poundm ldquoThis council should invest enough in roads to signicantly improve the road condition index, but we cannot afford to do that.ldquoThis council should commit to four new high schools in  years, but you wonrsquot make that commitment.ldquoI will not tell the electors in Peebles, as you will have to, that they cannot have a new high school within  years when you have tied up poundm for  or so years in Tweedbank.ldquoWe canrsquot even cut the grass properly in our cemeteries, but this administration glibly spends poundm on buying a private estate.ldquoThis is a decision I fear you may come to regret.In reply, East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton defended the deal, claiming that pressures on local government spending made such projects necessary, saying: ldquoWersquove had several briefings on this subject, and officers have presented us with an excellent paper on the future benefits of developing this site, especially with the council in control.ldquoNow councillor Bell is scaremongering about service cuts, but this is a smokescreen to keep us away from the real issue at hand, which is the financial pressure being passed down to Scottish local authorities by his SNP colleagues.ldquoScottish local councils are currently expected to continue services while facing continuous cuts.ldquoIt will be very interesting to see what opposition councillors bring to the table for their budget proposals. No doubt there will be some vanity projects.The Tweedbank masterplan, going hand in hand with the Borders Railway blueprint programme, includes earmarking residential and business space on the estate, as well as expanding Tweedbank and rebranding the current industrial estate there as the Borders Innovation Park.The deal agreed with the estatersquos owner, Alexander Hamilton, is for the remaining  acres still in private hands to add to the  acres bought from then owner Constance Hamilton using compulsory powers by the former Roxburgh County Council in the early s to create Tweedbank.The land will now be owned by Lowood Tweedbank, a company set up and owned by the council."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-scots-history-is-on-parade-at-peebles-library","story":"AN historic link between Peebles and what was Britains oldest infantry regiment was further strengthened this week with a presentation at the towns library.The Royal Scots was raised by Royal Warrant in  and subsequently served with distinction for almost four centuries through many campaigns across the globe.The Regiment continued to recruit almost entirely from Edinburgh, the Lothians and Peeblesshire until its amalgamation just over a decade ago.During the First World War the Regiment expanded to  battalions in which over , men served.During the - conflict a total of , Royal Scots made the ultimate sacrice - many from the Borders, including  from Peebles,  from Innerleithen and  from Walkerburn.The Royal Scots served in most of the campaigns of the First World War, from the Western Front to Bulgaria.To mark the close connection with the area the Regiment was awarded the Freedom of Peebles in .As the centenary year of World War I ending draws to a close this month, a presentation was made on Tuesday by representatives of The Royal Scots Association at Peebles Library.Nick Edwardson and Alex Dockar presented a rare three-volume History of the Royal Scotsto head librarian Alison Tait.Mr Edwardson told us: \"The presentation of the volumes acknowledges the contribution made by the county of Peeblesshire to the story of Britainrsquos senior infantry regiment.\"The Regiment was amalgamated in  but its long history of proud service continues today as part of st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland.The Colours of the Regimentrsquos th Battalion which historically had a particular association with Peebles were laid up in the town in .And they are now displayed outside the entrance to the library in the Chambers Institute.The three-volume History of the Royal Scots will now be available for everyone to read in the library."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-parents-to-register-children-for-nursery-places","story":"PARENTS in Tweeddale are being invited to register their children for a place at nursery.Enrolment week takes place from Monday, January , to Friday, January .

This is how it should be.#Rothwell added: #Approaching Greenock in the van was intimidating. As we turned up the Clyde, a massive dark grey wall of torrential rain swept in and sent the windscreen wipers into overdrive.#I was called in as a late substitute for Mike Hancock who sadly could not take part.#I was confident that I had the required fitness, skills, and equipment, as I had recently been bashing around the tricky broken hilly roads of Northumberland on my superb Trek Emonda Disc road bike.#I had a fantastic support crew in Angus, Gayle, and John, and I was very much looking forward to a big adventure, despite the horrendous weather situation.#A deep low pressure system had started battering the north west and I was riding straight into its path at just the wrong time.#Weather warnings had been issued, the average wind speed would reach mph+, and lots of heavy rain was guaranteed.#Still, my logic was to dynamically risk assess the situationthings got too hairy, I would stop and not continue unless safe to do so.By the time I left Roseneath I was throughly saturated and needed to change gloves frequently. This set the tone for a very wild and long night.#Some shelter was occasionally enjoyed on eastern roads but crossing over to western areas, and dealing with side-winds that literally pulled the bike out of my hands was incredibly mentally and physically demanding.#Climbing the mighty Rest and Be Thankful was a turning point though.#The weather was atrocious but the mountains loomed blacker than night sky either side of me.#The road rose and car headlights hovered high in the distance, which told me the top had to be earned.#A howling headwind tried its worst to hinder my progress but the adrenaline was really flowing now and I was feeling alive and focused.#At Lochgilphead, I was delighted to hook up with Alex Flinn, and soon after Robert Semple, who would escort me around the southern end of the peninsula.

If you order a drink in Italy, at the very least yoursquore going to get olives, bits of pizza, focaccia, dips. Sometimes the snacks that accompany an ldquoaperitivo amount to a meal, as in Venice. Down the sinuous backstreets and alleys of La Serenissima, yoursquoll find those little bars, bacari, whose cicchetti pre-date the fashion for small plates and tapas. They donrsquot look like much when theyrsquore closed: a narrow front, bottles obscuring the window, a couple of rickety tables outsideyoursquore lucky. Then they spring to le in the early evening when theyrsquore thronged with locals, and the bar tops fill up with plates of Adriatic seafood from the Rialto market, cured meats, local cheeses, salt cod, and much more.Itrsquos this spirit that West Room tries to capture. Drably Venetian decor wouldnrsquot work here. Instead therersquos supersized lampshades, one of those geometric tiled floors that makes you feel dizzyyou look at it for too long, and led walls enclosing a grid of gold leaf squares, the look you get in historic Italian caffegraves that have been recently refurbished.West Room misses a trick: the wine list isnrsquot Italian enough, with only one Venetian red. But the food  It starts and ends well. Fritto misto, the acid test of clean deep-frying, competence with batter, and truly fresh fish, passes with flying colours: pearly squid, stf, crisp whitebait, surprisingly good prawns , a mellow aioli. Focaccia is a touch amateurish, in a good way, less airy than some but with an addictive, salt-dusted, well-oiled crust. Risotto of East Neuk crab with chilli and tomato is fighting an internal battle with itself. The rice is cooked to a correctly firm consistency it forms the requisite gentle slump and you can see ample strands of white crab meat within it. But the acidic whack of the tomato and the heat of the chilli beats its gentle charms into submission. Three fat pea, mozzarella and basil arancini are a steal for pound., interesting too with fresh green peas at their heart and a pesto that tastes homemade.Broad bean bruschetta, meanwhile, is the antithesis of the usual lazy effort. Painstakingly double-podded beans piled high on toasted focaccia spread with whipped ricotta, and heaps of oily fresh mint to dress it. Homemade ravioli of the day constitute another bargain for pound. Their ricotta filling is simple, even timid, the perfect foil, in fact, for a vibrant, handmade parsley pesto. They come with a clutter of toasted hazelnuts, crisped-up cavalo nero, cylinders of salt-baked golden carrots that are still in their skin, and ribbons of sweet pink pickled carrot. The totality, although most definitely not an Italian line-up, makes a jolly interesting veggie option thatrsquos speaks of kitchen effort.Prices of artisan cheese being what they are, I am amazed by our pound. plate of Pecorino al Vino, a mouth-filling cheese from the Veneto that matures in red wine for at least three months. Here are three thick chunks, four crostini toasts made from the in-house focaccia, a tablespoonful of fragrant acacia honeycomb. I couldnrsquot buy these ingredients in a shop for this price.We polish off the tiramisugrave in seconds, that often tedious dessert, which is rather compelling here. Nearly liquied, thin sponge floats on powerful espresso, under a thin creamy froth punctuated by fatty curds of mascarpone cheese. Itrsquos barely sweet, a commendably grown-up pudding.West Room is the opposite of a cynical establishment. Hard working, top drawer sourcing, it talks up, not down, to its customers.

The SNP is the only party showing true leadership by knocking heads together and making the case for a better way forward.ldquoScotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in Europe. If we have the chance to do so through another EU referendum we should grasp that opportunity.ldquoBut there is no doubt whatsoever that the utter chaos of Brexit from the Tory party has strengthened the case for Scotland taking its future into its own hands through independence. We cannot go on like this with Scotlandrsquos interests ignored at every turn."},{"url":null,"title":"kevin-mckenna-why-is-scottish-labour-determined-to-let-down-scotland","story":"When the Tories spoke about Scotlandrsquos best interests being protected by the Union you sensed they actually believed this heart and soul. The word Unionist is included in the full title of their party and the historic privileges enjoyed by them and the cultural constituency they represented have all indeed flourished when Westminsterrsquos writ has run in its four constituent parts.This is not to say that they are anything less than fully Scottish, just that they believe Scotlandrsquos destiny to be forever entwined with the UK. Itrsquos merely one among many declarations of what it means to be Scottish and none the less valid for that and is characterised chiefly by an historic affectionnot love for what they understand Britishness to be.Thus, there was an honesty and integrity about the Scottish Toriesrsquo opposition to independence that was absent in much of the campaigning of Scottish Labour chiefs and their water-carriers on social media. This seemed to be fuelled less by any great love for the Union than by an implacable malevolence ndash sometimes approaching outright hatred ndash towards anything sponsored by the SNP. At times you formed an impression thatScottish independence was being proposed by wee green men emerging from a spaceship they would receive a fairer hearing in some Labour circles than anyone sporting a yellow and black rosette.The seeds of such bitterness were probably sewn in hundreds of Westminster and electoral campaigns keenly contested and with a signicant degree of rancour with the SNP. On these occasions it wasnrsquot the Tories who were threatening their influence and privileges but the SNP, even though they may have shared largely similar social agendas. Many simply couldnrsquot stomach the possibility of permitting what would be the ultimate triumph of the SNP evenit meant ignoring what their instincts were telling them: that Westminster was beginning to favour options for the rich in its economic policies and to re-direct any resultant working-class bitterness in the direction of immigrants.Even the most reactionary of Tory governments come to power on the back of working class votes. For this to occur, they must always have an assortment of familiar phantoms and usual suspects to hand and these must be leveraged by calls to national unity and security or the echoes of empire. Any notions Scottish Labour might have entertained about de-coupling from such a polity were swamped by antagonism towards the wretched SNP. They also fashioned a  narrative to conceal such narrow animosity. Thus, the lie that the referendum was nasty and isive and that Yes supporters despised the English became the distinguishing feature of their campaign.It was probably this, as much as anything , that formed the tipping point for many Labour supporters who, having signalled their rejection of such a dishonest narrative, were subsequently marginalised and made to feel like aliens in their own party. None of them have since ed to the Labour fold and this, more than anything  is why Labour in Scotland is a spent force with no immediate prospect of recovery.Foolishly, Richard Leonard, Labourrsquos latest leader in Scotland, continues to oppose independence while exhibiting no shred of original thinking on policy that might make his party attractive once more to the tens of thousands of its former supporters who have abandoned it.As Westminster takes a two-week holiday while the clock ticks towards a No-deal Brexit nothing in the behaviour of Labourrsquos UK leadership has done anything to inspire confidence either. In the last seven days Irsquove asked several Labour supporters to describe their partyrsquos Brexit strategy. No two answers were the same and all were marked by confusion. Any empathy they had previously felt with Jeremy Corbynrsquos policies on social justice has evaporated, largely on the perception that he has been found grievously wanting on this the biggest political issue of their lives. No leadership, no consistency, no courage and no conviction are the unorm verdict of Mr Corbynrsquos lamentable last two weeks at Westminster. By contrast, Theresa May, even in these her darkest dayshas displayed all of these attributes.The spectre of a No-deal Brexit now looms large and with it the real threat, which the UK Government has now admitted, of civil disorder. These and the exposure of Mr Corbynrsquos failure of leadership will test the propaganda unit of the Better Together campaign during the second referendum on Scottish independence.Once, it might have been a valid argument to insist that in a time of national crisis we must pull in the same direction. Butyou have been ignored and treated with contempt as Scotlandrsquos Government and Scotlandrsquos parliament have been in their efforts to help get a decent Brexit or even to mitigate its worst effects then such appeals are rendered worthless and hollow.In  Westminsterrsquos lurch towards reactionary and socially isive policies tipped many of us towards an independent Scotland. Such a hard right agenda also seemed to act as an accelerant for darker elements with racist agendas. More than four years later the England that many of us loved and admired is on the verge of capitulating to these forces and it looks like UK Labour has been fighting them with a peashooter.When it comes time to have our second referendum ndash and we will have it ndash there will be a moral dimension to consider for those who previously voted No and this will outweigh everything . For by this time Brexit and its process will have destroyed their once cherished economic arguments and their warnings of social ision."},{"url":null,"title":"scotrail-boss-handed-bumper-pay-rise-since-starting-job","story":"Critics have reacted with angerafter a breakdown of high earners compiled by the Cabinet Office showed Mr Hynes is now earning between pound, and pound,.When his appointment was announced in early , Network Rail said he would have a salary of pound,.The rise comes amid continuing criticism of ScotRailrsquos performance as passengers endure persistent delays and cancellations.Mr Hynesrsquo stated pay does not include performance-related bonuses, which are capped at  per cent of his salary ndash potentially taking his final package to more than pound,.Scottish Labourrsquos transport spokesman Colin Smyth said passengers wanted ldquobetter services, not inflation-busting pay rises for executives.He said: ldquoAt a time Scotlandrsquos hard pressed rail passengers are facing a fare hike in the New Year for overcrowded, delayed and cancelled trains, they will be angry that ScotRail bosses are seeing their pay rise.Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA transport union, said services had deteriorated in the  months since Mr Hynes took over.He said: ldquoItrsquos ridiculous to find out that his pay has gone up by more than some rail workers members earn in a year.ldquoThis is a slap in the face for ScotRail staff doing overtime over the Christmas period to make ends meet.ldquoAlex was the highest paid public servant in Scotland when he started and hersquos now presiding over the biggest failure in public service in Scotland.

This does not include bonuses.Last year it emerged Mr Hynes was being paid a pound, car allowance despite commuting to work by train every day.Scottish Liberal Democrat Leader Willie Rennie insisted passengers are not getting value for money, adding: ldquoIt is quite a remarkable decision to reward ScotRailrsquos chief when performance has been so poor.\"It came as it emerged  ScotRail trains were taken out of service and sent south of the Border after their lease expired on December .Mr Rennie described the move as a ldquohuge forward planning failure at a time of increased delays and cancellations following problems with the roll-out of new Hitachi trains, an industrial dispute and a shortage of train crew due to training.However, ScotRail said the removal of the trains was factored into the new timetable change which came into force on December , and would free up space in the depots for new and refurbished trains.Earlier this week, Nicola Sturgeon branded the recent level of cancellations ldquounacceptable and said she wanted the power to nationalise Scotlandrsquos railways. The current ScotRail franchise is held by Dutch firm Abellio.Sir Peter Hendy, Network Railrsquos chair, defended Mr Hynes pay.

It takes me back to when I was young, six or seven, maybe, to a time when we lived in an old house, with a big open fire, and we used to sit there of an evening ndash it would have been about this time of year ndash roasting marshmallows.I can smell the fire ndash not a roaring one, but mellow embers with the odd little puff of smoke. I can taste the rich toffee-sweetness of the melting marshmallows.But, therersquos something  too ndash is that Jamaica ginger cake  Not homemade, but the sticky one out of the packet. Itrsquos luxurious, and it makes me smile.So,you have a whisky and the tasting notes donrsquot make any sense to you, donrsquot worry. More powerful forces may be at work ndash just open your mind and see what you can see.www.benromachCaol Ila -year-oldABV: %Price: poundThis is another one ndash another malt that holds a special place in my heart.When my two daughters were young, this was the one I remember sitting back with as the madness of Christmas began to subside at the end of the day. And itrsquos still the one Irsquoll go forI see it on a menu after dinner at a hotel.Caol Ilais a Muhammad Ali of a dram hellip it dances around, all lightness and fruit itrsquos fascinating and mesmerising.But at some point or other, you just know itrsquos going to knock you out with a wonderful smack of smoke.It starts off light and refined, with fresh herbal notes and hints of damp grass, but then the coastal smokiness really kicks in ndash not unlike hot-smoked salmon. Itrsquos full-bodied and has a long, warming finish.As you add water, a wonderful freshness ndash much like Ardbeg ndash takes over, making this a hugely satisfying dram.www.maltsOld Particular Cameronbridge -year-oldABV: .%Price: poundWe couldnrsquot let a list of brilliant whiskies go without including a single-grain. And what better place to find one than at legendary Glasgow-based independent bottler Douglas Laing The Cameronbridge isnrsquot exactly blessed with the beautul surroundings of Strathisla or Glengoyne, or the rugged backdrop of Dalwhinnie ndash it sits in Fersquos industrial heartland, just a stonersquos throw from Methil and Leven.It may not have had the most romantic of beginnings, but this Cameronbridge is a real ndash and rare ndash treat.In my mind, the defining characteristic of single-grain whiskies is cream, and this expression is awash with it.In fact, when you smell it, therersquos almost an aroma oftoffee sauce ndash salted caramel mixed with all that cream, but with a bit of honey thrown in for good measure.You could almost pour it on your sponge pudding.Therersquos cakiness too ndash in fact, this is more like a big, rich sharing dessert than a dram.Now, wherersquos my spoon  I want another helping .www.douglaslaingcomOld Pulteney -year-oldABV: %Price: poundIf anyone ever says that whisky isnrsquot a product of its surroundings, this is definitely a dram to make them change their mind.Itrsquos made in Wick, and its warehouses are exposed to the full force of the North Sea.This gives the whisky a wonderful coastal, salty personality ndash and once you get to know it, you can recognise it anywhere.But donrsquot think this dram is harsh in any way at all. The -year-old is aged entirely in bourbon casks, and this gives the finished product a wonderful richness and sweetness ndash and the distinctive vanilla that is always there when bourbon casks are used.Look for vanilla, tablet and almost burnt sugar on the nose, with a flavour balancing chocolate and toffee indulgence with citrusy fruit and that coastal tang.This level of quality is great value at pound, but be aware that Old Pulteneyis regularly on offer ndash I think itrsquos pound in Tesco right now, and at that price itrsquos a steal.www.oldpulteneyKilkerran -year-oldABV: %Price: poundBefore we start, letrsquos take a moment to thank Kilkerran ndash because the distillery where itrsquos made, Glengyle, effectively saved Campbeltownrsquos status as a whisky region.After many years of only having two distilleries, Springbank and Glen Scotia, it was deemed that Campbeltown could no longer be classed as a region.However, when Glengyle was resurrected ndash it was an old distillery that closed in the s but was brought back to le in  ndash the three operational distilleries could maintain their status.And just as well, as Campbeltown malts are unique ndash robust, oily and bursting with character ndash and this Kilkerran -year-old is certainly a classic of its kind.Itrsquos oaky and slightly peaty, but super-rich, sweet and velvety smooth at the same time. And, of course, therersquos the oiliness and saltiness yoursquod expect from a Campbeltown dram.This whisky was only launched in , but it surely deserves its place among the true greats of this amazing region.All hail Kilkerran ndash you are indeed a hero!kilkerran.scotMacallan -year-old Double CaskABV: %Price: poundThe Macallan has been looking a million dollars lately hellip literally. One of its bottles ndash a -year-old distilled in  ndash broke that mad, seven-figure barrier just a few weeks ago, but far more importantlythe distillery moved house hellip to possibly the most beautully perfect building I have ever seen.So, as the year draws to a close, I was pretty sure my impression of this superbrand couldnrsquot get any more positive hellip until I tasted the Double Cask.Much of my whisky journey has been a hunt for the dferent and the new, but when I come back to a dram like The Macallan and its perfect richness, I remember therersquos a reason why this is a worldwide favourite.The Double Cask uses whisky aged in barrels of both American and European ex-sherry oak to take the spirit to a whole new level.Therersquos the classic dried fruit. Itrsquos creamy and you can almost see the drops of honey. But therersquos the sweet sharpness of marmalade and almost the spiced luxury of a cinnamon pastry.A finish of vanilla and more sweet fruit and I have only one challenge on my mind as we end .Go on Macallan, I dare you ndash top that next year.www.themacallanArdbeg An OaABV: .%Price: poundTo me, Ardbeg is about only one thing ndash itrsquos what identies it the minute I stick my nose in the glass.Smoke ndash pure, perfect, wood-embers smoke.And the An Oa ndash launched last year as the first addition to Ardbegrsquos core range for more than a decade ndash doesnrsquot disappoint.Itrsquos there in spades, mixed with a wonderful cocktail of cakey sweetness and butterscotch richness. Therersquos a luxurious creaminess in the background too, just in case you didnrsquot get just how special this dram really is.Then,you add water therersquos another treat in store ndash something I donrsquot understand from such a peaty whisky, but which I always look for in an Ardbeg.The peaty oomph remains, but something  appears ndash the most wonderful freshness. Itrsquos like a summer breeze blowing through freshly washed linen just hung out to dry on a line by the sea.If you like peaty whisky, you really canrsquot go wrong with Ardbeg, but this was the first time Irsquod tried the An Oa.Time to rewrite my whisky wish-list, I think!www.ardbegGordon  MacPhail Discovery Bunnahabhain -year-oldABV: %Price: poundThere are Islay whiskies ndash the ones that take a barrowload of peat and stuff it down your throat ndash and there are Islay whiskies ndash the ones that tone things down, some a teeny bit, some a lot. For me, Bunnahabhain sits in the second camp hellip and itrsquos all the better for it.So when Gordon  MacPhail ndash one of the countryrsquos small band of legendary independent bottlers ndash gets hold of an already interesting dram, itrsquos time to take notice.This Discovery expression ndash part of a wider range from around the country ndash is rich and exciting, with dried fruit and sherry on the nose, and hints of spice, rich vanilla and orange. Itrsquos super- smooth, and as you taste it the initial spice morphs into more richness of dates and plums. At the finish, therersquos chocolate ndash maybe not milky bar, but definitely not bitter dark ndash and more fruits.The bottlerrsquos art is a critical part of the whisky firmament ndash they hunt out interesting casks and, when they find them they bottle them. Soyou see a bottlerrsquos version of one of our favourites, go for it ndash you will definitely be in for a memorable voyage of Discovery.gordonandmacphailNaked GrouseABV: %Price: poundAs I said in the introduction to this whole article,yoursquore after something truly memorable, you really donrsquot have to spend a fortune to get it hellipyou know where to look.

The bleak splendour of Drumochter and Dalwhinnie are miles behind the Cairngorms and Aviemore are a rapidly fading memory. Inverness isnrsquot far off, and from there itrsquos on to the wild lands of Ross and Caithness.Yoursquod expect a whisky here to have ruggedness its heart ndash to be as unforgiving as a northern winter. But no, not a bit of it. The climate round here is softer and more gentle than you might imagine ndash and the spirit thatrsquos born from this land reflects that.The Tomatin -year-old is smooth and silky, with a rich, fruity aroma coming from its traditional mix of ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks. Itrsquos buttery at first, but there are also notes of marzipan. The flavours are powerful, but therersquos sweetness and richness, with oaky vanilla, ripe apples and pears. Hints of stem ginger and citrus add a tangy treat.Soyou ever thought the Highlands were bleak, think again.

Theyrsquore a ready-made whisky collection.There are six names to look out for, and each blends together some of the best malts from its region to capture the unique character of each area.The fun, light Epicurean is the lowland offering, while rich,complex Speyside is represented by Scallywag.If you head into the Highlands, look out for Timorous Beastie, and slightly peated, slightly salty Rock Oyster is a island-inspired tidal wave.If yoursquore into a dram from Islay or Skye, why not try Big Beat , while the newest addition to the range,The Gauldrons, captures the unique, excellent power of Campbeltown.The range was launched with ldquobasic versions, but since then it has grown, and a host of special editions and extra expressions have turned these Regional Malts into a veritable reference library of whisky.So put on your reading glasses, pull up a chair and get studying. You will be tested at the end of the lesson.www.douglaslaingOld Pulteney HuddartABV: %Price: poundThis is a strange experience. Old Pulteney has been a favourite of mine for many, many years, but trying the Huddart ndash released just this year and named after the street in which the distillery sits ndash was like meeting the younger sister of my best pal that I didnrsquot know existed.I recognise her immediately, but at the same time shersquos so dferent from the friend I know and love.The Huddart is definitely an Old Pulteney ndash the saltiness and drtwood-on-a-beach coastal personality tell us that ndash but itrsquos been finished in casks which previously held peated whisky, and this gives it a wonderful far-off smokiness that adds a layer of real intensity to an already powerful dram.But therersquos a ton of richness too, with sweet vanilla balancing the intensity of smoke, and I loved the buttery, mouth-coating finish. This is definitely one to come back to on a cold, stormy night when I have some time on my hands, and the music player to myself. Van Morrison, I think.Huddart, itrsquos been a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

Enabling the websitersquos restricted mode helps to prevent children from accessing these videos.ldquoThe other thing you can possibly do is download some of the apps that you want them to use, so theyrsquore ready to go on the phone as you hand it to them, Ms Bombusa suggested.It is also advised to go through the device and switch off location services, as older children may be unintentionally sharing their location on social media apps.Gaming consolesGaming consoles feature parental controls, which allow parents to limit what children can do on devices such as the PlayStation  and Xbox One.Screen time settings allow grown-ups to decide specic times a child is allowed to play their console and how long for.Similar to smartphones, parents can also set spending limits to stop or restrict how much children buy in the game stores.LaptopsIf a child is getting a laptop this Christmas, itrsquos advised to set up a child account while an adult remains administrator, meaning parents have control over what they can download and access.Internet service providers offer broadband protection directly from the router, meaning inappropriate content and malware-infected websites are automatically filtered out as an added safety net, not just for laptops but all devices.Smart speakersSmart speakers such as the Amazon Echo and Google Home include protections against the ability to buy products, and that can help block any inappropriate content, such as music with expletives.Many of these controls can be found within the accompanying app used to set up the device or from the device makerrsquos website.Most importantly, Internet Matters recommends having regular conversations with children about how they use their gadgets."},{"url":null,"title":"us-government-unlikely-to-get-fully-back-to-business-for-days","story":"From coast to coast, the first day of the shutdown played out in uneven ways.The Statue of Liberty was still open for tours, thanks to money from New York state, and the US Post Office was still delivering mail, as an independent agency.Yet the disruption has affected many government operations and the routines of , federal employees.Roughly , workers were deemed essential and were expected to work unpaid.The crisis of illegal activity at our Southern Border is real and will not stop until we build a great Steel Barrier or Wall.

That would be outrageous and, as the Committee has heard, fundamentally undermine efforts to target support where it is most needed.“Orkney has the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty at present.

The company asked Ofgem to approve the project, under a condition that, by the end of , there would be MW of generation capacity on Orkney committed to use the link once it is built.However, Ofgem has made its approval subject to SSEN demonstrating that, by no later than December , at least MW of new generation on Orkney has either been awarded a Contract for Dferencein the government#s  CfD auction or has secured planning consent and finance to construct its project.Meeting this increased generation target could prove challenging. This summer saw planning applications two large-scale wind farms, which would have contributed to this generation total, refused by Orkney Islands Council#s planning committee, following signicant public opposition.SSEN has said it #strongly disagrees# with MW of new generation being required, saying their figure of MW is based on industry best practice, which has been used to assess similar transmission investments across GB. SSEN has also said it is unclear why Ofgem is proposing a dferent test for Orkney, which it says conflicts with Ofgem’s own guidance on these types of transmission investments.Ofgem also says it plans to reduce the cost to consumers of building the link by seeking to replicate the outcomes of competition by using the #Competition Proxy# model, where it will set the revenue that SSEN can earn from building and operating the Orkney link based on its experience in cutting the costs of connecting offshore wind farms to the grid by tendering the ownership of these links.SSEN has stated concerns that the Competition Proxy model has  still not been fully developed by Ofgem, rather than the well-established Strategic Wider Works model.Ofgem has said it will make a decision on the business case for the link in spring next year and will confirm whether it will use the Competition Proxy model at the same time.Speaking on Friday, following the publication of Ofgem#s Needs Case consultation publication, David Gardner, SSEN#s director of transmission, said the recognition that the connection is needed is #a crucial step forward#, adding: “Whilst there are still several obstacles to overcome, having got this far it is important we don’t miss this opportunity to unlock Orkney’s vast renewables potential.#We will therefore continue to work in close consultation with our generation customers and wider stakeholders to address the key points raised by Ofgem in its consultation.”Ofgem has separately published a consultation on SSEN’s #Alternative Approach for Orkney# policy proposal, designed to overcome the barriers to connection faced by SSEN’s generation customers on Orkney.Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur welcomed Ofgem#s consultation but said there is still work to do to ensure SSEN#s proposals meet the needs and reflect the concerns of the local community.Aside from a transmission subsea cable from Orkney to Caithness, SSEN#s transmission reinforcement project, which, in one form or another, would stretch around most of the Orkney mainland and some of the south isles, would consist of:More information on SSEN#s Orkney Transmission Reinforcement project can be found at company#s website, here.For more on this story, see next Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The first £ payment will be made around the time a child starts nursery, to help with the costs of early learning and a further £ when they start school.Social security secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville said: “I am delighted we will be delivering the Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment earlier than originally planned, providing low income families with increased financial support. I am particularly pleased, that by not capping children, babies born in the last six months who already have a big brother or sister, and had no support from the UK Government because they were not the first child, will be eligible to get their payment.“With the Early Learning and School Age Payments, this means that for a two child family, the Best Start Grant will provide £, # £, more than they would get under the UK legacy benefit. That’s a substantial investment to ensure our under s get the best possible start in le and reflects this government’s emphasis on the early years.“Our focus on supporting people on low incomes, and the action we are taking stands in stark contrast to the UK Government, who last week was criticised by the UN Poverty Rapporteur for being in denial about the damage and misery that their welfare cuts were causing.”Connie is  and lives in Glasgow her baby is five months old.“I heard about the Pregnancy and Baby Payment through One Parent Families Scotland, who told me all about the grant and how to apply for it,” she said.“The payment will go toward clothes, nappies and shoes for my son, babies grow so quickly and he’s five months now.“This will make a real dference to me, it’s not a payment I was expecting. It will make le a bit easier, my income stays the same, but my outgoings are higher as this is my third child. My other children are four and five so the things I had for them I don’t have anymore, so I’m kinda starting again.“I got the baby box which is great, but you get size - month clothes in that, so the £ would be of benefit when he’s a wee bit bigger.” vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

More than , young people were at the heart of it, and planned a calendar of sporting, music and cultural events for all ages to enjoy.A world-first initiative, Year of Young People was a commitment made by the Scottish Government. Young people worked alongside decision makers to make sure they were involved in the creation of government policy. This year, they established a Youth Commission which examines mental health services. They will have a greater say in their education with the creation of a Scottish Learner Panel, and will hold those in power to account with the launch of the First Minister’s Question Time for children and young people.YoYP was delivered in partnership with local and national organisations including schools, youth work services, EventScotland , Young Scot, Scottish Youth Parliament, Children in Scotland and YouthLink Scotland.More than  young ambassadors volunteered their time to challenge the negative stereotypes of their peers. Their role is to represent their local area, promote activities and showcase the positive contributions young people make to their local community.Orkney’s Hope Laing was one of those who volunteered to be a young ambassador. She said: “Year of Young People has given Scotland an opportunity to build young people’s reputation, and provide more opportunities for them to influence and take action. “I am very proud that I have been one of the ambassadors for my area, and being involved in helping young people shine in my local community.“A few highlights are: Stromness Drama Club winning the National Youth Festival Estrella, on their amazing Young Enterprise Venture which won three awards at the Young Enterprise Finals and their Managing Director, who has been announced as Young Entrepreneur of the Year!“One group which I am part of, the West Mainland Youth Achievement Group, had success this year competing in the MoneyforLe scheme. We went to London to represent Scotland at a National level and won with our project called ‘Trash to Cash’.“During my time as ambassador, I have had the privilege to meet and work with so many people from all walks of le. Without this opportunity, I don’t think I would feel as confident as I do now when taking on new challenges.“I would like to think that stereotypes of young people in Orkney were not too bad, but this year has highlighted how much good can come from the community working together.

Most cash was paid to Scottish wind farms, with some earning more than £m a month for not supplying power.Whitelee and its extension on the outskirts of Glasgow, the biggest onshore wind farm in the UK, has received almost a fth of the entire pot since , with payments totalling more than £m to date.Meanwhile, the MW Clyde scheme, near Abington in South Lanarkshire, has raked in more than £m and the Grfin, near Aberfeldy in Perthshire, nearly £m. The amount paid out has been rising annually, despite a new transmission cable to export power from Scotland south of the Border.The fees, known as constraint payments, are paid for by households across the UK.Anti-wind campaigners say spending on constraints has got “completely out of control”, and described expansion of the industry as “reckless”.Lyndsey Ward, who lives in the Highlands, said: “The constraints situation is completely out of control. The Scottish Government is recklessly approving more and more turbines to be connected to a grid that has little hope of managing any power they produce. “The result is an ever-increasing number of turbines have to be switched off and it is the consumer who pays. “Industry also has the wind costs on their energy bills and they add that on to the goods and services they sell us.” The £. billion Western Link interconnector, which became operational last year, runs  miles underwater from Hunterston in Ayrshire to Connah’s Quay in North Wales.It was hoped by exporting power to England and Wales the cable would cut levels of compensation paid to energy firms when Scottish turbines have to be shut down because supply outstrips demand.But faults have seen the cable – a joint project between network operators National Grid and Scottish Power Transmission – unable to operate at full capacity until last month.So far there seems no reduction in payouts compared to the same time last year.Dr John Constable is director of the Renewable Energy Foundation, a charity which first exposed constraint payments to wind generators and publishes data on the costs.He said: “No-one expected the Western Link to be a complete solution to wind power constraint costs, but the continuing level of payments is strikingly high – £m in November, £.m in December so far – raising the question as to whether this very expensive interconnector represents value for money.”Energy regulator Ofgem approved the Western Link project following a cost-benefit analysis that showed it would reduce consumer bills.A spokeswoman for National Grid said: “The Western Link project is playing a vital role in reinforcing the existing UK transmission system … The project is in the early days of operation but will signicantly reduce the levels of constraint payments being made to wind generators.” A spokesman for Ofgem added: “Ofgem sets National Grid, as electricity system operator, strong financial incentives to manage constraint costs efficiently. Overall these costs are less than  per cent of a typical household electricity bill.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4847378.1545391589!/image/image.jpg","title":"funding injection for smart central heating project","story":"East Lothian-based thermal energy storage specialist Sunamp and energy supplier OVO have secured seven-figure funding to develop a commercially viable smart central heating system.The project brings together OVO’s intelligent energy management , called VCharge, with Sunamp’s super compact “heat batteries” which are said to store four times more heat than hot water tanks of a similar size.The firms have received £. million of grant funding from the UK government’s Low Carbon Heating Technology Fund for their collaborative zero carbon home project.Andrew Bissell, chief executive of Macmerry-based Sunamp, said: “It’s a fact that  per cent of energy used in UK homes is for heating and we are delighted to team up with the UK’s leading independent energy supplier and bring our UniQ heat batteries together with OVO’s Time of Use technology.“We aim to develop an accessible heating solution to deliver heating and hot water on demand and improve levels of comfort and lower fuel costs, energy consumption and carbon emissions in homes everywhere.”Toby Ferenczi, director of strategy at OVO, said: “Replacing a gas boiler with a smart electric system is the most practical and low-cost way to decarbonise heating.“By combining VCharge and Sunamp’s UniQ heat batteries, power can be drawn down according to the needs of the grid, resulting in running costs comparable to gas heating systems but without carbon emissions.“We are excited to work with Sunamp to develop this game-changing smart electric heat solution.”Energy and clean growth minister Claire Perry said: “By replacing fossil fuels with smart heating systems we have the potential to cut carbon emissions and save consumers money on their heating bills.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4847903.1545470140!/image/image.jpg","title":"jeremy corbyn says brexit would go ahead if labour won snap election","story":"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party would continue with Brexitit won a snap general election in the new year.The opposition leader told thehe would “go back and negotiate and see what the timetable would be” with BrusselsTheresa May triggered a vote and lost, thrusting his party into power.Meanwhile, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has said European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker’s behaviour towards women has been “grotesque” after the former Luxembourg prime minister played with a woman’s hair at a European Council meeting.Mr Corbyn told the paper that he would advocate Brexitthere was a second referendum on the issue, and attacked the bloc over its rules on state aid and competition.He told the : “I think the state aid rules do need to be looked at again, because quite clearly,you want to regenerate an economy, as we would want to do in government, then I don’t want to be told by somebody  that we can’t use state aid in order to be able to develop industry in this country.”Asked about Labour’s positionthere was a fresh popular vote, he told the paper: “It would be a matter for the party to decide what the policy would be but my proposal at this moment is that we go forward, trying to get a customs union with the EU, in which we would be able to be proper trading partners.”Ms Rudd, who backed Remain in the referendum, launched a scathing attack on Mr Juncker, labelling him “ghastly”.Mr Juncker and Mrs May were caught on camera having a robust discussion the day after Mr Juncker used a press conference to describe her negotiating strategy as “nebulous”.Ms Rudd replaced Esther McVey at the Department for Work and Pensions a month ago, having been sacked as Home Secretary over the Windrush scandal.In a wide-ranging interview, which will fuel speculation she has leadership ambitions, the Hastings MP was asked about Mr Juncker.She said: “ ghastly.

This is a month noted for its joie de vivre, bonhomie and what the German language, with typical economy, calls Weinachteneinkäuferwartung . It is signicant, perhaps, that the English language has no specic noun for the state of mind that settles on many of us during this special month. This state is marked by a niggling desire to get away – anywhere – in order to escape the state of mind that appears to affecting others.For some, the first appearance of Christmas lights is the signal that things are about to go downhill. In Edinburgh, this happens now in September, immediately after the Edinburgh Festival. This is in accordance with the desire of our local tourism promoters – a couthie lot – to inflict festivals on the long-suffering inhabitants of this city  , as the expression has it, and, indeed,  . For this, many feel they should be awarded  . But that is another subject, and it is too depressing to talk about it in a month during which we are all so spontaneously cheerful. The Reverend I.M. Jolly we most certainly are not.However, one feature of December that is genuinely enjoyable is the Christmas letter that people like to send their friends and relatives round about now. These are wonderful things to receive, and who does not feel a certain disappointment when they open a Christmas card and find that it contains nothing but good wishes for Christmas and the New Year  There is no point in sending others such thin fare: of course they have such wishes for you, and it would be odd,not actually hurtful,they were not to harbour such thoughts. By contrast, finding a cyclostyled letter within is a bonus, and sets the heart racing with anticipation.: Alexander McCall Smith: Edinburgh Airport should charge people to sit downAn important thing to understand about these letters is that they give an opportunity to boast, usually about one’s offspring. Usually this involves exam results, which form, on average, about half the content of a Christmas letter. When it comes to Highers and A levels and such things, people have no shame in trumpeting them loudly in the seasonal letter. Indeed, I have heard that the SQA, which controls exam results, is seriously thinking of withholding their release until December each year in order to ensure their topicality for Christmas letters. This is a helpful suggestion, although it may complicate university admission, which of course is another very fitting topic for the Christmas letter.What you should do in this respect is mention exam results indirectly. Don’t say Jane got nine As in her exams this year. That is clearly boastful and in bad taste. Rather, you should write, “Janeis still a bit worried about her university admission. I have assured her that anyone who gets nineA grades in her Advanced Highers has no need to worry, but does she listen to me  You know how children are!” Other family achievements should not be forgotten, and should all be referred to in a good Christmas letter. Once again, insert the information indirectly, as in this example: “We all went to Rome this year and had a wonderful time. The Pope looks so much younger, you know, when you see him close up. I mean, really close up, in his private study.” That conveys, in a very tactful way, the message you wish to convey. Then you might add, “We were a bit nervous of course, as this is the first time that we have had a direct experience of the beatication of a close relative . But it was such a simple, rather moving ceremony and we had a lovely dinner afterwards in a modest trattoria ...”: Alexander McCall Smith: Time to wake up and smell Europa’s coffee If you received an OBE or similar award this year, do not mention it directly. The following form of words will suffice: “We couldn’t get away in July, as planned, as I had to go down to London– just for the morning – what a bind!” If you went to the Garden Party, then the only way of conveying that information is to say something like this: “My goodness, it was a battle getting into my morning suitin July. There I was enjoying my statutory cucumber sandwich under the gaze of Arthur’s Seat, thinking of the strict diet ahead!” No more than that is necessary.All heavy colds and injuries must be mentioned. The attachment of a small photograph of an X-ray plate is optional. That, believe it or not, really was in a Christmas letter we received a few years ago. The fracture was an interesting one.

But he also reserved time for a thinly-veiled critique of the  SNP MPs at Westminster.: Would an independent Scotland face a hard border with England In conclusion to a maritime-themed analogy, in which he described Mrs May as “a barnacle clinging desperately to the hull”, Mr Salmond said: “Even the Scottish contingent seems unsure as to when, or even whether, to launch our Caledonian leboat and chart our own course for the continent.”“In fact, the only parliamentmentary group which appears secure and determined in their objectives are the Democratic Unionists. Speaking in the show’s closing monologe, Mr Salmond added: “Parliament should now take advantage of the Scottish ruling from the European Court of Justice and instruct the Government to revoke Article . This would allow the time and space for either a general election or a renewed referendum, or even just a rationale discussion to break the deadlock and chart a way forward, free from the looming clf edge. As we say in Scotland - that would make for a guid new year.”An SNP spokesman said: “The fact of the matter is this – an alternative must be found to the PM’s  choice of a bad deal which lacks support, or a bad deal which would spell disaster for jobs and living standards.“The SNP is the only party showing true leadership by knocking heads together and making the case for a better way forward.“Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in Europe. If we have the chance to do so through another EU referendum we should grasp that opportunity.“But there is no doubt whatsoever that the utter chaos of Brexit from the Tory party has strengthened the case for Scotland taking its future into its own hands through independence.

What followed has been the stuff of dreams.Back in , as the debate over Scotland’s constitutional future became ever more fractious, I grew accustomed to receiving some fairly unpleasant messages and Tweets from keyboard warriors who saw my scepticism about the SNP’s proposal as a matter of considerable treachery. Often they’d want to know what I was being paid to espouse the views I didand, when they were referring to my trade, they’d be sure to put the word journalist inside inverted commas, lest anyone be in any doubt that the truth was I was nothing more than a shill.Every day, I’d block dozens of accounts – ,, at the last count – and get on with my “so-called” “journalism”. But when the owner of an account by the name of @ropoem popped up on my timeline to challenge something I’d written, he stood out. Unlike my usual correspondents from the Yes side of the tracks, he was polite and playful.And so I followed him back and enjoyed our little exchanges, which never ended in agreement but always passed in good humour. Occasionally, I’d wonder who this guy was we seemed, politics aside, to have a lot in common. I’d wonder, too, what he made of me. Before long, I was to find out exactly who he was and, it turns out, he thinks I’m not so bad.In , the owner of my local video rental place bought a job lot of ”singles that had previously been used in jukeboxes. There were boxes and boxes of the things, which he knocked out at p each or a quid for three. To a -year-old music fan of limited means, this was a treasure trove. Over a period of months, I bought dozens of s – among them such classics as Rip it Up by Orange Juice, Werewolves Of London by Warren Zevon and  Carat Love Affair by The Associates – that I cherish still. When the stock on display ran low, the shopkeeper would produce yet more boxes containing yet more gems and, thus, one Saturday afternoon I walked out of his place with three recent hit singles – Cath, I’m Falling, and Young At Heart – by The Bluebells. What a magnicent score.These records – I’m Falling, especially – have remained great favourites of mine throughout the ensuing decades. I know them intimately yet they retain the power to thrill me.So when a friend emailed me in  to say he’d noticed I seemed to be getting on pretty well online with Bobby Bluebell, I was surprised and delighted. This @ropoem bloke, it turned out, was the songwriting genius behind some of my favourite records.An invitation to watch The Bluebells play in Glasgow a few days after the independence referendum followed, and when Bobby dedicated Young At Heart to me from the stage, I was fully smitten.I can be awkward with new people but Bobby and I slipped into an easy friendship, opening up about times good and bad, and enthusing about the music we loved.Perhaps I was being a little cocky, \u2028but when my mate Kenny, a drummer, and I, a sort-of guitar player, began renting out a rehearsal room in Edinburgh to make a racket, I invited Bobby along,he wasn’t doing anything , mind, and it was okayhe couldn’t make it.Not only did he make it, but he gave generously, patiently listening to scraps of music I’d written, to half-realised rfs, and offering gentle and wise guidance. Usually, this would entail him suggesting the removal of unnecessary noodling and the focus on the essence of the song. I may have been a know-it-all newspaper columnist but I was a know-nothing novice songwriter and here was someone who’d written for some of the biggest names in popular music – he’s written for Brian Wilson, for heaven’s sake – acting as my mentor. Soon, I was in not one but two groups with Bobby. Last year, our group Best Picture released their first single, Isabelle, and last week our other band, Fat Cops, released their debut, Hands Up! Get Down!, a song written by Bobby, the band’s keyboard player Neil Murray, and me. It was named single of the week by BBC Radio Scotland’s Afternoon Show. Proud  You bet.For someone who bought his first single in  and still buys them, these have been truly magical moments. And underpinning these developments is a friendship that came out of the blue. Bobby and I still disagree about politics, of course, but the circumstances of our meeting act as a constant reminder in these horribly turbulent times that political disagreement needn’t be a barrier to an enduring human connection.On  March, , Fat Cops’ debut LP will be released. We’re proud of it. It’s better than any of us – Bobby, Neil, Chris, Bass Chris, Al and I – imagined it might be and we’re looking forward to playing gigs to promote it. But the music we’re making is only part of the story. Yes, I’m now realising an ambition I’ve harboured for four decades, but I am only able to do that because of this most surprising friendship.And when it comes down to it, friendship is what really matters, isn’t it  We might live in troubling times with political leaders who want to ide us and extremists who want to help them in that objective but,we’re lucky enough to have them, our friends will sustain us through the darkest days.When @ropoem popped up on my Twitter timeline to tease me about my columns, I could – touchy as I can be – have taken the huff and told him where to go.Instead, I found a dear friend who has had the most profound and positive impact on my le.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4848087.1545513411!/image/image.jpg","title":"jeremy corbyn s pledge to go ahead with brexit is unfathomable says snp","story":"The SNP has branded Jeremy Corbyn #incapable of opposition# after the Labour leader warned he will press ahead with Brexithe becomes Prime Minister after a snap election.Corbyn played down the prospect of reversing the UK’s departure from the EU and declined to confirmhe would back “remain”there was a second referendum.The comments in an interview yesterday were described as “unfathomable” by the SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford after momentum appeared to have been building towards a second referendum in recent weeks.“Jeremy Corbyn has finally come off the fence he’s been sat on for the past two years – but unfathomably he’s come down on the same side as Theresa May,” Blackford said.“The Labour Party is incapable of providing opposition to the worst UK Government that most people can remember.“The SNP, meantime, will grasp any opportunity to see Scotland’s wishes respected.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure.

Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong  finally Mr Carmichael should know that the only reform of the eu that they will be doing is ever closer integration. Starting with what his former leader called a DANGEROUS FANTASY dreamed up by brexiteers, an EU ARMY. Well that DANGEROUS FANTASY has been seen to be a DANGEROUS REALITY since the referendum with EU armoured personel carriers on the streets of Paris battling french protestors.Is this DANGEROUS REALITY stuff for real Someone may have been listening to Trump and Farage#s comments on the EU army without turning on their b.s. filter.Why shouldn#t EU nations cooperate in defence matters  Is Ali saying NATO is a bad thing Since  it has become politically correct for democratic European neighbours to cooperate. Why not get over it What is this DANGEROUS REALITY Ali fears  Does he imagine the purpose of a EU army would be to attack domestic protesters across frontiers like the Soviet army did in Hungary in   Does he see the EU as a fascist entity that must be stopped  Before you know it he will be advocating the citizen#s right to bear arms so as to protect itself against the government like they do in the good old US of A. Just how whacky is his DANGEROUS REALTY No one gets to choose their nationality Ali, just how we feel about it. There is nothing natural or God-given in being Scottish, British, German or European. Why not celebrate what we have in common and not obsess about invented dferences resulting from random man made lines on a map  Scary scary stuff. and only a line on a map drawn by a king that separates Scotland and England. A separation you are keen to expand upon. I have to say you do seem confusedSo your British now,not a Shetlander, # accepting the majority wanting to be part of the E.U, So much for Wir Shetlandits Wir Westminster then!Give us a vote and I will vote with my head and my heart for Shetland to be clear of da lot a dem, EU, UK and Scotland all running massive deficits. We wid certainly be much better aff.Fake news strikes again then I guess#Which is this culture that demands you submit without question Ali   Sounds like it owes more to Henry Tudor than Kant and Rousseau. And what culture is it you are being asked to accept that separates us and is abhorrent to you   Eurovision   Persian   Mesophilic Perhaps you can expand on what your gripe actually is Ali,it isn’t pulling sovereignty with folk little dferent from ourselves.FYI should Brexiteers triumph I’d still rather separate Scotland from England and stay European as I don’t much want to be led by English nationalist bigots. No confusion there.As I said only a fool submits without question, and remaining in the eu is submitting without question.Go read the Lisbon treatyyou think it isn#t.I am intrigued as to what other opinions there is on Brexit, and whether or not this has a political agenda to suit the purpose for a particular party to benefit Is Brexit for the greater good of the few, but at the cost to the many Would Shetland be better off under Brexit   There does not appear to be a definite picture being drawn where people can make a concise and definitive choice. Even the politics which has caused this mess, seem to be at odds with each other  How do they expect the people of the countryto choose   The more you look into Brexit, the more I am convinced we would be better off on our own Maybe we should re-establish our links back to Denmark     Propaganda rules okPutting the culture issue Ali ducks aside I don’t get why pulling sovereignty when it is helpful is a problem, be that in the EU or even when accepting WTO rules which, guess what, weren’t written singlehandedly by her majesty’s government. Lisbon moved us to majority rule in a partnership of friendly nations. So what Perhaps the problem to following mutually beneficial accept-some-trade-off rules set by the collective group is where you fear your culture dfers, so again I am wondering what part of European culture Ali fears and   or rejects. Eating snails asideI’ve always felt the UK is an appreciated part of mainstream European culture. There is a joint love of family, films, bevvy and football, eating out a bitpossible, a law abiding appreciation of the need for democracy, free speech, free press etc. Fondness of folktales and music, poetry, song, literature, dance and even opera unite people across national boundaries. Again, what is Ali’s problem Leaving the EU will be bad for jobs, farming and the NHS and we don’t know what the deals will bring to fishing or trade. Vive la dference and long live the similarities. I think your own bigotry is shinning through Peter, You talk about pooling sovereignty on one hand while labeling the English bigots. You say one thing while meaning another will you be standing for office soon A few thoughts, not for the first time have we, in Britain, find ourselves alone with Europe united against us and the will of our people. Not for the first time in our history has our position looked bleak with hard times being promised to come. We are being bullied by a cabal of bureaucratic nonentities answerable to no one who would try and isolate and distance us from our Commonwealth friends. Our Sovereignty and independence being undermined and the will of our people being ignored and denigrated. Contrary to some misinformed views, I and many like me, welcome selective immigration from Europe but not at the expense of our Commonwealth friends, whatever their colour and Creed. I welcome open Borders in Ireland just as they were long before the EU ever existed.We have stood alone before and always overcome adversity however grave. IfJunker and the cabal running the EU will not negotiate and remain intransigent, sneering and neo-bellicose It is time to stand tall and give them the two-finger salute, not just the Churchilian one.Heavens Ian, I wis imagining a violin accompaniment.We cant feed our bairns sovereignty Ian, even the Bank of England agrees that we are going to be worse off.A self-made economic disaster.Let them eat cake.Really Ian, “bullied”   Surely Theresa May said her deal was a “good deal”.There is such a thing as reading too manyeditorials. Last one I read saw Ian’s “bureaucratic nonentities” blasted for removing the right of the honest Brit to buy a lawnmower so loud it could deafen you. How very dare the EU protect UK consumers Does Ian imagine Claude Junker doesn’t speak for the elected leaders of the remaining EU nation states, but that rather they march to his tune  Lamentable.The remain member states are naturally protecting the interests of their citizens, including those of the Republic of Ireland, who are in the worlds largest trading block, which is conveniently on our doorstep.The Commonwealth ties however are lose, with distant nations who urged Britain to Remain. The EU block will secure better trade deals with those nations faster by dint of size and relevance.British diplomacy has never succeeded by cutting off our nose to spite our face.Perhaps we should learn from the Nordic foreign minister who quipped last week that there are two types of countries in Europe: small ones and small ones that don’t realise they are small.Has the question really been answered as to why the Tories, gave us this referendum to leave the EU in the first place,it was not going to be in their favour, despite the fact much of our business is with the EU What hidden agenda do the Tories have that they are not telling us###..until it is too late Have we all become xenophobic and argumentive about the pro#s and con#s of the EU, and the need to # fly the flag # as a weak demonstration of nationalityor Britishness, said very, very loosely   It seems very much we are playing right into the hands of the Tories, and singing their song to their beat.What has brought this on other than a narrow vision and not looking at the bigger picture    Brexit only means one thing, and this one thing is for the Tories to benefit for themselves no matter how you look at it.I would prefer to be as part of the EU, instead of being outside it, looking in.It is as simple as that.Of come off it Ali! I have never once labelled all English people as being bigots, nor would I. English nationalist bigots are bigots by definition of being bigots. It’s a bit like a numpty being a numptythat helps.Great attempt at ersion Ali, but just what, or should it be which, is your “abhorrent” cultural problem exactly  It can’t be this hard to specy the culture s you abhore surely, be they mainland, Scottish, UK mainland, continental or from further afield No man is an island Ali, unless perhaps you moved a little northwards and changed your name to Forvik, but you might need to borrow a little cash from somewhere at that stage to build a hospital lest you ever get poorly. Heaven knows who would staff it though, when you are happy to say some cultures are abhorrent to you but won’t specy which.Last I checked you can’t train as a doctor at Shetland College, the NAFC or in a night class in Hamnavoe or Walls, so I guess we will be needing other folk from other parts and other cultures for some time to come. Maybe try to get over it Mr. Shetland-wid-be-much-better-aff-clear-of-da-lot-of-dem, EU-UK-and-Scotland.I do not know exactly what it is Peter, but your first paragraph reminds me of ##.. Is not worth noticing. lolHo ho ho! Glad you are laughing David 🙂I’m with you on the real agenda behind Brexit not being immediately obvious btw.I think the big picture is that there are some rich and powerful people in the UK wanting to shackle the UK to USA workers rights and health care in order to benefit from lower taxes after Brexit.They don’t need the EU to guarantee their human rights. They have holidays aplenty and investments in so many places that using the NHS is as alien to them as using public transport.They have uncharitably driven their agenda to the fore against the better instincts of one nation Tories and have done so using decades of media manipulation and dispicable xenophobic dog whistle messages on immigration.Thankfully as I write the Shaddow Home Secretary is advocating for an “efficient, fair and non-discriminatory migration policy” that is conducive to the UK’s economic interests. Something to wish for in the New Year.I take your points, Peter. It will be interesting how the Tories will drive their immigration policies and whether or not it bends more towards the USA than to this of the EU, after March next year One of the largest industries which depend on EU workers is in the hospitality industry, even here in Shetland there is a large EU workforce, not only in the hospitality industry, but the fishing processing industry as well.It will be interesting how the Shetland economy will cope after March .As for human rights, I question the validity of as to what will be used and what will be discarded in terms of either British or European Human Rights. I fear workers rights may be diminished and favoured more towards the employer than the employee     We shall see If the UK becomes # the cheap workforce of Europe # this may stir up resentment within the working ethos or political change##.before it is too late    We are in unchartered waters, and there could be stormy sea#s ahead. I just hope the changes are for the better of the collective rather than for the few    #I think the big picture is that there are some rich and powerful people in the UK wanting to shackle the UK to USA workers rights and health care in order to benefit from lower taxes after Brexit.# O dear dear me, it is all a wicked capitalist conspiracy.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Campbell-Stewart-MacLennan-Co.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly. Firstly, in a bid to reduce ‘fast fashion’ a fancy-dress option will be available to participants with the focus on homemade outfits.

These include chocolates, Isle of Skye Whisky and sides of salmon donated by the Scottish Salmon Company.A route for participants who have impaired mobility will also be incorporated into this year’s race. This follows on from a link-up between the event organisers and Amanda Bell from the West Highland College, who runs a fitness group for restricted mobility participants. This includes parents with pushchairs, children who cannot manage the whole route and entrants who have mobility limitations.Event organisers have said that the sections that are alternatives to the main route, will not be marshalled, so caution will need to be exercised when crossing roads.All proceeds from the participants taking part in the main route will go towards the Rotary Club of the Isle of Skye, while proceeds from the alternative route entrants will go towards the West Highland College restricted mobility fitness course.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh. Two other posts - at Clady and Strabane in Co Tyrone - were also to have been demolished that night but the bombs to be used exploded prematurely, killing three Volunteers at Stranamuck, near Castlefin, Co Donegal.Comdt John James Kelly and Staff Capt James Joseph Reynolds were killed instantly and Comdt Charles McCafferty died a few days later in Lford Hospital.The three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof. The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady.

He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8746825.1545316039!/image/image.jpg","title":"duffin replacement selected by sdlp","story":"The SDLP has co-opted Ryan Wilson onto Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council.Mr Wilson will take up the vacant seat in the Dunsilly DEA.It had been vacant since former SDLP representative, Brian Duffin, resigned from the local authority after losing an appeal against a sexual assault conviction.Mr Wilson said: “I am delighted to have been co-opted to serve the people of Randalstown, Toome, Creggan and Parkgate, in what is an increasingly challenging time in politics. “Alongside my colleagues in council, I intend to make rural job creation a focus during my tenure, as well as lobbying for more social housing to be built in South Antrim. “Additionally, I will work to secure adequate funding for many excellent community, charitable and sporting organisations throughout the constituency.”Welcoming Mr Wilson to the role, party leader Colum Eastwood MLA said: “Ryan has proven to be a dedicated activist within the party and his local community.

It is this trip that has him in the full glare of publicity once again due to the Spotlight investigation. Evidence of the Males trip produced by the BBC show, included an image from the resort’s internal records which suggested that full board and transfers were provided complimentarily at the request of the Males government and facilitated by the resort owner, Hussain Hilmy, who himself is a former government minister.On whether the trip should have been declared, an expert on Parliamentary rules, Mr Gavin Millar QC, said it should have.He told the Spotlight programme: “If, as Spotlights documentary evidence suggests, the benefit was requested by the government and facilitated by Mr Hilmy,Mr Paisley should not have accepted it.“But having accepted it, he certainly should have registered it undoubtedly.“There are very strict rules about lobbying and creating an interest for yourself that may be perceived as lobbying. “The moment you know these facts, that are disclosed in this document, the perception is that this is a reward for him having advocated for the Males government.”DecorumIan Paisley claimed however that he did seek advice over whether to declare his trip.He said he spoke to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone during her investigation into his previous Sri Lanka holidays, which his failure to declare resulted in his recent suspension from the House of Commons for  sitting days.He told the Spotlight programme that after the conversation he had satisfied himself he did not need to register the holiday.However, when pressed further, the MP claried that he had not spoken to the commissioner as he had claimed, but in fact had spoken to the parliamentary registrar who administers the register of members interests. contacted the Parliamentary Commissioner and the Parliamentary Registrar for a comment, however both refused to comment on private discussions with an inidual MP. They instead directed the ’s attention to the rules on the registration of Members’ financial interests.These rules clearly state under the heading of ‘Selflessness’ that: “Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. “They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends.”Under the heading of ‘Integrity’ it states: “Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside iniduals or organisations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties.”DenialMr.. Paisley last week denied that the trip was connected with the government of the Males, but rather that the cost was covered partly by himself and partly by a friend, who he has not named.He also told Spotlight he had evidence which, he said, categorically disproves that the trip was connected to the government. He said the holiday had not been arranged by the Embassy or paid for by the government of the Males.Deacutejagrave vuMr. Paisley has just recently finished his  day suspension, the longest given to an MP, for failing to declare complimentary family holidays to Sri Lanka.  He told the House of Commons in July that he felt: “A deep personal embarrassment” over failing to declare his Sri Lankan trips and made the “profoundest of apologies. A jubilant Ian Paisley told thein the immediate aftermath of the shortfall in the ‘petition of recall’ that ‘a smaller man than me would have crumbled’ under the pressure he had faced. And he told the BBC that after avoiding a by-election by  votes, it was the public’s way of saying: “We are keeping you big fella, we like you” and that it was “a miracle.”He was also adamant that there were no other potentially embarassing issues which could impinge his role. He said: “No. Nothing at all. I mean that was a genuine mistake on my part, I made a mistake and I apologised for it and I was punished for it.The matter will now be referred back to the Parliamentary Standards Commission, where the allegations will be further scrutinised.

My sacrice and dedication went to motorcycling and I’m very proud to be a Doctor of Letters because of that.“It’s a lelong sacrice. Since I was six-years-old I’ve travelled theand breadth of the UK racing. The injuries I’ve faced, the ups and downs, to actually win a world championship on top of all that is massive.“It’s nice that my family can see there was an endgame after all their sacrice in the beginning.Jonathan Rea shows off his new threads“It’s a very proud day for the whole family. Especially my two little boys , they realise that it’s not normal to be at an event like this. They know the ious race tracks inside out but this is dferent. I hope I can be a good role model for them.”The -year-old said it was the first time he had ever attended a graduation, adding: “I never imagined the first one would be my own.”Asked about his graduate attire for the ceremony, he said: “Of course I feel a lot more comfortable in leathers and a helmet but it’s really nice to be acknowledged outside the sport. It’s something that’s happening more and more recently.”The honorary degree follows the  award of an MBE on the New Year’s Honours list.

I went travelling the world racing bikes.“After I left school I went to technical college and got an HNC in manufacturing engineering and then went on to work as an engineer.“It was hard to hold down a job as I was taking too much time off work to go racing.“I had what was nearly a career-ending injury. That was a dark time in my le because I didn’t know what was coming, I’d no great qualications behind me, I was working a minimum wage job. I wasn’t in a great state of mind.“I threw myself at bikes for a few years and then it worked out, my big break came.”He added: “Northern Ireland fans are very important to me. The travelling support has been immense these last few years. It just keeps getting bigger and bigger.“On my sighting laps and slow down laps I can see the Northern Ireland fans. I always try to throw out a leg to acknowledge I’ve seen them.”Rea is often claimed by both Larne and Ballyclare and sometimes referred to as a son of Ballymena.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat.. Call Age NI’s Advice Service on    for a free benefits check.

asked for their story to be told – from beginning to end,” Ms Jones said. “It is done sensitively, but they were five guys in a band, on the road together, so there is humour too.”Double celebrations

In a move that’s sure to be viewed with envy by congregations all over the city, Clonard has upholstered its wooden seats just in time for the festive season. On Friday night the church welcomed guests to its sold-out Candlelight Christmas at Clonard event, which featured the St Dominic’s Grammar School for Girls’ Choir, baritone Karl McGuckin and West End star Niamh Perry. Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses. We have three vigils on Christmas Eve, one at pm, pm and .pm. “We would also like to thank all those who donated so generously to our Christmas crib during the carol service and hampers are now being prepared and distributed by the St Vincent de Paul Society.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local schoolboy pulls toddler from pond","story":"A YOUNG boy from the Cltonville area has been hailed a “hero” after pulling a toddler from the Waterworks lower pond.-year-old Neil Francis Montgomery from Brookhill Avenue was walking through the park with his friends on Sunday when a toddler slipped into the duck pond.While other passers by looked on in shock, the Edmund Rice College boy leapt into action, jumping into the freezing water to pull the child out. Speaking to the North Belfast News, Neil Francis said: “Me and my friends were walking out of the playground and this baby walked down towards the pond. We saw a woman pointing towards the baby and he slipped into the water face first. “All the other people started panicking and they all ran over and people were screaming. I got on my stomach and tried to reach in to get him, but I couldn’t reach so I just jumped in lted him under the armpits and lted him out.“A woman took the baby and cleaned him and dried him. I was scared, but nobody  seemed to be doing anything so I just jumped in. I was worried that it might be a bit deep, but I was more worried about the baby. I’m just really happy that the baby wasn’t hurt.”Neil Francis has been recognised as hero at his school assembly, and was gted a superman t-shirt by his religion teacher Mr Wylie. Paul Berne, acting Principal at Edmund Rice College, said: “We’re delighted that these kids are able to do what they’re doing. It’s the second time our pupils have saved someone’s le in a month. We’re very, very proud of them. They are top class role models for the school. About a month ago a sixth year helped someone in a hit-and-run and now we have this.It’s great that young people that age are able to do that – it’s incredible. Some people would freeze in these situations. These kids are top class. It’s a very tough thing and a very brave and courageous thing for any child to do.”Neil Francis’ mum, Natalie, added: “We’re so proud of him. We were scared that he did it, but we’re very happy that he did.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dups emma pengelly reminds academic she has arts degree from ulster university","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

save twin babies lives","story":"Two little Derry twins have delivered an early Christmas present for the nurses who helped to save their lives.Saorlaith and Saoirse McLaughlin spent the first few weeks of their lives at Altnagelvin Hospital’s Neo Natal Intensive Care Unit .The girls were born six weeks prematurely and suffering from a potentially fatal complication called \"Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome,\" where one baby gets the majority of the blood flow and nutrients from the placenta.Their parents, Bob and Michelle, have since raised a staggering £, for the unit, with the help of their friends and work colleagues.This year alone, they raised over £, through a tattoo fun day and a sponsored walk.But the McLaughlin’s decided that as well as vital equipment for the ward they wanted some of the money to be spent on the nurses, who work so tirelessly for the tiny babies in their care.“This year we wanted to put a bit of focus on the nurses and let them know we appreciate everything they do for sick new borns in Derry and beyond and especially our own twin girls,” explained Bob.“We asked the nurses to give us a list of stuff they needed for their tea room and of course we added a few extras and we are also going to buy them a new three seater sofa.“We felt it was very important that the nurses should have everything they need to make decent food.“It’s not a lot but it will make a dference to them.”“We want them to know that people are thinking of them and appreciate what they do.“The NHS canteen is closed when they are on night sht and at the

googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“As my we says, when the parents go home at night we are leaving our babies in their care.”The couple gave the nurses a voucher for a fridge freezer, cups, plates, cutlery, glasses a George Foreman grill, a set of knives, a radio and a £ MS voucher.And next month, they will present a cheque for the remaining £, to be spent on frontline services at the unit.“It was fantastic to catch up with some of the lovely nurses who did so much for our girls Cathy McClafferty Bridgeen Devine and Ciara Doherty and they passed on their thanks for the generosity of the public“We’d like to give a big thank you to everyone who made this possible including Michael Kelly who held a fundraiser at the Tattoo Lounge in Rathmor Business Park in the twins’ honour.”The tattoo fun day and last weekend’s sponsored walk have raised over £,, which will be donated to the unit next month.Mr McLaughlin says his employers and colleagues at First Source have played a huge part in helping them raise the £, over the past three years.“The management have been so supportive,” he continued.“They pick their own charity every year, but they also help a lot of smaller charities and a lot of it goes under the radar because they don’t advertise it.“When I brought my sponsorship form for the walk into work I raised £, in just five hours.“That’s how generous people in First Source are, there were people donating £ and £.”Picture Saorlaith and Saoirse

The bumper pre-match lunch crowd were less than keen to brave the elements, but a few hardy souls cheered the team on.Johnny McPhillips was released by Ulster late on Friday night and he started the match with Ryan Wilson ping to the bench. Ulster flyer Iwan Hughes also made his debut on the wing and Peter Nelson continued at full back.Kyle McCall ed at loose head, but his brother Zac was ruled out with Clayton Milligan taking his place at hooker. Malone looked strong with Ross Kane, Joe Dunleavey, Peter Cooper, Adam McBurney and Matthew Dalton all released by Ulster to bolster their forward pack.The wind was blowing across the pitch and this did not really favour either side. However, it did make things even more dficult as the rain was relentless and conditions underfoot were fairly treacherous.No one expected a classic and Ballynahinch had a little more composure in the key moments to secure a vital win. Local knowledge certainly helped with Nelson providing a masterclass in tactical kicking throughout, using his big left boot to keep his forwards on the front foot and dig his team out of trouble.Two McPhillips penalties and a typical Ross Adair finish following a Kyle McCall break had Ballynahinch - up at the break and they were well worth their lead.Malone turned the screw in the second half and when they scored a penalty try following a collapsed scrum under the lsquoHinch posts to close the gap to - with around  minutes the game could have slipped away from the home side, especially as McCall was sin-binned at the same time.However, the  man defence held out, and with the outstanding John Donnan laying waste to the Malone line out, the locals held out in relative comfort for another tight derby win.The next AIL fixture is away at Malone for the next instalment of the double-header on January .Ballynahinch will hope to have some players back from injury as the season reaches a crucial stage.The Ulster derbies look likely to decide the shape of the table and lsquoHinch will be away from home for three out of four in the second half of the season.Brian McLaughlin and his coaching staff will be plotting over the break to gain any advantage in the race for promotion.Ballynahinch Malone AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£250k Lottery Funding boost to restore Castlewellan park  ","story":"MAJOR plans to restore Castlewellan Forest Park to its former glory as part of a signicant investment programme have received a major pre-Christmas boost.The Heritage Lottery Fund confirmed yesterday that it is to provide almost pound, to help with ambitious redevelopment proposals which are being spearheaded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with the Forest Service.Fund officials had made it clear that the application process was very competitive, with council officials delighted they had made a persuasive argument to secure the cash they require.The local authority is also in the process of making a separate pound, bid to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to assist with the work at the forest park. The closing date for applications is the end of next month.Since the s, the forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, a long line of passionate gardeners who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important  hectare arboretum.The pound, Heritage Lottery Fundgrant will be used to help fund the development phase of the project, which will work to achieve a vision for Castlewellan Historic Demesne to create a heritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.The development phase includes surveys of the woody plants in the arboretum and bioersity of the park, alongside design work to repair and develop the buildings in The Grange and walled garden. Work is also required to carry out further consultations and submit planning applications.Council chairman Mark Murnin, thanked the HLF for its financial support for the exciting project.ldquoThe park is such a vital part of the local community, he said. I am delighted that this funding gives us the potential for its restoration and that future generations will also be able to enjoy the facility and engage with its heritage, he added.The local authority is keen to see the picturesque forest parkrsquos Arboretum, Annesley Garden and Grange Buildings redeveloped to help increase the number of visitors and provide the area with an economic boost.A recent economic appraisal recommended the development of what is being described as a welcome centre in the Walled Garden area designed to provide access via lt to its upper floor, with the local council keen to play a leading role, alongside the Forest Service, to help transform the parkrsquos fortunes and make it even more popular.Politicians were told last week that architects have been awarded the tender for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard and Rhododendron Wood areas, with work underway on planning and statutory approvals for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard.It has also been confirmed that a topographical survey mdash which could cost as much as pound, mdashwill be required to assist with the planning process.Council officials say that while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve and help promote an area which has ldquoexceptional tourism and recreational potential.It is envisaged that initial restoration work will focus on the -acre walled garden which is at the centre of the critically acclaimed arboretum, Bothy Yard and pathways which wind their way through the Rhododendron Wood.A critical look has also been taken of the parkrsquos traffic management and parking facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£700k environment scheme set to begin  ","story":"WORK on a near pound, environmental improvement scheme at Irish Street in Downpatrick starts on January .The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are jointly funding the initiative which will result in one traffic lane being closed during the scheme to facilitate the contractor.The government department is making a pound, contribution to the public realm project, with the local authority providing the remainder of the cash for the eagerly-awaited revamp.Design proposals have revealed the work mdash which includes new granite footpaths, lighting and street furniture mdash is due to be completed before the end of the financial year.The government department said funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.Local council officials are delighted to be working in partnership with the Department for Communities to deliver the project and are looking forward to the benefits that it will bring to Irish Street in terms of regenerating a central part of the town which has missed out on major public sector investment for several decades.Damian Mulholland mdash director of regional development with the Department for Communities mdash said recently that funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.He said the latest investment for Irish Street will enhance the natural heritage of the area at this historic part of the town and help improve visitors and resident experience.Councillor Dermot Curran says he is pleased work will start early in the New Year and has appealed to motorists to be patient during the lane closure.ldquoI realise this will inevitably have an impact on traffic, but hope roads officials will alter the sequencing of town centre traffic lights in a bid to minimise this, he continued. ldquoI hope the lane closure will be in place for the shortest time possible and will be liaising with contractors throughout the duration of the scheme.Cllr Curran said the scheme will help regenerate Irish Street, providing a boost for traders and residents and help arrest decline in an area where the presence of the townrsquos former police base was a major impediment to investment.He continued: ldquoBusiness owners in particular will be delighted that work is due to start soon. As I have said previously, Irish Street is ripe for redevelopment opportunities and this major investment is long overdue.Cllr Curran is also hopeful that Newry, Mourne and Down Council will make a fresh bid for Heritage Lottery Funding to help restore historic buildings within Downpatrickrsquos conservation area, which includes Irish Street.Several weeks ago it was confirmed that the local authorityrsquos initial bid for a so-called townscape initiative had been rejected, despite a signicant amount of time, effort and money being invested in the application process.Officials in charge of the heritage fund claimed the local authorityrsquos bid was influenced by planned regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area ldquorather than heritage need.In addition, they argued there was limited scope within Downpatrickrsquos townscape initiative area to deliver a ldquocomprehensive scheme and believed that given development proposals for Irish Street and the townrsquos former police base, the local authorityrsquos proposed scheme was ldquoinfluenced by regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area.Cllr Curran says he hopes a fresh application will meet with success to assist further the social and economic regeneration of not only Irish Street, but the wider town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch fete Schmidt  ","story":"IRELAND coach Joe Schmidt was the guest of honour at Ballymacarn Park on Friday when  members and guests enjoyed an excellent lunch followed by a question and answer session, conducted by club chairman Philip Gregg.He was his usual humble self as he described his coaching philosophy and the journey he has been on over the past  years and it was a wonderful afternoon for all in attendance.Despite his tight time schedule, Joe took the time to mingle with those present and was a complete gentleman throughout.

It has also a topic of considerable concern and a high profile environmental issue.Members of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee were told on Monday night that flytipping places a ldquosignicant demand on the organisationrsquos budget with staff also erted away from other duties to deal with the problem.Council officials are currently working alongside Environment Agency staff and neighbouring local authorities in what is being described as an attempt to ldquoadopt compatible practices and approaches to highlight the issue and reduce the scale of the problem.If the amount of the waste dumped mdash mostly in secluded areas mdash is greater than two cubic metres, or is hazardous, the incident is reported to the government agency. Council enforcement officers will also investigate each incident and assessthe culprits can be identied and prosecuted.On Monday night, councillors were told that over the past eight months there have been almost  reported fly tipping incidents across the district.Council staff responded to  incidents, with contractors removing waste on  occasions. Environment Agency staff removed waste on  occasions.While the cost of removing waste over the past eight months is estimated at almost pound,, council officials have suggested the yearly total could top the pound, mark.The cost of flytipping on hard pressed ratepayers comes just a few weeks after council officials were asked to look at innovative ways of combating the problem.Councillors are concerned about the scale of the issue and the restrictions being placed on what material ratepayers can dump at household recycling centres.Some elected representatives have suggested council officials should reintroduce a service used by the former Down Council which arranged for a local authority bin lorry to visit some towns and villages on a Saturday morning to allow people to get rid of their household waste.The scheme proved extremely popular and while it was in service there were few reported flytipping incidents in the area.In addition, community groups helped keep their respective towns and villages clean by taking part in litter picks, with their efforts recognised by the local authority via an awards scheme.Councillors also believe the fact that some of the districtrsquos household recycling centres do not accept certain types of waste is contributing to the scale of the flytipping issue which, they say, must be addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C December 19%2C 1978  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash Fears that Newcastlersquos status as a leboat base could be thrown on the rocks were sunk yesterday by the Royal National Leboat Institutionrsquos chief spokesman in Ireland, Lt-Col Brian Clark.In a clear-cut statement he dashed the hopes of  Kilkeel fishermen who have called for a full-scale rescue centre to be set up in their port instead of Newcastle.Lt-Col Clark, who is the RNLIrsquos organising secretary for all of Ireland, has also hit out strongly at claims that the prospect of a tug-orsquo-war situation is looming between Newcastle and Kilkeel.He said: ldquoKilkeel has indeed been considered carefully as a possible location for a leboat, but the major requirement is that a boat must be able to get away from its base promptly in all kinds of weather.ldquoThe RNLI management committee feels that this capability is at present lacking in the case of Kilkeel where strong winds create unfavourable conditions at the entrance to the new harbour. These conditions could prevent a leboat from ing to its moorings and may prevent it from getting out of the harbour on service.Lord Roden, the honorary secretary of the Newcastle leboat station, has also rejected the latest call to switch the leboat base from his town to Kilkeel.ldquoI can give an assurance that Newcastle is taking no part in such an argument, he said. ldquoThe stationing of boats on the coast is solely a matter for the RNLI management committee.ldquoThe Newcastle leboatmen are proud of their boat.

Teddy wouldnrsquot worry sheep. He was far more interested in carrying my sonrsquos bag home from school and things like that. He was well known in the village and senior citizens were often thankful to have him around as a sort of watch dog.Mr Tweedie said there had been several cases of sheep worrying in the district recently and thatrsquos what led him to believe that a farmer may have shot him.He added: ldquoWe certainly miss him.

Because of ill health, she has to crawl up to her bedroom on hands and knees and get back down on hands and knees.Spearheading the Watsonsrsquo case has been their daughter, Mrs Jean Cheevers, and after a long struggle she has finally managed to get good news for her parents.After bringing her case to the attention of the local MP, Mr Enoch Powell, Mr Gerry Fitt MP, Cllr Rowan-Hamilton, the Sunday News and the Down Recorder, she has at last evoked a reaction from the Housing Executive.The Executive has now decided to take a ldquohumanitarian attitude to the couplersquos case, therefore increasing their chances of getting a stair-free home.In a sympathetic letter to Mrs Cheevers, an Executive spokesman explained that full consideration had been given to the age and state of health of Mr and Mrs Watson.ldquoI should add that our ability to rehouse your parents in accommodation suitable to their needs will be dependent on such accommodation becoming available in the area, the spokesman added.DOWNPATRICK mdash A bumper medieval pageant proposed for Downpatrick in May to celebrate St Patrick is hanging in the balance mdash and only a large turnout at a public meeting early in the New Year can save it from the chop.The pageant, the brainchild of Down Councilrsquos arts committee, is seen to be one of the best ideas to come out of the district for some time mdash but unless sufficient backing is forthcoming, then the community festival will have to be scrubbed.Organisers have been guaranteed funds from Down Council, but in order to quality for a big payout by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board will have to have the potential to be a major tourist attraction and to be continued each year.Mr Frank Connolly, a spokesman for the arts committee told the Recorder: ldquoIf there is no support, there will be no festival, itrsquos as simple as that. Wersquore calling a public meeting for January  in the new library in Downpatrick and itrsquos essential that there is a massive turnout of interested people and of organisations who are willing to play a part.ldquoA successful event would no doubt help tourism and itrsquos in the interest of the district to give it their full support.BALLYGOWAN mdash A young handicapped Ballygowan boy received an extra Christmas surprise recently when his pet donkey gave birth to a baby foal.Seven year-old Gregory Townley suffers from spina bida but the new addition to the family is certain to add an extra sparkle to Christmas for him.His mother, Mrs Myrtle Townley, said: ldquoMy husband got a donkey for Gregory two years ago after he bought a motorbike for my nine year-old son Roy.

Letter to the editorThe faculty are ‘Internationally Renowned Experts’ who are ‘experienced and active practitioners. Students for theology at Queen’s have a ‘ per cent overall satisfaction rate for their degree in the most recent National Student Survey results , ranked joint th in the UK.’ ‘The excellent standards of our education are recognised by employers who value the quality of our programmes and recognise the skills of our graduates.’Those aren’t actually my words, but the words of Queen’s University, promoting the BA Theology course taught by Union Theological College. To this day those words remain on their website, encouraging students to study at a high-class educational institute.QAA, the independent organisation which assess higher education in the UK, speaks in similarly glowing terms in its  review of the college, praising ‘The culture of supporting students and the meticulous care taken to foster personal growth and academic attainment’ as an area of good practice. They note the ‘very strong sense of community among staff and students, which enhances the students’ learning experience’ and highlight activities which ‘reflect a culture of student-centeredness and underpin the trust between students and staff, which enhances student engagement.’It is hard to understand how a college praised by independent assessors and promoted enthusiastically by Queen’s can suddenly be seen as unfit to teach. How can a college which helps students ‘develop breadth of vision and understanding of the place and role of Theology and Religion, in both the past and the present’ be unsuitable for ‘today’s post-conflict Northern Ireland’  Union seems to be getting blame for allegedly coming from a single denominational perspective. But a few years ago there were four colleges from a iety of backgrounds working with Queen’s. Now none are teaching undergraduate courses for Queen’s and some partner with universities in England where the likes of Oxford, Cambridge, and Durham all work with denominational colleges.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all. I would like to thank her for writing the book - especially with the personal things.The book is pound at www.jamessommerinrestaurant. co.uk  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Parents in Moira, Maralin and other outlying areas would rightly be thinking whether a bus to Lurgan, then another bus to Portadown in the morning, then reverse the process in the afternoon - earlier starting and later finishing – would be conducive to their children’s well-being or learning.“The best way to meet their needs is that they remain on the Toberhewny site where teachers who know them, really know them, can offer them a first-class education.“Educators will tell you that transition at any age can bring regression for many children so why in Lurgan are we willing to let this happen “Previous Craigavon Senior High School principals often said it took at least a full term for pupils to settle down to learn. We are always teaching for readiness and when relationships are formed, the learning can begin.” They said staff at Lurgan Junior High School ‘would willingly embrace these young people and provide for them the best educational outcomes possible with a curriculum suited to their needs’.Their letter added: “The ideal solution would be for the pupils to remain on the Toberhewny site at a new - school, which would accommodate not only our - children but also those who would have gone on to Craigavon Senior High School . Naturally those selected at  could continue to transfer to Lurgan College.Traffic ersions for those wishing to visit Rushmere or Portadown Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“A second preference would be for Craigavon Senior High School, Lurgan Campus to relocate temporarily to the Toberhewny site, while a long-term solution, such as the one above, could be considered.”They also pointed out: “We look, with both envy and admiration, at the plans for St Ronan’s College to have a £ million new school and Lismore Comprehensive with a new school on the way and congratulate them both. Our pupils deserve to be treated equally.“Lurgan Junior High School is almost  years old so now is the time to be bullish and push for a modern, state of the art solution for all children in our catchment area.” In an appeal to parents they said: “Make every effort to attend the consultation meeting, Ask questions at the meeting, Speak up for your children – all are important whether Grammar or High School pupils.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flat1.jpg","title":"belfasts flatiron building takes on first tenants","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew A design agency has become the first tenant of a newly renovated Victorian listed building with another business expected to become the second soon, Ulster Business can reveal.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/house1.jpg","title":"ulster rugby player developing luxury homes","story":"Posted on Friday  December  by John Mulgrew A series of new luxury homes are being developed by an Ulster Rugby player in east Belfast, Ulster Business can reveal.Craig Gilroy, alongside developer Austin Baird, is currently building two large detached properties on a site at his home close to the Belmont Road.Work is under way on the properties, which will include a five-bedroom and six-bedroom development.“One of the properties is around , sq ft and the other , sq ft – we are still working on a price,” Mr Gilroy said.“The market seems to be pretty good, looking at the other properties in the area.”He said the properties will come to market in the next few weeks.
