They provide all the intermediary services through which we sell advertising.\u0027Facebook are also dominant in social media with Instagram, which they own, they hold about 62 per cent, and within Facebook to a large extent you have to use Facebook advertising services. This means that advertising markets are opaque.\u0027Google have, I think, six different vertically integrated advertising services, all of which charge commissions, fees or take revenue shares, many of which are opaque, and we have to accept what terms they impose.\u0027Even the contracts that we sign to use their services are often presented to us on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.

And as of the last couple of months, the biggest apart from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in Australia.\u0027It now makes more money out of advertising than our newspapers do, but we don\u0027t have any subscription revenue, or any to speak of, and the next struggle is to replace the newspaper cover price revenue, which now forms about 80 per cent of the newspaper revenue.\u0027DMG Media, which is based at Northcliffe House in Kensington, West London, also owns the Daily Mail, The Mail On Sunday, Metro and the i newspaper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/999081e6dc018965176a15448338f3fe43b9284a/0_0_5906_3543/master/5906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eedb95cf043d6cda77b4a0cbebf9af9","title":"shopping is back but not as we know it a look at the covid secure high street","story":"This week, non-essential shops in England opened their doors for the first time in months. DIY store owner Surinder Josan explains the steps that he has been taking to keep his family and his customers safeAll non-essential retailers – including clothes, shoe, toy, book and electronics shops, tailors, auction houses, photography studios and indoor markets – in England were able to reopen this week, provided they had followed UK government guidelines to make them “Covid-secure”.That means reopened shops should have carried out a risk assessment using guidance from the Health and Safety Executive. Employers also had a duty to consult staff about the safety measures required. Businesses were expected to inform all staff about the findings of their assessments, and those with more than 50 employees should have published the results on their websites.Shops should now have hygiene procedures in place to keep staff and customers safe, for instance by providing hand-washing facilities and regularly cleaning surfaces, including self-checkouts, trolleys, or devices handled by staff. Employers will also need to help those with visual impairments or disabilities to navigate these measures.It’s not only shop owners tasked with keeping customers safe. Shoppers have also been urged to protect each other by, for example, not trying on clothing or testing goods. Fitting rooms should be closed wherever possible. If they are open, contact between customers and staff should be limited. They should also be cleaned frequently, typically after each use.For many it is all new. But not for Surinder Josan who has been implementing safety measures for the past few months. Josan owns two family-run businesses in Smethwick, West Midlands: a hardware store, All Seasons DIY, started by his parents and Seasons Palace, a banqueting venue for weddings and parties.The 55-year-old grew up helping in the DIY shop and appeared to be heading down a different career path after a degree in electronics and studying for a master’s in IT. But when his father developed a heart problem while Josan was studying, he took the reins, streamlining the way the DIY shop ran and developing two thriving businesses.The whole family has been involved – including his wife, his mother, his father until he died a few years ago, and even his children when they’re not studying. “We like to be right in the thick of things so we run them both. With the venue it’s actually pretty easy – we just take the bookings and direct people to our suppliers like caterers, DJs, the people who do the decorations.The detail is taken off our hands. Plus, the main use of that is at the weekend and evenings when the shop isn’t open, so I can jump from one to the other.” When Josan started hearing about the coronavirus in late December, he admits to being scared.“The first thing that came to mind was that the banqueting venue was not going to work in those circumstances.” So, in late Januaryearly February, he took the decision to close the 200-person venue, persuading customers to move their bookings to 2021. While the loss of income was a hit, he decided the move was in the best interests of everyone’s safety.He was then faced with deciding what to do about the shop. “The biggest problem is that my mother’s DNA is part of the shop, and asking her to step away from it was a big no-no. The only way to get her away was to close. So when they announced that pubs and schools were all closed we bit the bullet and shut it too.”Putting the time to good use, he decided to carry out a shop refit, but put notices up saying if anyone needed hardware items for repairs or urgent work, he would help. It started with a few phone calls, he says, but soon there was a steady stream of people wanting to buy things. “It also dawned on us that hardware stores were allowed to remain open, so we thought: ‘If we’re going to do this, we will have to do it properly.’”That decision prompted Josan and his family to put an array of measures in place to keep both themselves and their customers safe. “We put lines outside the shop. We also barricaded the area by the till so customers come in one by one, tell us what they want, then we go and get it. We reduced the contactless payments minimum from £5 to £1 to make it easier for people to limit contact. We also started cleaning the money using wipes.”The measures weren’t necessarily easy, but were well-received by customers filled with confidence that Josan was doing everything he could to keep them safe. “It was hard work – we were constantly going backwards and forwards – I think I did 17,000 steps in one day and that was just in the shop.“It was so tiring that we cut down our hours, so instead of opening from 9am to 7pm we opened from 10am to 4.30pm. The number of customers who’ve come in and complimented us is unbelievable. They say that when they come here they feel really safe. We did it because we wanted to be safe, but it works for everyone.”While many businesses will be getting used to new practices and ways of working, Josan and his family have few changes planned for the immediate future, being happy to continue with the safety measures they’ve been using for the past few months.“We’re going to carry on doing exactly what we have been doing up until now,” he says. Despite that, he remains concerned that not everyone is as careful with their safety as he and his fellow retailers are.“People have calmed down and there’s less panic-buying, but they aren’t observing the 2-metre rule. They’re just a bit absent-minded about it,” he adds.And while he plans on keeping things as they are for the DIY store, potentially until the end of the year, Josan admits the future is less clear for the banqueting venue.“If the government says we can open, I have thought about how I would do it and keep people separate. You could do it with the tables, with the toilets, and the kitchen and even the stage. But how do you do it on a dance floor? Unless you draw circles and tell people to stay inside them.“So the only way I can think of is that instead of having 200 people you have 60-70, and use more of the outdoors as opposed to the indoors. These are some of my thoughts, but I have got to do it so we are safe and whoever is with us – the caterers, the guests – are safe too. The last thing I want is for there to be an outbreak.”In the meantime, he plans to offer the space to a local school free of charge if it needs more room in order to welcome children back. With so much adjustment needed for the “new normal” when it comes to our shops and venues, Josan acknowledges that it can be confusing. But he says there is a lot of information available, both from the UK government and other organisations, to help business owners put the right measures in place to keep themselves, their staff and their customers safe. And while he is confident that he’s been doing his bit to make sure his customers aren’t put in harm’s way, he admits the future is uncertain.“This is a new normal – we’re not going to go back to what we had for some time yet. There are still so many unknowns. At the end of the day, this virus is going to take out people who are close to us. It isn’t good enough to only think of our businesses and economy.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

With women only allowed to have one birth partner and home births restricted for a time, I spoke to women and men about how having a baby during lockdown has been for them and their new families. The project is ongoing.”Misgalla lives in south London and has been a doula for 4 years. She’s currently supporting Cath, who has undergone solo IVF, via Zoom.“I’ll be Cath’s birth partner, I’ve been supporting her since November. Sometimes doulas don’t do very much at all, but just seeing someone else’s face is enough, especially while pregnant women are in self-isolation.”Rooney lives in south London but is currently self-isolating in Bedford with her sister and brother-in-law and their three sons.“I was 42 when I started talking about IVF with friends. Once I’d decided, it all happened pretty quickly. A friend and I got pizza and a bottle of prosecco one night and went through the website.“Michele and I did a lot of the preparation together and she was there during the birth, looking after me.“Gaspar looks just like his cousin Jude when he was a baby, he feels like a total Rooney. Grandma and granddad are besotted. We Zoom with them every few days.”Kara has been a doula since 2017, supporting Becky and her daughter Silver, four weeks old, who live in Wirral.“I started supporting Becky on the day of her C-section, from when she went to hospital to immediately after the birth. Mums need a lot more support in the first week, then it gradually tapers off. Hopefully I’ll get to visit when lockdown’s over. It’ll be lovely to see them in person.”Thando has been a doula for seven years, supporting women around London and Bristol and attending hundreds of births.“It was horrible not being able to attend Colleen and Joe’s birth. I spoke to them on video call, but environment is everything in birth – you need intimacy and privacy. I haven’t met James and Juliet yet, we’ve had a telephone chat and a video chat instead of meeting face to face. I’ve been working with them since March.“We mother the mothers. Birth is really simple, we just overcomplicate it. Being a doula is such a beautiful thing.”Colleen McKeever, 39, and Joe Weber, 36, with baby Mae, born 26 MarchFrom the US, McKeever and Weber relocated from New York to north London three years ago. Thando has been their doula since February. McKeever and Mae were in hospital for eight days following her birth.Weber: “Mae was in intensive care for the first few days because she had jaundice. We’d meet up in NICU during the day, then Colleen would go back to her room and I’d come home and play Nintendo. I delivered supplies to Colleen in the days after. We could meet downstairs but not with Mae. Colleen held her up to the window for me.”Emily de Groot and Rashid Ariori with twins Maya and Joshua, born 21 March“My mum was going to come for a couple of weeks to help – that’s been hard because our families haven’t met them yet. My brother might come on Sunday and wave through the window.”Leah Bedwood, 35, south London, whose baby is due at the end of June‘I am determined to have a home birth with the sisterhood around me, women who are experienced birth keepers who’ve had their own children – my mum, my sister, my aunt – and my partner. At the moment my local hospital have suspended their home birthing service. They should be up and running again by the end of June, so hopefully the baby waits!“I had a socially distanced baby shower. I saw balloons and then suddenly this convoy of cars started coming down the road! We played games, everyone was guessing the sex of the baby, we had a bit of music, sweets. That was probably the nearest to having a social connection with people. It was a surprise, I really appreciated it.”Reyhan Akyıldız-Gladstone, 31, Jack Gladstone, 30, and Aphra, born 16 MarchAkyıldız-Gladstone: “We had Aphra at home 10 days before they shut down the local home birth team. She was born at 9am on the day everyone started working from home. I was quite aware that everyone was around in their houses! I went into labour at 4.30am and by 10am we were in bed and everyone had gone. Everything happened at a crazy pace.“We have no idea when our parents are going to meet her. My dad lives in Turkey – he had flights to come over but they were cancelled.“It’s had advantages, getting to know her and her getting to know us. The three of us have our little routine.”James Dow, 36, and Juliet Cochrane, 34, east London, who are expecting a girl on 21 JuneCochrane: “It’s definitely going to be different. The grandparents and siblings will have to self-isolate for two weeks when she’s born, and even then they might not be able to hold her. They might, it’s so hard to know what the right thing to do is. There’s a real plus side in slowing down and having time to really plan and get things organised. It’s quite good for us as a family.”Nilufar Anwar, 35, Johan Bjerke, 38, and baby Alma, born 13 AprilAnwar: “At hospital, my midwife’s name was Rachel. I wouldn’t be able to recognise her again as she wore a mask the whole time. It’s strange to go through such an intimate, intense, life-changing experience with someone you can’t really see. I would have loved to have given her a hug. But the pandemic has given us time to do nothing but adore every move and sound that Alma makes, and slowly grow into our new role as parents.”Raquel Ruiz Tognetti, 40, with baby Leonardo, born 20 April“I’m a solo 40-year-old mum, and had a complicated delivery in the worst weeks of the pandemic. My parents were supposed to come and help, but they were stuck in lockdown in Venezuela. In hospital you could feel the fear in everyone. Since the delivery, things have been much better, but I’ve been weighing my baby at home as the midwife visits stopped. Sometimes I think Leonardo thinks I’m the only human on earth.”Helen Ward, 35, and Oli Evans, 37, with daughters Emily, 4, and Erin, born 19 MarchWard: “We feel a lot calmer now. the start of this was insane. I was so anxious, crying all the time, really stressed. Now Erin’s putting on weight, I feel better about things. Emily has been remarkably fine. So far only Oli’s sister has met Erin, no one else. Friends have come for distanced drive-by drinks and cuppas so they’ve only seen her from afar. The experience has been otherworldly at times. Erin isn’t registered with a birth certificate yet, so coupled with no one meeting her, it’s almost as if she doesn’t exist.”“It’s nerve-racking taking the bus to maternity appointments. Even though you have a mask on and other people have a mask on, you still feel on edge. My partner can’t come to any scans, so we’ve booked a private 4D one so he can see her.“I’ve mostly been worried about the baby when she’s here, I’m not worried about myself. I think her grandparents can meet her with a mask, not touch. Maybe everyone can meet her around Christmastime. Hopefully it’s over by Christmas!”Sherica Spence, 34, and baby Caleb, born 4 March“The morning we checked out of hospital, I heard them say they had two confirmed cases of coronavirus. I just wanted to go home. We saw family and friends for the two weeks before lockdown, but after that we couldn’t see anyone. Everyone made sure we had food in the house: toilet rolls, nappies and wipes.“That was weird, having to rely on people. I’m a person that does everything myself. Celeb’s dad thought he might have the coronavirus, so he was at his house, doing video calls, making sure we were OK. I’m just lucky that he’s a peaceful child. He’s so good!”Lena Buhler, 31, and Johnson Aboaba, 27, due 1 SeptemberBuhler: “We were supposed to travel for work over March, April and May, but that was all cancelled. The hardest thing is not having a routine – that can make you feel a bit lost. My mum would have come over from Switzerland during this time but instead she’s been ordering baby stuff to the house. After the initial worry and anxiety subsided, I’ve found this to be good for us as a couple. Johnson’s been good. It’s a strange time for him but he’s been very calm.”Nissa Moger, 36, with baby Indy, born on 8 April“Indy was born in hospital and we were home 12 hours later. We were planning a water birth at home, but at that time they’d stopped the service, so we went in. It wasn’t what I planned, but the midwives were brilliant.“I work at St Thomas’ on the labour ward as a midwife and I teach hypnobirthing. All the classes moved online in March as soon as they said mums were at risk. It’s worked really well. I think initially my clients were more anxious because it was the unknown, but they seem more settled now.”Tammy Woodhouse, 30, and Adam Woodhouse, 28, due 9 AugustTammy: “They announced the lockdown the night of our 20-week scan, so off we went to our appointment. There were signs up, but we didn’t really read them, we just went up, and they told Adam he couldn’t be there. We had no idea. I just sat in the waiting room crying! It was a shock.“They let me FaceTime Adam in the appointment, but it turned out I had my hand over the microphone the whole time! In the first trimester I was sick quite a lot, but the second one’s been an absolute dream. I’m a little bit sad I had to spend it indoors.“I’ve deleted all my news apps – that was probably the best thing. I think it was just watching the numbers go up and up and feeling completely helpless.”Esther and Shahin Najafipour, both 31, with baby Milo, born 21 MayEsther: “I was in hospital for two days when I had him. No visitors were allowed. I work as a costume maker for film and had made 85 pairs of scrubs for the local hospitals while I was on furlough. Some of the nurses were wearing ones from the same batch. The midwife that delivered him was wearing some.”Shahin: “Normally, I would get two weeks’ paternity leave, so I’d go back next week, which doesn’t seem that much. It was kind of a blessing to be home as well and help where needed.”Farah Habibi, 28, and Faisal Imadi, 27, two-year-old Araaz and baby Zaayan, born 6 MarchHabibi: “Zayaan was born two weeks before the lockdown. My mum stayed for two weeks, then I sent her home. She would usually have stayed with me a lot longer. We FaceTime with her and my sister everyday.“My sister’s been dropping food outside the flat for us. We were self-isolating with him, but I’ve started going in the garden now. Today was the first proper walk I did with Araaz – he mostly goes out with his dad.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4d999f9ae90acc1d82b96135a66594d6d1f8524/71_93_3573_2144/master/3573.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ec5f0443e99b5757ebe4448f2fde721","title":"national gallery england reopen lockdown","story":"London venue will become first of big museums and galleries to reopen as lockdown easesThe National Gallery is expected to become the first of England’s big museums and galleries to reopen. Subsequent openings of other venues will be staggered to help ease pressure on public transport.Museums such as Tate Modern, the British Museum and the V\u0026ampA will announce their plans in the coming days. But first up, the  understands, will be the National Gallery in London.Museum bosses welcomed an announcement by Boris Johnson that England’s museums, galleries and cinemas can reopen from 4 July, but say they will proceed with extreme caution.In a joint statement, the directors of Tate, Science Museum Group, the Natural History Museum, the National Gallery, the British Museum and the V\u0026ampA welcomed the news. “The British public have faced a wretched few months of isolation, loss and anxiety in confronting the Covid-19 pandemic,” they said. “The reopening of museums – whose galleries speak to the creative, resilient power of the human spirit – will provide solace and inspiration as Britain looks to the future.Jenny Waldman, director of the Art Fund, warned that the future of many galleries and museums remained uncertain. “The lockdown closures have hit museums’ finances incredibly hard – some may never reopen, and for those that can, social distancing measures will drastically limit visitor numbers and associated income that make them economically viable.” People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.The WHO says masks should be made of three layers – with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and – more importantly – because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.Tim Marlow, director of the Design Museum in London, said he was keen to open the electronic music exhibition, which had been due to begin on 1 April. “Cautiously, this is music to my ears,” he said. “We’ve been ready to go for some time, in terms of content, but we are still working through logistics.”Those logistics will include a one-way system, extended opening hours but reduced capacity, with visitors having to book time slots, new signage and hand sanitisers, some of them based on a design competition the museum ran earlier this year.For all museums and galleries, questions remain about the economics of operating with fewer people, and over how nervous visitors will be.Marlow said reducing the physical distancing limit from 2 metres to 1 metre would help. “It will just give us a bit more leeway, but we have to start cautiously,” he said. Iwona Blazwick, director of the Whitechapel Gallery in east London, said she hoped to reopen in mid-July. “We have been counting the days,” she said. “It has been so tragic to have all these wonderful things on display and locked away like sleeping beauties, so we are really excited to be able to welcome people back.” The gallery will have a one-way system and a timed-and-booked entry scheme, staff will wear “art visors” made at Goldsmiths. Blazwick does not expect significant problems. “People are used to navigating their way round supermarkets, and we have a lot more space,” she said.Jonathan Watkins, director of the Ikon gallery in Birmingham, said the news, on an emotional level, was great. “We love what we do and we really want to get back to it. It was deflating to open an exhibition in February and close it in March and to have it sitting there, hibernating … so this is a good feeling.”He thinks the Ikon will be able to reopen in August because of the time needed to deal with logistical issues. That includes what to do with the gallery’s famous “singing” lift, which features a choral work by the conceptual artist Martin Creed.“People won’t really be able to use it without going to reception first, and someone will come along with a key. How will we do that? There is all that kind of stuff because we have got to take it all very seriously. It is not just an academic exercise.” Theatres and concert halls were told they cannot yet reopen for live performances and fears remain that the industry faces ruin without targeted further government help.A spokesperson for the Society of London Theatre said: “We welcome the easing of lockdown restrictions and look forward to continuing to work closely with the government on a date when theatres can reopen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b704141fe27ec6006d6cd593011a4abe9a2745b/0_72_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=121557d7e76e697eaefc4d172f56bd5b","title":"black and asian people not seen as readers bernardine evaristo condemns books industry","story":"In foreword to report into ersity in publishing, Booker prize-winning author rails against ‘ridiculous’ beliefsBernardine Evaristo, the first black woman to win the Booker prize, has hit out at “ridiculous” and “misguided” beliefs in the publishing industry, where “black and Asian people are not considered to be a substantial readership, or to even be readers”.Evaristo, writing the foreword for the UK’s first academic study into ersity in trade fiction and publishing, released on Tuesday, said the report showed that the UK books industry “hasn’t changed fast enough to become more inclusive”. A key finding of the study was that writers of colour and their books are “either whitewashed or exoticised” to appeal to what UK publishing sees as its core audience of white, middle-class readers.The report, Rethinking “Diversity” in Publishing, found that writers of colour are disadvantaged during each key stage of the publishing process, from finding an agent, to having to “fulfil certain expectations of what white, middle-class editors want” with their writing in order to land a book deal.The study is based on more than 100 interviews with authors, agents and publishing staff across editorial, design, publicity, marketing and sales, about their practices and their experience publishing writers of colour. Researchers found the majority of publishing continues to cater for what it sees as a “core audience” of white, middle-class readers – “a sort of 50-something middle-class to upper-middle-class white woman who reads a lot because she has time, and she has resources to spend on books,” according to one respondent.“What were they saying? That whiteness reigns supreme, heteronormativity is acceptable and old people be gone from the pages of our books because you are of little importance?” asked Evaristo. “The truth is that good literature about anything can be enjoyed by all kinds of people. Literature transcends all perceived differences and barriers. It’s partly the point of it.”It is frustrating, Evaristo writes, to learn that “the publishing industry is still run by the predominantly white, middle-class demographic of years ago, and that the perceived target reader is a middle-aged, middle-class white woman, who apparently does not have the imagination to want to engage with writings by people of colour, which is plainly untrue”.Publishers, particularly the large ones, assume that audiences are white and middle class, and undervalue black, Asian and minority ethnic and working-class audiences, the report found. “Writers of colour are essentially promoted to appeal to this core audience, which can lead to their exoticisation and marginalisation,” write the report’s authors, Dr Anamik Saha and Dr Sandra van Lente.Talking to publishers about book cover design, the researchers found that “there remains a fear that featuring a racial or ethnic minority person on the cover could lead to diminished sales” – one respondent said they had heard their then managing director, who is still in a senior role in publishing, say: “We can’t put a black girl on the cover of a book because it won’t sell.” Some of those interviewed spoke of characters from ethnic backgrounds “literally being whitened on covers”.Publishers also see writers of colour as a “commercial risk”, according to the study. One BAME respondent said they had watched editors “asking for changes to a manuscript by a writer of colour that basically amounted to it being ‘translated for a white reader’”.The report, which is a partnership between Goldsmiths, University of London along with Spread the Word and the Bookseller, is calling on the book industry, from publishers and agents to booksellers, to challenge their practices, behaviour and cultural biases, to work with writing agencies to identify talented writers of colour, to hire more ersely, and to value non-white, non-middle-class audiences. It is being launched as part of a virtual #RethinkingDiversity week from Monday.“Our study finds that publishers and booksellers do not have the resources, know-how, or, sadly, the inclination to reach wider audiences. They do not see the economic or cultural benefit.

We think we are probably at about our usual level in terms of sales, but that’s on reduced opening hours and still delivering to many local customers who are shielding or reluctant to venture out,” said James Ashmore at independent bookshop Read, in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire.“It’s so lovely to see all of our customers as we’ve really missed them, but we’ve also had the chance to meet a lot of customers who used us for the first time during lockdown and have come back to us again now that the shop is open.”Booksellers have introduced a range of safety measures for customers, from sanitiser and plastic screens, to quarantining titles for up to 72 hours if they’re handled by readers. At Waterstones in Swansea, staff have been trialling a new look for bookshelves, stocking titles back to front, so that customers can read the blurbs without having to pick them up.Waterstones’ Kate Skipper said the first week had gone “really well”, with “so many customers delighted to be back in a bookshop”. “The health and safety measures have been working well without taking away the joy of visiting a bookshop,” said Skipper. “We have seen good footfall in local high street and neighbourhood locations, with shopping centre and city centre shops quieter. Footfall still remains lower than before the pandemic as expected.” Waterstones is opening its shops in Wales this week, with high street shops in Scotland to open on 29 June.Skipper said that the books customers bought in stores over the last week “have been more varied” than those they purchase online, where the chain’s charts are topped by Reni Eddo-Lodge’s Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race, Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo and Akala’s Natives.“It’s been joyous seeing debuts like The Truants by Kate Weinberg soar as we have opened our doors and children’s adventure stories like Wonderscape by Jennifer Bell – not titles that will necessarily pop up on the algorithms but wonderful books – alongside the current crop of bestsellers,” said Skipper. “There has been a huge appetite for recommendations from our booksellers alongside the bestsellers, which is very cheering.”In Yorkshire, Ashmore said that Girl, Woman, Other had been “flying out the door”, as had Eddo-Lodge’s bestseller, Afua Hirsch’s Brit(ish), Layla F Saad’s Me and White Supremacy and Robin DiAngelo’s White Fragility.Why I’m No Longer… was number one in the overall book charts for a second week, with sales of 34,215 copies, reported BookScan this afternoon, while Girl, Woman, Other was in third place overall, behind Charlie Mackesy’s The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse. Evaristo’s Booker-winning novel topped the mass market fiction paperback charts with sales of 18,893 copies – the highest paperback fiction sales of the year to date. Both titles have soared up the charts in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, with Eddo-Lodge last week becoming the first black British author ever to top the UK’s overall book charts.“It’s absurd, it’s exciting, I hope the Guinness Book of World Records send me a plaque but it is mad – especially when you consider the black British authors that have come before,” Eddo-Lodge told the Observer this weekend. “To know there was a surge of people searching out anti-racism books after seeing what was essentially a film of somebody being murdered, I can’t uncouple those two things … The aim of anti-racism work isn’t to make me personally wealthy, and so some of this capital flowing my way will go to donate, to contribute to the cause in some way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b627f8866f906b301b53d96d50f3f523ad43029c/341_470_3659_2196/master/3659.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=99f88f0e5b9f9ea2ada7306eb115937b","title":"three ways for uk schools to improve their race relations now","story":"Instead of empty slogans, schools should treat racism like safeguarding and health and safety and be on high alert. Here’s what to doUK public institutions, including schools, are clamouring to show they are card-carrying anti-racists. Pictures of patients who have died from Covid-19 have had a striking similarity: mainly black and brown faces because, shockingly, BAME people are twice as likely as white Britons to die of the virus. The murder of George Floyd in the US has galvanised people into action, at least for the moment.Some educational institutions have released statements declaring they believe Black Lives Matter. But how, beyond the slogans, do they commit to concrete and long-term change? And where do schools start?Alison Kriel, an education consultant with nearly 20 years’ experience of leading schools in the London borough of Hackney, says issuing statements without a deeper knowledge of racism and anti-racism work only betrays a lack of understanding. When schools do this, Kriel says, they unwittingly reveal, however well meaning they are, that they may not be listening, running the danger of becoming what Kriel calls “laminated, not living practice” for the purpose of ticking a box. A statement is fine as long as concrete measures follow. Instead of making megaphone announcements saying racism is wrong, headteachers should reflect on how their school structures may have allowed inbuilt institutional racism to arise. Jeffrey Boakye, a teacher and author, says school leaders should treat racism like safeguarding or health and safety. “Who is trained to tackle it? What precautions have been put in place? Are you ready to accept that your school is always unsafe?”For Kriel, schools must first work on their ethos. A good place to start is in shifting from an autocratic style of leadership that produces change through fear to a collaborative model enabling open and difficult conversations about race and unconscious bias. Without this, a culture of silence pervades in which important discussions about racial inequality and discrimination are shut down.Emmanuel Awoyelu, a teacher and Senco at a special school, New Rush Hall in Ilford, east London, says schools must create safe spaces for teachers and pupils to explore their experiences of racial inequality. For students, it can look like afternoon “golden time”, where children discuss their experiences in small groups. In secondaries, pupils can meet during break or lunch to talk through their experiences.And for teachers, are clear policies in place for them to report instances of racial discrimination without fear of repercussion?  “Schools must emphasise the need for staff and governors to be reflective of prejudice and stereotypes they have,” says Awoyelu. Doing something once a year won’t cut it either. As the Runnymede Trust’s latest report on Race and Racism in English Secondary Schools argues, schools must embed racial literacy for all.Allana Gay, headteacher of Vita et Pax preparatory school in north London and founding member of the BAMEed Network, says school leaders should question the alienating nature of the British value of “tolerance” in their school. Who wants to be tolerated, rather than accepted and understood? Tolerance suggests an agreement to let sleeping dogs lie. Acceptance, Gay says, shows that “I recognise your differences and appreciate you.”But what of schools that largely have white pupils? If scenes of far-right rioters in London have taught us anything, it is that these settings are where values of ersity and inclusion are most needed. Schools can reflect principles of acceptance and openness to dialogue in building relationships of exchange and collaboration with schools made up of very different communities.Dr Lorna Cork, a leadership consultant, says change can only be sustainable when school leaders are willing to question every stage of their recruitment processes, from what is written in the advert, to where those ads are placed. This applies to the recruitment of teachers, senior leaders and governors.But for Cork, once schools hire black and minority ethnic teachers, they must ask themselves how they are supporting and retaining them. This is not to ask for special treatment, she says. Rather, it is that black teachers want to be given the same support their white counterparts have, whether that be with behaviour management as newly qualified teachers, or mentorship and coaching for progression. The Runnymede report found BAME teachers tended to be more isolated and lacking in support from colleagues.Schools are often full of excuses as to why their curriculum is not more reflective of erse communities. Nick Dennis, director of studies at an independent school in Hertfordshire, says, however, that the capacity to broaden the curriculum has always been there. What is needed is for teachers to “go beyond what is to hand”. Schools should link up with innovative university departments, academics and research students keen on demonstrating a wider social impact, he says.Sonia Thompson, headteacher of St Matthew’s Church of England primary school in Birmingham, says it is normal for her school to reflect the ‘‘full ersity of human histories”, as described by the Royal Historical Society in 2018. A head for 10 years, she says BAME pupils, in particular, are sometimes considered “empty vessels” for their teachers to fill up. Schools often undervalue such children and inhibit what they are able to display intellectually, she says, but all children are “funds of knowledge who bring a lot to the table”. Thompson says schools can begin with a careful audit of their curriculum before harnessing the “rich repository children and their parents bring”. A strong believer of a “knowledge rich curriculum”, she says what is considered the best knowledge is itself subjective, and schools must question this.In her school, which serves a large Somali community, reception children begin with a unit on family histories entitled “our lives, our families”, as part of what the head called “sharing literacy lives”. From here, they explore the history of traditional Somali food and clothing. Black and Muslim inventors, philosophers and leaders are studied and celebrated so pupils view them as change-makers in their own right.Headteachers have the power to create open environments where BAME staff can raise issues of discrimination and racial inequality without being deemed troublesome. Everyone needs to be prepared to feel uncomfortable and resolve to move past this. If your school is in a largely white area, recognise that issues of race are as much your concern as colleagues in metropolitan hubs. See it as your business to teach inclusivity and acceptance.Recruit more BAME teachers. Offer them the early career support often lacking, so the profession can retain them. Recognise their talents by promoting them into leadership positions. Be prepared to view BAME families not as problems to be solved, but partners in the communities you serve. Diversify the curriculum. In short, make space."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d090cc2f19c17fec07d28c158be436f844447a0b/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11426008f1201b07b83c24974f9d94ce","title":"specieswatch invasive rushes british uplands","story":"For native plants, three similar species of rush are causing a lot of trouble: they are invading uplands, swamping other vegetation, and ruining pasture and the nesting sites of rare birds.The varieties are known as soft, hard and compact rushes and have the Latin names Juncus effusus, J inflexus and J conglomerates respectively. Exactly why they are spreading so fast is uncertain although changing farming practices and a warmer and wetter climate are suspected.The rushes are formidable. They grow to 1 metre tall, spread through rhizomes but also produce up to 4m seeds per sq metre, which can germinate decades later. They like poor, badly drained acid grassland, which is made into more suitable habitat by farmers using heavy machinery that crushes the drains installed by Victorian farmers.Sheep compact the land further and the ponies and cattle that used to eat rushes are gone.

Sanitary felling is sometimes necessary to stop the spread of disease and pests such as the European bark beetle. But it is hard to judge how much felling is really needed, and whether the harvesting is taking place under strict controls.Earthsight has uncovered evidence of felling during the silent periods in the spring and early summer from 2018 to this year. Previous research by the organisation found similar harvesting during the silent periods in preceding years.Some of the wood allegedly felled during silent periods is going to companies that supply the Swedish furniture maker Ikea, according to Earthsight. Ikea denied wrongdoing and told the  it would cut off any supplier found to have breached its stringent rules on sustainability.The company said: “Ikea does not accept illegally logged wood in our products. When we encounter any information that indicates wood which does not meet our requirements has entered or is at risk of entering our supply chain, we take immediate action.”The company said last year its forestry specialists carried out several audits across Ukraine and Romania and no illegally logged wood was discovered. The latest audit carried out on the supply chain in question was in April 2020, and did not indicate any illegal wood, the company said.The company has also begun an independent audit of VGSM, the supplier named in the Earthsight report as allegedly felling timber in contravention of the regulations.“We take the issues raised by Earthsight’s recent report very seriously and immediately began investigations with all mentioned partners,” said a spokesperson for Ikea.The company rejected claims that it had contravened the rules or the standards set by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), which certifies wood as coming from sustainable sources: “VGSM LLC highly values the FSC standards and cooperation with its foreign partners. Therefore, we never violate their requirements.”Ukrainian laws intended to protect forests are open to abuse, according to the FSC, which certifies timber from Ukraine and other countries as coming from environmentally sustainable sources. Earthsight has accused the FSC of certifying timber as sustainable when it is not.But he said that the uncertainties meant it was impossible to say for sure whether companies were acting within the law. Asking for a blanket ban on sanitary felling, which some companies may be using as a cover for extensive logging, would be counterproductive, said Carstensen, because protections against diseases and pests were still needed. “We are asking for clarification of the law,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb99b26bf18f30041654a6bc4e3c66d7757ef52d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=959633dc753902cca1aafa2a7f815521","title":"the science of shorts how to pull off this summers toughest style","story":"It’s boom time for short trousers – just make sure you swerve the ‘Boris Johnson out for a jog’ look This week’s dress code can be summarised in one word: shorts. There is a heatwave incoming, for a start. Plus, this weekend would have been Glastonbury, so the spirit of imaginary Worthy Farm is in the air, conjuring up the ghosts of Kate Moss and Alexa Chung in hot pants and wellies.Look around you. It is boom time for shorts: perfect with trainers when you are walking or cycling rather than taking public transport ideal for impromptu frisbee games. Also, the are-they-office-appropriate problem is, well, not an problem. (Marks \u0026amp Spencer reported that nine out of the bestselling menswear items in the first days after it reopened were shorts.)The past three months have relaxed our standards of wardrobe formality. Not getting dressed up for work events, weddings or parties has dialled down our wardrobes to the point where what used to look scruffy now looks acceptable – and what once looked like a baseline level of public-facing polish reads as if you have made a tremendous effort. Something has shifted, also, for those who have tended not to be “brave” enough to wear shorts. The past three months has pushed us outside our comfort zone in so many ways. Getting hung up about whether other people are looking at your knees? Maybe we can leave that one in the old normal.The shorts vibe of 2020 is one part Paul Mescal owning lockdown London in his O’Neills Gaelic football shorts and one part Carrie Bradshaw tapping at her laptop on a hot Manhattan night in a stretchy tank top and a pair of boyish athletic shorts. (Carrie Bradshaw at her laptop is a bluechip working-from-home icon, of course.) The loose, boxer-style shorts Rachel Green wore to hang out at home with Monica in Friends two decades ago are now turning up on Instagram: see Teen Vogue’s fashion editor, Michelle Li, who has been chronicling her at-home athleisure during quarantine in New York.Leggings were ideal when we wore our athleisure in the sleek, minimal aesthetic of a yoga studio, but when your exercise class is an Instagram Live in the kitchen or tricep dips on a park bench, the lo-fi, games-kit mood of what are essentially PE shorts hits the spot. Cut-off denim Daisy Dukes are a touch too poseurish for this moment. Culottes, which are basically shorts pretending to be midi skirts, are a little unnecessarily fiddly and formal. Cycling shorts are still going strong, buoyed by Lizzo and their usefulness when riding a bike, and long, tailored Bermuda shorts would probably have been more of a hit had this summer involved more urban commuting. There is a niche revival for the buttock-hugging micro boxer short in its 70s-retro mode – think Barbra Streisand in the 1979 film The Main Event – but the loose, athletic style short is where it’s at.\u2028Do not be fooled by the air of pull-on ease, however, because this is not a straightforward look to pull off. Too saggy and scruffy and you inch perilously close to “Boris Johnson out for a jog”. You need a wide waistband and enough fabric to give a standalone, slightly A-line silhouette – not a million miles from the paper-bag waist silhouette, in fashion terms. You need to accessorise, to make the point that this is fashion. (A bumbag will do the trick nicely.)

Back in February, when Parasite swept the board at the Oscars, it felt like he was the new flag bearer for foreign language cinema. However, in terms of sheer popular appeal, Parasite has been blown out of the water by a small Polish film called 365 Days. Maybe in the days and weeks to come, Bong will look back and regret not making his film a dreadful straight-to-DVD thriller about semi-consensual blowjobs.Because that’s what 365 Days is. Touted as the Polish 50 Shades of Grey (and also based on a hit book), it is currently the fourth most-watched thing on Netflix UK and the third most-watched on Netflix US (it’s been near the top of both charts now for two weeks). It is the story of a mob boss who kidnaps, drugs, chokes and all but rapes a stranger for a year in the mad hope that she will fall in love with him. And it is also terrible.Honestly, it’s hard to know where to start. There’s the central conceit, designed to be a riff on Beauty and the Beast, albeit one where Beast attempts to demonstrate his worth by tying Belle to a bed and forcing her to watch the teapot character suck him off. There’s the way that the kidnapped woman’s character development is expressed solely through the medium of shopping montages (there are three of them). There’s the dismal dialogue, like the moment where the woman pouts: “I’m not a bag of potatoes that you can transport without permission.” There’s the part where she does eventually fall in love with her kidnapper, but only after he pushes her off a yacht during a screaming argument about how frigid she is, then demonstrates his innate kindness by eventually stopping her from drowning.Then there’s all the sex, which is by far the biggest failing of 365 Days. Because, despite enjoying a pair of ridiculously photogenic leads, this is easily the least sexy screen sex since you saw Tommy Wiseau’s buttocks pumping away in The Room. On paper, the sex here is at least quite varied. There is masturbation. There is window-pressing. There is cucking, spitting, non-consensual licking, erotic consumption of ice cream, berserk multi-position drone-shot yacht intercourse, and a scene of such aggressively gaggy fellatio that the recipient ends up licking the overhead luggage compartment of an aeroplane at the point of climax.And yet, it very quickly becomes monotonous. The kidnapper will get a look in his eye, and your heart will sink because you know it means you’re in for yet another few minutes of drably shot semi-resisted sex accompanied – without fail – by a song that sounds as if it has been written for the exclusive purpose of soundtracking a local commercial for a vaguely noxious off-brand aftershave called something like Mutiny or Heretic or Insubordination. You know that feeling of dread you get during musicals, where the plot screeches to a halt so that some ninny can sing about their feelings? That’s how you’ll feel about the sex scenes in 365 Days.I don’t have any qualms about spoiling 365 Days for you, because nobody on the entire face of the planet has watched this for its storyline it is a film aimed squarely at a very specific sliver of horny people who are smart enough to sign up for a Netflix account but too dumb to be able to type the word Pornhub on to the internet. So here goes: the plan works. After 365 days, the woman falls in love with her kidnapper. They get engaged and she gets pregnant. But then she dies at the end, offed by another mob gang driven to unthinkable violence because they also couldn’t have sex with her. So, despite everything, at least 365 Days has a moral: sometimes, on reflection, kidnapping a woman and holding her hostage for a year in a sex dungeon doesn’t always have the happy ending you’d expect.

Overthinking pasta is never a good idea, so channel your inner nonna by mastering the dough and regional sauces with those who’ve spent a lifetime making them: the Pasta Grannies.

Discussions were held on Tuesday at the club over reiterating condemnation of the banner, and support for the Black Lives Matter movement, at the Watford game. Although details have yet to be confirmed it is understood Burnley will project their “One Club For All” message inside the stadium with support from Sean Dyche’s squad.Burnley issued a statement during the match on Monday that condemned the banner and vowed to ban for life those supporters responsible. That stance was repeated in a statement by the chairman, Mike Garlick, and chief executive, Neil Hart, on Tuesday . Lancashire police have said no criminal offence took place.Garlick said in an interview with ESPN: “We need to gather our thoughts, but clearly we need to make a clear stand against this sort of behaviour. I am sure will be doing that over the next few days to make our actions speak as loudly as our words. It’s a tiny minority, as any form of hooliganism or racism always has been, because the vast majority come to football in peace. But I want to stress that Burnley football club welcomes all people, from all creeds, races and religions.”Garlick echoed Mee’s embarrassment at Monday’s events – the chairman was at the Etihad Stadium – and said it was a shameful episode. “We will root out these racists and I am sure they will be dealt with in due course,” he said.“We will do whatever we can to make sure justice is done against these people. Let’s be clear. The plane didn’t fly in our name. It has absolutely nothing to do with Burnley football club and we absolutely deplore it. But we have to talk about it. We cannot and will not sweep it under the carpet.“I was at the game and I have been chairmanco-chairman for eight years. I have always been proud to be in that position, but I can tell you that I wasn’t proud to be Burnley chairman last night. It was for all the events that happened off the pitch, not what happened on the pitch. The game became irrelevant after the plane flew over. But I thought Ben Mee, our captain, spoke exceptionally well in really difficult circumstances. I am proud that he is captain of our football club and I have told him that.”Burnley’s condemnation of the banner on Monday prompted numerous complaints on social media and to the club questioning their stance. Garlick and Hart felt compelled to explain their objection in Tuesday’s statement. It read: “While we naturally consider that all lives matter, let us be clear that the Black Lives Matter movement aims to overcome years of racial inequality against the BAME community and promote a greater fairness for all. We at Burnley therefore stand firmly behind it and oppose anything that may appear to undermine or challenge such a positive message.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ffa6661598ba56c2475898359679f581403ad3e/78_0_2168_1301/master/2168.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a0c81e1f642f5c3e432bd3ab0b117a0","title":"leicester reprieved by neal maupay penalty miss but stall against brighton","story":"Leicester’s charge for Champions League qualification has slowed to a crawl but they can be thankful to Kasper Schmeichel for helping them to eke out a point here. The goalkeeper’s save from a penalty by Neal Maupay in the first half enabled Brendan Rodgers’s team to claim a draw from a match in which they were second best for long spells. Leicester have won only one of their past seven league matches they remain third in the table but their once-plush cushion is not looking comfortable.Brighton, meanwhile, can take heart from their performance here, which brought their tally to four points from their two matches since the Premier League’s resumption. But they, too, could have done with a maximum yield and will lament their failure to turn first-half buoyancy into at least one goal.As a manager who has the courage of his convictions, Graham Potter has never been spooked by the spectre of relegation. That was plain from his team selection here, which showed four alterations to the side that started Saturday’s precious victory over Arsenal. That could be read as a comment on Mikel Arteta’s rabble but is more accurately interpreted as a sign of the Brighton manager’s confidence in the young talent in his ranks: three of the newcomers were aged 21 or under. The right-back Tariq Lamptey was the most impressive of the trio, but the midfielder Alexis Mac Allister and the forward Aaron Connolly also enjoyed bright moments.Potter’s approach was vindicated by a first half in which Brighton were perkier, sharper and smarter than their high-flying hosts, who looked tactically flummoxed as Brighton buzzed around them. The chief frustration for the visitors was that they failed to translate their superiority into a lead before the break. Maupay squandered a perfect opportunity to put them in front from the penalty spot in the 14th minute, dabbing a shot towards the bottom right-hand corner. Once Schmeichel read his intentions, it was an easy save for the keeper.The way the spot-kick came about reflected Brighton’s greater vivacity. Aaron Mooy dropped a teasing pass from deep over the top of the home defence, and James Justin looked well positioned to get to it first but failed to make a decisive intervention, instead tangling untidily with the pesky Connolly.Despite the boost offered by their goalkeeper’s save, Leicester’s performance still did not take off. They were unable to pass their way through the middle and made little inroads down the flanks, with Lamptey subduing Ben Chilwell impressively while the absence of the injured Ricardo Pereira was sorely felt on Leicester’s right. Jamie Vardy, meanwhile, might as well have been following proceedings via a Zoom conference, as he barely touched the ball in the first half-hour. The three attackers just behind him – James Maddison, Kelechi Iheanacho and Demarai Gray – offered paltry service.Connolly showed his sharpness again just before the half-hour, when he embarked on a shredding run through the heart of the home defence before his shot from the edge of the area was deflected wide by Caglar Soyuncu. Not until five minutes before the break did Vardy threaten – thanks to a comical error by the visiting goalkeeper, Mat Ryan, who accidentally threw the ball backwards when attempting to pick out a teammate. The mortified keeper scampered back pronto to stifle Vardy’s attempt to deepen his embarrassment.For all their impressive work in the first period, Brighton were thankful for a close-range miss by Soyuncu just before the break, as the defender nodded wide after a shot by Gray following a clever free-kick by Maddison ricocheted into his path at the back post.Surprisingly, Brendan Rodgers made no changes during the interval. But his team did show a little more cohesion in the second half. Wilfred Ndidi, hitherto eclipsed by Yves Bissouma, began to shine in midfield as the hosts applied pressure. But Leicester did not look like creating an opening until the 54th minute, when the ball broke to Chilwell amid frantic play in the Brighton box. Unhappily for the hosts, Chilwell’s right-foot is a far lower grade of a weapon than the left one he used to fire Leicester into the lead at Watford last weekend. Here he dragged a feeble shot wide.Even though Brighton could no longer generate much momentum, Leicester sagged again after that, so much so that by the time Rodgers made his first substitutions, in the 68th minute, change felt overdue. Brighton had to defend well in the last quarter of an hour and that is exactly what they did, snuffing out crosses and blocking shots with under only moderate duress."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cefae8c218027c07f0bfa9a273bfdad8197d4a5e/424_590_2425_1455/master/2425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b77a72ec5577c1aac1feb56a501dc919","title":"leicester city v brighton premier league live","story":"Neal Maupay missed a penalty for Brighton as the points were shared at the end of another underwhelming contest Premier League: Paul Doyle sallied forth to the King Power Stadium to watch yet another underwhelming Premier League contest. Relive his pain ...Premier League: It’s a big game for both teams at White Hart Lane and kick off is in 10 minutes. Follow whatever passes for the action with Rob Smyth.Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeep! It’s all over at the King Power Stadium, where Brighton missed a first half penalty but will probably be the happier of the two teams with a point. They edge six points clear of the relegation zone with some terrifying fixtures to come. Leicester have to settle for their second consecutive draw in the Premier League and remain third in the table, four points clear of Chelsea having played one game more.90+4 min: “HIT IT SOLLY! F**KING HELL!!!” comes a loud roar from the touchline, as an unidentified member of Brighton’s coaching staff speaks (well, shouts) for all of us.Solly March ignores the wise counsel, is dispossessed by Jonny Evans and that is very much that at the King Power Stadium, where the points are shared. 90+3 min: Jamie Vardy gets his head to a cross and the ball hits Lewis Dunk’s extended arm in the penalty area. Leicester appeal for a penalty but none is forthcoming. I’ve seen them given for a lot less. 90+1: Dan Burn hooks the ball out for a corner with Ayoze Perez lurking behind him at the far post. James Maddison sends the ball into the penalty area, where Shane Duffy heads clear under pressure from Jonny Evans. 90 min: Solly March claims a corner but doesn’t get one after the ball appears to go out of play off Jonny Evans. 87 min: It’s worth noting that Dale Stephens, who is already on a yellow and was lucky to avoid a second for what looked like a shove on Wilfred Ndidi, has just dodged another bullet after avoiding a booking for a foul on James Maddison. Lee Mason, our referee, seems in a generous mood this evening. 85 min: Leicester continue to dominate these closing stages as the game enters its knockings. Brighton will rue their missed penalty in the first half but I suspect if you were to offer Graham Potter a draw right now he’d snap your hand off.Tariq Lamptey gets a slight touch on a Harvey Barnes cross from the left and the ball is put out for a corner by Lewis Dunk. Nothing comes of it. 83 min: Brighton substitution: Aaron Connolly off, Help The Aged’s Glen Murray on. At 36 years old, Murray is 16 years older than the player he’s just replaced and twice the age of his team-mate Tariq Lamptey. 81 min: ... fires over the bar. That’s poor from Maddison, who’s capable of much better. 80 min: Into the final 10 minutes we go, with Leicester on the front foot in a game that has been good in spots, but largely underwhelming since the interval. Shane Duffy is booked for a foul that gives Leicester City a free-kick five yards outside the penalty area, a little left of centre. It looks perfect for James Maddison, who steps up and ...78 min: If I was a betting man, which I am from time to time, I might be tempted to have a few pennies on Leicester snatching this game in the closing stages. They’re dominating possession having switched to a 4-1-4-1 formation and have made important changes in personnel in their efforts to win the game at the death. The 11 on the field now are certainly stronger than the 11 who started. 76 min: James Maddison blasts the ball over the bar from distance with a wild shot after running on to a cushioned pass into his path from Jamie Vardy. 74 min: Leicester substitution: Ayoze Perez on for Demarai Gray. “AWAY!” roars Brighton goalkeeper Mat Ryan, as Jonny Evans heads a corner clear. 71 min: The drinks break over, play resumes. Sky Sports flash up a graphic showing that Neal Maupay is Brighton’s top scorer in the Premier League this season with nine goals. The prolific “Own Goals” are next highest, with four. In their next three games, Brighton face Manchester United (h), Norwich (a), Liverpool (h) and Manchester City (h), so it’s fair to say they could do with securing at least a point if not all three here.67 min: Leicester double-substitution: Youri Tielemans and Harvey Barnes on for Kelechi Iheanacho and Papy Mendy. They immediately adjourn to the sideline for some liquid refreshments which they have done little to earn. 65 min: Another corner for Brighton, won by Dan Burn. March’s delivery is cleared at the near post by Wilfred Ndidi. Leicester break up the field with Jamie Vardy on the ball, but Tariq Lamptey stays on his feet and eventually robs him of the ball. Excellent defending from the teenager. 64 min: Brighton win a corner. Solly March sends the ball towards the far post, where Jonny Evans leaps highest and clears with a meaty header. 63 min: Leicester are dominating proceedings for the first time in this game, but still aren’t creating much. 61 min: With Leicester on the counter-attack, James Maddison plays a diagonal ball to Jamie Vardy on the right side of the Brighton penalty area. With his path to goal blocked, he pulls the ball into the path of Wilfred Ndidi, galloping towards the edge of the penalty area.As the Leicester midfielder shapes to rifle the ball home, he appears to get a nudge in the back from Dale Stephens – who is already on a yellow card – that knocks him off balance, but referee Lee Mason is unmoved and doesn’t award a free-kick. 60 min: James Maddison runs on to a bouncing ball and fires goalwards from the edge of the Brighton penalty area, but his effort fizzes wide. 58 min: Brighton triple-substitution: Davy Propper, Solly March and Leandro Troussard come on for Neal Maupay, Alexis MacAllister and Yves Bissouma. 58 min: Demarai Grtay sends a cross into the Brighton penalty area which is cut out by Lewis Dunk. 56 min: Aaron Mooy tries to pick out Alexis MacAllister with a cross from deep to the far post. He overcooks his delivery and the ball drifts wide. 54 min: Jamie Vardy heads a cross from the right across the face of Brighton’s goal. The header clear is weak and the ball drops kindly for Ben Chilwell. The Leicester left-back snatches at his shot and fires well wide. That was an excellent opportunity wasted. 53 min: Leicester enjoy a rare spell of sustained possession, but lose the ball when Ben Chilwell’s ball into the penalty area is cleared by Yves Bissouma. 52 min: Jonny Evans plays the ball wide to James Justin, who tries to pick out Demarai Gray in the middle. His touch is poor and he cedes possession. 50 min: Ben Chilwell sends the ball into space down the left flank, prompting Shane Duffy to unceremoniously leather into an advertising hoarding at the side of the pitch. 47 min: The camera cuts to Brendan Rodgers who has a notebook in his hand. The formation he has drawn on the visible page appears to suggest he’s going to have Wilfred Ndidi playing as a lone holding midfielder sooner rather than later. Back on the field, Neal Maupay shoots from distance but fires wide. 46 min: Leicester City get the ball rolling for the second half, with no changes in personnel on either side. I’m surprised Leicester haven’t made any tweaks as they’ve looked bereft of ideas so far this evening. It’s all square. The deadlock remains unbroken but it was certainly one of the more entertaining halves of football I’ve seen since Project Restart ... er, started. Graham Potter will the more pleased of the two managers. His players have looked more inventive, more committed, more motivated and – whisper it – more fit than their opponents. 45+5 min: Brighton have been dominant throughout a first half in which Jamie Vardy, Kelechi Iheanacho, James Maddison and Demarai Gray have all been conspicuously quiet. They’ve failed to capitalise on their dominance, however, not least thanks to Neal Maupay’s penalty miss on 16 minutes. 45+3 min: Lamptey attacks down the right touchline again, but James Maddison puts the ball out for a throw-in. Moments later, James Justin puts the ball out for a corner under pressure from Neal Maupay. It’s their sixth of the game, compared to Leicester’s one, but Jamie Vardy is back to head the delivery clear. 45+1 min: We’re into the first of six minutes of added time. Caglar Soyuncu scuffs a header wide from close range after a Wilfred Ndidi shot is deflected into his path. It was a tight angle and he was taken by surprise, but perhaps should have done better. 45 min: Dale Stephens has a shot blocked from Brighton’s latest corner and Leicester clear their lines. 44 min: James Justin concedes another corner as Lewis Dunk tries to head the ball goalwards after getting on the end of a Mooy cross. 43 min: Aaron Mooy shoots from distance, just outside the Leicester penalty area. His low drive is deflected wide for a corner. 40 min: Jamie Vardy tries and fails to take advantage of a brief rush of blood to the head of Brighton goalkeeper Mat Ryan. The Australian threw the ball to nobody in particular and then had to scramble in a most unedifying manner and beat Vardy for toe as the Leicester striker tried to capitalise on his error. 38 min: The camera cuts to Aaron Connolly during a break in play. Showing a healthy disregard for health and safety during the current global pandemic, he hoiks up a generous gully of spittle from the recesses of his throat and flobs it out on the well manicured grass. 37 min: Dale Stephens gets a yellow card for a late tackle on Leicester City midfielder Nampalys Mendy.35 min: Aaron Mooy robs the ball from Ben Chilwell and sets of on a run down the right flank. His expedition comes to an abrupt end as he runs down a blind alley. 34 min: Wilfred Ndidi gets booked for putting an illegal stop to an ambitious gallop from Tariq Lamptey, who had skipped past two players as he danced down the right touchline. 30 min: Despite their penalty miss, Brighton haven’t let their heads drop and continue to boss the game. Jamie Vardy and Kelechi Iheanacho have had very little to work with so far.Vardy gets only his second touch of the game as he leaps at the far post to get his head to a Ben Chilwell cross from the left touchline. The delivery is a mite too high for him and he can only send the ball looping into the grateful embrace of Mat Ryan. 27 min: Aaron Connolly shoots over the bar when scoring looked easier, due in no small part to a desperate and timely lunge from Caglar Soyuncu. “FOR F**K’S SAKE!!!” screams somebody or other with Brighton affiliations, their profanity echoing across the stadium. 26 min: Lamptey returns to the fray, boasting a swollen lip that is now covered in Vaseline after shipping a whack to the face. Leicester corner – James Maddison sends the ball into the mixer, where Dale Stephens heads it clear for Brighton. 24 min: Duffy has come on for Webster, but Tariq Lamptey is still receiving running repairs on the sideline.

Rice drives a long pass over the defence towards Antonio, who lashes a half-volley into orbit on the stretch.59 min: Chance for Kane! Cresswell’s corner is headed away and Spurs break four on three. Son and Lo Celso combine efficiently to find Kane, who drives a left-footed shot just wide of the far post. He probably should have scored.58 min Brilliant play from Rice, who beats Sanchez twice during the same run before cutting onto his right foot and driving a shot that is deflected wide.58 min “Personally I do not take advantage of a lot of technology out there but I am not a luddite,” says Mary Waltz. “Technology is simply a tool that humans use properly, or that humans abuse. There is nothing wrong with VAR per se, humans just don’t know how to use it properly.”Yes, the real question is whether it’s time for technology to dispense with humans. 56 min Alli shoots well wide from 25 yards after a nice one-two with Son.55 min That’s the Harry Kane we know, admire and in some cases love. He cuts in on his right foot, on the edge of the area, and whistles a shot just over the bar with Fabianski leaping desperately in an attempt to save.54 min: Fornals misses a great chance! West Ham should be ahead. Bowen, on the right, played a one-two with Noble and dragged a good cross back towards the penalty spot. The unmarked Fornals ran onto the ball but mistimed his shot so badly that it dribbled across the area, miles wide of goal.52 min “To add to what Ian said,” begins Aditi Modi. “If technology is not allowed anywhere near sport, we wouldn’t be able to watch said sport in this new world.” 51 min Bowen wallops over from distance.51 min Kane is booked for a high challenge on someone, Balbuena I think.50 min: Good save by Fabianski! Aurier fizzed a low cross to the near post, where the unmarked Kane flicked the ball daintily behind his standing foot. Fabianski was well-positioned and blocked the shot, with the ball rebounding back off Kane and behind for a goalkick.49 min Fine play from Eric Dier, who marches forward from his centre-back position and curls a shot just wide from 25 yards. Fabianski had it covered but it was an admirable injection of purpose from Dier.49 min Lots of Spurs possession at the start of the second half, though it’s all in front of this well-organised West Ham defence.47 min “I may be over-thinking or just thinking, but the implicit critique in Mary Waltz’s observation is that technology kills human joy,” says Ian Copestake. “If human joy comes from sport then technology should not be allowed anywhere near it. Am I right, Hal?”You’re not wrong, Walter…46 min Peep peep! Spurs begin the second half.“Even though Son’s goal was erased it was a joy to see some quality,” says Mary Waltz. “Other then City, all these teams can’t seem to string three passes together.”Peep peep! The break comes at a good time for West Ham, who were hanging on a bit after making a comfortable start to the game. See you in 15 minutes for more entertainment.45+3 min Lucas Moura misses a great chance, sidefooting well wide from 12 yards after being picked out by Davies.Spurs have been VARed. The non-goal was made by Lo Celso, who picked up a loose ball just outside the D and wriggled away from two players before playing the ball out to Son on the left of the box. He cut back inside Fredericks and rammed an emphatic low shot past Fabianski at the near post. But VAR showed his toenail was offside. Jose Mourinho will love that.A moment of quality at last. Son has given Spurs the lead with a good goal, though it’s being checked for offside.42 min Son’s left-wing corner hits a West Ham defender at the near post and bounces back towards Dier, who smashes a cross-shot that deflects behind for another corner. The second corner is cleared at the far post.41 min West Ham have been fine defensively, with their back four well protected by the midfield trio of Rice, Noble and Soucek. You’d expect the game to open up a bit in the second half. By heaven, it needs to.39 min After a good break from West Ham, Fredericks’ cross is well claimed by Lloris.37 min I’m not a rich man, nowhere near, but I’d still pay a lot of money to hear Daniel Levy’s internal monologue right now. It’s fiendishly difficult to see this ending well.36 min “Do you think the audio boffins at Sky are using actual songs from Spurs supporters,” says Stephen Carr, “or are they just using another team’s but at half speed?”Heh, very good. At this rate, even the virtual fans will be booing Spurs off at half-time. 35 min Davies knocks Son off his feet by belting a cross straight at his noggin. This isn’t great. Moments later, Alli slashes well wide from the edge of the D.31 min Aurier, in space on the right, dumps a cross into the middle. Kane gets above Balbuena but heads over under pressure. It was only a half chance.29 min “Wotcha, Bob,” says Mac Millings. “No matter which temperature scale you use, it’s absolutely steaming here in South Carolina today (which is the equivalent of the 1950s everywhere else), but a lot of that heat is generated by me sweating over almost every result involving the Relegation Mini-League. It’s bad enough having to watch my Hornets from between my fingers, but now I have to cry myself through all these other games. On top of that, wanting Tottenham to win sits very uncomfortably, and even worse, I had to be happy that Chelsea won on Sunday. CHELSEA, FFS.”I’ve missed all this. When I say ‘missed’28 min A smart bit of play from Fabianski, who controls Diop’s awkward back pass on the chest and knocks it away just before Alli arrives on the scene.27 min A decent effort from Kane, who has a sudden pop from 22 yards. It bounces up awkwardly in front of Fabianski, who does well to hold it. I think he held it, anyway. Look, it didn’t lead to a goal, that’s all you need to know.26 min Noble is booked for pulling back Lo Celso.24 min “Greetings Rob from a part of the world where the mercury is on its way to 37C99F,” says Peter Oh. “27C sounds rather mild. You wrote ‘Lo Celso’ but I think you meant Low Celsius.”22 min: Good save by Fabianski! Lucas Moura turns away from a West Ham player, 25 yards from goal, and cuts across a vicious, swirling shot that is tipped over by the leaping Fabianski. The shot was central enough for it to be a relatively comfortable save, certainly for a keeper as good as Fabianski.21 min “How does one get an invite to the dedicated Antarctica MBM?” says Travis Johnson. “Oh, just for Patreon subscribers, then.”We need proof of Antarctican address as well, and of course your bank details. 20 min: Good save from Lloris! A long free-kick from the right ran through to Antonio, whose shot on the stretch was blocked by Lloris at the near post. The ball rebounded to Bowen, whose follow-up shot hit Dier. The flag then went up, I think for offside against Antonio at the original free-kick, so it wouldn’t have counted anyway.19 min It’s still an even game, with Spurs yet to gain much attacking momentum.16 min Aurier is still limping after that challenge from Fornals, who caught him on the right ankle. I think he’ll be okay.14 min Fornals is booked for a lunge at Aurier.13 min A good attack from Spurs. Lucas Moura plays a fine pass inside Cresswell for the overlapping Aurier, whose hit-and-hope low cross is kicked behind by Diop.10 min West Ham have made a pretty positive start, with Cresswell and Fornals combining nicely on the left and Bowen looking lively on the other side.8 min In other news. 6 min Another corner to Spurs, this time on the right. Lo Celso takes it short, gets it back and whips in a deep cross that is headed clear. 4 min “For those of us in the former colonies, territories etc. (e.g., USA) who have stuck with fahrenheit, you might mention that 27 C is 80 F,” says David C Hunter. “Also, not that sweltering, but everything’s relative, right?”You should see what I said about it in our dedicated Antarctica MBM3 min Son’s left-wing cross deflects off Fredericks and is almost shovelled into his own net by Fabianski. Turns out it had gone out of play before it reached Fabianski, so Spurs get the first corner of the game. Nothing comes of it.2 min A bright start from West Ham. Cresswell’s deep cross finds Antonio, who does superbly to take it on the chest and reverse it with the outside of the boot towards the onrushing Noble. He takes the ball in his stride, just inside the area, but Sissoko tracks him all the way and makes an important interception. Good defending.1 min Peep peep! West Ham, in claret and blue, kick off from left to right. Spurs are in white.The players emerge on a sticky night in north London, 27 degrees it says here. Prediction: Tottenham Hotspur 12-7 West Ham.“Football has been largely crap since the restart,” chirps Stephen Carr, “so a Mourinho v Moyes match-up doesn’t exactly whet the appetite does it?”I don’t know what you’re talking about.“Was I wrong in thinking that the long break would have given players the opportunity to develop some innovative free kicks and corners?” sniffs Gary Naylor. “I thought that they might have practised execution too. Instead, they’re worse than ever. Brighton kicked two corners out of play! Imagine rugby players being as slapdash about penalties and conversions.”I don’t know, I’d be tempted to reserve judgement until we see the first rugby matches after such a long break.It’s all over at the King Power Stadium. You will believe the score!It’s Leicester 0-0 Brighton at the King Power Stadium. You won’t believe the score!Hello and welcome to live coverage of Tottenham Hotspur v West Ham United from the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in Tottenham. Both teams come into this match in a bit of a funk. Spurs had a perfectly good result on their return to action, a 1-1 draw at home to Manchester United, but for one reason or another the mood around the club hasn’t been great for a while now.The same is true of West Ham, apart from the bit about a perfectly good result. They lost 2-0 at home to Wolves, a scoreline that did not flatter them, and are only outside the relegation places on goal difference. After a good start to the season - they were fifth are seven games - they have taken only 15 points from 23 games.

Here, three stars of social share what they’ve learnedMost businesses these days will have some form of social media presence, but many may not be making the most of the opportunities it provides. Not only does it open up a huge potential customer base – half the world’s population is now on social media – it also gives companies the perfect opportunity to build and retain loyalty among existing customers.Like all aspects of technology, social media is constantly evolving. So while a small business may have set up a Facebook or a Twitter account a few years back and thought that was a case of “job done”, new social media platforms such as TiKTok have been developed since then, while Instagram and YouTube have become vital parts of a holistic social media ecosystem.\u0026nbspBeyond the platforms themselves, trends have also changed in terms of what users want, how they interact with brands and what’s important to them. Customers have now become fans, emotional ties to brands are a thing and thought-leadership can make you an influencer. Content is still king, and shareability is vital.\u0026nbspBut as well as all this modern stuff – the basics are still important too.\u0026nbsp“On the high street you wouldn’t have a shopfront with a broken window, peeling paint, rubbish everywhere and goods randomly thrown on displays, and expect to thrive,” says PR and social media expert Mike Crutchley.As someone who helps businesses improve and overhaul their social media strategies, he says first impressions count.\u0026nbsp“Social media channels must be up to date with everything from posts to contact details and opening hours,” he says. “High-quality images and videos, as well as good grammar and spelling are as vital as creating engaging posts.”The tools that allow businesses to make this happen have never been more accessible, and there is now an opportunity to try some of them out free of charge. Customers of the website builder GoDaddy are currently receiving a complimentary 90-day premium subscription to the mobile app Over, which gives them access to simple templates for creating sleek and effective social media content.Sometimes the things that work best on social media are the simplest. You can have all the metrics and dashboards in the world, but if people don’t engage and share your original posts then you’re missing a huge potential source of customers.\u0026nbspWhen Dutch-born Londoner Annemarie Plas saw people in countries throughout Europe clapping for their healthcare workers she was inspired to help set up something similar in her adopted home, and so created clapforourcarers with GoDaddy.Scaling up quickly could well have proved a challenge, but with the astute use of social media things have gone from strength to strength.\u0026nbsp“I just put together a small image and posted it on my socials such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter, and sent it to all my UK friends by WhatsApp, I also made a small website and an Insta page,” says Plas.\u0026nbspHer efforts to spread the word were given a huge boost when her campaign was picked up by influencers such as the Beckhams and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who shared it to their followers.\u0026nbspThe first clap happened on Thursday 26 March at 8pm and became a weekly event, being covered by the national media and circulated widely on social media too, right up to the final clap on 28 May.Although Plas has a background working for media agencies, she had neither the time nor staff support that other organisations might be able to draw upon. So she decided to keep things simple and made shareability a big part of her strategy.\u0026nbsp“I understood the importance of having simple and engaging messaging. I used a hashtag and made the image easy to share on any social channels.”Her simple and consistent messaging has resulted in the #clapforourcarers hashtag being shared more than 139,000 times on Instagram alone.\u0026nbsp“Some influencers get a bad reputation,” says Masha Zvereva, founder of Coding Blonde. She set up her blog back in 2015, when she was trying to learn some coding skills to make her more employable. She originally registered it with GoDaddy, which she then also used as a hosting provider.Through that blog, as well as Instagram and YouTube, Zvereva has amassed a loyal following and is now regarded as an influencer in the field of women in tech, entrepreneurship and personal growth.\u0026nbsp“Influencers can be perceived as fake, superficial, salesy etc, but what people don’t see is the hard work that goes behind being able to make a living off of this business model and growing your business,” she says.Quality content is paramount according to Zvereva. Whether you’re filming a video for YouTube or writing a thought leadership piece, it has to add value beyond simply advertising your skills to the wider world.\u0026nbsp“Anyone can become an influencer if they want to, but I’d recommend approaching it from the standpoint of adding value to an audience,” she says.\u0026nbsp“What’s the purpose behind your blog? How will you be impacting people’s lives and who is your target audience? And finally, why should it be you?”Many people might still associate social media in a business context purely with selling, but its importance when it comes to building a brand can’t be overstated.\u0026nbspThis is something Zaffrin and Brian O’Sullivan, co-founders of the vegan skincare company Five Dot Botanics set out to do well before their company launched.Establishing it on Instagram even before they had products to sell, they were able to develop a loyal audience.\u0026nbsp“Social media has allowed small brands like mine to build a brand. Historically it would not have been possible to launch a beauty brand without millions of pounds to acquire customers through marketing,” says Zaffrin.\u0026nbspBefore setting up those social channels though, their first move was to register a domain name and get a URL through GoDaddy. Then it was time to get the ball rolling with social media.\u0026nbspThe stories the O’Sullivans shared weren’t all about success, but about the challenges they were facing. This honesty helped create a situation where people were rooting for them. The couple were also able to get 600 people signed up to their newsletter email list so there was already an eager customer base waiting for when the products were ready.Once the social channels were up and running, the O’Sullivans set up an internet landing page using GoDaddy’s services – and they were in business.Social continues to be at the heart of their marketing. As well as using Instagram for brand-building, Zaffrin posts to Pinterest and Facebook, although she says the latter works best for business if you’re willing to put money behind it – paying for targeted ads, for example. Otherwise the other platforms can be effective without budget, simply by skilful use. Zaffrin uses LinkedIn to raise her business profile and publish articles, and is curious about TikTok, saying it is “one to watch”.\u0026nbsp“Our audience are our fans,” she says. “They root for our success, and our customers on social tell us every day what they think and what they want. We are constantly listening to them, whether they’re letting us know how they are using our products or coming up with ideas for new ones.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

Take away arrangements of pieces originally intended for other forces, and the number of genuinely worthwhile pieces expressly intended for violin and viola without the support of a keyboard or a bass instrument shrinks further, though Benjamin Baker and Timothy Ridout included two of the best of that small list in their lunchtime recital.Mozart’s B flat Duo K424 was one of two that he composed in Salzburg in 1783 to complete a set of six that Michael Haydn (younger brother of Franz Joseph) had been unable to finish, while Martinů’s Three Madrigals for violin and viola, were in turn inspired by Mozart’s examples. As Baker and Ridout showed, both composers treat the two instruments as equal partners. In the set of variations that ends the Mozart duo in particular, Ridout made the most of the opportunities that are given to the viola, while in the Martinů their playing was wonderfully unanimous, so that the two instruments sometimes seemed to become a single musical entity.An early piece by Sibelius, a duo that he composed for a couple of his students, separated the Mozart and Martinů, and the Sarabande and Variations on a Theme by Handel by Johan Halvorsen, a younger contemporary of Grieg, followed them. There was not much substance in either work, and Baker and Ridout could never quite dispel the feeling that such a programme did not really demonstrate what fine young string players they both are.• Available on BBC Sounds and Wigmore Hall live.

He is not interested in Westminster politics and has little time for talk of the green recovery, but he knows how to unite a community and care for people who are hurting. And it is this that inspires his thoughts about Britain beyond lockdown.“We can’t have more cuts. There are a lot of people on their knees already,” he says. “There is a lot of industry in this area. If the government puts the money on the table, it could be massive in the north-east. Let’s get people back working and lift the economy off its knees.”Day is known locally as “the most popular man in Hartlepool” because of the amount of time he devotes to community work. He has raised more than £400,000 for cancer, established the mental health charities Miles for Men and Minds for Men, and works with local supermarkets to arrange food donations. During lockdown, he and his friends have been doing karaoke car park tours to lift the spirits of people in isolation, regaling the inhabitants of elderly care homes with Elvis and Oasis numbers.He says this already close community of 90,000 has become stronger during the pandemic because people have rallied to help each other out. But Day foresees financial and mental health problems ahead unless there is more support. “A lot of people have been going through tough times. After lockdown, it’s going to get worse.”How to lift and heal the country is the biggest political challenge facing the government. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is putting together a recovery budget that could be the defining economic policy of a generation. It must head off the UK’s worst recession in 300 years, address an existential climate crisis, and “level up” incomes in an unequal and ided nation. Politicians in the north-east see an opportunity for a historic transition. There are hopes that decarbonisation can give a future to a region that has often struggled to emerge from the past.Since Margaret Thatcher closed the collieries in the 1980s, the town of Hartlepool has slipped further and further behind other parts of Britain for job prospects, life expectancy, health and economic growth.One in three households are jobless. A third of children are obese when they finish primary school. Although there are only 40,000 families in the town, such is the level of need that there are nine food kitchens. Life expectancy was declining even before coronavirus. The local council is in dire financial straits. Locals joke darkly that even three pound shops have gone bust.Because the town was already so poor, the economic impact of Covid-19 has been muted. The third of the population on benefits may even be slightly better off because the government is giving an extra £20 a week in universal credit and £15 for school meal vouchers. In a ranking of which English towns have suffered the worst financial hit from the crisis, Hartlepool came 154th out of 175. Others have suffered a sharper downturn because they have lost tourist and student income.“For us, Covid is just another crisis. We already knew who to support. We’ve been doing it for ages,” says charity coordinator Sacha Bedding. He fears that what happened to Hartlepool after deindustrialisation in the 1980s could be a foretaste of what is to come.When the Conservative government closed the coal mines and ancilliary operations that had provided most of the jobs in the town, call centres were supposed to be the future – but they all moved to India in the 2000s. The public sector was then the biggest employer, but it was slashed under austerity programmes following the financial crisis. There has been public-private investment in redeveloping the marina, but several of the upmarket new restaurants have gone bust because there are not enough wealthy local customers to fill the tables.“We try to reinvent ourselves, but we always seem to be one step behind because we don’t address deep structural changes,” Bedding says. “If we are not careful, I worry the country will level down rather than level up,” he says over a cup of tea at the end of another day delivering food parcels and medicine to those in need.For most of the last few decades, Bedding – like several others the  spoke to – feels people in the north-east have been ignored, scorned as “scroungers” or derided as racist throwbacks who failed to adjust to a globalised post-industrial world.But he feels the voice of the region has grown stronger in the wake of Brexit and the election of a new post-”red wall” wave of MPs, mayors and councillors who can no longer take their support for granted. One such politician is Ben Houchen, a Conservative elected in 2017 as Tees Valley mayor. The investments he is trying to attract include some of the biggest decarbonisation projects in Europe.In a phone interview, Houchen comes across as very different from southern Tories like David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson. He seems more concerned about jobs, levelling up and the need to decarbonise the economy.“For Teesside, clean growth could be as transformative to our region as steel and iron were 200 year ago … This would be huge in levelling up.”He is under no illusions about the scale of the economic challenge. “It’s absolutely unprecedented – as big as it could be,” he says. “But the rebound will be strong. There is a lot of pent-up energy in the economy … that wasn’t there in 2007.”Many major spending projects have been pre-approved, and Houchen is hopeful for more because interest rates are low, which means the government has less of an incentive to take the path of austerity. Politically, it will also want to capitalise on its recent gains in former Labour territory.The old steelworks on Teesside was recently chosen as the site for one of the world’s biggest industrial-scale carbon capture and storage projects. Houchen said Net Zero Teesside will bring in more than £3bn in investment, create 5,700 jobs and capture CO2 equivalent to the emissions of 6m homes every year. It is due to start by 2025 with the backing of BP, Shell and Equinox. “They see it as the future of their business. They realise they can’t just release the emissions into the air any more,” the mayor said.Other potential job-creating investments by the chancellor include the decarbonisation of heating in the country’s 20m homes by switching boilers from fossil fuel gas to hydrogen. “That will require refitting 2,000 boilers every day until 2050. That’s a huge number of jobs,” the mayor says. The government could also support the domestic manufacturing of turbines for the large offshore wind farm at Dogger Bank, which is 80 miles off the Teesside coastline. Houchen estimates that would create another 5,000-8,000 jobs.But all this is not enough to hold back the unemployment tsunami that is gathering force. There will also be pressure to generate more carbon-intensive jobs through roadbuilding and expanding airports.Locals say they don’t care whether jobs are green or black, as long as they are not minimum wage, or zero-hours contracts, which barely pay more than benefits. That means employees in the care, health and retail sectors should be valued as the “essential workers” they were designated as during lockdown.The town centre is coming back to life. When non-essential shops reopened, locals say there were so many people wanting to return to old consumer habits that streets were blocked with cars, and marshals had to be called in to manage the long lines of eager customers.Some want a more caring economy. Independent retailers Angela Arnold and Trevor Sherwood, co-owners of the cosy LilyAnne’s coffee bar, have used their £10,000 Covid-19 support grant to expand the cafe so they can provide a “gentle space” that will help socially isolated residents to reintegrate. “Covid has heightened anxieties among many people,” said Arnold. “There will be a big mental health impact.”But with the prime minister urging people to shop for Britain, Arnold and her business partner fear the government will suspend the Sunday trading law to ramp up productivity again. “That would be a disaster for independent retailers like us,” she said. Like many, she would like more focus on togetherness, which helped during Covid-19 and previous crises and is likely to be needed in the tough times that everyone expects to come.“Before Covid, when did you last see your neighbour? Everyone is normally too tired when they come home. But in lockdown, we are getting to know each other again,” she says. “People are cooking for one another and leaving food on the steps, and reconnecting with friends. There is a realisation that there is more to life than money.” At the nearby seaside town of Seaton Carew, the beachfront is as close to bustling as it is possible to get in an era of physical distancing. There are long queues for fish and chips and ice-cream. Families picnic on the sand, play football and fly kites. With pubs and amusement arcades still closed, people pay more attention to each other. The scene could come from a more innocent, bygone age. It seems that the lockdown, which started with fears of dystopia and social breakdown, appears to be ending here with people more closely bonded and appreciative of nature than before. The question now is how long that mood can last once capitalism revs up again.

However, this was overturned by the high court in 2017, in a judgment that described Javid’s decision as “a complete and unexplained volte face” from a previous favourable government assessment of the plans, and noted the inspector’s finding that there was a clear need for more housing in Newmarket.Hancock nevertheless wrote to Javid after that judgment, again urging that the development be halted. He also wrote to the then housing minister James Brokenshire in July 2018, stressing his opposition to the scheme. After another public inquiry last year, in which the inspector again approved the development, Hancock wrote to the current communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, in September, attaching the legal case made by the horse racing industry to oppose the scheme. On 12 March, however, Jenrick accepted the inspector’s recommendation and finally approved the development.Hancock has accepted donations, including some hospitality, from senior figures in the horse racing industry since he was first elected MP, including badges and car passes for Newmarket races in 2010 and 2011 valued at just under £800, and in July 2010, honorary membership of the prestigious Jockey Club Rooms, worth £1,356.In August 2012, Hancock, a keen rider himself, won an amateur race in Newmarket on Dick Doughtywylie, a horse then owned by Hood and trained by Gosden. Hood marshalled the opposition on behalf of the horse racing industry to the Hatchfield farm development via the Save Historic Newmarket group, which she founded. On her register of interests at West Suffolk council, Hood also declares membership of the Racehorse Owners Association, Thoroughbred Breeders Association and Jockey Club Rooms.A spokesman for Hancock said he stood by his interventions in opposition to the development, and pointed out that he also received financial donations from a racehorse owner, Bill Gredley, who supported the scheme. Gredley told the  he supported the scheme in a personal capacity, not representing the horse racing industry, because he felt “the people of Newmarket wanted some houses”. Tattersalls, also described in the high court judgment as having represented the horse racing industry at the planning inquiry, told the : “We have made donations either directly to our local MP or to the West Suffolk Conservative Association for the past 25 years … Our donations have never been related to any specific local issues, but have always reflected our support for our local MPs who we believe have historically represented the constituency extremely well.”Hood and Gosden did not respond to questions from the  about their donations to Hancock.Claire Unwin, who unsuccessfully opposed Hancock for Labour in December’s general election, said: “The Hatchfield farm plans had very strong support in the local community because there is a great need for more homes, and affordable housing, so that people don’t have to move out of Newmarket. Matt Hancock was acting against the wider interests of the community and solely on the side of the horse racing industry, whose elite have been making financial donations to him.”The spokesman for Hancock, who has pointed out that all his financial donations are properly declared, said: “Matt is grateful for the  highlighting how hard he campaigns for his constituency. He has opposed this development since before he was first elected MP. He is very grateful for all the support he receives from all quarters working hard for his constituency.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce56307494ed2b4dbc38958782639b0e95888e53/0_108_2831_1698/master/2831.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=3fdbf19c7b2eaff2a614b111a9952620","title":"pina bausch rite of spring dancing at dusk senegal african dance","story":"They flew to Senegal to create an electrifying version of the Pina Bausch classic with her son. Then coronavirus struck. Would they have time to dance the horrifying masterpiece for a film crew at sunset?Dresses rippling in the wind, sand beneath their feet, a sky fading to a heathery dusk as dancers sway and thrash to the urgent, ominous chords of Stravinsky’s music. This is Pina Bausch’s Rite of Spring as it’s never been seen before.Earlier this year, proving yet again that some remarkable moments can come out of global crisis, 38 dancers from 14 African countries gathered at the Ecole des Sables, a dance school an hour from the Senegalese capital, Dakar. They were there to recreate Bausch’s 1975 masterpiece, a reinterpretation of the infamous Ballets Russes work depicting the pagan ritual of a sacrificial maiden dancing herself to death.This new project – devised by Bausch’s son Salomon and Ecole des Sables’ director Germaine Acogny, known as the “mother of African contemporary dance” – hoped to bring a different energy to the 45-year-old dance work. Made with London’s Sadler’s Wells, it was to be premiered in Dakar on 25 March, before touring to Bausch’s home town of Wuppertal in Germany and London in April and May. But then coronavirus upturned all that.“It was a real shock,” says dancer Serge Arthur Dodo, speaking via translator over video from his home in Ivory Coast. “That morning we had our first complete run-through and it went well. The month and a half of hard work was paying off. We were performing in 10 days’ time so we were really excited when we all went for lunch. And then they made the announcement and all public gatherings and performances were forbidden. It was a total contrast to the emotions of the morning. It felt like everything was in slow motion.”In the background, however, things were on fast-forward as the show’s producers hastily remade their plans – including dealing with a shipping container full of peat that had just arrived at a nearby port as part of the set – and began trying to book everyone flights home before borders closed. This was made more difficult because the dancers’ passports were in Paris waiting for visas for the European tour three were unable to beat the clock and are still in Senegal.Six weeks earlier, the young company were strangers tackling a completely new way of moving. Now, as a group bonded over their “beautiful adventure”, as Togolese dancer Anique Ayiboe puts it, there was huge disappointment. Then Salomon Bausch proposed a final run-through on the beach, which was captured by a documentary film crew who were following the dancers.Performing on sand had its own challenges. “It was really stressful trying to do these movements,” says Ayiboe, who danced the role of the Chosen One. “But once the music started and the girls started to enter the stage, we just went for it.” Dodo adds: “There was this last push of doing it all together.” It’s certainly an atmospheric setting, the ruffling wind and vast sky adding to the elemental character of the piece, humans at the mercy of nature. The moment brings some intense performances from the dancers.Dodo admits they didn’t really grasp the enormity of the situation immediately. There was still a birthday party planned for that night, and a trip to the swimming pool the next day. But, amid their farewell celebrations, they performed their own rituals that recognised the gravity of their circumstances. “We made a massive fire and gathered around it and prayed,” says Dodo, “for the health of everybody on the team, for us to come back together and for the world as a whole. And the day after, we sacrificed a sheep and it was a moment to pray and eat and share the meat. That moment around the fire was a very strong moment.” Ayiboe calls it “an exceptional response to this very exceptional situation”.“The way I see it,” adds Dodo, “it’s not about doing something, but living it. So when we’re performing that piece, we’re not pretending. We’re living our traditions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4899c5f4db7191fdfbc80c40b197ac92aa66a529/185_175_2510_1506/master/2510.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7815603a448bef0f903932580d8b041e","title":"apple ios 14 new features coming to ipad and iphone","story":"Firm announces latest innovations including for iPad and watch at US conferenceApple has announced the latest features heading to user iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches this summer.At the firm’s first virtual World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple showed off iOS 14, iPadOS 14 and watch OS 7, due to be released later this year as free updates.Last year’s iOS 13 introduced changes centred around privacy and speed, plus Dark Mode, but also came packed with bugs requiring a series of updates to fix various issues.This year Apple is concentrating customisation options to iOS 14. For the first time users will be able to view all their installed apps in a list view called App Library, similar to that available on most Android smartphones, which automatically sorts apps into large category folders or a searchable list. Users can also hide apps from the rest of the home screens by hiding pages.Apple is also adding widgets to the main home screen, which sit between app icons, including one that automatically selects time-dependent information called smartstack. Siri has been brought directly to the home screen as a pop-up overlay, rather than its own page that takes over the screen.Alongside offline, on-device voice transcription for dictation, Apple is also launching the Translate app, which is a direct competitor to Google’s Translate, capable of translating speech and text offline in 11 languages.Apple has also made tweaks to iMessage, with pinned messages, WhatsApp-like @-mentions and improvements to groups. Apple’s vastly improved Maps are also expanding to the UK, Ireland and Canada, with new cycling routes, new electric vehicle directions with charging information and saveable exploration guides.Apple is also looking to turn the iPhone into a car key with its new contactless CarKey feature that allows your iPhone to unlock a car using NFC. The feature is rolling out to both iOS 13 and the new iOS 14. The 2021 BMW 5 series will be the first car to support it.A new feature for the App Store called App Clips allows you to access some functions of an app that may be needed to access a service, without downloading the full app.Apple is also bringing more awareness of privacy to the App Store with privacy practices displayed from apps, covering what data they collect and which companies it is shared with, before you download them. It is also allowing users to share their approximate rather than exact location with apps and ensuring they ask before tracking you.Having gained full trackpad and mouse support in iPad OS 13.4, Apple’s iPad software is gaining the new features from iOS 14, including customised default apps, which will make the iPad even more like a laptop computer.New for iPad OS 14 is the introduction of sidebars to most first-party apps, and the addition of toolbars similar to desktops apps with drop-down menu actions. Universal Search has been revamped to more resemble the way Spotlight search works on a Mac, with a pop up that can be invoked over any app.The new Scribble feature allows you to to turn handwriting into text in any field, and select and move handwriting in notes, using the Apple Pencil stylus and on-device machine learning.Apple’s smartwatch continues to dominate the watch market. It’s watch OS software is gaining more customisation in the form of new rich complications and new watch faces, including the new Infograph face with a tachometer and the ability to share your customised face combinations to friends and family or download them from a site or app.The Workout app has also been redesigned and renamed Fitness, which better shows your current trends on the iPhone from the Apple Watch. The Apple Watch will also be able to finally track your sleep, matching offerings from Samsung, Garmin and others. Wind Down will attempt to help you sleep by reducing distractions on your iPhone and Watch, while new alarms including silent alarms can wake you in the morning.The Apple Watch will also automatically detect hand washing, using motion and sound, and then sets a countdown timer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f8cace822a729ea74f6f4ccfdb89f616cc32dab/235_226_4235_2541/master/4235.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f113b94b7bbf7813a58c7c3657e1313","title":"10 best books set in ireland sally rooney edan obrien colm toibin","story":"Explore Ireland’s history and culture through these tales of loss and love by Sally Rooney, Edna O’Brien, Colm Tóibín and more• Share your own suggestions in the comments belowI was born in Toronto and moved to Ireland as a boy, where I spent some formative years in a planned, Khrushchevian-style satellite town in south County Clare. Settlers arrived in waves from Belfast, London, New York or further afield – from cities throughout Chile and South Africa. In this multicultural outpost, populated by residential tourists, we became wry observers of traditional nuances. For me, Ireland’s political, historical and cultural landscapes were first properly discovered in the country’s literature. The greats, such as Wilde, Yeats and Joyce, offered signposts to the past while more contemporary writers, including Roddy Doyle, Flann O’Brien and Jamie O’Neill, shone a light on lesser-heard Irish voices. And so my selection of novels echoes Ireland’s literary journey from pre-famine to the present day.“The famine funerals, then, the women wailing, their thin screeching piercing the sky”The second novel in Walter Macken’s sweeping trilogy was published in 1962 and captures the harrowing decades in the lead up to the 1847 famine. At the start of the novel Dualta Duane’s life changes for the worse after a chance encounter with the son of a landowner. It is set in a time when Catholics still bore the scars of the last blight and eked out a bare existence working farms while paying exorbitant rents and tithes to corrupt landlords who relished a violent eviction. Dualta is the voice of these silent people. The sparkling waters of the Atlantic, stone cottages burrowed into the landscape and blue turf smoke keep his spirit alive as he journeys south along Ireland’s west coast to meet “The Liberator” Daniel O’Connell, before Black 1847 devours the county’s population.“The day was blue and brilliant, the beating sun making a mockery of the sea of dark clothes worn by the mourners”Sometimes death can make a cheerful appearance, as is the case in Deirdre Purcell’s 1993 novel about repression and isolation. With the windswept beauty of West Cork’s Beara peninsula as a backdrop, the protagonist, Elizabeth Sullivan, falls as hard for the ocean-sculpted landscape as she does for the young dancer – Daniel McCarthy. Despite a loveless marriage and unwanted pregnancy in 1930s Ireland – when most unmarried mothers were shipped to the Magdalene Laundries – happiness is discovered in the mucky paddocks beneath the shadow of a mountain. The novel was written shortly before we got to see the full horror the high walls of the Magdalene Laundries and Industrial Schools had been hiding.“The rain drove us into the church – our refuge, our strength, our only dry place”Limerick’s Georgian avenues and compact medieval quarter have finally emerged from the cloudy streetscape of Frank McCourt’s poverty stricken 1930s childhood to become a vibrant destination. This moving memoir and tribute to his mother, Angela, published in 1996, laid bare his bid for survival in tenement conditions on the fringes of Limerick’s society, and earned him a Pulitzer prize. Unknown to the young McCourt, across town future Hollywood legend Richard Harris and Terry Wogan were growing up in different circumstances, without the rainy-day backstory of death, near starvation and destitution. Head to O’Connell Avenue to South’s Bar and see where Frank’s father drank away their family’s meagre earnings.“At the far edge of the lake there was a belt of poplar trees, shutting out the world”The ground-breaking 1960 novel by County Clare author Edna O’Brien gave a voice to Irish women’s liberation, and the ensuing parochial outrage and censorship on its publication guaranteed its enduring success. This first book in the trilogy traces the lives of young Cait Brady and Baba Brennan, from their drab, cloistered life in County Limerick to the bright lights of Dublin. Scaling the pages were older men, like the predatory Mister Gentleman, who used the country girls’ bid for emancipation to exploit their vulnerability. The book incensed the country’s power houses at the time – church and state – who struggled to grasp the concept that women may want more from life than domestic servitude.“There was a vague mist that masked the line between the horizon and the sky”Colm Tóibin’s Costa Award-winning novel, published in 2009, is the story of the immigrant, transformed by the loneliness and freedom of her journey. Eilis Lacey returns home to Ireland in the 1950s and her married life in New York becomes obscured in a haze across the ocean. She adapts to the old familiar pace of life in County Wexford and begins to see handsome Jim Farrell with fresh eyes. However, Brooklyn eventually finds her in the cosy Irish coastal cocoon and she has to make a difficult choice between her two different worlds.“It was getting dark now, though the afterglow lingered over the western Atlantic a sky too big for the sun to leave”Man Booker prize-winner Anne Enright sets her softly lyrical novel at the tail end of Ireland’s Celtic Tiger economy. Rosaleen Madigan is entering her twilight years at her homestead by an old famine (green) road on the Burren Park’s ocean-ridged limestone landscape in County Clare. Rosaleen’s four children return to spend one last Christmas together, and the intricate backstories of their scarred lives unfold in the first half of this 2015 novel. Hanna is an alcoholic in Dublin, Dan is living with his boyfriend in Toronto, Emmet drifts through Mali and Constance stays close to home. Personalities clash over Christmas, before Rosaleen wanders into the darkness to escape the drama.“The colour of the streets always seemed drained and muted as if the colours, too, had been blown away”Two tales of the same city sharply conveyed by unlikely working-class friends: one a toughly veneered Catholic, the other a capitalist Protestant. The Belfast setting for this novel, published in 1996, straddles the months before and after the 1994 IRA ceasefire. The often-humorous take on the slowly retreating shadow of the troubles graphically depicts the violence of a fractured Belfast, as the protagonists try to normalise their lives in the chaos and prejudice. One chapter lulls the reader into a soft, harmonious take on the city and it’s followed by another, which blows apart the setting with the bombing of a sandwich shop. The two friends’ tangled lives are told in fast-paced prose and peppered with satire, a foreshadowing of the author’s future role at Charlie Hebdo.“Things you were sure you’d have in the future turn out to be on the far side of a big, dark mountain”Donal Ryan spins a Booker-prize longlisted yarn set in the lush Tipperary countryside, a place where looming hillsides and wide lakes block escape paths to mental and physical liberty. Mourning mother Bridie sits with her back to the River Shannon to block neighbouring County Clare where her child died, while Vasya concedes that he will drown if he tries to swim across Lough Derg. They are just two of 21 desolate voices marooned by circumstance in his novel, published in 2012. It’s set at a time when Ireland was haunted by ghost estates and zombie hotels as reckless bank lending destroyed the Irish economy and normal people were left to rebuild lives from the carnage.“Dublin is extraordinarily beautiful to her in wet weather, the way grey stone darkens to black”Published in 2018 and longlisted for a Booker prize in the same year, Sally Rooney’s tale of fractured hearts and minds crosses class structure and Ireland from the west coast to Dublin – and appeared on Barack Obama’s top 19 book list for 2019. It traces the fragile relationship between a popular high-school student, Connell, and marginalised Marianne, through their reversal of fortunes when she becomes Dublin’s Trinity College cool girl and he loses his way in the bigness of life there. The book’s small-screen production dominated ratings and press coverage throughout the Covid-19 lockdown, as did Connell’s short shorts, necklace and prolonged nudity. Onscreen, Tobercurry and Streedagh Strand in Sligo played the novel’s fictional town of Carricklea.“Henceforth I would have to address things as they are, not as I might imagine them, for this was a new version of reality”John Banville’s 2005 Man Booker prize-winning novel depicts art historian, Max Morden, as a man all at sea, trying to navigate his way through the turbulence of loss and sorrow. He returns to County Wexford, where he spent summer holidays as a child. You can almost taste the salty air and feel the gentle breeze burn tender skin as the prose ebbs and flows between the past and the present, in this timeless, meditative, disquieting masterpiece."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bf71a3f9cbdb523babcbf5cc8a475bd4522914f/47_0_1920_1153/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e52d1d562529f713950733f6fbc92cd","title":"return to camping the quiet site lake district","story":"Confirmation that campsites can open on 4 July has prompted a rush of bookings. For one award-winning eco holiday park in the Lake District, the phone hasn’t stopped ringing...‘The phone started ringing even before he’d finished talking,” says Daniel Holder, referring to Tuesday’s announcement by Boris Johnson that campsites and hotels are allowed to reopen on 4 July. Four of the 12 people employed by Holder, managing director of The Quiet Site, an ultra-green holiday park in Ullswater, Cumbria, were poised to speak to people eager to book a stay at the site. At the same time, Holder was replying as fast as possible to a flood of emails. “We had 206 in the first hour.”It doesn’t surprise me that people are so keen to visit. The Quiet Site is an exceptional place. In April it became the first holiday park in the country to win a Queen’s Award for Enterprise. And the campsite’s post-lockdown credentials are impeccable. With its Hobbit Holes, pods and generously-sized pitches spread out over the large site, social distancing should be easy. Its location on a rural hillside also means visitors are far from the pell-mell of urban life of any sort. And if the enforced isolation has left you starved of soul-easing views, you won’t even have to leave your tent to drink them in. I stayed there last autumn and even though my visit coincided with rather iffy weather, I still had a cracking time.The Quiet Site is high above Ullswater, sheltered by the perfect dome of Little Mell Fell. As well as pitches for tents and campervans, it also has pods (designed by Kendal’s Ian Bone, whose classic “upturned boat” shape you see in many places now), and 15 partially subterranean mega-pods that are as snug as their name suggests.Not one to do things by halves, Holder’s installation of solar panels, extreme insulation and a biomass boiler fired by locally-sourced woodchips has made the site not merely carbon neutral but carbon positive. But if you’re thinking “hairshirt”, think again. My Hobbit Hole came with thermostat-controlled underfloor heating beneath its stone flags. There’s also a microwave, fridge, kettle and a spacious loo.“We want it to be a progressive opening. It wouldn’t be right for our staff or locals if we were full immediately but we will start slowly and build on it as and when we can,” says Holder.When I arrived last year, I did so on a pleasant mostly back-lane cycle from Penrith station. Once I’d settled in and put the kettle on, I sat outside in one of the old school deckchairs, sheltered beneath my new dwelling’s ample awning, and gazed idly out. Beyond a billowing tent and a thicket of trees I spied silvery fragments of Ullswater beneath the broad green brushstroke of Barton Fell. From somewhere behind me, a rook rattled out a throaty cheer.The next day it rained. Undaunted, I ventured out along a section of the Ullswater Way, a 20-mile waymarked footpath. My four-mile walk from the campsite – over the exposed Gowbarrow Fell and down to the waterfalls of Aira Force – was somewhat damp, but the rain did at least ensure that the waterfalls plunged with enough drama to justify the sousing.Helvellyn, that mighty warrior among Cumbrian fells, had burrowed itself away into the clouds and the gusting winds were so ferocious that the Ullswater steamers that ply the mere had been cancelled. I was thankful for a cosy dinner at the award-winning Another Place, a lakeside hotel and restaurant in nearby Watermillock, where I wolfed down a warming coconut katsu with tofu.The next day, armed with a map of the 1618-hectare Lowther estate’s cycle trails, which opened in 2019, I took my electric bicycle to a castle bathed in sunshine.“We’ll have a whip around Askham Fell and take in a couple of neolithic burial chambers and a stone circle.”It’s the kind of sentence I like to hear: full of outdoorsy, nosing-about-in-history promise. It was spoken by Alex, a whip-thin bicycle tour guide. I couldn’t help feeling it was cheating – the fact I’d hired an electric mountain bike for the day – but it did rather take the sting out of the Lake District’s vertiginous inclines. It also meant I could take advantage of the maze of stony, grassy and, at times, gloriously boggy bridleways on the fells and a new network of waymarked cycle trails on the Lowther Castle estate.The greater part of the 1st Earl of Lonsdale’s grand Georgian mansion is a shell. It is the magnificent 52-hectare gardens that are the castle’s glory. At lunch, I headed for Askham Hall’s Kitchen Garden Cafe, a five-minute woodland ride away. I had a tasty artichoke, olive and homemade-pesto pizza from an outdoor wood-fired oven and then wandered about Lowther’s modern parterre – created by rockstar garden designer Dan Pearson.Back at base, I had breakfast served to me by The Quiet Site’s Spicy Sausage food van and dropped in at the excellent on-site zero-waste shop. There I borrowed some washed-up containers and filled them with popping corn and sugar in preparation for a late-night treat, adding rather healthier muesli for the morning. Since my stay the van has gone but the zero-waste shop has been open for locals throughout lockdown.Undoubtedly the most surprising thing about The Quiet Site is its bar. Yes, I know: campsite bars are where dreams go to die. As I entered The Quiet Bar, my expectation meter was showing high levels of trepidation. What I found was a traditional 17th-century Cumbrian Long Barn converted in the 1960s and lit by fairy lights wrapped around beams, making it positively murky … but in a good way. A couple of rustic wooden galleries were filled with extra settees and old church pews. They were needed, too: despite it being a damp Tuesday night the bar was buzzing. Happily, it reopens on 4 July – it will be seating only and table service but the beer will be just as good.I sampled a draught Ullswater Blonde, the local Tirril brewery’s very more-ish pale best bitter, and watched that night’s billed entertainment: a very young man in black tie shimmying from table to table doing polished little magic tricks as if we were in Vegas. To top it off, the bar staff had a simple but brilliant music policy: if David Bowie didn’t sing it, they didn’t play it.

His press secretary had later said the remarks were “in jest” but the president stood by them on Tuesday, telling reporters that the comments weren’t a joke.Speaking to a congressional committee hours later, however, Dr Anthony Fauci said: “I know for sure that to my knowledge none of us have ever been told to slow down on testing. That just is a fact. In fact, we will be doing more testing.”Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, spoke to the committee alongside the heads of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and a top official at the Department of Health and Human Services.About 2.3 million Americans have been sickened in the pandemic, and some 120,000 have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Fauci last testified before Congress in May, when states were still mostly shut down. Since then staggered re-openings have taken place across the country, and several states are seeing a concerning increase in cases.He said the state of coronavirus in the US was overall a “mixed bag,” in part because of the country’s huge size and ersity.He said some areas, such as New York City, had done well to rein in cases by following the government’s guidelines for re-opening, but said the “disturbing surge” in infections in other parts of the country was very concerning.“The next couple of weeks are going to be critical to address those surges we’re seeing,” Fauci said, specifically citing the increase in cases in Florida, Arizona and Texas.He was joined by House Energy and Commerce Committee by CDC director Dr Robert Redfield, FDA chief Dr Stephen Hahn and the head of the US Public Health Service, Admiral Brett Giroir.The concerns shared by top health leaders at the hearing contradicted Trump’s continued efforts to downplay the affects of Covid-19.At least eight Trump campaign staffers tested positive for Covid-19 in Tulsa, where Trump told a campaign rally that he had asked administration officials to slow down testing, because too many positive cases are turning up.After administration figures including White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany suggested the comments weren’t serious or were a joke, Trump on Tuesday said: “I never kid.”“Testing is a double-edged sword,” Trump told reporters. “One way, it shows you have cases and in another way you find out where the cases are and you do a good job.”When asked inidually at the congressional hearing if the president had asked the US health leaders to slow down testing, they all responded “no.”At the time of the May hearing, Fauci was one of many speakers to testify from a video feed at home. This time, the speakers were in person for this hearing, though most congressional representatives relied on video feeds to ask questions.In the chamber, the men sat with tubs of disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer pumps next to their nameplates. While committee members and speakers are usually packed tight, people sat at a distance, wearings masks which they removed to speak.Fauci told the committee he was “cautiously optimistic” that a vaccine would be ready at the end of the year or early 2021. He said phase three of vaccine testing is to begin next month.The group also expressed concern about what could happen if coronavirus cases are still high when flu season arrives in the autumn.In a prepared statement, the experts said such a collision could again burden the country’s healthcare system.“If there is Covid-19 and flu activity at the same time, this could place a tremendous burden on the healthcare system related to bed occupancy, laboratory testing needs, personal protective equipment and healthcare worker safety,” the statement said.There is still no vaccine for Covid-19, and there are no treatments specifically developed for the disease, although the antiviral drug remdesivir has been shown to help some patients, as well as a steroid called dexamethasone, and plasma from patients who have recovered.Fauci remains optimistic that a vaccine will be found, noting that patients develop antibodies to the virus – a sign that the human immune system is able to battle back. However, he shies away from promising results by the end of the year, as Trump has done.The energy and commerce panel has oversight over drugs and vaccines, among other facets of the US healthcare system. Committee Democrats have been harshly critical of the administration.However, not all Republicans have lined up to defend the White House. Some GOP members were growing concerned early in the year that the administration wasn’t doing enough to prepare.Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ed433391d3489f33e6539028f7be0e5744007bd/252_334_4362_2618/master/4362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e89eedd48495f19746f1503ba926a294","title":"big tobacco wants our youths lungs rise of smoking in jordan","story":"Despite one of the world’s highest smoking rates, many politicians believe a ban will affect the economyby  Michael Safi and Jassar Al-Tahat in AmmanWhen patients quit cigarettes at the King Hussein Cancer Center’s smoking clinic they are asked to be patient with their children. Often their offspring have been exposed to so much secondhand smoke that they have become addicted, too.“For every four cigarettes their parent has smoked, the child has smoked one,” says Firas al-Hawari, a physician who directs the clinic. “We can control the parents with medication, but the kids are going through withdrawals because we don’t have them on medication.”Figures published by the  on Tuesday show that the Middle Eastern kingdom of Jordan has surpassed Indonesia to have the highest smoking rates in the world. Including e-cigarettes and other “smokeless” products, more than eight in 10 Jordanian men are nicotine users, according to a 2019 national survey carried out in collaboration with the World Health Organization.Jordanian men who smoke daily consume an average of 23 cigarettes a day, the survey found. “In Jordan we consider someone who smokes a pack a day to be a light smoker,” Hawari says. “We have people who smoke three, five, seven packs a day. It is like it was in the 1950s or 1960s in other places.”The proliferation of tobacco is obvious on a summer night in the country’s capital, Amman. Thick smoke wafts from water pipes and cigarettes in the courtyards of cafes and restaurants that have recently emerged from the country’s stringent coronavirus lockdown. Officials nonchalantly smoke in government offices, many of which are fitted with no-smoking signs. Even hospitals struggle to enforce bans in a country where more than a third of doctors are smokers, according to a 2013 survey.Jordanians with conditions such as asthma can end up planning their lives around avoiding smoke. “They smoked all the time: at their desks, in the hallways, in the bathroom,” says Ruba Madhadha of her colleagues at the government agency where she worked. “I used to run away to my car to do emails, just to keep doing my job.”For a few months she used steroid inhalers to manage her condition, but she finally had to leave the office in January. Smoking was officially banned in the building, she says. “But nobody does anything – no fines, no punishment.”The impacts of so much smoking are already stark: tobacco use is linked to one in eight deaths in the country, compared with one in 10 deaths worldwide, and costs Jordan’s GDP an estimated three times the global average.But Hawari say the true scale of the problem will be known in about 2030, when a bulk of the country’s disproportionately young population reaches 40 – the age at which tobacco-related illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, start to manifest. “It’s going to cause an enormous surge in non-communicable diseases that we won’t be able to handle,” he says.Surveys show tobacco use is still growing, on the back of a rise in women taking up the habit and the popularity of water pipes, which doctors say can be equivalent to consuming approximately three packs of cigarettes over a 45-minute session.The emergence of e-cigarettes, marketed as a tool to help people stop smoking, have so far led to more people using nicotine overall than quitting cigarettes, according to the 2019 nationalWHO statistics.Smoking used to be endemic in wealthier countries such as the US, Australia and many in Europe. But decades of aggressive public health campaigns and restrictions on the ability of tobacco companies to advertise and lobby have succeeded in dramatically cutting their smoking rates.Many of those corporate tactics have now migrated to countries in the Middle East and Africa, where regulations are more lax and poorly enforced, suggests Raouf Alebshehy, a monitoring coordinator in the tobacco control research group at the University of Bath. The majority of the world’s smokers now live in middle- and lower-income countries.Analysts suspect smoking rates may be just as high in countries such as Iraq, Lebanon and Syria – Jordan is just advanced and stable enough to be able to measure its problem.“What makes the Middle East region special in terms of its smoking rates?” Alebshehy says. “It isn’t lack of information. It’s a closed case that tobacco is harmful. One of the important factors we have found in this region is that the multinational companies started to invest and expand here. They started to shift work from developed markets to emerging markets here and in Africa where tobacco demand is still growing, and they bought up local manufacturers.”Jordan has the most tobacco company interference in policymaking in the world after Japan, according to a 2019 analysis by a civil society group. “Big tobacco is preying on our countries, wanting to really own the lungs of our youth,” says Princess Dina Mired, the president of the Union for International Cancer Control and a member of the country’s royal family. “And they are doing so successfully.”Many in government do not see a problem. Smoking is not even banned in the Jordanian parliament. When lawmakers tried to do so in 2004, a report in the Jordan Times says they had to reverse the decision as meetings started losing quorum because too many MPs were outside have a cigarette.“Members of parliament tell me: ‘This is an economic matter, you are affecting the Jordanian economy and threatening the jobs of people working in the industry’,” says Mervat Mheerat, the deputy manager for health in Greater Amman Municipality. “They correlate tobacco with the economy. And that’s the message they get from the tobacco industry.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86466843d6e17a6413acb5810de4564f3071126d/0_335_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77c90387bde1d3bd9bb5fdf5dce73e21","title":"easing of lockdown rules in england whats reopening on 4 july","story":"How PM’s latest announcement affects pubs and restaurants, hairdressers and galleriesThe government’s lockdown rules to control coronavirus are easing on 4 July in England to allow many more businesses, as well as leisure facilities, to reopen, with other measures also relaxed.A new “1-metre-plus” concept has been introduced. This means it is now possible to be 1 metre away from someone outside your household instead of 2 metres, so long as there is another mitigating factor in place, such as a screen or face-covering, or hand-washing facilities. The changes also allow one household of up to six people to spend time with another household indoors, including staying the night, but they should remain physically distant. Pubs and restaurants in England can reopen both outdoors and indoors in what the government calls a “covid-secure way” with more hand-washing, ventilation and table service indoors, rather than customers standing at a shared bar. People may be asked to give their names but pub landlords will not check the exact makeup of an inidual household that comes into the venue or request to see identification. They will not be asked to wear face-coverings. A household will be able to meet with one other household at a time in a pub or restaurant, then choose another household on another occasion. Nightclubs will not yet be reopening, nor will casinos, and the government has said there will be taskforces to ensure more businesses can open as quickly as possible.Hotels, bed and breakfasts, holiday homes and campsites and caravan parks and boarding houses will be able to reopen. Campsites will be given guidance on how to be “covid-secure” in shared areas such as shower, toilet and washing-up facilities. Work remains to be done on how hostels, where there are shared sleeping spaces, can reopen safely and they will not be ready for 4 July.Instead of keeping a distance of 2 metres from other passengers, it will be possible to travel 1 metre apart so long as another mitigating factor is in place, such as a face-coverings which are mandatory. This will help more people get on to trains, buses and trams.They will be able to reopen but not for live performances, as the government say they want to protect the health of performers. They could show previous work on a screen. Cafes, bars and restaurants associated with the venue would be able to reopen, however. Museums and galleries can also reopen. Concerts and outdoor music festivals will not be permitted as mass gatherings are still banned.Gyms, indoor studios, indoor sports facilities, swimming pools and water parks will not be reopening yet but outdoor gyms in parks – many of which have been taped up by councils since March – will be. Popular events such as park runs, and large running groups, are not due to make a comeback just yet as they are classed as a mass gathering. The reason gym-like venues are remaining closed for now is the level of breathing involved, which is a risk factor in the virus’ spread.These have been open for private prayer since 13 June but the changes mean more of the congregation can attend so long as the building’s staff follow guidance on how to control the virus. Singing will be banned, so there could be a Sunday church service but held without the hymns.Weddings can be held as places of worship reopen. However, after the service the couple will only be able to go to a hospitality venue with one other household – making any celebration small-scale and forcing couples to chose between different sides of a family. At the moment, the maximum number of people from one household that can mix with another household in an indoor venue is six.Hairdressers and barbers can open and have been booking in clients for a number of weeks anticipating the change. Nail bars, massage and tattoo parlours will not be reopening because of concerns about the risk of transmission. However, the government says it hopes to get them reopened within weeks and that they are working closely with the sector on how this could be possible.Funfairs, theme parks, adventure parks, amusement arcades, model villages, aquariums, wildlife centres, zoos and safari parks can all reopen on 4 July, which will give families far more scope for days out. However, bowling alleys, indoor skating, indoor play areas including soft play will not be reopening for now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2b8a00fc252c05d3f129138cd8b84a3f74f191b/0_48_3877_2326/master/3877.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=380628ca36d9f16fc1d354ab33a68288","title":"easing several lockdown rules at once could boost virus say uk scientists","story":"Sage advisers warn of risks of halving 2-metre rule while reopening venues in England The easing of multiple lockdown measures in England at once risks Covid-19 gaining a fresh foothold, scientists advising the government have warned.They raised concerns over the halving of the 2-metre physical distancing rule at the same time as reopening venues, saying the country was currently experiencing up to 4,300 Covid-19 infections a day and had no effective digital track-and-trace system, while highlighting research that showed transmission of the virus was more likely to happen indoors.R, or the \u0027effective reproduction number\u0027, is a way of rating a disease’s ability to spread. It’s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out – eventually.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 – higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus people\u0027s behaviour, such as social distancing\u0026nbspand a population’s immunity. A country may see regional variations in its R number, depending on local factors like population density and transport patterns.On Monday, it was announced that millions of people with underlying health issues would be permitted to leave their homes and mix with groups from 6 July, for the first time in three months.On Tuesday Boris Johnson gave venues from museums to pubs to hairdressers the green light to reopen from 4 July, halved physical distancing from 2 metres to 1 metre and said two households could meet up indoors, both also from 4 July.Acknowledging the relief many would feel – the  headline on Tuesday was “Freedom pass for millions” – Johnson called it the end of a “long national hibernation”. However, scientists made clear that it came with risk.Prof John Edmunds, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said: “The social distancing rules that have been in place since March have had two effects: first, the number of contacts that we make has been drastically reduced and second the nature of these contacts has also become safer, as we seldom meet inside and we have been maintaining 2 metres of distance wherever possible.“Relaxing the 2-metre rule at the same time as opening bars and restaurants does run the risk of allowing the epidemic to start to regain a foothold. These changes will have to be very carefully monitored and the NHS track-and-trace system will have to be working properly to help keep us safe.”She said that while the government was entitled to make a political decision – as Downing Street has indicated it has – it was important to be fully transparent, so the public could fully understand the risks and see whose advice it was relying on.Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures, published on Tuesday, showed that the latest weekly number of deaths from Covid-19 in England and Wales was 1,114, the lowest since 27 March, shortly after the imposition of the full lockdown on 23 March. On Monday, the official tally of UK deaths from Covid-19 was 15, the lowest number since 15 March.The latest ONS infection statistics show that approximately one in 1,700 people in a community setting in England (not in a hospital, care home or similar) had Covid-19 at any given time between 31 May and 13 June. This compares with one in 400 between 3 May and 16 May.But there have been concerns that the R value, showing the transmission rate, has been rising and is close to – or even above (different studies vary) – 1 in certain regions, which could lead to an exponential increase in cases.Rowland Kao, professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh and not affiliated to Sage, said: “If the current R – bearing in mind there is a lag – is about 1, and the pre-lockdown R was around 3 to 4, then the difference, of about 2 to 3, is made up by things that we aren’t doing that we were doing before (at least so long as the number of people who are immune is relatively few).“As we move through the gears of releasing lockdown we will ‘recover’ some of those missing events. The important thing is that we do so in a way that the change isn’t too sudden. Of course things like face masks will likely help to keep it down – but we don’t yet know how much.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d4915a3dee212dea49443ffbb8f459e9f1d21d8/0_121_3872_2324/master/3872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe373a6a4129375e99664845604728b3","title":"jordan smoking rates highest in world amid claims of big tobacco interference","story":"‘Big tobacco wants our youth’s lungs’: rise of smoking in JordanSmoking rates in the Middle East kingdom of Jordan have become the highest in the world amid what public health advocates say is widespread interference in policy-making by multinational tobacco companies.More than eight out of 10 Jordanian men smoke or regularly use nicotine products including e-cigarettes, according to a government study carried out in 2019 in collaboration with the World Health Organization. Jordanian men who smoke daily consume an average of 23 cigarettes a day, the survey found.“The rates are dangerously high and a predictor of a future public health catastrophe,” said Firas al-Hawari, a physician and head of the cancer-control office at Amman’s King Hussein Cancer Center.The Jordanian figures contrast with those in Europe, the US and Australia, where smoking has been drastically reduced over the past three decades with the introduction of limits on tobacco companies’ power to lobby and advertise, as well as through awareness campaigns about the dangers of smoking.Industry analysts and public health advocates said Jordan’s rates were exacerbated by the influence of big tobacco, which they said was allowed to operate with comparatively fewer restraints than in the UK – as is the case in many of the lower- and middle-income countries where the majority of the world’s smokers now live.“These companies continue to exercise as much political power as they can in wealthy countries, but they’re more successful in lower-income countries where they face less transparency, can operate more in the dark and overwhelm whatever civic societies exist,” said Rima Nakkash, an associate professor of public health at the American University of Beirut.A  investigation of tobacco industry conduct in Jordan has found:Tobacco company lobbyists have been accused of inappropriate involvement in shaping regulations on their products in Jordan. Meeting minutes seen by the  show that lobbyists from BAT, Japan Tobacco International (JTI) and PMI attended a series of meetings last year to discuss standards for e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products.Among the standards being decided were nicotine content, the size and composition of health warnings, the graphics and colours permitted on the packages, and whether the products could be labelled as less harmful than cigarettes or as an aid to quit smoking.“The tobacco companies actually sat at the table right across from us,” said Princess Dina Mired, a member of Jordan’s royal family, who attended the meetings in her capacity as the president of the Union for International Cancer Control. “They argued against every single standard.”The tobacco companies supported the adoption of regulation comparable to EU directives, according to meeting minutes, while anti-smoking campaigners said they were pushing for more restrictive standards on the products.Jordan is a signatory to an international tobacco-control treaty that obliges countries to protect their public health laws from tobacco company interference. A civil society group that monitors compliance with the treaty argues that the tobacco companies’ involvement in regulatory meetings in Jordan is an example of lobbying that is contrary to the agreement.PMI and JTI said in statements to the  that it was normal and lawful for their companies to be consulted as stakeholders when relevant regulatory issues were being debated.“Our interactions with government officials in Jordan – like elsewhere – comply with all applicable laws,” PMI said. “In addition, we abide to our own international standards and practices which are stricter than many national laws. In any democratic society, the central objective of regulatory policy – ensuring that regulations are designed and implemented in the public interest – can only be achieved with full participation of those concerned.”JTI said its involvement in the meetings on e-cigarettes and heated tobacco was about providing assistance on technical and industrial standards.Mired said she felt that few of the public health advocates’ concerns were heeded by the committee, which was made up of various ministries and the chambers of commerce and industry. “We failed miserably. They didn’t take a single recommendation from us,” she said.Several former and current government officers said big tobacco had strong relationships with Jordanian MPs and officials, who are not obliged to declare their contact with the industry.Mervat Mheerat, the deputy health manager at the Greater Amman municipality, told the  she was visited by a regional manager for a multinational tobacco company while she sat on a government committee that oversaw how tobacco products were displayed at supermarkets. “I was shocked when the regional manager came to me, and knew what I was saying in the meetings,” she said.Mheerat said she was asked to be “neutral” on some of the issues being discussed in the meeting, and was offered a donation of up to 1m dinars (£1.15m) for anti-smoking campaigns in the city, in what she felt was an exchange.“They approach each person in the style they like,” she said. “So for me, they know I am passionate about promoting health and raising awareness of the dangers of smoking. So they came and said: ‘Let us find some money for your campaign.’”Apparent conflicts of interest go to the heart of Jordan’s anti-smoking lobby. Emails seen by the  show a senior member of a major public health group recused themselves from anti-smoking work after a family member became employed as a lobbyist for a multinational tobacco giant.Company filings show big tobacco spends hundreds of thousands of US dollars in Jordan on sponsorship, including of many programmes aimed at young people. In one example, Philip Morris paid to refurbish 10 schools in the Amman neighbourhood where its factory is located, and provided children in 25 schools with bags and stationery.Philip Morris has also run careers training programmes, which were widely covered in local media and lauded at events attended by government ministers, local officials and senior police.Public health advocates argue such contributions launder the adverse health and economic impacts of the industry’s products. JTI said in a statement that its corporate social responsibility work strictly adhered to local and international laws and policies and that none of its programmes involved minors.PMI said its factory was located in an underprivileged area “where the local community has often requested much needed in-kind support and aid”. “It is saddening that even actions to improve the living conditions of people around our factory might be seen as a reason to attack us,” the company said.This message has been broadcast directly from government social media channels. “Philip Morris is the largest American investment in Jordan,” the company’s then general manager for the region, Fadi Maayta, said in a video posted by the prime minister’s office last year. “We are the second-biggest taxpayer in Jordan.”PMI said the video was one of several short interviews with local business leaders that featured on government social media.Research funded by the UK government has found that smoking costs Jordan £1.85bn a year in healthcare and loss of productivity, the highest per capita figure in the world, outweighing the approximately £1.03bn the industry pays in taxes, fees and wages to local workers.A Jordanian government source authorised to comment said tobacco companies did not receive special treatment compared with other industries and that anti-smoking awareness campaigns were continuing to try to change people’s behaviour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39ae5e66432f009630410252b8832e92ab20d983/220_540_4451_2671/master/4451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6370f4df7abc85f6c8675282f233f7df","title":"shielding in england how do you feel about coming out of lockdown","story":"Lockdown restrictions are to be eased from 6 July and we want to hear how you feel about itFrom 6 July, people in England with underlying health issues who have been shielding since March will be allowed to leave their homes.They will be able to meet up outside in groups of up to six people from different households, provided they keep 2 metres apart, and they will no longer have to remain 2 metres apart from the rest of their household at home.If you have been shielding since March we would like to hear how you feel about lockdown restrictions easing.You can get in touch by filling in the form below or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

They also demanded that the police be “permanently banned” from using the chokehold and prone restraint, in which a person is forced face down on to the ground to be handcuffed.“We’re calling for calm. France isn’t the United States, but France is becoming like the United States,” William Bourdon, one of the Chouviat family’s lawyers, said at a press conference.Arié Alimi, another family lawyer, added: “It’s the prone restraint and the chokehold that killed Cédric Chouviat. Today, everyone knows these techniques kill.”Police said they stopped Chouviat on his scooter after claiming he was looking at his mobile phone and had a dirty licence plate. Officers say he was disrespectful and abusive and resisted arrest.However, a report by the National Gendarmerie Institute for Criminal Research suggested the exchanges between the police and the delivery driver were “correct”, although officers may have felt he was being “provocative” or “defiant”.Tapes examined by investigators suggest the situation worsened after nine minutes and 44 seconds of uneventful exchanges.According to witnesses quoted by Le Monde, the officers held Chouviat, a father of five, in a chokehold, a restraint technique that was banned by the interior minister, Christophe Castaner, this month, then reinstated after complaints from police.Chouviat had a heart attack and was taken to hospital in a coma. He died two days later. A postmortem concluded that he had died from asphyxia, having sustained a “fracture of the larynx”.The dead man’s father, Christian Chouviat, expressed the family’s “incomprehension” on Tuesday. “They gave him no chance of surviving,” he said. “When you hear your son saying, ‘I’m suffocating’ seven times, that’s hard.”None of the police officers has been suspended. Laurent-Franck Lienard, a lawyer for three of them, told LCI they had not heard Chouviat’s last words and “had absolutely no idea” what he was saying.Lienard said the arrested man had subjected police to “around 15 minutes of insults”, calling them “clowns”, “puppets” and “fools”. He said his clients had not used the chokehold."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24bca06caf266e6447dc3360602d291c37d34402/0_302_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9692b5d48843eb8278f570fe8c055f95","title":"you start to think its scary out there englands shielders on stepping out","story":"Those in England most at risk from Covid-19 prepare for 6 July when life will tiptoe back to normalAfter what will be more than 100 days in isolation, people with underlying health issues, who are most at risk from Covid-19, are preparing with some trepidation for 6 July when life will begin to return to normal for many who have been shielding in England.“I’ll probably go into the supermarket on the day with a big sigh of relief, though I will still be very careful,” says Sue Lamble, 74, a retired graphic designer from London.She has an auto-immune condition that makes her lungs more vulnerable to infection and does not intend to mix with other people – although she has been going on distanced walks with a friend regularly – for the foreseeable future.“You get used to the idea of not going out,” Lamble adds. “You get somewhat institutionalised and think, ‘Ah, it’s scary out there’, and I know a number of my friends feel like that. We’re viewing public transport with alarm.”Esther Quaintmere, 32, a mechanical engineer from Cottingham in East Yorkshire, has been shielding because she has a low white blood-cell count that leaves her susceptible to bacterial infections. She spent 60 days without leaving her home before going on walks with members of her household who shielded with her.Now, she is preparing to visit friends’ gardens, but after being made redundant she is acutely aware that there will be no swift return to normality. “It’s exciting to be able to plan and just think about seeing people,” she says. “But we don’t know the ins and outs of it.”Shortly after Quaintmere spoke to the  on Tuesday, a letter arrived through her door signed by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick. “For now you continue to be advised to follow the shielding guidance rigorously,” it says, adding: “From 6 July, you may, if you wish, meet in a group of up to six people outdoors … while maintaining strict social distancing.”Quaintmere said it left her none the wiser and described the letter as “a waste of taxpayers’ money” because it did not appear to say anything different to what was previously said: “We’ve just got to interpret the advice now, though I’m a scientist – not a biologist or a medical doctor.” From August, Quaintmere and the 2.2 million other high-risk people in England should no longer have to shield, the letter confirms. But Idris Rees, 78, who has a heart murmur and atherosclerosis – a potentially serious condition where arteries become clogged – is glad he lives in Wales.Rees says that although he walks on the coast each day near Cardigan, south of Aberystwyth, he has not set foot in a shop or any building aside from his own home since March.“I don’t feel the virus is under control and I don’t trust the government or their scientists,” he adds, saying that while he appreciates that a continued lockdown could have ever more damaging affects on the economy, he is worried about coming out too soon.“My concern is coming out too early if it risks precipitating a second spike which could be much worse than the first. If I caught the virus that would be it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef958019f9e5f22ddc5b4d4626bd8b32da5c8dbc/0_19_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1ec750a6de70993aa661ce6388d5f8e","title":"coronavirus live news update saudi arabia closes borders hajj global covid 19 cases pass 9m latest updates","story":"England relaxes social distancing rules Dr Anthony Fauci testifies to US Congress German district put in local lockdownTop US health officials contradicted Donald Trump over claims the president made at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Saturday when he told supporters that he told his people to “slow the testing down”.Dr Anthony Fauci and other health officials told a House panel they had never been instructed to slow down testing:The UK government has given the green light to a night out in a pub or restaurant in England but gym workouts, swimming pools, nightclub dance floors and even manicures are still off limits – prompting accusations of glaring inconsistencies as the lockdown is eased, Zoe Wood and Paul MacInnes write.The chief executive of PureGym, the UK’s biggest gym chain, said he was “bitterly disappointed” by the delay in opening its 269 gyms and questioned the government’s commitment to tackling obesity. “It is a strange war on obesity that sees pubs and restaurants open before gyms,” said Humphrey Cobbold who highlighted that the company had already safely reopened its gyms in Switzerland and Denmark.Jane Nickerson, the chief executive of Swim England, called on the government to urgently rethink its decision: “Prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that it’s safer to go into a pub than a pool and I’ll shut up. But if not, examine the evidence, come and see our test sites and let us open.”The US has suffered 410 more deaths and recorded 26,643 new cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said.

In weighing the risks to public health of easing lockdown against the economic risks of not doing so, Mr Johnson has opted to prioritise the economy and hope his bet pays off. The prime minister said that the government’s guiding principle would be to trust people to “use their common sense in the full knowledge of the risks”. As a scramble takes place to bring the test-and-trace insurance strategy up to speed, the country can only hope his faith in the public is borne out.Venezuela’s western Zulia state has emerged as a hot spot as poorly supplied hospitals and chronic shortages of water and power make it difficult to prevent the disease from spreading, Reuters has reported.The government of President Nicolás Maduro has identified Zulia as an epicentre, with official statistics showing 590 cases and 10 deaths in the sweltering border state that shares a frontier with neighbouring Colombia.But opposition leaders have questioned the official figures, noting a lack of transparency in the reporting of cases and persecution of reporters, doctors and nurses who have contradicted the authorities. Juan Pablo Guanipa, an opposition legislator who represents the state of Zulia said:There are more deaths from coronavirus than the regime is announcing. The figures they are presenting are not credible.Venezuela’s information ministry and the Zulia government did not reply to requests for comment from Reuters.The Croatian prime minister Andrej Plenkovic is refusing to self-isolate following his brief encounter with Novak Djokovic, the men’s world number one tennis player who has tested positive.The Croatian Public Health Institute said Plenkovic did not have to self-isolate as the risk of infection was low because he only briefly met Djokovic and was not in a close contact with him.Three other players who played in Djokovic’s Adria Tour exhibition tournament in the Balkan region have also tested positive.Plenkovic attended the tournament in the northern Adriatic town of Zadar on Saturday, a day before it was cancelled after Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria said he tested positive.Croatia’s Borna Coric and Viktor Troicki also tested positive as well as Djokovic’s fitness coach Marco Panichi and Dimitrov’s coach Christian Groh.On Monday, Plenkovic tested negative but calls from opposition politicians for him to self-isolate have grown stronger.European Union countries are prepared to block Americans from entering because the United States has failed to control its epidemic, the New York Times has reported, citing draft lists of acceptable travellers.More than 120,000 Americans have died from the outbreak the world’s worst death toll.The US’s top infectious disease expert has testified before Congress that the country will be doing more Covid-19 testing, not less, hours after Donald Trump insisted he was serious when he called for testing to slowdown in the US.Coronavirus cases have continued to rise in about half of US states, but Trump said at a weekend rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that increased testing was making the US look bad and that he had asked staff to slow down. #His press secretary had later said the remarks were “in jest” but the president stood by them on Tuesday, telling reporters that the comments weren’t a joke. Speaking to a congressional committee hours later, however, Dr Anthony Fauci said: I know for sure that to my knowledge none of us have ever been told to slow down on testing. That just is a fact. In fact, we will be doing more testing.Barcelona disco owners have condemned a regional decision to maintain a ban on dancing, unless you are at a hotel or restaurant and know your partner well. “We want to dance” the discotheques said in a statement in response to a U-turn by the Catalan regional government on the issue. It had lifted the dance ban in discos and nightclubs last week as Spain eased one of Europe’s strictest coronavirus lockdowns.But on Monday, officials backpedaled on the decision, saying night clubs would have to keep people off the dance floor, if necessary by putting tables and chairs there.Dance floors in hotels and restaurants were allowed to stay open, but only if they were used by “groups of people often together and in close contact”.Social media had a field day with the decision, but disco owners who have been hoping to open again were not amused.Ramon Mas, head of the Barcelona discotheque federation, told a regional parliament hearing:A night club without dancing is like an opera without music or a restaurant without food. We will not reopen if we cannot let people dance.President Vladimir Putin said Russia will from next year increase taxes on high earners, the first hike in decades, as he laid out measures to tackle the economic fallout of the coronavirus. Addressing Russians in a lengthy televised speech, Putin said the country is facing huge economic challenges after the coronavirus epidemic and associated restrictions on business. A week before Russia votes for constitutional changes that give him the possibility to run for president two more times, Putin praised Russians for coming through “the most dangerous stage of the epidemic”. “In all, we have forced the epidemic to retreat... but the virus is still dangerous,” he said. “The fight against the epidemic is ongoing.” Russia is currently ranked third in the world for the total number of cases with nearly 600,000 people having tested positive for the coronavirus. The country has however reported a considerably lower number of deaths associated with the infection than other countries where the epidemic was severe, with the total toll at 8,359. Announcing an extension of the government’s financial aid to families and healthcare workers, Putin suddenly suggested that the country’s income tax policy be changed in order to finance treatment of children with rare diseases. Since 2001 we have had a flat tax. Its introduction at the time allowed us to take incomes out of the shadows, to make taxation easier. But now with a better quality of administration and the introduction of digital technologies, we can spread the tax burden in a differential way and direct the additional funds towards solving specific and important issues. The extra revenues would be used for “treating children with severe rare diseases,” buying expensive medication and funding complicated surgeries, Putin said. “But even that would add about 60bn rubles ($872m) to the budget,” he said. “The past months have been a time of massive challenges and difficult trials,” Putin said, outlining various measures to boost Russia’s economic recovery, such as lowering taxes for some industries. “In essence, a global recession has begun... the depth of this crisis is yet to be evaluated,” he said. “For Russia this is also a serious challenge.” The Males will reopen its tourist resorts from mid-July after a months-long virus-enforced shutdown, the country’s president said, adding that international travellers would be welcomed to the Indian ocean holiday hotspot. Tourism is a major earner for the Males, a tropical island nation popular with honeymooners and celebrities. “The country will reopen its borders for international travel, and the government will allow resorts to welcome visitors from July 15,” president Ibrahim Mohamed Solih told reporters. Foreign visitors would not be required to undergo virus tests or carry virus-free certificates to enter the archipelago of 1,190 tiny coral islets, the government said. Visitors showing virus symptoms or with high fevers would be tested for the infectious disease at the airport, officials said. The lockdown would be eased further with schools and restaurants, as well as mosques, to be re-opened in the country of Sunni Muslims in the near future, Solih added, without mentioning any dates. Tourists were stranded in the Males when international flights were halted from late March to combat the spread of the virus. Most of them left by mid-April on government-organised or privately chartered flights. International flights have not yet resumed, although charters and special flights are permitted to arrive and leave the main airport in Male. The South Asian nation, which has a population of 340,000 people, has so far reported 2,217 virus infections including eight deaths.

File photograph: Nick Bradshaw Ireland has the highest rate of infection from coronavirus of all health workers globally, the Oireachtas Covid-19 committee has been told.General secretary of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) Phil Ní Sheaghdha, who described the figures as “an absolute scandal”, also said nurses “have been applauded and they have been abandoned” by the HSE and the State as they struggle to balance work with childcare.And she said it was “wrong and a mistake” that the Department of Business will not alter regulations to include Covid-19 as an occupationally acquired illness.She told the committee that the regulations must be changed to allow the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) examine the reasons behind the figures.Siptu Divisional organiser Paul Bell said a number of EU states recognised Covid-19 as an occupationally acquired illness and he could not understand why Ireland was not doing the same.Speaking at the committee, which is looking at the impact of the pandemic on childcare, Ms Ní Sheaghdha said that, based on contact with the International Council of Nurses, Ireland’s figures for infection were the highest in the world.Figures from the INMO showed that up to the end of May, a total of 8,018 cases of infection of healthcare workers were reported. Some 66 per cent or 4,823 remain out sick, and of that number 1,600 are categorised as nurses and midwives. Ms Ní Sheaghdha said “this puts enormous pressure on rosters”.She told Fianna Fáil health spokesman Stephen Donnelly that the lack of personal protective equipment (PIPE) was a major issue.The INMO, she said, was forced to lobby the HSE to make it mandatory for healthcare workers to wear face masks. In one case, a nurse was sent home for wearing a mask, having been advised that it was against HSE policy.She said “face masks should have been mandatory” from the start for all healthcare workers in healthcare settings, and that infection rates fell dramatically once masks were made obligatory on April 22nd.Mr Bell said the union had to supply face masks to staff early in the pandemic. He pointed out that the HSE announced a survey which showed that 7,000 healthcare workers required childcare, but said Siptu was unaware of any survey, or of any member being offered or asked about such a survey.Meanwhile, a survey by the INMO found that 60 per cent of nurses faced additional expenditure to enable them attend work. Some had a relative live with them to provide childcare, or ended up using all their leave and taking unpaid leave to mind their children because of lack of alternatives.The committee was told that in one case it cost a nurse in South Tipperary General Hospital €150 a week more to go to work than the nurse earned.The INMO and Siptu called for the costs to nurses and midwives of attending work to be repaid to them, and said they should get preferential treatment when childcare services returned to maintain their employment contracts.Ms Ní Sheaghdha said that 88 per cent of those infected who work in the health service got the virus at work and had to absent themselves for 14 days.Childcare has always been a very difficult issue and became huge when creches closed down, she said.The survey by the INMO found that 27 per cent of all those who responded were reliant on creches and, with the pandemic, the rate of childminding in childminders’ homes dropped from 27 per cent to 7.9 per cent, while childminding in the child’s home rose from 7 per cent to 11 per cent and care from grandparents dropped from 32 per cent to 10 per cent.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19

nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Keep up to speed with The Briefing, The \u0026#39s two-minute audio updatesNeed a better way to keep up-to-date?

At the time, there had been 350 deaths from Covid-19 in the UK. Today there have been close to 40,000. That grim figure explains why the Government has retained the controls over social interactions, albeit with modifications as the pace of contagion has slowed.Now that it has almost halted, Mr Johnson is emboldened to relax the restrictions further and, in delivering better news, he certainly looked far more chipper in the Commons than he has done for a while, back to the old Boris.But listening to his statement about what we are now permitted to do was to appreciate in the starkest terms what it is that we have lost. For a country that is defined by its love of freedom to be told that we can go to the pub, though only if we supply our names and addresses to the innkeeper or can get our hair cut, though only if our coiffeur dresses like a nuclear power plant worker or we can have a dinner party but must not embrace or kiss our guests, these are hard orders to take, even if they are dressed up as “guidance”. As a law-abiding nation, we take these things seriously even when they are not actually the law of the land as many of these “rules” are not, including the two-metre distancing.Many restrictions seem arbitrary. Why, for instance, is professional football allowed but not cricket? This makes no sense since the former involves much more close contact. Mr Johnson said the ball in cricket acted as a vector for disease but on that basis the game will never restart.We were promised Independence Day on July 4 but remain in chains, even if they are looser than before. Even when we are freed, which will not happen this year because of the Government’s fear of a second wave, much will have changed.Looking through my wallet yesterday was like a Proustian journey into a past life. Photo-passes to offices \u2028I no longer visit an oyster card for trains that I no longer use a library card for books no longer borrowed and even some cash – remember that? These may well be the detritus of a world never to be regained. Will those of us able to work at home ever be allowed back into the office or even want to go for that matter?I had thought that once this nightmare was over, we would all be commuting into cities again, eager to return to the camaraderie and woke minefield of modern office life, but I have my doubts now.Parents whose children have been at home since March and face another two months with the little darlings cannot wait to get back to the office but once the schools have returned they might think differently. Home working by millions will be an abiding legacy of this time with all the implications that will have for the viability of public transport, commercial property management and businesses like cafes, restaurants and taxis that rely on commuters for their livelihoods, especially in London.Foreign travel will change even when the 14-day quarantine for all arrivals is dropped. While there are many people desperate to get back to the beaches of the Med, there are others who find the thought of a masked four-hour queue at the airport intolerable. Eating out, going to the cinema, attending the theatre – all these activities are to reopen but their pleasures constrained by pettifogging rules and for how long?What else will change? The BBC has been running a series of podcasts called Rethink in which leading figures in their fields consider what might happen. One contributor, Lady Hale, the former president of the Supreme Court, suggests that we might reconsider how we use juries in criminal trials.This has been a theme recently among jurists alarmed at the growing backlog in the system. One proposed “temporary measure” is for judges to sit alone or with a couple of lay assessors rather than with a full jury in order to get through the mountain of pending trials. But it would not be a temporary measure. Once introduced it would be hard to get rid of it. Do we want the “new normal” to erode our ancient juridical rights?Or what about Parliament: when will it go back to proper functioning? Now that voting is carried out remotely or by proxy, do we ever see the old system returning or a full complement of MPs allowed back to Westminster? What will that mean for the scrutiny of legislation which was never especially well done and has been almost non-existent in recent weeks?Research by the Hansard Society think tank found that more than \u202890 pieces of legislation, including significant restrictions on people’s freedoms, were pushed through without parliamentary scrutiny. We have lost a great deal in the past few months. We cannot dispense with our democracy as well.Do events like a pandemic create a new reality or accentuate changes that were already lurking beneath the surface? Notwithstanding the death toll, this has not been the catastrophic plague that some had feared and has mercifully spared the young almost entirely, unlike past contagions. Moreover, when Mr Johnson announced what he acknowledged to be an unprecedented curtailment of inidual freedom, he said the aim was to prevent the NHS being overwhelmed.That justification passed some time ago and yet the Government still thinks it should dictate how we conduct our lives, including our most intimate contacts. Provided the people most likely to succumb to the virus are protected then everyone else should be allowed to carry on and assess the risk (low for most) to themselves.Our freedoms cannot continue to be restricted by a fixation on R numbers or assumptions that there will be a “second wave” of the virus which, as Liam Fox said in the Commons, is merely the continuation of a disease that we cannot get rid of and have to live with. The “new normal” is a world devoid of light and liberty.

In suburbs of Lisbon, too, a partial lockdown is being reimposed after a rise in local cases. Globally, according to the World Health Organisation, the pandemic is accelerating.Look more calmly, though, and one thing becomes apparent. While the number of recorded cases globally has yet to peak the number of deaths peaked in April and is now running about half the level it was then. While more and more people are being recorded as suffering from Covid-19, fewer are dying. Why?It is partly because the world is performing ever more Covid tests. The more you test, the more Covid-19 you will find. Tests are now picking up asymptomatic cases which would previously have gone undetected. The number of cases recorded is no guide to the true level of incidence of infections. Look at Britain, where officially  there have been 305,000 recorded cases of the disease. Yet the ONS, on the strength of antibody tests, has estimated that 6.78 percent of the population (4.4 million Britons) have been infected. In spite of Matt Hancock’s boast of reaching his target of 100,000 tests a day, we have managed to capture fewer than one in 10 cases of the disease.But there is something else apparent from the data on Covid-19. The wider the infection spreads, the more it is concentrated in younger, less vulnerable age groups. In Portugal, a rise in cases has been blamed on young people partying. However much and irresponsibly they party, however, they have failed to make any impact on the daily death toll, which is in low single figures compared with over 30 back in April.It is a very different situation from March and April when Covid-19 was running riot in care homes all across Europe and North America. In the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control, more than a quarter of tests among the over-65s in March turned out to be positive. That has now fallen to less than five per cent. More cases, by contrast, are now being picked up among children and teenagers – but that doesn’t matter so much because they have a very tiny chance of dying from the disease or suffering any ill effects.If all age groups had the same chance of dying from Covid 19 as do children (who are more likely to die from being struck by lightning), there would be no need to do anything about the disease – it could safely be allowed to rip through the population unchecked. All of which begs the question: why don’t we allow young people to build up society’s herd immunity while simultaneously protecting the elderly and other vulnerable people? This was, in fact, once a policy that was favoured by at least one government scientific adviser.On March 12, Graham Medley, Professor of Infectious Disease Modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and a member of Sage, told Newsnight: “If I could, what I would like to do is put all the more vulnerable people into the North of Scotland and keep them there, everyone else in Kent and have a nice big epidemic in Kent so everyone becomes immune, and then we can put people back together again.”Instead, we seemed to do pretty much the opposite: we locked young people away indoors while discharging elderly hospital patients, untested, into care homes where they helped spread the virus unchecked. Eventually, however, we have – accidentally – arrived at more or less is the policy Medley advocated.Young people, fed up with lockdown, are increasingly flouting the rules by partying, going on protests and the like, while many elderly people remain indoors. Black Lives Matter hasn’t done a lot for community relations, stirring up tensions. But it may just have done us a favour by contributing to herd immunity from Covid-19.In Britain, new infections from Covid-19 have fallen to a trickle in any case. In the first half of June, according to the ONS, only around one in 1700 people had the virus at any one time. But if we do get a second spike in infections, it would be madness the repeat the economically-debilitating experiment of total lockdown. We should protect the vulnerable – and let others continue more or less normal life.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inside florida model gods waiting room could point way managing","story":"On Monday, Florida hit the grim milestone of 100,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, following a series of record daily totals.But the headline figure is far from the full story. On that same day there were only 12 deaths, and 82 people hospitalised, in a state of 22 million people, which has so many elderly retirees it is known as “God\u0027s waiting room.Florida\u0027s mortality rate - the proportion of deaths per positive cases - has fallen to just 3.4 per cent. That compares to 5.2 per cent for the United States, and the same globally. The UK\u0027s rate is 14 per cent.Most startling of all, the average age of people testing positive has plummeted from 65 in March to 35 now. In some Florida counties it is under 30.The figures reflect the Sunshine State\u0027s strategy of protecting the elderly, while allowing the young and healthy to proceed with life as much as possible.It is an approach not dissimilar to what was originally proposed in the UK and, with the addition of focusing on the elderly, what has played out in Sweden. Going forward, it could provide a model for how the virus can best be managed.If anywhere was set for catastrophe when coronavirus emerged, it was Florida. The state has 691 nursing homes, with about 85,000 beds, and over 3,000 assisted-living facilities, with 106,000 beds.And it is home to numerous resorts for the elderly, including mega-retirement community The Villages, the largest in America, which has over 130,000 senior citizens, with an average age of 70.From the start the approach of Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor of Florida, was simple - shield the elderly, and let others carry on because they are less likely to get seriously ill, and contribute more to the economy.The result has been a lot of cases, but less deaths, and less pressure on the state\u0027s health system.No special measures were introduced for the elderly. But repeated appeals were made for over-65s to stay home, and avoid crowds. Ultimately, it was each inidual\u0027s decision, but they listened.When the first case was confirmed in The Villages on March 19 public events there had already stopped, and restaurants had switched to takeaway. Churches immediately made services online or drive-thru only.Days later, Mr DeSantis unveiled what he called the most innovative testing site in the country at The Villages. It was a drive-thru centre that tested anyone, regardless of symptoms, and returned results within 72 hours. Testing went on for a month. Scientists hailed it as a global example.Ultimately, despite predictions the virus would devastate The Villages, less than 100 cases have been detected there.Meanwhile, Florida is nearing completion of testing everyone in all its nursing homes. All nursing staff are being tested every two weeks. The governor ordered the National Guard to help with testing.We have a lot of large retirement communities, but overall Florida didn\u0027t get to the point the models predicted we were going to hit. Our older people took note of the need to protect themselves.The shift in cases is in part thanks to them continuing those practices, and younger folks not.Experts like Professor Prins are still worried by the recent spike.The preference is to not have this many cases. this is not a desirable situation. Certainly when we look at younger cases, they\u0027re not hospitalised as often, not as likely to die, she said. But the 25-year-old may still go visit grandma and grandpa.Mr DeSantis was highly reluctant to issue any kind of statewide stay-at-home order, eventually doing so in April, and then starting to reopen as soon as possible in early May.Now, restaurants and bars are operating at 50 per cent capacity, or 100 per cent outdoors. He has not mandated masks.Since Memorial Day on May 25, Floridians have flocked to beaches. Images of sun worshippers avoiding social distancing have given public health officials apoplexy.But the governor is pleased at how the average age for positive cases has shifted in a radical direction younger.Speaking last week in Miami, he said: A trend that’s very important is what is the median age of those people who are testing positive. Those under 40, in particular, who don’t have any underlying conditions are much, much less likely to be hospitalised or to suffer a fatality. We’re not rolling back.The figures appear to back up Mr DeSantis\u0027s approach.Florida has the third highest population of any US state, including a very high proportion of vulnerable elderly people, yet it has had the ninth most deaths - 3,173.That equates to 147 deaths per one million people, far below the US average of 368 per million. For the UK it is 641 deaths per million, whereas New York\u0027s figure is 1,602. Florida is also testing aggressively, with 41,028 tests conducted on Saturday. On that day the percentage of positive tests was 14 per cent, compared to less than six per cent in preceding months. It reflects contact tracing efforts aimed at getting people treated quickly.Meanwhile, doctors have reported the falling age of patients easing pressures on them. In Broward County, the length of hospital admission has fallen from an average of 10 days to six.At the start of the pandemic elderly patients from nursing homes and cruise ships required long stays. Now, the vast majority of younger patients are not admitted, and sent home to recuperate.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"return big weekly shop short lived new data shows","story":"The return of the big weekly shop may have been a blip, after the latest figures showed a resurgence in supermarket trips.Tesco boss Dave Lewis said in April that the clock had been turned back “10 or 15 years” on our shopping habits with the lockdown meaning shoppers were visiting the supermarket less frequently but spending more when they got there.However, the latest data from analysts Kantar, showed that an extra 19 million trips to supermarkets were made in the four weeks to June 14 than in the previous month.Matt Botham, from Kantar, said this was an indication that the shift in consumer behaviour was temporary but that, at the current rate of growth, things would not get back to normal until October.The 405 million trips made in that four weeks was still a reduction of 77 million when compared to the previous year.He said: “Each time the Government’s advice shifted you can see it reflected in the shopping data. After the stay home message became stay alert there was a little tick upwards in the data.”Online shopping has continued to prove popular with the volume of sales almost doubling in the time period, an increase of 91 per cent.Meanwhile, the sunny weather and the relaxing of restrictions on seeing friends and family drove a surge in demand for picnic and barbecue items and ice cream.Sales of soft drinks and chilled dips increased by 28 and 30 per cent respectively, while ice cream sales rose by 57 per cent, burgers by 44 per cent and sausages by 40 per cent.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rules lockdown uk guidelines latest","story":"The move will enable pubs, restaurants, cinemas and other businesses to be run profitably when they are allowed to reopen on the same day, and will change the way in which schools, shops, transport and workplaces can operate.Mr Johnson told MPs the rate of infection in the community – as opposed to hospitals and care homes – is now low enough to relax the social distancing rule as long as steps are taken to mitigate the risk of people being closer together.Face coverings will be needed in some indoor locations, perspex screens could be used between tables in restaurants and al fresco dining will be encouraged to minimise the risk of transmission.A Downing Street spokesman said: After a long period of asking the public to follow very strict and complex rules, the Government believes we are now in a position to enable people to see more of their friends and family.The infection rate has fallen significantly in the first half of June. Only one in 1,700 people have the virus, compared with an average of one in 400 a month ago.Where it is not possible to stay two metres apart, people are advised instead to keep one metre plus apart – meaning one metre apart plus mitigation.But I must say to the House it will be all too easy for that frost to return. And that is why we will continue to trust in the common sense and the community spirit of the British people to follow this guidance, to carry us through, and to see us to victory over this virus.Families will be allowed to meet groups of relations or friends indoors for the first time since lockdown began – but there will be a ban on hugging or touching.From July 4, any two households can meet together under the same roof, and even stay overnight, as long as they observe social distancing. That means families could invite one set of grandparents over for lunch and then see the other set of grandparents for dinner, as long as they are not there at the same time.The new rule also allows any two households to meet up in a pub, restaurant, museum or cinema, or even go on holiday together. There will be no limit on how many people can gather, as long as no more than two households are meeting at the same time.The Government decided against an alternative plan to allow two entire households to form one social bubble, partly because it would have forced families to choose which set of relations they could see.Existing rules allowing up to six people from up to six different households to meet outdoors remain in place, as does the rule that allows someone living alone to join a support bubble (see below) with another household and be treated as if they live in the same home.Downing Street admitted people would need to show a lot of discipline and restraint to adhere to the new rules, such as preventing children from hugging grandparents, but stressed that the changes would be swiftly reversed if coronavirus started to spread again.A Number 10 spokesman said: Your household will be able to link with one other household at a time, which includes staying over at someone\u0027s house.This is not a bubble because households should continue to remain socially distant from one another when they are indoors or outdoors, so they will need to stay two metres apart or follow the new one-metre plus advice.Hotels, pubs and restaurants will be allowed to reopen from July 4, but customers will be banned from propping up the bar and will have to register their contact details before entering. This will allow customers to sit closer together in venues in which it is not possible for them to be two metres apart, so long as there are additional mitigating measures in place. New safety guidance, due to be issued later, will set out a menu of options for hospitality bosses to use as part of the new system. These include more back-to-back seating, perspex screens, partitions between tables, disposable menus and more cleaning of commonly touched surface areas. Waiters will be required to wipe down surfaces more often and collect glasses and plates more frequently. People will be discouraged from returning their glass or ordering from the bar, with more table service and mobile apps expected to be introduced. The changes will also place limits on the number of people who can sit together indoors in pubs and restaurants, with just two households of any size permitted to drink or eat together. To assist the Test and Trace system, customers will be required to register their details with a venue before entry.Hairdressing salons will be able to reopen, but the experience of getting your hair cut is likely to be very different.Hairdressers will be required to wear a full-face plastic visor to reduce the risk of infection and will also need to follow strict rules over the disinfecting of equipment.Customers will have to make appointments, and there will be limits on the amount of people in salons. It is also anticipated that hairstylists will be told to cut down on small talk.But the mass reopening will come with a number of conditions attached. Recommendations to stop coronavirus from spreading include emptying mini bars, offering buffet-free breakfasts and regularly deep cleaning rooms, with 24 hours left between bookings.All paperwork is likely to be removed from rooms, along with the telephone, while the plastic pouch containing tea and coffee sachets will either be removed or quarantined for up to 72 hours between guests.Those checking in should expect to see social distancing stickers on the floor, perspex screens at the reception desk and hand sanitiser available throughout. It is thought campsites will be instructed to ensure that tents are pitched further apart than normal so social distancing measures can be adhered to, along with frequent deep cleaning of facility blocks such as showers. Some campsites will be required to reduce the number of pitches to keep numbers down. Campers are likely be told they cannot have day visitors in order to further limit the numbers on site. Communal areas such as receptions, shops, laundries and playgrounds are likely to remain closed, with guests advised to bring all their own essentials, including gas canisters.As with hotels and other overnight accommodation, guests will be asked to pay in advance and use contactless payment rather than cash. Changes to the rules, allowing two households to meet up, mean that two families will now be able to go on holiday together.The Prime Minister confirmed: From July 4, provided that no more than two households stay together, people will be free to stay overnight in self-contained accommodation, including hotels and bed and breakfasts.Mr Johnson did not specifically mention Britain\u0027s 2.2 million shielded people in his statement.However on Monday, Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, announced that this extremely clinically vulnerable group would finally be able to meet friends and visit relatives\u0027 homes from July 6.Shielded people, considered to be the most medically vulnerable to the effects of coronavirus, including those with lung conditions and people being treated for cancer, will be able to meet up to five other people outdoors after having been virtual prisoners in their own homes for the past three months.If they live alone they will also be able to form a support bubble with one other household, meaning they can visit their families and stay overnight with them. It is hoped the infection rate will be low enough for shielding to end all together at the end of July, though help will still be available from NHS volunteers and local councils.As long as they continue strict social distancing measures, shielded people will be able to visit supermarkets and places of worship, and those who cannot work from home will be able to return as long as their workplace adheres to Government guidance.Until now, the only easing of lockdown for shielded people has been allowing them to go outside once a day with their household or, if they live alone, to meet one other person at a two-metre distance.It advises that shielded children can return to school in line with their peers, provided they wash their hands frequently and adhere to social distancing. Mr Johnson said that Easter, Passover and Eid all occurred during the lockdown and he was pleased to announce that places of worship will reopen for prayer and services, including weddings with a maximum of 30 people, all subject to social distancing.Weddings will restart from July 4, with up to 30 people able to attend under social distancing rules. From July 4, provided they are Covid-19 compliant:More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/23/19/gettyimages-169206619.jpg","title":"columbus statue minnesota saint paul state capitol prince","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.‘Prince represents Minnesota values and Columbus does not’The Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism.

Announcing the new social distancing rule on Tuesday, Mr Johnson stressed it was “preferable” for people to remain two metres apart but said “we can now move to one metre plus where it is not possible for us to stay two metres apart”.He added: “That means staying one metre apart plus mitigations which reduce the risk of transmission and these precautions could include installing screens, making sure people face away from each other, providing hand-washing facilities, minimising the amount of time you spend with people outside of your household and of course being outdoors.“On public transport, it already means one metre plus, it means wearing a face covering for mitigation as everybody I think now understands.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

You can get involved too: share your recipes using #SeasonalVeg on social mediaTry different types of fishSimilarly, the UK\u0027s fishing industry has suffered during the current coronavirus pandemic.While higher-end produce is currently not being purchased by restaurants, much of the catch from UK waters that would usually be exported hasn’t been, so boats across the country have struggled to sell their fish and seafood. That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Museums and cinemas in England have been given the green light to reopen their doors to visitors from 4 July, but many smaller venues are still worried about making it through the year.The government has scrapped the two-metre social distancing rule in favour of one metre, a change that has been welcomed by museums and cinemas, which say it will help them reach up to 50 per cent of capacity instead of less than 25 per cent.However, concerns about consumer confidence and whether reopening is financially viable means that some venues, such as heritage museums and independent cinemas, are in “mortal peril”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Bonser-Wilton, chief executive of the Mary Rose Museum in Portsmouth, told The Independent that lockdown has cost the museum 90 per cent of its income and it would probably take between four to six weeks to make changes to ensure the safety of its staff and visitors.“The prime minister’s announcement is not a surprise and is very welcome, but there is so much uncertainty about whether we will be able to recover from the past few months,” she said.All libraries, museums and galleries in Leeds could closeWhen will nail bars and beauty salons be allowed to reopen in the UK?Drinkers warned risk of catching coronavirus in pubs ‘quite high’Live: PM eases lockdown, as Japan wants trade deal within six weeksWhen will pubs, cinemas, restaurants and hairdressers be open from?“In theory, museums will be able to reopen on 4th of July, but I think very few will. For the Mary Rose, we’re fully indoor and have air conditioning, so we will need to see if we comply by ventilation requirements, we need to order and install things like Perspex screens, review the guidance on toilets and so on.“The issue we’re seeing is the question of how much consumer demand there’s actually going to be. Our cost will likely go up because of all the changes and it’s unlikely we’ll see more than 20 per cent of our usual visitors — it is a risk for all heritage museums because we might lose more money to open than to stay closed. We are in mortal peril if the government doesn’t step in.”Laura Pye, director of the Liverpool Museums group, which aims to reopen the World Museum and the Walker Art Gallery as soon as possible, said it can do so because the spaces are large enough to allow for social distancing but many smaller heritage museums won’t be able to do the same.She said the biggest challenge for the museum sector is seeing how financially viable it will be to reopen, and it will take much longer to reopen smaller venues.“Reopening will be incredibly difficult for a large section of the museum community. The reality is that museums are mostly in historical buildings, have huge amounts of historical and valuable artefacts, so staffing levels will be higher than normal,” she told The Independent.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If you’re running a small venue, it’s very difficult.”A survey by the Independent Cinema Office (IOC) showed 41 per cent of venues are not confident they can reopen with social distancing measures and majority think they won’t be able to open until September at the earliest.“Despite government suggestion that cinemas could reopen in July, many smaller independent venues are reluctant to open, citing safety of staff and audiences as the main concerns,” said the IOC report.“They feel pressure from the commercial sector the industry as a whole to open when it is not actually financially viable, practical or even safe to do so.”What are the new lockdown rules announced by Boris Johnson?Most of the respondents to the IOC survey also thought they would have a 20 per cent increase in costs to implement health and safety measures, such as additional staffing, PPE, and enhanced cleaning of the venues.Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association, said the announcement was “very much welcome” and was a “major step forward for recovery in the industry”, but added it was “undoubtedly true” that there will be a significant number of smaller venues who will not want to open for various reasons.“The IOC survey respondents were predominantly from smaller communities, there are a vast number of independent cinemas that will want to open,” he told The Independent.“But smaller sites may decide their audiences are more likely to decide not to come back, may look at a likely film slate in the weeks after cinemas open and decide it’s not strong enough to attract enough people, or simply have too-small entrances to ensure social distancing is possible.“However, we are confident that as things develop, more cinemas will be able to reopen their doors.”Both independent museums and cinemas believe the government will have to step in to help them recover, especially as half the summer period will have passed by the time they are allowed to reopen.Ms Bonser-Wilton called for the government’s furlough scheme to continue until the end of the year and for substantial grants to be provided to “cover essential care costs during the crisis and beyond”.She has also called for an “urgent conversation on building resilience and better funding mechanism for independent heritage charities”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort.

Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising.

Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This would be acceptable under the code of practice for statistics provided the uncertainties were described appropriately,” he added.It comes after a report by the Work and Pensions Committee on Monday urged ministers to suspend the rule during the crisis, warning that it forced migrant workers to make the “invidious” choice between “financial ruin” or risking their lives as they continue to work.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is therefore vital that good data in this area – or at least good estimates – are made available.“The Prime Minister said at the liaison committee that he would find out how many people are in this position. I am optimistic that the information will now be provided.”The Home Office has come under mounting pressure to suspend the NRPF policy in recent weeks, including from local councils and the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, both of whom say it is hindering their efforts to help thousands of rough sleepers off the streets during the pubic health crisis.A government spokesperson said: “Extensive action to support those with no recourse to public funds has been taken, such as rent protections, the Job Retention Scheme, the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme, allocating £3.2bn to local authorities and £750m for charities to support the most vulnerable.“The Home Office does not routinely collect or publish data on those with no recourse to public funds but is considering how best to produce statistics in this area.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Coleen feels that the time and money involved could be put to better use her offer to meet face to face still stands. Mrs Vardy’s decision to issue court proceedings does at least mean that Coleen’s evidence can be made public when the time is right.”  The combined legal fees are set to cost up to £1m, The Sun, which found itself at the centre of the original dispute between the celebrities, reported.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Nearly half of the home coronavirus tests sent out by the government are not being sent back or are being returned void, the government has admitted.The revelation casts further doubt on ministers\u0027 claims about how many people they are testing for Covid-19, with home tests making up a substantial chunk of the total.The Government\u0027s testing figures count a test as soon as it is sent out rather than when results are obtained, with the effect of inflating the numbers in time to meet deadlines. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut new statistics released by the Department of Health and Social Care show that 39 per cent of kits are not being sent back, with a further 4.8 per cent of those – 9,761 – returned void.It means that over 4 in 10 of the home testing kits are not actually providing results, a total of around 42 per cent.Majority of British workers want coronavirus spot checksPM accused of \u0027rubbish\u0027 over claim no country has working Covid appThe statistics were released by the government in response to a written parliamentary question on Tuesday. Ministers have previously been coy about releasing the exact figures, but Public Health England told a parliamentary committee last month that certainly more than half were being returned.Officials say tests may be returned void because they either have not been used, sent back without a barcode label, or with the sample container\u0027s lid not screwed on properly. They say there have also been occasions in which the sample provided cannot be processed.The figures, the latest of which related to 25 May 2020, show that 3.6 per cent of home test kits received a positive result and 91.6 per cent received a negative result, with 4.8 per cent void.It is difficult to estimate the exact impact of the low return rate on the overall figures using publicly available data. On the day of the government\u0027s deadline to test 100,000 people alone, 40,000 tests were recorded as either mailed out to homes or satellite centres. The satellite tests are not thought to face the same problems home tests have, but the government does not distinguish between the two methods in the figures it makes public.Labour\u0027s shadow health minister Justin Madders said: For just under half of these tests not to be returned or to have been voided shows that the Government have got little control over the testing system.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt is understood ministers are consulting on how businesses should record customer information to help support the new test and trace system to fight the global pandemic. But a spokesman for UK Hospitality, which represents the trade, said: “We do need swift clarification from the Government on how the system will work.”The British Beer \u0026amp Pub Association (BBPA), which represents brewers and pubs, said it had significant concerns over the collection and storage of customer data, but would work with ministers.  Grace Bradley, from campaign group Liberty, said: “We must know what’s going to happen to data collected by venues, how long it will be kept and who it will be shared with and under what circumstances it will be shared with government.” She added there had been “no guarantees” that test and trace data would be firewalled from other agencies like the police and immigration services “leaving many people rightly afraid to engage with the system.” A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office said: “The ICO is assessing the potential data protection implications of this proposed scheme and is monitoring developments.”Covid to remain at \u0027significant\u0027 levels into 2021, says medical chiefCoronavirus loans backed by government and furlough bill exceed £60bnDrinkers warned risk of catching coronavirus in pubs ‘quite high’The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I’m not apologising for that at all.‘Grave risk’ of Windrush-style scandal again unless Home Office actsWatchdog to review hostile environment policy in light of Windrush “It is right that we treat each inidual with the respect and dignity they deserve. These are complicated cases.”The home secretary also announced that her department would accept the recommendations of the review into the Windrush scandal – published in March – in full.“The review itself is damning of the conduct of the Home Office and unequivocal about the ignorance and institutional thoughtlessness towards the race and the history of the Windrush generation by the department,” she said.“There are serious and significant lessons for the Home Office to learn.”During the sitting, Labour MP and chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee Yvette Cooper raised the cases of two men who were told in January that their cases were nearly finalised, but had made no progress since.One of these iniduals was Anthony Williams, who served in the Armed Forces for 13 years, and the other Andrew Bynoe, who was made homeless due to issues with his immigration status.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Coronavirus lockdowns are lifting around the world, raising concerns that it could trigger a new wave of infections.Some countries that experienced a significant drop in new Covid-19 cases in April and May are now beginning to experience an uptick in confirmed daily cases.The concerning trend can be seen in several countries throughout the Middle East, most notably in Iran where new cases briefly dropped below 1,000 in early May but have now more than doubled.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIran was one of the first countries to experience a significant outbreak of the deadly virus, with close to 200,000 total cases recorded.Looking at a smoothed seven-day rolling average for new daily cases, Iran\u0027s second wave came almost exactly one month after the first wave.The data suggests that Iran may have already reached the peak of its second wave and is now on the decline.Other countries in the region appear to be experiencing a more gradual second wave, with official figures from Israel revealing that new coronavirus cases have been rising consistently for the past three weeks.Israel\u0027s second wave remains a long way off the peak of the first wave, and the country remains one of the least affected in the Middle East.In Saudi Arabia, new cases are rising at record rates despite briefly appearing to peak in late May.The false peak means the latest surge of new cases could be counted as a continuation of the first wave, rather than a new second wave.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No matter that I am not, nor have ever been, a member of the Conservative Party.I would never be forgiven by some people, who just couldn’t understand why an ethnic minority person would have sympathy for Conservative policies. At best we’ve been hoodwinked at worst we must just be plain evil.It often feels like we are not allowed to think for ourselves, outside of the orthodoxies set down by left-wing political groupthink.In the days of fighting to set up my school, and in our first few years of establishing ourselves, I received racist emails and threats of violence — from the Left.There were protests outside my school and abuse was shouted in my face from militant union members opposed to free schools.My detractors tried hard to discredit me in ways that made sense to them.There was even a running Wikipedia battle over my heritage, lasting for years.It was regularly edited to state that I was of Indian descent, while some people claimed my ancestry to be Indian Ugandan, and thereforethat I must hate black people.It was absurd, and I didn’t know from one day to the next what race my Wikipedia page would say I was.While it seems a bizarre thing to fight over, some opponents clearly believed that my criticisms of the education system and my support for free schools could be discountedI wasn’t black.My experience ten years ago is why today I have the greatest sympathy for Conservative MPs such as Priti Patel and Kemi Badenoch. Heaven knows what actual Tory MPs from ethnic minorities must have to endure.Mirza has been working with the Conservative Party for many years and her simple appointment to this role has enraged her detractors. For them, a “good” ethnic minority is one who always toes the leftist line.So play around with my Wikipedia page, make me Indian with a couple of keyboard strokes, and suddenly not only have they wiped my mother out of existence, but my words don’t really matter any more. This accusation of “not being black enough” raised its ugly head when Priti Patel was accused of distracting from the racism facing black people by highlighting her own experiences — assomehow her struggles were worth less because she is of Indian heritage .That being called a “P**i” as a young girl wouldn’t have had the same crushing, hurtful impact as any other racial slur. Similarly, Munira Mirza has been accused of not being able to understand the experiences of black people because she is of Pakistani origin.The recent protests inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement should have provoked serious conversations about the meaning and impact of race we all need to explore the nature of racism and what to do about it.But it is clear to me, from the black boxes on Instagram to the meaningless supportive BLM statements on corporate websites, that few people are interested in examining race in our own society.Most people want an easy fix, a stamp of approval that will allow them to be branded a non-racist so that they can go back to their normal lives, satisfied that they are a good person .This is not even remotely helpful to anyone, it’s simple box ticking but the desire to signal “anti-racism” instead of just not being a racist is so prevalent that at times I wonder whether human beings have the capacity to distinguish between the two: The signal and the reality.This tick-box race culture goes hand in hand with the oppression Olympics. Hierarchies of race are the easy bingo card that allows ethnic people to be ticked off on a sheet.Chinese  Sorry, only two oppression points for you. Black  Wow, that’s ten points! You go straight to the top!This is why,you are merely interested in appearing to be non-racist, rather than actually being a non-racist, you will buy into the idea of this totem pole of oppression.You will ignore that race and class are so much more complex than this.My father was of Indian heritage, but he came from a much poorer environment than my black mother and grew up without any shoes.Le is more complicated than the tick-box culture allows, butyour only interest in race is to do enough to signal to everyone that you aren’t a racist, then you will promote that hierarchy enthusiastically, because it is the perfect prop for your non-racist dissimulation. It doesn’t require any thought or effort.The reality of being anti-racist requires years of reading and discussion, befriending a iety of black people, including ones who think dferently from you politicallyand really coming to terms with one’s own uncomfortable feelings around race. Signalling requires a black box on Instagram and instantly everyone approves of you. You can see why most people choose the simpler option.In fact, spending a letime helping black boys realise their potential, something Black Lives Matter should approve of, instead of earning me adoration as a black box on Instagram does, has given me many enemies.My -plus years of improving young people’s lives is meaningless next to the superficial letters of support for BLM, because making a useful dference to people’s lives is less important than being seen to do so. It is a wonder why anyone ever does anything truly good at all.But there is one way of being anti-racist in a very simple and real way that takes no time at all.Allow Priti Patel, Kemi Badenoch and Munira Mirza the right that so many white people enjoy and take for granted: The right to think for themselves.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mums.And when you are responsible for home-educating your children as well as working out how to feed them three meals a day while holding down your job and everything  you used to do before children went to school at home, there is a strong incentive to get those schools open. And quick.Perhaps less so when someone  is taking care of all that stuff for you.Getting our classrooms back up and running may well take a bit of lateral thought, because of course it has to be safe to do so. But on the basis we can now pop to Zara or Ikea, surely we can open our schools safely Few disagree that lockdown should have included schools, but they need to open as soon as it is safe to do so.Yes, these things all need proper managing and organising. So why don’t schools ask local business leaders to help them with the logistics and arrangements To socially distance safely, we may need to cut class sizes in half and have twice as many classrooms, so why not look to use dferent spaces, for example empty community halls, empty libraries, empty offices etc.What about outdoor learning in small groups If we cut classrooms by half we will need twice as many teachers.So how about encouraging unemployed graduates to work as teaching assistants Or asking retired teachers to come out of retirement, just as many nurses did at the beginning of the pandemic.You know you can find the solution when it’s your problem to solve. Which is why any government and any Cabinet should be as representational of “real le” as possible, which is why we need more women advising the Prime Minister.That said, no doubt many women just don’t fancy a le in politics. When you look at the abuse, death treats, and sexism they face, who can blame them.But unless there are people from all walks of le — including women — in the Cabinet, then the issues that affect real people will not be properly tackled or solved.Just look at the incredible effect that some of the world’s female leaders have had when they’ve acted swtly and decisively in the face of Covid-.Germany’s Angela Merkel has kept deaths in her country down to just  per million — compared to  per million in the UK.New Zealand’s inspiring Jacinda Ardern has overseen a remarkable response to the pandemic which involved a rapid, draconian lockdown.Only  people died there. She has been widely praised for her strength in leadership.These daily UK Government press briefings have made it all too clear that we are crying out for more women at the helm.The steady stream of menfielding questions on the topics of the day has been alarming. Priti Patel’s appearances could be counted on one hand.It does make you wonder whether we’d be in a healthier positionmore women had been given more prominence in Boris’s Cabinet.I think we would be.Until recently, many people knew Maya Jama as the girlfriend of rapper Stormzy, but they broke up as a couple last year.What people are now gradually realising is that she has had a fantastic career in her own right – and she proved it last week when she stole the show while co-presenting Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer on BBC.And it wasn’t because her low-cut top, inset, raised a few eyebrows, though certainly not mine.As she rightly pointed out, she can dress how she pleases.She stole the show because she is good at what she does and is engaging.At the age of  she has already done a stint on MTV, DJing on Rinse FM, a job on Radio , and now she is presenting Saturday night TV.Andit weren’t for Covid- she would be acting in her first film around about now too.Plus, as a sideline she is launching a skincare range and has a mysterious big project brewing – rumoured by some to be Strictly Come Dancing.In fact, she said in an interview this week that lockdown is the first time since she was  that she has had such an extended rest .All of this would be impressive for any -year-old but way more so when you know that Maya’s father was in and out of prison for much of her childhood. And not only that – in  when she was , her then boyfriend, Rico Gordon, was killed in a shooting.These are the kind of le experiences that can lead young people down a very dferent track to the one that Maya has put herself on, and for that alone she deserves our admiration.But really we should admire her solely because she is so good at what she does, and such a brave and eloquent voice for her generation.Kate Ferdinand has announced she is pregnant and expecting her first child with husband of nine months Rio.It really could not happen to a nicer or more deserving couple, as evidenced by the fact that when they told Rio’s three children – Lorenz, , Tate, , and nine-year-old Tia – the youngsters jumped up and down with joy.That is the reaction of children who have been made to feel happy, secure and, above all, loved by their father and his new we, despite having gone through the pain of losing their mother.Kate put the video on Instagram with the caption: “The crazy house is about to get a little bit crazier . . . every time I watch this it makes me cry, the best reaction. Baby Ferdy, we are all so excited to meet you.”Good luck to them.About bloody time.This is an opportunity to be seized.If we think carefully about how to spend the money in the right way, we can achieve a great deal of good in this country – and God knows we need that right now.I am sure I’m not the only one having mixed feelings about shops reopening and the huge step back towards “normality” that we all took this week.On the one hand it feels like a huge relief.Thank goodness things are moving again.On the other, I’m a bit worried about how to get out of my pyjamas, start wearing make-up and navigate my working wardrobe again.On balance, though, I’m excited for us to all start doing what we can to get the economy growing again.Talking of shops reopening, I didn’t enjoy the level of scorn being heaped by people on social media on to the huge queues outside Primark stores, which re-opened on Monday.I think before they are so judgmental they should stop for a minute and consider that many people do not have credit cards so cannot shop online.But not only that – say what you like about Primark clothes, one thing they are is cheap.Families with kids who have grown out of their gear over lockdown couldn’t wait to get in there to grab what they needed, and there was a distinctly snobbish element to some people’s judgment.They should think before they speak.Photos of Reese Witherspoon running in a baseball cap with her face concealed by a mask made me realise celebs everywhere – especially those with lockdown hair and faces that might need a bit of  TLC – are seeing this season’s new must-have accessory as an opportunity to conceal a multitude of sins.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They do what they are told to by top brass but these horribly mixed messages are not a good look.It was once commonplace to hear that this country has the best police force in the world. When was the last time you heard that But it was true. Think of the late PC Keith Palmer, who died in  while heroically preventing a kne-wielding Islamist terrorist from entering the Palace of ­Westminster.Yet during this lockdown, there has been a steady draining away of respect for the police.How we all chortled to learn that in Hampshire,  per cent of police are now overweight or obese — the fat-buttocked blue line.While in London, when a ­protester leapt in front of the PM’s car causing a minor crash, it was hardly a complete surprise to see day-dreaming officers gormlessly staring off into space, as oblivious as Keystone Cops in a coma.There is a growing lack of respect for the police and that is the reason why  officers were injured in one weekend.The ordinary copper has been poorly led, leading to inevitable inaction the moment they are met by protesters or a crowd of eager shoppers at Nike Town.Their own senior officers seem far more concerned about ­displaying their politically correct credentials rather than anything resembling law and order. More than  years ago, the Macpherson Report into the death of Stephen Lawrence in South East London found the Met Police to be ­“institutionally racist”.There has been a great overhaul in the force since.It is hugely welcome that there are Black Asian and Minority ­Ethnicofficers now in senior Scotland Yard roles. This was long overdue.But there is still a long way to go before the force can be regarded as being truly erse.Five of the nation’s police forces have only one black officer.Forces in Durham, North ­Yorkshire, Warwickshire, Dyfed-Powys and North Wales had only one black officer in their ranks each as of March last year.This doesn’t mean our officers should be drawn into events like the death of George Floyd , miles away.It should be self-evident that British police were not in any way responsible for that death in Minneapolis.And yet a statement issued on behalf of Britain’s Chief Constables solemnly stated: “We stand alongside all those across the globe who are appalled and ­horried by the way George Floyd lost his le.“Justice and accountability should follow. We will tackle bias, racism or discrimination wherever we find it.”But the appalling racist violence of American cops — or indeed, when the police go on a violent rampage in Paris or Hong Kong — should not be clumsily confused with the issues our bobbies face here.As the violent clashes of the past few weeks have demonstrated, our officers should be focused on our own problems dealing with crime on our own streets.PAMELA ANDERSON ­promotes fake leather vegan handbags.You would never guess it’s mostly plastic.The bag, I mean. Not Pam.“Is Dad a James Bond fan by any chance ” cooed Britt on the website Cameo. “I’m here to fulfil your wildest desires.”Wow – you’ve got one old dad going now, Britt!You couldn’t get me a signed photo of Ana de Armas, could you AND they’re off!” cried Lizzie Cundy. No, not her clothes – the horses.“Doing this year’s Ascot at home,” sighs Lizzie.Just as well. They would never have let her into the Royal Enclosure carrying that glass of champagne.SIR KEIR STARMER, Labour’s gutless leader, is scared ­witless of upsetting his union paymasters so he can’t bring himself to admit that opening our schools is safe – despite sending his own children to school throughout the lockdown.Same old Labour – always hypocrites when it comes to educating their children. One law for them etc.Meanwhile, the Government is finally showing some urgency about getting the schools open again for all, pumping £billion into state schools over the next year, including £million for the most disadvantaged children.It beggars belief that non-essential shops have reopened while schools remain closed or see only a trickle of pupils.There are no non-essential children.DOMINIC RAAB says he would only take the knee for his missus and the Queen.Cue widespread and totally predictable outrage from the likes of Labour’s permanently apoplectic David Lammy.But as Raab’s Jewish father Peter fled the Nazis as a six-year-old Czech in , I don’t think the Foreign Secretary needs lessons in opposing racism from anyone.And to many of us, “taking the knee” looks like a servile and empty gesture, bowing down before the great gods of woke.During World War Two, there were those who thought Dame Veras songs were too sentimental for fighting men who might never see home again.But with We’ll Meet Again and The White Clfs Of Dover, Vera gave hope in the darkness all around.It is signicant that the Queen chose that immortal phase “We will meet again” in her address to the nation at the height of the pandemic.Some songs last for ever.DAN WALKER, the BBC presenter, mocks a supporter of the online campaign Defund The BBC as “a Russian bot” – meaning a fake account run by foreign communists who seek our demise.Oh, Dan! Defund The BBC was started by a smart young Glasgow University student called James Yucel.And there are millions who believe that the funding model of the BBC is laughably old-fashioned in the age of Netflix, Amazon and the rest.Sometimes I think it is the BBC’s preachy, ridiculously overpaid presenters such as Gary Lineker, Emily Maitlis and deluded Dan Walker, above, who are the Russian bots – planted to hasten the end of the BBC.Great, but Lewis is paid £million a year by the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One team – and , forced labourers once toiled in Mercedesfactories in Nazi Germany.I drive a BMW, who also used slaves under the Nazis.When it comes to symbols of racism, Lewis, German carmakers take some beating.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Scientists had predicted that the Arctic wouldnt reach those temperatures until  - meaning it had warmed  years faster than they had expected. The temperature was  degrees higher than normal andits confirmed by World Meteorological Organisation , it will be the warmest temperature recorded in the Arctic Circle.If its confirmed, the temperature of .F recorded in Verkhoyansk on June  will be a record high in the Arctic Circle - surpassing the current high of F which was recorded at Fort Yukon, Alaska in .Verkhoyansk currently holds the Guinness World Record for the greatest temperature range on earth - fluctuating from minus C to a high of .C. On the same day, Cancun, Mexico experienced a high of C -potentially seven degrees lower than in the Arctic Circle.The heatwave is set to continue as temperatures in the Siberian town are expected to reach highs of C this week. Verkhoyansk is usually one of the coldest places on Earth as the area reached nearly  degrees below Fahrenheit in \" href\"https:www.cbsnews news arctic-hottest-temperature-ever \" target\"_blank\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"November. This unprecedented heat isnt an isolated occurrence as Russia recently experienced its warmest winter in  years where temperatures were -C hotter than normal. Scientists have also recorded unusually hot weather in the Arctic, with a heatwave occurring relatively early in the year.Earlier this month, Nizhnyaya Pesha, about ,km from Moscow, \" href\"https:www.thesun news  arctic-record-temperature-june--degrees-climate-change \" target\"_blank\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"was hotter than Benidorm as temperatures soared to C.Dr Gareth Marshall, senior climatologist at the British Antarctic Survey, said \" href\"https:www.thesun news  arctic-record-temperature-june--degrees-climate-change \" target\"_blank\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"such a high temperature in June shows how quickly the Arctic environment is changing because of global warming.He warned such high temperatures lower the moisture content of soils, making the ground more vulnerable to wildfires.Dr Marshall added warmer weather causes carbon sinks in Arctic wetlands, forests and soil to break down and release emissions - further accelerating climate change.In April, many parts of Asia - including Siberia - experienced record heat, which led to wildfires.On April , a satellite system operated by NASA captured an image of red flames and smoke blowing through at least nine regions near Kemerovo and Novosibirsk in Siberia.Anton Beneslavskiy, a forest fire and climate emergency expert, told Mongabay News: This year’s fire season has started extremely early, and fires became intensive from the very beginning.That means a possible ‘long fire summer’ with a lot of forest destruction.Last year, fires swept through  million hectaresof forest in Siberia, although Greenpeace International believe official numbers were underestimated.In the Arctic as a whole, average temperatures have risen by more than two degrees Celsius since the mid-th century, twice the global average, The Journal reports. A warming Arctic has accelerated the melting of Greenlands kilometres-thick ice sheet, resulting in a net loss of  billion tonnes of ice mass for the year – accounting for about  per cent of total sea level rise in .In April, the UNs WMO confirmed the past five years have been the hottest on record globally. This trend is likely to continue because of record levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That person was not at home.”Amaral, , led the initial investigation into Madeleine’s disappearance back in , but was removed after criticising British police officers.He also alleged, in a controversial book, that the three-year-old’s parents, Gerry and Kate McCann, had covered up their daughter’s accidental death in their Algarve holiday apartment.The McCanns claimed the book was unfounded and grossly defamatory and launched legal action against Amaral in .In , Kate and Gerry were awarded around £, in libel damages by a Portuguese court, although this decision was later overturned.Amaral has made numerous appearances on television since the emergence of Christian B as a suspect in the McCann case.He has repeated his well-known criticism of the Brit youngster’s parents and their “Tapas Seven” holiday pals.Amaral accused them of abandoning their children to eat out at night and lying to Portuguese police, and said Madeleine had been crying the night before she vanished on May , . He also branded Christian B a “scapegoat”, describing the -year-old as an “almost perfect suspect”.Amaral first claimed last April that a German paedophile who was in prison would be accused over Madeleine’s disappearance.He told a Portuguese TV interviewer last night: “When I spoke last year I was talking about the situation that’s happening now.“It matters little who the paedophile is.”He added: “He’s an almost perfect suspect. All that’s missing for him to become the perfect suspect is for him to be dead.”Askedhe believed Christian B was the man responsible for Madeleine’s disappearance, he added: “To answer that question it has to be proven first that an abduction took place.”But during his half-hour-long interview with Portuguese broadcaster TVI, he also insinuated the German authorities had altered photos of the two-tone VW camper van Christian B was using around the time Madeleine disappeared.The former PJ chief, showed interviewer Jose Alberto Carvalho photos he said were taken in Portugal of the same vehicle.One of the photos he produced showed a series of very distinctive Minion-style characters painted on the front and back of the camper van, which in the picture put out by police had no markings on it.He said: “It’s the same vehicle flagged up in the police appeal.“I think it’s important to ask why the photo put out by the authorities of the van was altered.“Would that vehicle have gone unnoticed in Praia da Luz with those markings on it  I don’t think so.”He went on to say any appeal focused on the van from the official photos without the distinctive markings would be a waste of time.He claimed detectives were not aware of Christian B’s  teenage sexual conviction for molesting a six-year-old girl.But he confessed: “At the time all we knew was that this man was a paedophile.”He also came out against German authorities’ plans to re-examine DNA evidence taken from the McCanns’ hire car and holiday apartment.Amaral rubbished reports a saliva sample had been found on Madeleine’s bedspread and could prove key to a conviction now Christian B had been identied as a new suspect.He said it had been proven it belonged to a baby being fed mother’s milk staying in the apartment before the McCanns arrived.Asked why he thought the German authorities might have interest in coming up with new information which in his opinion had no real value, Amaral claimed: “Because it enables them to have jurisdiction over this case.“I think the Portuguese police and the authorities can do anything here in laboratories that they can do in Germany.”Amaral’s interview was his first since Christian B’s name was made public - and the first time he has spoken about the case since last December.He spoke last year on Spanish TV to rule out speculation Hamburg-born child strangler Martin Ney was being probed over Madeleine’s disappearance, months after claiming on an Australian podcast that a scapegoat was being prepared by police.He failed to identy Ney by name at the time, describing the suspect only as someone who had been ruled out of the investigation into the missing British youngster in  but later jailed in his home country.Amaral told the Spanish TV programme: “A paedophile who is German and serving le for killing children has been spoken about.“What I know is that the suspect is not him, it’s another man.“He’s also in prison in Germany. He’s also a paedophile.“Years later, many years later, it appears that in an Internet chatroom there is a conversation between that person and another person where they talk about Madeleine.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are going to learn to live with this infectious disease, like we live with tuberculosis and flu. I think physical distancing will change. I am just not entirely sure when.”In Wales, people also have to follow stricter rules than across the border in England.People can meet outside - but not with more than one household. The Welsh Government has also put in guidance telling people to stay local - but new rules allow them to travel outside the five-mile radius of their home to check up on relativeson compassionate grounds. That can include visiting loved ones in care homesthe homes give permission. Schools in Wales have been told to prepare to reopen to pupils from all years from  June. People have to maintain a  metre social distancing rule with people outside their household at all times in Wales. First Minister Mark Drakeford has said that stay-local rules will stay in place until at least July .

Heat stroke, also known as sun stroke, is a medical emergency and must be treated immediately.She also offered advice on when to know the dference between heat stroke and heat exhaustion.“Heat exhaustion is caused by loss of salt and water from the body through excessive sweating. Perspiration is your body’s natural way of cooling itself. Symptoms should improve quickly by cooling and rehydrating the body, butleft untreated it can progress to heatstroke.“The symptoms are often the same in adults and children, although children may become floppy and sleepy.”Forecasters say the UK is set for record-breaking temperatures this week - prompting experts to issue a Level  heat health warning for tomorrow.The rare alert is triggered when the risk is  per cent or above for threshold temperatures being reached in one or more regions on at least two consecutive days and the intervening night.“This is an important stage for social and healthcare services who will be working to ensure readiness and swt action to reduce harm from a potential heatwave,” the Met Office said.It is working with Public Health England to help healthcare services prepare for periods of “extreme temperature”.The hottest day of the year could be recorded several times over as the mercury climbs towards  degrees in the south of the UK by Thursday.However, the record for the hottest June day ever looks set to remain in tact, as temperatures will not quite reach the .c seen in .Met Office forecaster Luke Miall said: Weve got high pressure to the South East of the UK over the next few days which is going to be drawing our air up from the continent, and the warmer climates of France and Spain.Tuesdays top temperature is expected to be around C in the South Wast of England, with other areas quite widely getting into the mid s, the forecaster said.The hottest day of the year so far was .C reached last month, and Mr Miall explained: Its likely tomorrow will beat that in the South, do it again on Wednesday and then again on Thursday.Thursday will probably be the hottest day in the region of  or  degrees, but he added thats not quite the June record from .Although its fairly uncommon to get  in June at the moment, it doesnt look like were going to break any of the records.Things will start to cool off for the weekend, and the meteorologist explained: By Saturday most places will be seeing the fresher air coming across for the weekend, so although it might still be humid at times I think generally temperatures will be falling below heatwave.With the dry and sunny weather expected and the Governments Covid- alert level lowered to three, emergency services across the country are urging people to continue to respect the two-metre social-distancing restriction.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It would have been in the paper, there would have been big talk,” Ms Smith said. Grant, who died in , is alleged to have been drinking alcohol on the night of the crash. His  acquittal attracted no major media attention.Grant was acquitted of culpable driving causing death with his lawyers arguing that Mona was behind the wheel when the car crashed.Investigators did not test for Monas fingerprints on the steering wheel. In March this year, NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller sent a letter to Attorney-General Mark Speakman stating that two independent inquiries found the police handling to be “adequate”.Mr Fuller said that because Grant is now dead, an inquest into the girls deaths “will adduce new or additional information”.Monas sister Fiona Smith said the police commissioners letters angered her.   She said: “I didnt like what I read in the letters. I dont agree with it and neither does [Monas mother]. Its like theyre ducking and weaving and no one wants to take responsibility.Ms Smiths lawyers have called on the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions to reassess its response.  “What was important was the evidence, accepted by the magistrate, that Cindy was dead when she was found by two independent witnesses, and that an alleged ­offencetook place after that,” solicitor George Newhouse from the National Justice Project said.The -year-old’s mother and Bourke indigenous elder Dawn Smith said the Director of Public Prosecutions decision to drop a sexual offence charge against Grant was “disappointing”.In  a charge against Grant to “offer indignity to a dead human body” was dropped just days out from his District Court Trial.Cindy’s family were not aware of the decision which is reportedly one of the reasons he avoided time in jail. The interference with a corpse charge was later dropped because the coroner was unable to determine the exact time that Cindy died and may have been alive while she was assaulted. Grant never faced any jail time before dying in . Last year the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions apologised for failing to inform the family of the withdrawal of charges but maintained it made the correct legal decision.  “I have not been able to identy any error in the ultimate decision that was made or this ­offices consideration of the relevant legal issues,” NSW Public Prosecutions, Huw Baker SC, told the family in a letter from last November.     Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But when the coronavirus crisis struck, the two of them were plunged into compulsory lockdown on the beautul -acre isle off the Pembrokeshire coast. With only seabirds for company, the situation has left them even more isolated than usual. Sylwia, who is using her spare time to learn the ukulele, says: “Every few weeks we take our boat to collect our online supermarket order from friends, and we alternate cooking duties. “You need to be OK with being in isolation, and not being able to just pop to the shops. You have to plan ahead and be able to enjoy the changes in the weather.”  In normal times, Skomer attracts up to  visitors a day, drawn by the chance to see the island’s wildle - but coronavirus cut this off virtually overnight, and the Wildle Trusts was faced with having to withdraw the wardens. However, thanks to a grant from The National Lottery Heritage Fund – part of a wider £m National Lottery allocation to help good causes affected by the pandemic’s impact – Nathan and Sylwia can continue protecting Skomer’s unique bird habitats.  National Lottery players have raised £m which will support good causes through the coronavirus. We’re facing exceptional times brought about by the global pandemic. But thanks to you, essential funding is being distributed over the next few months to charities, projects and the good causes most impacted by coronavirus. Click here to learn more about how you are helping - or visit national-lottery news While living on the island, Nathan initially came down with symptoms of the coronavirus and had to self-isolate for two weeks, then the pair struggled to get food deliveries But now they’re embracing the situation. Their work involves collecting data on breeding seabirds, including puffins and Manx shearwaters, and helping to protect them from other species – humans among them. “The island is really fragile,” says Nathan. “Puffins and shearwaters nest in burrows, so the ground is like a honeycomb. It’s important that people stay on the paths.”  Both are missing their families on the mainland, though. Nathan is also craving ice cream, while Sylwia pines for fresh strawberries. Meanwhile they, and two other wardens, have been sharing their work online via video blogs. And despite the crisis, the pair are counting their blessings.“We know how lucky we are to have a job on a remote island,” says Nathan. “We appreciate all the support from The National Lottery and the people who play it.” “It’s a very special place to work in and it’s definitely a privilege,” Sylwia adds Next we hear from another duo who have been separated from their loved ones in lockdown in Slough and find out how theyaposve been making the most of it too... Pensioners transform lounge into yoga studio  Like many loving grandparents, Rajinder and Usha Mehta have found being separated from their family in lockdown a challenge. But the couple have made the most of their time by turning their lounge into a yoga and dance studio, thanks to online classes run by a local National Lottery-funded community group. Rajinder, , and Usha, , live in Slough. While they’ve at least been able to see their son and two-year-old youngest granddaughter from a distance, they have also managed to stay close to their wide circle of friends through shared virtual exercise classes, WhatsApp groups, regular phone calls and even cooking challenges. The couple have been active members of the National Lottery-funded Apna Virsa voluntary community organisation for four years. It was co-founded by friends Seema Kamboj and Bobbi Johal in , with the aim of bringing together members of the vibrant South Asian community in the Slough area. Since then it has grown to have hundreds of members, and works in close partnership with other community groups, running yoga, pilates, wellbeing and bhangra dance classes, alongside community meet-ups and other services catering for a broad age range and uniting people from many dferent cultures. “Social isolation is a big issue, particularly among older members of the community, and early on we also recognised a need around peopleaposs health,” says Seema. “We’ve always consulted with the local community about the kind of services they want, and the classes we run have proved really popular.  “When lockdown hit, we knew we had to keep bringing people together, so we ran with the challenge and moved our classes online.

Pubs, hairdressers, hotels, campsites, restaurants, cinemas, museums and galleries can open bang on Saturday  July - despite fears itaposs too soon to unlock the nation, especially all at once. Two households will also be able to meet indoors and even stay overnight - as long as they maintain social distancing. And the two-metre social distancing rule will be cut down to a one metre plus rule, with people able to be closerthey sit side-by-side or wear a mask. The death toll of people with coronavirus in the UK today passed , and stands at ,. And scientists warn the risk of catching Covid- is ten times higher at m away than m away. Yet Boris Johnson told his Cabinet the changes were crucial to rescue the economy, which has plunged into recession thanks to the pandemic. He told Parliament: Our long national hibernation is beginning to come to an end.But the PM also warnedthe virus surges too soon, the nation will be forced back into lockdown potentially region by region. Todayaposs changes come after the PM held a crunch meeting with his two top scientic advisors last night. The trio will appear later today at the pm press conference to offer more explanation. Later we are expecting detailed guidance on exactly what pubs, hotels and other venues will have to look like when they reopen. But key venues including hostels, soft play areas, gyms, swimming pools and nightclubs all remain shut. So what exactly has the Prime Minister announced so far and how will it affect you  Hereaposs everything you need to know. Things you can do from July  Venues that CAN reopen in England from July  All these venues can reopen in England providing they can show they are aposCovid-secureapos:Hotels and BBs Holiday apartments or homes Cottages or bungalows Campsites Caravan parks Boarding houses Places of worship Libraries Community centres Restaurants, cafes and workplace canteens Bars Pubs Cinemas Bingo halls Theatres and concert halls - but on the basis it’s not a live performance. They can only screen past performances for example Museums and galleries Hair salons and barbers Outdoor playgrounds Outdoor gyms Funfairs Theme parks Adventure parks and activities Amusement arcades Other indoor leisure centres and facilities - including indoor gaming, social clubs, model villages, and indoor attractions at aquariums and zoos.You can finally visit friends and family indoors - but you canapost hug  People in England can have friends and family round to their house to eat, hang out and stay overnight from July  - but they can’t hug. For the first time since March, indoor gatherings will be allowed between two households who havenapost joined together in a “bubble”. Bubbles - a permanent joining of two households which let people break social distancing rules - aren’t being expanded, for now. But new rules will allow two households in England to meet indoors. This applies to all indoor gatherings, be they in private homes or in places like pubs. When you are indoors, your household will be able to meet with one other household at a time. That potentially includes staying over at someone’s house.  There is no limit on the size of either of the households which can meet. And unlike with bubbles, ’exclusivity’ is not required. So you can have one friend round for a meal one weekend and another friend round another weekend. But there’s a big catch - these households should continue to remain socially distant from one another when they meet, That means following the m or ‘m plus’ guidance, and also following other advice such as regular hand washing. You can meet more people outdoors  There will be a slight change to the rules for people meeting outdoors from July . Currently up to six people from up to six households can meet in a park or garden,they maintain social distancing. This will continue, but there will also now be another option. Two households of any size - for example, two families of four - will now also be allowed to meet outdoors, as long as they maintain social distancing. So you can either meet five friends from dferent households, or an unlimited number of friends from one household. The two-metre rule will be cut  Changes will be made to the -metre rule in England from July . Where it’s not possible to stay  metres apart, people will instead be advised to keep to a social distance of “one metre plus”. This means staying one metre apart - plus mitigations which reduce the risk of transmission. On public transport it means people stay one metre away but with a face covering. In other spaces it will likely mean having screens between tables, making sure people face away from each other, putting in hand washing facilities, minimising amount of time spent with people from dferent households., and being outdoors where possible. Government sources claim having such mitigations in place at one metre away can have a “broadly equivalent impact” on transmission as staying two metres apart. But it comes despite grave warnings of the danger of moving people closer together. Scientists say the risk of catching coronavirus from someone is  to  times higher at one metre away compared to two metres away. Yet now fewer people have coronavirus in society overall, the overall risk of catching it is lower. And Tory MPs and the pub trade have piled pressure on Boris Johnson to cut the distance to save the economy. Crucially, the review was led by No and while it took advice from scientists, they had no powers of veto. Economists also contributed to the review.  Pubs, bars, restaurants, cafes and workplace canteens can all reopen in England from July  - both indoor and outdoors. But thereaposs a catch -youaposre indoors, you can only meet with people from one other household. And you should still maintain social distancing rules. That means staying either two metres apart, or one metre apart with mitigation measuresyou canapost manage two metres. It means no propping up the bar or standing in groups, and pubs will be encouraged to have table service where possible. All venues - from pubs to places of worship - will be expected to keep a record of people who visit, to enable contact tracing. But landlords won’t be expected to police what household customers belong to, or check ID of everyone coming in. Guidance for pubs will be published later today. You can get a haircut - but canapost get your nails done  Hairdressers and barbers will be allowed to reopen in England from July  with protective measures - including face visors for those cutting hair. It means millions of Brits can finally get a haircut after more than three months of having their locks chopped at home. But nail salons, which involve people sitting face to face, will remain shut for the foreseeable. You can go on staycation to English hotels, BBs and campsites - but not hostels  Hotels, BBs, holiday apartments or homes, cottages or bungalows, campsites, caravan parks and boarding houses can all reopen to paying guests in England from July . Again, they must follow Covid-secure guidelines - but people will be able to stay overnight away from their home. Despite concerns over shared facilities, campsites will be able to reopen in England from July . This would include showers and washing-up blocks. There will be Covid-secure guidelines to minimise the spread of the virus. But hostels with shared bedrooms cannot yet. This is dferent to Wales which is keeping both campsites and hostels shut. You can go to visit cinemas, galleries and museums  The government has now officially set the date of Saturday  July for cinemas, galleries and museums to reopen in England. Guidance will be published shortly on how to keep them safe - including one-way systems, spaced queuing, increased ventilation, and pre-booked tickets. A No source said: We are only able to move forward this week because the vast majority of people have taken steps to control the virus. But the more we open up, the more important it is that everyone follows the social distancing guidelines. We will not hesitate to reverse these stepsit is necessary to stop the virus running out of control.  Today comes hot on the heels of last nightaposs announcement that shielding will be eased for .million vulnerable people in England. From July  shielding people can go out and meet up to five friends - andthey live alone, form a aposbubbleapos with another household. From August , the advice to shield ends completely. But Statutory Sick Pay and direct food parcels for the shielding will also end on August , prompting alarm. Thereaposs also anger at the failure to have a legal safeguard against people being forced back to work. Things you still canapost do from July  Venues that CANaposT reopen in England from July  Government sources said “it’s not felt that at this moment in time it’s possible” for those venues to reopen. Task forces will be set up to try to get these venues open in a safe way. Nightclubs Bowling alleys and skating rinks Indoor play areas including soft play Spas Nail bars Beauty salons Swimming pools Tattoo and piercing studios Massage parlours Water parks Indoor fitness and dance studios Gyms Conference centres, other than for people who already work there. You canapost go to the gym  Government sources said gyms remain shut because there is a “far greater risk of infection” due to people breathing harder and touching surfaces. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden later insisted: Subject to public health, our aspiration is to reopen gyms  leisure facilities in mid-July. You canapost send your child to school  Only years R,  and  are allowed back to primary schools in England at the moment. The government wants all children back in September - but was forced to drop plans to do it earlier. Full plans for September are due to be announced next week. You canapost see a live theatre show  Theatres and concert halls can reopen in England from July  - with a catch. They can only reopen on the basis it’s not a live performance. Instead theatres and concert halls can screen past performances. Government sources said theatres have an issue with ensuring the actors themselves can move around the stage in a safe way. You canapost sing in church Worship will be allowed - but not full singing services due to the risk of spreading the virus. There will be further guidance about singing. You can get married, but not have a proper reception  Wedding services with up to  people will be allowed from July . But trips to indoor hospitality venues should still only be with one other household - in other words, the rules make wedding receptions almost impossible. This also applies to baptisms and Bar Mitzvahs and other “le cycle events”. The number of people allowed to celebrate a wedding will be increased at some point but it’s not known when or by how much. You canapost play cricket, football or rugby, except with your own household "},{"url":null,"title":"government commits implementing windrush review","story":"NewsGovernment commits to implementing Windrush review recommendations in fullPriti Patel pledged toto the House of Commons to explain what action will beShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN News \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

And she said more than £m has been offered in compensation to those affected by the scandal. But her announcement was met with a string of reports from MPs of constituents who still have outstanding cases two years on. Labour criticised the government for being too slow to respond - having managed to compensate just  people so far.Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas Symonds said: “That rate of progress is just too slow given the number of years that have elapsed since this scandal first came to light and already this scheme has been in operation for over a year. Ms Patel refused to apologise for the pace of compensation as the inidual cases are “complicated”, but admitted it had been “far too slow” She pledged toto the Commons with a further statement later in the year, confirming what specic actions would be taken to meet the demands of the report. The Home Secretary told MPs: I was clear when Wendy Williams published her Lessons Learned Review that I would listen and I would act. I have heard what she has said and I will be accepting the recommendations she has made in full. I am committed to ensuring that the Home Office delivers for each part of the community it serves and I will come back to update the House on how we will be implementing the recommendations before the summer recess. It comes after the Home Secretary announced a new working group to right the wrongs suffered by the Windrush generation. Ms Patel will chair the new Windrush Cross-Government Working Group with Bishop Derek Webley as part of the Governmentaposs efforts to address the scandal. SNP justice and home affairs spokeswoman Joanna Cherry called for a root and branch review of the hostile environment policy. She said: Itaposs all very well to agree that Black Lives Matter, but actions speak louder than words and the reality is that many of this Governmentaposs immigration policies continue to have disproportionate impacts on BAME communities andthe Home Secretary does not carry out the root and branch review of the hostile environment policy this will continue.

And he was using a ft-long American-style Tfin Allegro motor home in  when he allegedly bragged to an acquaintance in early : “I can transport children, kids in this space. “Drugs and children, you can transport them in this van, nobody can find you, nobody can catch you.” On Monday it was reported he was also the registered owner of a white Mercedes-Benz D van and a grey Opel Ascona when Madeleine went missing.

He was allowed to keep the German-plated vehicle after being stopped for using a disabled parking bay - but told he could not use it because he had failed to put it on Portuguese plates despite living on the Algarve.

Chantelle Bennett, , and her partner Rebecca Tantrum, , lashed out at Paul Sutton after he grabbed their dogaposs lead to prevent further attack. Prosecutor Matthew Roberts said Mr Sutton had been walking his own dog when Bennett and Tantrumaposs pet bit him outside their flat. But the women became enraged when Mr Sutton took hold of the animalaposs lead in a bid to control it. Mr Roberts said: Chantelle Bennett was shouting at Mr Sutton, ‘Let go of my dog’. She was screaming at him. “She approached with a bottle in her hand and she was indeed trying to hit his partner with the bottle. “Mr Sutton pushed her to the back of the neck and to the floor. “She smashed the bottle of Desperadoes alcohol. Rebecca Tantrum left the address and came towards Mr Sutton with the hammer. “During the incident, Bennett shouted, ‘Go on. Whack him!’ and Tantrum said, ‘I’m going to kill you.’”  CCTV showed Tantrum swinging the hammer at Mr Suttonaposs body and Bennett punching him before the three fall to the floor. Cardf Crown Court heard they grappled before police arrived at the scene in Newport city centre. Bennett and Tantrum, of Newport, admitted actual bodily harm and Tantrum also admitted possessing an offensive weapon and cannabis. Jeffrey Jones, defending, Bennett said: “There was an element of provocation. She was manhandled to the ground.” Rosamund Rutter, for Tantrum, said: “She is appalled by her actions.” But the women were spared jail because of police delays in bringing the case to court. Judge Jeremy Jenkins said he was unable to lock the women up because the attack happened almost a year ago and the women hadnapost been charged sooner. He said: Each of these defendants deserves to go immediately into custody for their violent behaviour.

The Met Office pollen map shows levels are very high for most of England today, with just the north of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland hitting medium and high. Wednesday is the worst day for pollen with the whole of the UK, bar the north of Scotland, measuring very high levels. For those affected, luckily by Thursday and Friday some areas are given some respite with levels ing to just high. Although those in Wales, the south east and all of the east coast remain at very high even as the weekend begins. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here Most people being affected by pollen in June are allergic to grass or weed pollen. The Met Office says tree pollen occurs first in the UK, typically from late March to mid-May. Grass lasts from mid-May until July, and weed pollen covers the end of June to September.  However, dependent upon where you live in the UK, the hay fever season will start at dferent times. There’s a later start and shorter season in the north of the UK, where generally there is less pollen. Urban areas have lower counts than the countryside, and places inland have higher counts than around the coast. A Met Office spokesman said: There are also loads of factors that change the start date of the pollen season. Low temperatures in winter will keep plants and trees dormant for longer into the new year.  Essentially, the lower the temperature the less pollen is produced, but, this can changesoil and air temperatures in spring are higher than normal. Today has seen the start of an official heatwave in the UK. The Met Office says that heatwaves are counted when a temperature peaks at  in London and  in the north for three consecutive days. Crowds have been spotted at beaches across the country, soaking up the good weather. Some who were photographed in Bournemouth were seen frolicking on the beach and in the sea.  Although the offical heatwave temperature was missed yesterday, the meteorologists expect it to be easily hit on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday before thunderstorm hit parts of the country. Hay fever affects almost  million people in England, equating to almost one in four adults and  in  children, and research shows that the number of sufferers is rising, year on year.

Professor Sarah Gilbert, leading the University of Oxford vaccine trial, said that when Covid- transmission was high, lockdown was imposed to bring the rate down. But since then rates have dropped, and the trial relies on a sufficient number of volunteers to have been exposed to the virus to see whether a vaccine protects them or not. However,their chances of being in contact with an infected person are low, it will take a long time to demonstrate the efficacy of a vaccine candidate. Prof Gilbert told the House of Lords Science and Technology committee: Of course, what happened was that because it [transmission] actually increased much more rapidly than anybody thought was going to happen, we had the lockdown, which fortunately reduced transmission. Not so fortunate for those of us trying to develop vaccines in the UK, because we now have essentially a very large safety immunogenicity study, running in the UK with little chance, frankly, of determining efficacy. She added that the researchersapos approach was to work with multiple dferent countries in dferent settings to give them the best chance of seeing efficacy in at least one of those countries. The committee heard the Oxford team is already running a trial in Brazil because the numbers of transmissions are much higher than in the UK. As soon as we get a signal of efficacy and can compare that to the level of immunity that weaposre generating, that gives all vaccine developers really helpful information to let them know whether their vaccines are likely to work as well, and whether it will be one dose or two doses, and in older people and in younger people, she said. Follow all coronavirus updates here on our live blog So the first efficacy signal is going to be really important and as yet we donapost know which country will be generating that. Prof Gilbert and Professor Robin Shattock, who is leading the Imperial College London trial, said they were optimistic about their vaccine approaches but cautioned that optimism should be balanced against known risk of success. Prof Shattock said vaccine success rates tend to be at about % once you start clinical testing, but added: I think in the UK we are very lucky that we have two [vaccine] candidates that are already in clinical evaluation. We think that probably both of those will work inidually.

Boris Johnson today told the House of Commons that places of worship will be able to open for prayer and services - including weddings - with a maximum of  people.This will be subject to social distancing measures, he said. But trips to indoor hospitality venues should still only be with one other household, the Mirror understands, which could make wedding receptions almost impossible. This also applies to baptisms and Bar Mitzvahs and other “le cycle events”. The PM acknowledged the dficulties people have endured with places of worship being closed, mentioning the Islamic celebration of Eid which fell during the lockdown period. The Mirror understands that while public worship will be allowed, full singing services will not due to the risk of spreading the virus. It comes as the PM today revealed a massive number of changes to the lockdown rules from July  in England. Boris Johnson said that from July , two households of any size should be able to meet in any setting. He said: From now on, we will ask people to follow guidance on social contact instead of legislation. In that spirit, we advise that from July , two households of any size should be able to meet in any setting inside or out. That does not mean they must always be the same two households, it will be possible for instance to meet one set of grandparents one weekend, the others the following weekend. But we are not recommending meetings of multiple households indoors because of the risk of creating greater chains of transmission.  Mr Johnson also announced that restaurants and pubs will be allowed to reopen. He said: I can tell the House that we will also reopen restaurants and pubs. All hospitality indoors will be limited to table service and our guidance will encourage minimal staff and customer contact. We will ask businesses to help NHS Test and Trace respond to any local outbreaks by collecting contact details from customers as happens in other countries and we will work with the sector to make this manageable.  The PM said hairdressers will also be allowed to reopen. Mr Johnson said: Almost as eagerly awaited as a pint will be a haircut, particularly by me, and so we will reopen hairdressers with appropriate precautions, including the use of visors. We also intend to allow some other close contact services such as nail bars to reopen as soon as we can when we are confident that they can operate in a Covid-secure way. And the PM added: From July , provided that no more than two households stay together, people will be free to stay overnight in self-contained accommodation including hotels and bed and breakfasts, as well as camp sites, as long as shared facilities are kept clean.

Up and down the country people have been standing on markers to ensure they stay cm behind the person ahead, and trying to visualise what two metres looks like when thereaposs no guide to help them. The move, recommended by the UK governmentaposs top scientic advisers, was implemented in March to help slow down the spread of coronavirus. While itaposs possible for people queuing in supermarkets and to enter high street stops, pub landlords and restaurateurs have said the rules would prevent them from making any money when theyaposre allowed to reopen. On Tuesday Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed the new one metre plus rule that would help businesses in England, such as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and hotels, reopen from early July. What is the one metre plus rule  This new social distancing measurement would mean people can be one metre away from people they donapost live with,they make additional efforts to protect themselves. Efforts to mitigate transmission include avoiding face-to-face seating, reducing the number of people inside, improving ventilation, installing protective screens and additional hand sanitiser.

When the coronavirus lockdown is eased from July , customers may be required to show ID when they order a drink or food, and car parks could be transformed into beer gardens. It will be table service only, tables will be spaced apart or ided by perspex screens, and some pubs will use menus that will be thrown out after each use. Pubs, restaurants and hotels are expected to turn their spaces inside out this summer as they reopen their doors for the first time since late March in a bid to save the hard pressed hospitality sector.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email.     Boris Johnson has set out plans to allow pubs, restaurants, hotels, museums, theme parks and cinemas, among other places, to begin re-opening. The Prime Minister announced the Governmentaposs keenly-awaited review of the two-metre social-distancing rule on Tuesday, confirming it would be cut to one metre plus. The move follows intense pressure from some Tory MPs who have said easing the two-metre requirement is key to re-opening the hospitality sector. Many pubs and restaurants have been operating takeaway and delivery services. But the sector has warned that it would simply not be viable for them to operate as long as the two-metre rule remains in place, and thousands of jobs are at risk. Some scientists have, however, expressed concern the Government is moving too quickly, and that its track-and-trace system to contain any fresh outbreaks is not fully up and running. Here is what pubs could look like when they reopen from July , a day being dubbed Super Saturday. Book before visiting a pub  Punters may have to pre-book a table as pubs try to manage numbers due to social distancing restrictions. Some pubs have said all their tables have already been reserved on opening day. Health Secretary Matt Hancock had earlier suggested people may have to register their details online before they visit a pub. It would be part of contacting tracing efforts in case of a fresh Covid- outbreak. Mr Hancock told Sky Newsapos Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme: I wouldnapost rule it out, it isnapost a decision weaposve taken yet, but there are other countries in the world that take that approach. PPE Pubs and restaurants will have to adhere to extremely strict rules. Staff are likely to be wearing PPE such as face coverings, plastic face shields or gloves. Ban on ordering at bar  Punters will be banned from ordering at the bar in a bid to prevent crowding and limit contact between customers and staff. Instead, customers will be required to order at their table or through a smartphone app. Show ID when you order Each customer will be required to leave their name and contact details when they arrive. This measure would allow the authorities to carry out contact tracing should a Covid- outbreak occur. It had been suggested pubs and restaurants could ask customers to show ID to prevent them from leaving a fake name.  The industry hit out at that idea, citing privacy concerns and saying it would put unfair pressure on pubs because there is no similar requirement for retail shops. Pubs could be patrolled There was a suggestion at the weekend that pubs could be patrolled to make sure social distancing rules are being followed. By the time pubs reopen, the two-metre rule will likely be slashed to one metre or one metre plus. No standing outdoors  There could be a ban on standing while enjoying a pint with friends outside some pubs. In Westminster, central London, the council is planning to transform places such as Chinatown and Soho into a continental-style outdoor dining area in a bid to keep restaurants and bars afloat. The plans include a ban on standing and drinking outside. Beer gardens in car parks Ministers are drawing up plans allowing pub car parks and hotel grounds to be converted into temporary beer gardens this summer, thereported. Legislation to be introduced as early as Thursday will include changes to licensing laws to allow pubs, restaurants and hotels to turn their spaces inside out this summer.  It is hoped it will lead to a surge in al fresco dining and drinking. A source told the newspaper: At the moment, you [pubs and restaurants] have to specy in the plan for your licence where you are selling and serving alcohol. Beer gardens tend to be licensed already but car parks arenapost. You could have little courtyards that would be normally used for storage, car parks or land that you donapost normally license. A lot of hotels will have huge gardens but wonapost have an outdoor licence. Extended hours or one-off events Changes to the law would make it easier for pubs, restaurants and hotels to hold one-off events or extend the hours and activities permitted under their licence, thereported. More applications for road and street closures would also be granted, the report added. Social distancing  Punters will be required to maintain social distancing and pubs will undertake several measures to make it happen. Tables will be placed far apart and some pubs could install perspex screens. Some pubs could use disposable menus that are binned after a single use. Others could use a blackboard or a digital form. Restaurants can no longer lay tables in advance. Strict sanitising measures will be in place. Customer limits Due to the social distancing requirements, there will be a limit on how many customers are allowed. It could mean one in, one out policies or having to book a slot to help manage numbers. Some pubs could also use one-way systems for entering and exiting premises. Book a toilet break A Manchester tech firm has developed an app called Sort-It, which pubs and restaurants can use to force customers to book a trip to the toilet. It can also be used to order food and drink from the table.

Steve Challice, from Southampton, claims he took the picture of what he describes as a big fish while on holiday in Scotland. He estimated that it was  feet away and about  feet long. After sharing the image of the large creature emerging from the water online, people began commenting that it might be Nessie while others speculated whether the picture was real.But even Steve is sceptical, the Daily Record reports. He says he believes it to be something more mundane like a big fish or a seal. Personally I know there has been some interest and some people are saying itaposs the monster but I donapost believe that, he admitted. Steve was on holiday with his brother in September when they decided to visit Urquhart Castle on the banks of the famous loch. Spotting the chance to get away from the majority of the other tourists who had just arrived in a couple of coaches, Steve explained that he was initially photographing the opposite shore when he saw a sort of ripple in the water. He said: I started taking a couple of shots and then this big fish came to the surface and then went back down again. It only appeared in one shot and to be honest that was something of a fluke. I watched for a while as you can see from the last picture but didnapost see it again. He said it was only during lockdown that he has had time to look through the photos he had taken from his two week trip, stating that he had hundreds to go through as heaposs a keen photographer. Steve added he initially thought it was a catfish and only posted it online so people could try and identy it for him. He said: I have to say I donapost believe in the Loch Ness Monster and frankly I thinkanything is there then there is a logical explanation for most of the sightings. My guess would be that what I captured was a catfish or something like that. As seals get in from the sea then I expect thats what it is and that would explain why these sightings are so few and far between.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side. It shows contempt for all of us who have stuck by the rules to protect our lives and the lives of others.Boris Johnson has asked us to #move on# but this issue will not go away.

this year.Previous research indicated that macaques were protected against lung disease after a single immunisation.Now the Pirbright Institute, working with the University of Oxford, has shown that two doses of the Covid- vaccine might produce a greater immune response in pigs and therefore be a more effective approach to developing a protective response.What did the study find In the study, researchers saw a marked increase in neutralising antibodies, which bind to the virus in a way that blocks infection.It is not yet known what level of immune response will be required to protect humans against SARS-CoV- .Researchers said the finding in pigs is important as it suggests that two doses of the new vaccine could potentially give signicantly more protection in humans than a single dose.But they said further research in humans is required.What has Professor Bryan Charleston said Professor Bryan Charleston, director of the Pirbright Institute, said: ldquoThese results look encouraging that administering two injections with the same vaccine boosts antibody responses that can neutralise the virus, but it is the response in humans that is important.ldquoThe pig has proved to be a valuable model for testing human vaccines for other diseases to give an indication of the type of immune response induced and testing dferent doses.ldquoPigs are more physiologically similar to humans than some other animal models ndash for example, their body weight and metabolic rate ndash and are more accessible than studies using non-human primates.In the research, the pigs were split into two groups, with both receiving an initial dose of the vaccine, and one group receiving an identical booster immunisation on day  of the study.Latest developments are very encouragingProfessor Simon Graham, the lead author of the study, said: ldquoWhile it remains to be determined what immune responses are required to effectively protect people against Covid-, the demonstration that ChAdOx nCoV- induces both neutralising antibody and T cell responses is very encouraging.ldquoIt is likely that a combination of these responses would act in synergy to prevent and control infection, as we and others have recently shown in the context of experimental flu vaccines.What has the reaction been to this update Dr Stephen Grfin, associate professor in the school of medicine, University of Leeds, added: ldquoThe work done at Pirbright is an encouraging advance in support of the Oxford vaccine on three important fronts.,params: .pushldquoFirst, it has been conducted in a large animal model, namely pigs, which we know recapitulate human-like responses to influenza vaccines better than many other systems.ldquoSecond, it shows that a second dose of the vaccine, a so-called lsquoprime-boostrsquo strategy, gives rise to far better responses than a single inoculation, which might allay concerns arising from some of the earlier work on this and other spike-targeting vaccines.ldquoThird, it shows that the prime-boost strategy may well be achievable using the same vaccine rather than having to switch to an alternative  for the second dose, which could conceivably delay roll-out of the vaccination programme.ldquoWhilst these studies will need to be repeated within human subjects, and the precise nature and longevity of the responses might require further investigation, this is a heartening study that can be built upon and ideally followed by other potential vaccine s for SARS-CoV-."},{"url":null,"title":"staycation-five-scotlands-photogenic-places-visit-lockdown-eases","story":"WITH lockdown measures slowly beginning to ease and the coronavirus continuing to be

wearing of face coverings or face masks is already mandatory on public transport where it is not always possible to be two metres apart from other passengers.This precaution may be useful in other

scenarios such as pay points in bars and restaurants, hotel reception desks, or cinema ticket desks.ndash Handwashing and hand sanitising facilitiesSince the pandemic hit the UK, the public has been told time and time again that hand washing is absolutely vital in preventing the transmission and spread of the virus.Therefore, it is no surprise that good hand hygiene will remain a central measure which everyone must follow.When shops opened earlier this month, touch-free hand sanitation points were installed along busy shopping streets, so it is likely that these will become a regular feature

In this monthly column, she shares her wildle diary ndash and pictures!THE day I first visited Musselburgh was not one to write home about.I came to town to see the house I had already agreed to move in to. Most people would organise a viewing before deciding to move in however, since it was my fianceacutersquos childhood home, I had simply said YES!Our move-in date was already confirmed, meaning this visit was just a formality.Upon seeing the amount of work the house still needed as it underwent considerable renovation, my initial reaction was one of utter petrication that it would not be completed on time.The weather was not particularly favourable either. Drenched in the cold September rain, I had lost my appetite to explore the area, which now seemed grim and gloomy.By contrast, my second visit to Musselburgh is one worth remembering.I had come to check on the progress of the house and to join a group of birdwatchers for a stroll around the Esk and the lagoons.The walk started at the river mouth, from where we watched a couple of cormorants sunbathing.It was not long before someone raised the cry: ldquoA kingfisher!I promptly directed my camera to where everyone was looking, and I saw him: a beautul, bright blue kingfisher.After that sighting I knew my le would change.Moving to Musselburgh ended up being one of the best decisions I have made .Since that day I have been studying this wee bird.Every spare moment is spent at the river watching for our kingfisher.It has become my all-encompassing obsession.Each encounter teaches me something new and I never stop learning.This one bird inspired me in many ways, such as helping me understand the importance of fieldcraft in wildle photography, and allowed for some unforgettable captures.So, without further ado, let me formally introduce Mr KingfisherhellipThe kingfisher is an unmistakeable bird, with its metallic azure blue back and bright orange breast.The bird is usually glimpsed, a sudden flash of glistening blue, flitting at the riverbank.If you are luckyenough, the bird may comfortably land near you.Usually, despite its exotic colouration, the bird is dficult to spot sitting on a branch surrounded by foliage, a kingfisher successfully blends into the landscape.I have spent hours in the field and can still struggle to spot a perching kingfisher.When I locate a bird, I identy the sex by the birdrsquos beak: the malersquos is completely black, whilst the femalersquos is orange underneath.Kingfishers are territorial and they will hold their ground against other iniduals.Breeding season is the only time when the male and female tolerate each other and share territory.The choice of feeding ground is extremely important as the bird is dependent on it all year round.Each area covers at least km of slow-flowing fresh water or lake, but this may extend anywhere up to km.The resident male I have been watching for almost three years exhibits slight migratory behaviour it travels upstream during the breeding season, whilst it spends the winter months near the river mouth. For its fishing ground, a kingfisher will often choose a shallow pool in the river bend.They are not titled ldquoking fishers for nothing and are experts in this field.Before ing, they sit patiently on a perch, bobbing their head back and forth to assess the exact position of a fish.Once it has spotted a fish, it es headfirst at speeds up to mph.The kingfisher enters the water with beak half open and eyes protected by its third, transparent eyelid.A split second later, the bird emerges, beak first, and flies back to the perch.Here, it twirls the fish so that it may be held by the tail, proceeding to bash it against the perch to kill it and break the spine, making it easier to swallow.If you have a favourite animal you would like me to feature next month, or are looking for advice on how to spot and photograph a kingfisher, contact me through my website or social media channels.

But the journey became more than I anticipated, and gave me a new angle on Einsteinrsquos theory of relativity.To reach the island I went on a cycle with my good friend Gareth. He is a keen cyclist, and in my early days I was too. I literally cycled hundreds of miles a week. It gave me freedom and a sense of adventure.Over the last couple of decades my cycling adventures have signicantly declined. Those long adventurous rides I used to go on, well they have been a thing of the past, especially after my beloved bike was stolen years ago.But then, during the lockdown, my wee daughter Skye decided she wanted to learn to cycle, and with gritty determination she did so, magically on the same path in the Greenhills at Prestonpans where I learnt so many years before.So another friend very kindly leant me a bike and I was able to accompany my daughter around the then quiet streets of our town as she developed her confidence.I enjoyed this, and it was good exercise, but it began to give me itchy feet and a nostalgic longing to re-experience some of the joys of my youth and head off onto the open road and go exploring on two wheels under my own steam.So when Gareth suggested we go for a ldquovery short cycle ride to visit Green Craig island that I had heard so much about, I gladly accepted.The destination was just beyond the big gates of Gosford House in total just under five miles away. And, of course, the road follows the coast, so no horrible hills to climb.So I set off, with my children waving at me asI was going to war, and met Gareth outside Cockenzie House as arranged.It was from here I became increasingly aware of the depreciation my body has suffered since my last long cycle.The road was, as far as I could ascertain, flat.There was a very slight breeze on my face to cool me, so in theory it was perfect cycling conditions.But something was wrong I was very quickly puffing and panting as I tried to keep up with my friend, who was coasting effortlessly in front of me.I could feel my face turning red and an old lady walking her small dog looked up and gave me a sympathetic glance as I passed her.I was cycling faster than she was walking but not by much.Then another cyclist passed me, at what seemed to be close to the speed of light, at least compared to the pathetic speed I was travelling.It was at this moment I noticed Gareth was well ahead of me, and talking to himself, as he believed I was still just behind him.So I called out, ldquoGareth, slow down a wee bit! He waited for me to catch up.ldquoSorry, I said, ldquofeel free to cycle ahead but I will have to go slower.ldquoYou want to go ahead  he asked.ldquoNo, I said, ldquo we do that we may be in danger of falling over due to lack of velocity!And so we headed out of town.My comment about velocity had put me in mind of Einsteinrsquos theory of relativity that speed is not absolute and objects move at a speed relative to one another, and that this affects the passage of time.My time was most certainly being slowed down. Never had that short journey felt so long.I discovered small hills I had driven over but never noticed. I became acutely aware of the power of gravity, and I lost count of how many stops I needed before we finally arrived at our destination.But what elation when we did arrive: I was shocked on one hand at just how unfit I was, but on the other I had a sense of achievement.We locked our bikes and headed along the coast to the island. The tide was out which meant we could reach it without getting our feet wet.Gareth was keen to find a trig pole which he had discovered was on the wee island. It was used by early map makers but we didnrsquot find it.We sat on a log, and Gareth offered me a cup of tea from his flask. Hersquod bought an extra cup, and we sat there, two metres apart on an old log looking out to sea, talking. It was the best cup of tea I can remember in a long time.The island isnrsquot much in itself, more like a tuft of land or gloried sandbank, just beyond the coast.But itrsquos the location and what you can see from it which makes it special, both in terms of wildle and landscape. And history too is all around.The sea comes in fast at this point and it was soon moving in a pincer motion, enveloping the wee tuft of land to make it an island once again.Itrsquos that which perhaps excites the childhood imagination in us, beating the tide before being marooned or maybe being marooned could be the best bit!But we left just in time. The sea lapped at our feet as we walked past the huge concrete blocks from wartime and we discussed the goings on in the world.As we reached our bikes I noticed some dens made by previous visitors.Impressive constructions, showing perhaps that the lockdown for many of us has given us an opportunity to explore and discover our own area in ways perhaps we never did before.Then we set off home. The journey back gave me a new phenomena to contemplate that a road can feel uphill both ways when you are an unfit, overweight man on a bicycle.Gareth insisted on cycling with me all the way home, you know, just in case.But I made it, and got a kind reception from my kids who asked me, ldquoWhere have you been all this time, you must have gone really far Well in one way I had. Not in terms of actual physical distance perhaps, but certainly in terms of having an unexpected and unforgettable adventure with a kind and understanding friend."},{"url":null,"title":"former-mens-club-become-four-flats","story":"East Lothian Council has given the green light to East Lothian Propertyrsquos plans to transform  Sidegate.The former Haddington Recreation Club closed its doors in the early s and will now become home to a ground-floor office and four flats.The three-storey property is currently used as bedsit accommodation.One member of the public objected to the proposals on grounds including road safety, the likelihood that ldquothe use of the building to accommodate an office and four flats will lead to a large number of cars parking on street at this potentially dangerous spot and that the proposals ldquodo not accommodate any dedicated off-street parking, the consequence of which would result in cars being parked on the narrow road outside the building which would result in dficulties for other road users and would create a road safety hazard.Despite the objections, the plans were given the go ahead, with the planning officer noting that colleagues in the roads services department raised ldquono objection to the plans.Billiards, draughts and table tennis were all played by male members of Haddington Recreation Club before it closed.

we knew that losing your sense of smellwas a signicant symptom of the disease.Now, after months of reports, both anecdotal and more rigorous clinical findings, we think we have a model for how this virus may cause smell loss.One of the most common causes of smell loss is a viral infection, such as the common cold, sinus or other upper respiratory tract infections.Those coronaviruses that donrsquot cause deadly diseases, such as COVID-, Sars and Mers, are one of the causes of the common cold and have been known to cause smell loss.In most of these cases, sense of smell s when symptoms clear, as smell loss is simply the result of a blocked nose, which prevents aroma molecules reaching olfactory receptors in the nose. In some cases, smell loss can persist for months and years.For the novel coronavirus , however, the pattern of smell loss is dferent. Many people with COVID- reported a sudden loss of sense of smell and then a sudden and fullto a normal sense of smell in a week or two.Interestingly, many of these people said their nose was clear, so smell loss cannot be attributed to a blocked nose.For others, smell loss was prolonged and several weeks later they still had no sense of smell. Any theory of anosmia in COVID- has to account for both of these patterns.This suddenof a normal sense of smell suggests an obstructive smell loss in which the aroma molecules cannot reach the receptors in the nose .Now that we have CT scans of the noses and sinuses of people with COVID- smell loss, we can see that the part of the nose that does the smelling, the olfactory cleft, is blocked with swollen soft tissue and mucus ndash known as a cleft syndrome.The rest of the nose and sinuses look normal and patients have no problem breathing through their nose.We know that the way SARS-CoV- infects the body is by attaching to ACE receptors on the surface of cells that line the upper respiratory tract.A protein called TMPRSS then helps the virus invade the cell. Once inside the cell, the virus can replicate, triggering the immune systemrsquos inflammatory response. This is the starting point for the havoc and destruction that this virus causes once in the body.Initially, we thought that the virus might be infecting and destroying the olfactory neurons.These are the cells that transmit the signal from the aroma molecule in your nose to the area in the brain where these signals get interpreted as ldquosmell.However, an international collaboration showed recently that the ACE proteins the virus needs to invade the cells were not found on the olfactory neurons.But they were found on cells called ldquosustentacular cells, which support the olfactory neurons.We expect that these support cells are likely to be the ones that are damaged by the virus, and the immune response would cause swelling of the area but leave the olfactory neurons intact.When the immune system has dealt with the virus, the swelling subsides and the aroma molecules have a clear route to their undamaged receptors and the sense of smell s to normal.So why does smell notin some cases This is more theoretical but follows from what we know about inflammation in other systems.Inflammation is the bodyrsquos response to damage and results in the release of chemicals that destroy the tissues involved.When this inflammation is severe, other nearby cells start to be damaged or destroyed by this ldquosplash damage. We believe that accounts for the second stage, where the olfactory neurons are damaged.Recovery of smell is much slower because the olfactory neurons need time to regenerate from the supply of stem cells within the lining of the nose.Initial recovery is often associated with distortion of the sense of smell known as parosmia, where things donrsquot smell like they used to.For many parosmics, for instance, the smell of coffee is often described as burnt, chemical, dirty and reminiscent of sewage.Physiotherapy for the noseOlfaction has been called the Cinderella of the senses because of its neglect by scientic research.But it has come to the forefront in this pandemic. The silver lining is that we will learn a lot about how viruses are involved in smell loss from this. But what hope is there for people with a loss of smell now The good news is that the olfactory neurons can regenerate. Theyrsquore regrowing in almost all of us, all of the time. We can harness that regeneration and guide it with ldquophysiotherapy for the nose: smell training."},{"url":null,"title":"headteacher-praised-leadership-style","story":"North Berwick High Schools head Lauren Rodgers was described by Education Scotland inspectors as having a clear direction and being well respected.However while the inspection, carried out in February,praised the staff and leadership at the school and achievements of its senior students, it pointed to improvements required to enable more S-S pupils to learn a foreign language.The report called for more work to be done to ensure all younger students received their full entitlement to Broad General Educationin the first three years at the school.In particular it stated: \"Currently, a few young people are not experiencing a modern language until the end of S.\"Inaddition, the current arrangement is not sufficient for young people to receive their entitlementto a meaningful experience of a third language.\"Inspectors urged the school to ensure the focus was on ensuring younger pupils received full access to experiences across the curriculum and did not allow a focus on reaching exam levels to impact on them.The inspectors said: \"Teachers should ensure that learning at Sacross all curriculum areas remains focused on the experiences and outcomes of CfEanddoes not prioritise the requirements of National Qualications .\"Senior and middle leadersshould ensure that learning experiences in S provide those young people specialising atfourth level with appropriate depth in their learning to provide successful progression to thesenior phase.\"Inspectors visited the school in February  and assessed the schoolrsquos performance across four key indicators: leadership of change learning, teaching and assessment raising attainment and achievement and ensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion.The school was evaluated as lsquovery goodrsquo in the first three categories and lsquogoodrsquo in the fourth.Headteacher Lauren Rodgerrsquos leadership style was described as ldquocharacterised by openness and by trust, promoting empowerment in a supportive ethos.

Itrsquos not just in the countryside that they have become a large part of our lives, a source of ersion, fascination and even, or so I have felt, of company. Stepping outside in the morning is like entering the Usher Hall during warm-up, a discordant and energetic orchestra of flutes, pipes and trumpets. As I brush my teeth, I sometimes see Wilf, the blackbird with the silver ankle ring, by the chimney, letting the wind ruffle his feathers. He has a very keen look, and when our eyes meet, you feel you have been noted. By evening, his spot is taken by a pair of turtle doves which perch side by side on the TV aerial, well camouflaged against the dusky sky.Alan saw Wilf enjoying a bath in a puddle the other day, near his HQ, in the centre of the village. On our first social gathering in months ndash a glass of wine in a neighbourrsquos garden one warm evening ndash Wilf landed on the lawn beside us, hopping behind our chairs, and unperturbed by our friendsrsquo inquisitive dog. Clearly he considers every garden to be his private food department. Theirs is Fortnum and Mason to our Lidl.A barn owl has been seen in the village lately, out hunting before dark. The photos show a beautul, ghostly creature with a heart-shaped pale face, after which Hoolet is named. It was gliding low between trees and across the edge of rough fields. I hope it kept its distance from the blue tits, because other birdsrsquo chicks are the perfect snack for owls and their owlets. That comes as little surprise, but it wasnrsquot till recently that I learned that the woodpeckers haunting our garden might be lingering near the nestbox in hope of a tasty snack. A large one had taken up position on the gatepost, a few days ago, within earshot of the nest. Squirrels, meanwhile, are the stuff of blue titsrsquo horror movies. They have been known to gnaw away at a nestbox entrance to reach the birds inside.The charm most of us find in bird le and nature is often a rose-tinted perspective. For birds, every day is a challenge, a survival exercise tougher than anything the SAS could conceive. Often Irsquoll see the older blue tits, decidedly dishevelled, stuffing themselves on our peanut feeders as they boost their blood sugar levels ahead of another caterpillar hunt. Occasionally a scattering of feathers in the flowerbeds indicate where a cat has brought down a weary or unwary bird. The RSPB says that the avian massacre by cats ndash estimated to be over  million a year ndash is a natural winnowing, with only the weak or ill falling prey. Irsquom not convinced. It sounds like a half-truth, aimed to prevent all-out conflict between bird and feline lovers. Not that the two are mutually exclusive.Danger is all around,yoursquore small and feathered. Friends were out for a walk beyond Hoolet recently, and spotted a flock of sparrows, feeding on grass-heads. Suddenly, not six feet away from them, a sparrowhawk swooped and snatched one of the birds. The speed of the attack, and the hawkrsquos audacity, were startling.Nor was this a first sighting of this turbo-charged predator that moves at the speed of a bullet. Occasionally I catch one ing between our house and a neighbourrsquos garden. As it flashes past the kitchen window, you know this is no idle reconnaissance. From its perch high in the sycamore, it has spied something delicious. The best you can hope is that, for the creature caught in its crosswires, the end is mercully swt.With less traffic, you see far fewer birds flattened on the roads, especially pheasants, which usually seem positively eager to examine the chassis of approaching cars. Our neighbours were nevertheless worried that theyrsquod found a pegged-out pheasant among their poppies. Hearing them calling to us through the beech hedge ndash by now almost as impenetrable as the Berlin Wall ndash we hurried over to offer first-aidrequired.The glittering, fearless ndash and pea-brained  ndash beauty, which has been parading our gardens since springtime, was far from dead. It had simply settled itself into an earthy dip to enjoy the sun. This would explain the dusty hollows Irsquove been finding of late in the shrubbery, asan easter egg-sized UFO had landed. Unfazed by the humans clucking anxiously around it, the pheasant only roused itself and got to its feet when it heard us approaching on the gravel.Another frequent visitor is the young hedgehog which has taken to walking up the road to the house, around tea-time, and disappearing into the back garden. Seeing it approach, I stuck my head out of the door into the pouring rain, and noticed it has a limp. Seen from behind, it lurched on one hind leg, like a trolley with a wonky wheel. Since it was going at a lick, and obviously knew exactly where it was heading, I left it to get on with it.Itrsquos a matter of days before the blue tits will be out of their nest, and bouncing around the garden. In a second-hand bookshop last year I found a guide to making your garden more bird friendly. In a chapter on building nestboxes for dferent species, it advised that, after the breeding season, these boxes must be cleaned, to protect future broods from disease. This must be how landlords feel when the end of a tenancy is approaching. The need to disinfect is clearly universal. Unique to providers of avian accommodation, however, is the warning to brace yourselves for finding addled eggs, or the remains of chicks that failed to thrive.

His immediate task  The further easing of the lockdown in England without causing a surge in new cases.Ahead of the main act announcing something this week, Downing Street sent a warm-up man in the shape of Englandrsquos Health Secretary, Matt Hancock. On the dove-ish side of the lockdown easing debate, he was perhaps better placed than some to reassure the public that it would be safe to get back out there into pubs, restaurants, and schools.Sky Newsrsquos Ridge on Sunday was first to run the rule over the numbers with Mr Hancock. By presenter Sophy Ridgersquos reckoning, the contact tracers were only reaching two people a week.: Revolutionary vision for post-Covid ScotlandFar from being a sign of failure, said the Minister, this was a good thing.

With the failure of the Isle of Wight trial and still no date as to when the software will appear, the app has become a Bennettian ldquochip in the sugar, a sign of standards not being met and promises unfulfilled.Asked when the app would be ready, Mr Hancock said he was not going to put a date on it . ldquoIrsquom highly confident it will happen, said the Minister. By the time he reached The Andrew Marr Show this had become ldquoWersquoll get there with the app.Nick Robinson was standing in for Andrew Marr, whose father has died. The Today presenter was among those who deputised for the Scot after his stroke in . Robinson would have found the format much the same: start with the papers, end with a Minister, and pause in the middle for something lighter, in this case interviews with Kristen Scott Thomas, who stars in one of the Talking Heads, ldquoThe Hand of God, and Nicholas Hytner, who directs three of them.One major change Robinson could not have predicted are the by now regular slots on Marr for experts. Both Professor Sir Ian Diamond, the UKrsquos National Statistician, and Professor Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stressed that coronavirus had not gone away and there was no room for complacency.Professor Piot, described in his introduction as something of a star in the fight against viruses ndash the ldquoMick Jagger of microbes someone had called him ndash said he would be okay with a relaxation of the two metre rule as long as masks were worn in public places. He also called the quarantining of people entering the UK ldquouseless and urged the UK Government to appoint a Covid- tsar at Cabinet level.: Former FMslates blended learningIn all his answers he was as clear as day, unlike Mr Hancock who had to do the usual thankless ministerial task of talking about a subject while not giving anything away before the official announcement.In lieu of detail Mr Hancock had come bearing a new word: ldquomitigations. Besides mask wearing this appeared to include adopting the New Zealand system of asking people for contact information when they go to a pub or restaurant. Expect ldquosign here for a pint headlines in England.Robinson was not going to let Mr Hancock go without bringing up the Ministerrsquos breach of the social distancing rules, as caught on camera last week when he patted a colleague on the back in the Commons. ldquoIt was just totally natural, said Mr Hancock. ldquoThis shows how dficult social distancing is. All I can do is say Irsquom incredibly sorry for this momentary breach. Itrsquos because Irsquom human. Wersquore all human.

Nor was he keen to share his thoughts on extending the furlough in Scotland save for telling the Scottish Government to be ldquomore ambitious on reviving the economy.ldquoAll yoursquore doing is telling us things we already know, said Brewer.

It was her proud claim that not one of her children left without being able to read and write. Coincidentally, it seemed that the majority of them wanted to learn, teachers and parents were respected and discipline was applied rigorously, despite the widespread poverty.I find it dficult to understand why, in our modern system of free education, more and more children seem to prefer to roam the streets, rather than apply themselves to learning the basic Rs. Interestingly, the children of immigrants seem to appreciate this more than our home-grown lot.I wonder why this would be Carol MacDonald, Troon.POLITICIANS and high-ranking civil servants behind the decision for \"blended\" schooling, aka part-time school, are largely cushioned from the consequences of their decisions: they dont have to choose between working and educating their children at home because they have jobs where they can be flexible about hours, can afford for their partners not to work full-time, can afford private tutors or to send their children to private schools whichthey are not offering full-time schooling in August will still be offering much more than state schools.But it isnt just the children of politicians and high-ranking civil servants who are protected from the consequences of their decisions about lockdown.

Does anybody knowthis theory is correct Elizabeth Mueller, Glasgow G.I HAVE for some years now realised the Ayrshire tattie problem and have resorted to growing my own.First, I threw two bags of sand on my Carse of Gowrie garden to give it an identity crisis and make it think it was on the Girvan shore, I then planted Epicure seed potatoes.What I am now enjoying, this week, tastes much as I remember from my childhood in Wigtownshire.Ethel Fitzgerald, Longforgan.Living with the beastsAFTER  years living on Skye, my view of a couple of the things referred to as becirctes noires by R Russell Smithndash midges and cleggs ndash changed drastically from when I first moved, to live surrounded by them.Walking to the shore below my home and often up onto the dun, gave great pleasure as I saw otters, hares, eagles, larks, eider ducks, voles, indeed all manner of creatures. I felt delighted whenever I saw them, had their company. Especially the moths, owls and snipe in the still nights.Gnat-bites, tick-bites and clegg-bites  I had thousands of them , but they are all part of evolution, the normal world, they have their niches as do humans and I learned to thole them. It is actually cruel noisy humans who are my becirctes noires, who often harm or scare away the other quieter creatures. We should learn to be silent and still at times, then otters and other animals would not be afraid to be near to us.Thelma Edwards, Kelso.Character referenceTHERE was a hidden bonus in your Those were the days feature on Monday .

A storm in  showed something strange in the sand at the Bay of Skaill and the Laird, William Graham Watt, went on to excavate part of a , year old village. After reading the original reports, I now know that this isn’t true. The real story is more interesting.The Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, has three papers on Skara Brae. The first was by Samuel Laing, who visited the site in autumn .“Two chambers have been completely excavated, together with the passage and parts of the entrances to other chambers by Mr William Watt, a relative of William Watt, Esq of Breckness, residing at Skaill, to whose zeal the scientic world is indebted for the discovery and exhumation of this interesting relic of antiquity.#When I saw the credit being given to a relative of William Watt Esq, rather than the man himself, I remembered my father, Peter Leith, telling me that his father, also Peter, had told him that a dferent William Watt, known as Black Willie, had been the man responsible.In the  Census, I found the Laird living at Skaill, aged , with a son William, aged . His son and heir, William WG Watt was  and living at Kierfiold, so there were two sons called William.In James Irvine’s  book, ‘The Breckness Estate’, I read that William G Watt had a natural son, William, who in  was given £ a year and free board, “so long as he chose to remain a clerk in the house.”The story then turned into a neat circle. I followed up a reference in the book and found it was an Orkney Herald article written by my grandfather. It was about Hugh Miller’s book ‘Rambles of a Geologist’, in which Miller recorded his visit to Orkney in .My grandfather had written: “Another interesting person, who has already been mentioned, was William Watt of Skaill. This was not, as some readers may suppose, the laird of Skaill, but a distant relative who made his home there. He was well-known to everybody as “Black Willie” from his dark hair and complexion. Like Miller, he was a self-taught geologist, he always carried a little bag with a hammer and chisel to dig out any fossils he came across. He brought some of his more interesting specimens for Hugh Miller’s inspection and they had an interesting discussion. When Skarabrae was first dug into in the ’s, it is certain that Black Willie took an active part in the work and saw to it that anything found was safely preserved.”I looked up the references to William Watt in the book and found that Hugh Miller had come with a letter of introduction to him and described him both as an intelligent geologist and an intelligent palaeontologist. He showed Watt, along with Dr Garson of Stromness, where his famous discovery, the Astrolepsis fossil, lay.To read about the second and third papers on Skara Brae and what Patricia found out, see page  of this week#s edition of The Orcadian.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a strong interest in social history.

Employers should support their workers in using face coverings safely and provide advice,requested, on applying and removing the covering.On ferry services face coverings must also be worn by passengers and staff unless the ferry, or part of the ferry which is open to members of the public, is entirely outdoors or physical distancing of two metres can be maintained.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson stressed the importance of the new rules and that by wearing a face covering everyone is engaged in a collective responsibility to reduce the risk of transmission.He said: “Our message remains clear that public transport should be for key workers and those who need it most and can’t walk or cycle to work.#Capacity is reduced to enable physical distancing and operators are not yet running full services. However, as we work towards recovery and more peopleto work and further local leisure opportunities begin to open up it is vital that measures are put in place to protect everyone’s health.“Transport operators continue to play a key role in supporting essential travel and in ensuring passenger confidence in public transport while maintaining physical distancing. The use of face coverings forms a fundamental part of gaining that public trust.“We are asking people to take personal responsibility to do the right thing. Wearing a face covering while on public transport means you are playing your part in the collective effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus and reducing the risk to your fellow citizens. These measures complement physical distancing and good hand hygiene, they do not replace them.”Advice on face coverings, including how to make one and instructions for using one, will be available on the Transport Scotland website.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available.Source: Her Majesty’s TreasuryAn unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff.Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced.It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to £, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October.Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.”He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.”Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff.“The workshop’s a big, wide open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.”Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic. Getting through the next few months is crucial for us. We have a really good bunch of people and we want to hang on to them. The furlough scheme has helped us to do that.” vw, px\"  Planning, forward thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China.Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had.“The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown.“Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base.Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online.“All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon.

It is important that we face our fears and do not avoid them.“The enjoyment we might get from moving more freely outside, travelling and meeting friends and family is tempered when we are worried about the spread of infection. By sticking to the rules during the gradual lting of restrictions, we can be confident that risk won’t rise. Less virus around us can be matched with less restriction.“Although there are practical things we can do to help ourselves cope over the coming weeks, remember that help is availableneeded.  We’ve never had to deal with a situation like this before, so be kind to yourself and to others, and reach outyou need to talk to someone.  Support is there.”For practical tips, you can visit clearyourhead.scot.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The auld yins used the on-course site while the large overflow parking space easily accommodated the youngsters.Hand sanitising gel dispensers were installed and made available outside the clubhouse which like all others in the land is closed for business for the foreseeable future.Fortunately, although our clubhouse generates a decent amount of money from sales of teas, coffees, confectioneries but most importantly club logo-ed items of clothing we will not suffer quite as much as the larger clubs who maintain essential bars and restaurants.On the actual playing surfaces greenkeepers were required to make provision for golfers to be able to #hole# their golf balls without requiring to touch either the cup, the flag or the pin.Creativity came to the fore and what would our fellow dream up for our edication and delight # but much more importantly for our health and safety Sadly, unlike our local dominies for this year#s SQA exam diet he wasn#t allowed to #mark his own homework# so his efforts were subject to public scrutiny.Effort #: He decided to insert some of his old CD#s just below the lip of the hole to prevent players having to touch the edges in order to retrieve their balls but this wasn#t a great success as his choice of music did not seem attractive to the Titleists and Callaways of this world.Born on the wrong side of the River Forth our man#s musical integrity was questionable to say the least and with the greatest respectyou were a golf ball would you rush to be anywhere in the vicinity of wee Clfie Richard#s Greatest Hits or Daniel O#Donnell Sings Sacred Songs Effort #: His musical theme continued as he experimented with plastic piping in the holes to make it #touch-safe# for players to retrieve their balls without fear of contamination # but methinks neither Fred Morrison nor Dr Angus Macdonald need have any fears there either And so with health and safety requirements plus traceability suitably concluded play duly started on Friday th May at am – prompt .Play would necessarily be limited to solo or dyads of players with  minute intervals between groups teeing off in order to maintain social distancing.Apparently there were some horror shots off the first tee and indeed #yours truly# playing that first morning as a #lone-ranger# was mightily relieved to see his opening bf # following an enforced  week lay-off # fly straight and true down the middle of the fairway.That doesn#t happen very often!Social media pictures provided evidence of a rich harvest of players theand breadth of the land sclaffing and indeed in some cases actually missing the ball completely much of course to the great amusement and consequent delight of their respective playing companions and assorted onlookers.With the restrictions on playing golf eased well before local football and with the shinty season already all but over before it has even started the golf club is delighted to see that some of their fellow sports enthusiasts in Skye and Lochalsh have decided to give their #second# game a wee bit more attention pending the resumption of their own particular athletic activity of choice.Many of the shinty and football boys have paid their green fees for a round on the course in the past to both stimulate their interest and improve their golfing skills in God#s own game but now that there#s no choice of sport the membership numbers at the club have started to grow and develop-and all are most welcome.Although it could still be a wee while before the #rubber once again hits the road# and the competitive golf resumes the situation could be much worse.Consider the dilemma facing a much larger Highland club with c. members and the problems associated with trying to accommodate these golfers desperation toto their #links# Teeing off from am till :pm in ten-minute intervals playing either solo or in pairs only c. players per day get the chance to grace their fairways.Whereas down Sconser way our members can now book their slot, play their game, savour the view, enjoy the company then travel but a short distance home only today-after-day should they so desire Stay safe, keep healthy and best wishes to you all from the Isle of Skye Golf Club.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/home-farm-new.jpg","title":"skye nursing home worker positive for covid 19 for a second","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe news that a staff member had tested positive for a second time was confirmed by local MP Ian Blackford.Ten residents died at the nursing home after a major outbreak of the virus was detected there at the end of April.The Free Press understands all residents and staff at the home are to be re-tested as a precautionary measure today.The interim chief medical officer Gregor Smith was questioned about re-infection at today#s Scottish Government coronavirus daily briefing.He said that he could not comment on the inidual case, but added that the global evidence was that re-infection is #not a phenomenon we would recognise#.Dr Smith added that viral fragments can still be picked up in tests many weeks after the initial infection, and these highlighted the challenges which surrounds the testing process.Skye councillor John Gordon, whose father died at the home after testing positive for Covid-, said he was concerned families had found out about the new test via social media.He said: #Our thoughts are with families, residents, and staff who yet again have had to read about this on social media which has caused them more distress.#I can’t understand why a protocol has not been put in place to contact families before it’s in the media, and why management is not informing staff, despite assurances from NHS Highland and HC-Onethat this is happening.#Regular precautionary testing should be happening as a matter of course.#It’s a worrying time.#Mr Blackford said: #It has been confirmed to me that one of the staff members at Home Farm who had previously tested positive for Covid-, recovered and was tested negative twice has tested positive again.#The staff member concerned was re-rested on Sunday and received confirmation last night that they were positive.#It is important to stress that when someone does test positive having previously had Covid- that they may not necessarily be infectious.

Victor Leonard, chairman of the international youth football competition at which Rashford was twice a winner with Manchester United, has always been impressed with the manner in which the young England international striker has handled himself. As Rashford vowed to continue helping those in need after successfully forcing the government to reverse its decision not to provide free school meal vouchers during the summer, Mr. Leonard described the footballer as an inspiration to everyone. He added: “We first came across Marcus in the Manchester United squads that came across to Northern Ireland to compete in our tournaments. “He was a smash hit as United went on to win the Premier section in  and  but you could not help but admire the way, even at a young age, Marcus conducted himself. “We have been across to United many times and it was always very clear how highly regarded he was as a player and a person.” Rashford came off the bench in United’s  final victory over County Tyrone at Ballymena Showgrounds and started when the Red Devils triumphed  months later against defending champions Vendee from France. Victor added: “I think he is an inspiration to everyone. He has been so passionate about this issue but gone about attempting to bring change in a highly commendable manner. “He is a credit to his family and his club and we at STATSports SuperCupNI are privileged that he is one of our tournament graduates who has gone on to achieve greatness in his football career and also through his campaigning for something in which he believes so fervently. “Hopefully he will continue to be an inspiration to all of us.” Rashford has raised about poundm to supply around three million meals to vulnerable people while working with charity FareShare UK during the coronavirus lockdown. In an emotional open letter to MPs, Rashford drew on his own experience of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up. He said his story was all too familiar for families in England.

But, for now, all that has stopped.Fans of the local game have been left scratching their heads wondering what to do with their Saturday afternoons since the game came to a halt in March due to Covid-, never mind trying to wrap their minds around the proposals to bring back the action. Whether the club you love often basks in the glory of lting the Gibson or Irish Cups, or you trod home thinking what might have been, the Irish League is like no other in terms of the friendships forged on those Saturday afternoons.Certainly, some of the best memories this reporter has made in his  years is sharing Glenavon#s Irish Cup wins in ,  and  with his family. Who knowsthe Irish Cup will finish at all this season, but fans will not be able to share that special cup-winning feeling with the players, their friends and their families.Four Irish League fans who miss their weekend football fix spoke to the Belfast , looking back at those Saturday afternoons that feel so long ago and discussed what they are doing now to try and fill that void.Cltonville supporter Brian Smyth , Glentoran man David Kerr , Newry City fanatic Laura Hillenand Lurgan Blues fan Michael Scottwere all in agreement - it is not just the football, but the social aspect of our local game that has been missed over the last three months.Brian, a Green Party councillor in Belfast, described following his beloved Reds as an outlet and misses the unique quirks of the Irish League.If you#re invested in it, it#s family, he said. Your family is a bit of a melt sometimes, but that#s what the Irish League is, it#s your family.You miss it. You miss the characters and there is a social aspect to the Irish League. We don#t go there for sexy football. Sexy football comes along once in a generation for most teams, like Cltonville from  to  with Liam Boyce and Joe Gormley.You go along because it#s an extension of your family and you#re invested in it and you love it.I#ve been keeping myself busy with my council stuff, but I miss football. I#m a Manchester United man as well and a mate of mine said that the matches are back, but football isn#t, as the fans aren#t there.Michael was forced to watch old football fixtures on TV and YouTube at the beginning of lockdown.Like all those dedicated to following their team home and away every Saturday afternoon Michael, who is the editor of the Ulster Gazette in Armagh, has been totally knocked out of his weekend routine. I found that really, really hard. I missed that routine of getting up on a Saturday, going to the match, seeing my mates, have the craic, maybe stay on for a wee while afterwards and then come home, he said.I#ve been going out for a walk on Saturday afternoons, and like everybody  I ended up painting the fence. There was wee jobs in the house you end up doing.I miss meeting up with my mates. Saturday would be the day I would see a lot of people that I hang about with.You do miss that and obviously going to match might lead to staying on and getting a couple of pints or going round to a mate#s house for a pizza or a bite to eat. My routine on a Saturday now is basically get up and sit in a dferent room to the one I work in.Meanwhile, David#s Saturday afternoons at The Oval consisted of working with Glentoran#s media team, but all that has changed since Covid- struck.Focusing on nostalgic periods in the Glens# history during lockdown, David has been trying to bring a bit of Irish League football back into people#s lives through the club#s social media channels.You don#t have that usual routine of getting up, seeing what your mates and family are doing and heading to the ground, he explained.It#s the wee things you miss. I drive down and see that green mecca of mine that#s The Oval, so you miss that. You miss the smells, the taste of the burger and maybe getting a drink after the game.I think whether you#re a fan of Warrenpoint, Institute, Linfield, Glenavon, Cltonville or whoever, you all still have that same social side and I think that#s a massive part that everybody is missing and can#t wait to get back to.My job is trying to bring people closer to the club and Irish League football, so I guess I miss going out and speaking to people to create content.David added that no matter what your day job is, everyone who attends the game is the same when the referee blows the whistle at pm.Newry City#s Press officer Laura has even started supporting Hertha Berlin with their blue and white striped kit after the Bundesliga was the first major league toto screens.Her weekly routine consisted of attending committee meetings on Mondays, watching the players train on Tuesday, the under- games on Friday and seeing the first team play in the Championship on a Saturday.Going from that to nothing at all has been particularly tough.I would go to the matches with my sister and my daddy, she said. We all support Newry, so you#re getting to spend time with your family as well. My mummy is sick of the sight of us.Supporting local football is a great way to be part of the community and make friends.A large amount of our support would be the older generation and aren#t into social media, so without face-to-face contact they have no link to the club, so I#m sure as hard as it is for me, it#s harder for them.During this break we have launched a #KeepYourHeadUp campaign, getting videos from people from all over the sporting community - even a referee - to promote positive mental health and to keep your head up until we are back together again. Hopefully that#s sooner rather than later.Irish League football can generate a lot of negativity, mainly from those who don#t watch the local game, be it through the perceived quality of football or attendances, but Brian feels that is what makes our league.You even miss the games where there#s just  fans or less, he added. You can hear everything and the stuff coming out of people, which can be slightly outrageous, but it#s in your head for the rest of the week and it gets you through.I#m missing the routine, I#m missing the familiarity and I#m missing the social aspect. I think my we would prefer me going to watch a match.It is now up to the powers that be to get the ball rolling again, whenever that may be...

Patrick McGonagle, , whose address was given as Old School Lane in Shantallow appeared in court on June  charged with breaching his bail conditions on June  by ‘intentionally exposing his genitals’. The defendant had been released on bail on June  after being charged with common assault, namely throwing bread at a woman and attempting to grab her, and disorderly behaviour in a public place. A police officer said that on June  the PSNI became aware of a video circulating online showing a man acting in an ‘indecent manner’. googletag.cmd.push It was brought to the attention of police by community representatives and family members of children who witnessed it. McGonagle was identied in multiple reports. The officer said the incident took place at Old School Lane where the -year-old was seen ‘defecating in view of children’. A -year-old recorded the incident. The officer added: “He used chip shop wrappers to wipe himself. He was extremely intoxicated.” Police located the defendant at Old School Lane and he charged straight away. Objecting to bail, the officer said on June  McGonagle was warned about his behaviour and not to be intoxicated in a public place. googletag.cmd.push The court heard the -year-old has  previous convictions and two suspended sentences. There is an ‘extremely high risk of reoffending’, the officer added, ‘this man is incapable of not being intoxicated in a public place.’ Defence barrister Stephen Mooney said his client pleaded guilty to the offences before the court on Monday at the first opportunity and it was adjourned for a pre-sentence report. McGonagle was not in a position to be interviewed by the police due to his level of intoxication. Mr Mooney told the court that back in   the -year-old spent a ‘very signicant’ period of time in custody on remand. He was then found ‘unfit for trial’ because of his mental capacity and the prosecution was discontinued. The defence barrister said it is not so much a ‘fool’s pardon but a street drinker’s pardon’ as he is a well-known street drinker. His alcoholism is being criminalised because of his inability to stay sober, he added. Mr Mooney asked for bail to be granted with strict conditions attached. District Judge Peter King said ‘you’re absolutely correct’ and any bail conditions would have to include a prohibition on alcohol which would set him up for ‘spectacular failure’. He added that McGonagle may upset the ‘wrong person or group of people and find himself facing more dficulties’. The defendant was remanded in custody due to a ‘clear risk of reoffending’ to appear by way of video link on July .

From  July, people who are shielding will be able to meet up to sixpeople outside the home, as long as social distancing is strictly observed. In addition, people who are shielding and living alone will be able to form a support bubble from July  with one other household. These easements are based on the continuing reduction in the rate of community transmission of the virus in Northern Ireland. Further details will be provided in writing to people who are shielding. This letter will also set out plans to put shielding on hold from  July. googletag.cmd.push Minister Swann said:“I have no doubt that shielding has played a key role in saving many lives. It has undoubtedly been extremely dficult for those who are shielding. I have listened with great sympathy to what people have told us about feeling isolated and how they have missed their loved ones. “I know these easements that take effect on  July will be welcome news to many as we move towards the pause in shielding from the end of July. “However, I am also very conscious that there will be some who are apprehensive about this change. I would therefore, once again, repeat my call to everyone to continue to observe social distancing and to be considerate of the fact that the people you meet may have been shielding for many weeks.” googletag.cmd.push The Minister added that people who are shielding must strictly follow public health advice on social distancing and hand washing. “While the risk of being infected has reduced, the virus still constitutes a serious threat to those who are shielding should they get it. “It is important to remember that because of your underlying condition, Covid- will remain a threat to you. At the same time, it is accepted that shielding has been really challenging and that being stuck indoors indefinitely is bad for mental and physical health. What we all have to do in these dficult times is try to strike the right balance. “This is about minimising any risk as much as possible, being aware that all contacts with the outside world must be managed really carefully. “Keep your distance, wash your hands, don’t touch your face, avoid touching hard surfacesyou are out. Wherever possible, avoid enclosed spaces where social distancing is hard to maintain – such as public transport and shops.” The easements in shielding guidance from  July were agreed at today’s Executive meeting. This includes meeting up to six people outside the home providing social distancing is strictly observed. People who are shielding alone can form a support bubble with one other household. Social distancing is not required with this other household. This will allow people to visit, stay over and spend more time with the second household. The second household can be of any size. Both households should not be part of more than one bubble and should continue to socially distance outside the bubble.

The RQIA – Northern Ireland’s health and social care regulator – was directed by the Department in March to reduce the frequency of its statutory inspection activity and cease its non-statutory inspection activity and review programme. This temporary measure was introduced to minimise the risk of health and social care professionals and other visitors spreading infection within care homes. Similar restrictions were introduced in GB and the Republic of Ireland. With community transmission of Covid- now signicantly reduced, the Department has been able to rescind the March direction. googletag.cmd.push With the rebuilding of health and social care services under way following the first wave of the Covid- pandemic, the RQIA will be able to increase its activity across all areas of work. It is important that this increased activity remains as safe and as flexible as possible. Returning to pre-pandemic inspection levels will not be immediately possible. Whilst RQIA’s planned inspection programme was temporarily paused, RQIA’s inspectors – including registered nurses, social workers and pharmacists – continued to regulate services and respond to risks and concerns. It reports that since the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic, it conducted around  on-site inspections at care homes and domiciliary care services. It has also taken enforcement action against five services during this time. googletag.cmd.push In recognition of the threat from Coronavirus to older and vulnerable people, the Department of Health also “repurposed” RQIA from March to provide enhanced support to care homes and domiciliary care services. In response, the regulator established a Service Support Team.This has involved RQIA inspectors and senior staff providing detailed advice and direction to care homes and domiciliary care services in managing their services during the pandemic period.

The other three teams are isional teams picked from the rest of the clubs. Foyle Oaks , North Derry and South Derry. googletag.cmd.push Logistically it will be dficult to fit in around hurling. So in a case where Tiarnaacuten McHugh is trying to balance North Derry, Drumsurn and Kevin Lynchs, it will be far from ideal. A balance will be needed and proper dialogue between all three managers, with the players training regime at the heart of it. The senior championship will need to be played off over dferent weekends to intermediate and junior. This would be a stumbling block as it stands, with so much tied up in the leagues. Under this new concept, leagues would be totally dferent from championship. Leagues of  with a two up two down relegation, would be devised with one thing in mind – getting as many games as possible. The CCC would allocate rounds on the weekends the NFL is on. Club games are on Friday or Saturday night, with the county taking place on Sunday. The county manager names his starting  and anyone outside of that, who didnt see any meaningful game time in previous round, is eligible for club football. It would need checked with the county physio, buta player is going to be of any benefit, they need competition in the legs. The advantage is having more games on a more regular basis, with more room to balance the club championship commitments. It would help avoid loggerheads at a time of year when it really matters, it would help get rid of the alarming drop-off rate from players being caught between two stools. A situation where nobody wins and in the case of Derry, it leaves a situation that stles any continuity. ON THE DRAW Last week, Liam Tunneyrandomly picked  numbers and the draw was populated as you see below. It has some mouthwatering ties. North Derrys clash with a Dungiven side clambering their way back to their decline is the tie of the round, with the late Sunday night billing at Owenbeg. The appointment of former Dungiven manager Michael OKane and Darren McShane as managers of North Derry will add a bit of spice along the sideline. South Derrys debut in the championship see them up against a ravenous Slaughtneil, who have aim to win back the John McLaughlin Cup after a two year absence and have the astute Paul Bradley at the helm. In the opposition dugout is Ronan Rocks who will know the intermediate scene well and has an handle on the up and coming minor talent from his time with Derry Us. He is joined in the South Derry management team by Hugh Mulholland, who never misses a club championship game and will know Slaughtneil inside out. Foyle Oaks, under the management of Michael McLaughlin and Joe Gray, come up against Loup, with Paddy Bradley in his first season in charge. Lavey and Coleraine renew their  final rivalries.

With handsanitiserat the door to every store, one-way systems, contactlesspayment, and limits on customernumbers, the new normal might take a while to get used to. Around half the shops in Foyleside Shopping Centre were open on Tuesday morning, with Dunnes Stores attracting the biggest crowds. Staff in Marks and Spencers and Boots, which have remained open throughout the pandemic, were glad to see a bit more hustle and bustle in the centre And with sales on in Debenhams, Dunnes and Marks and Spencer, many shoppers remarked on how happy they were to be out spendingagain. googletag.cmd.push But while the shops are open, cafes and coffee shops in the shopping centres remain closed for now. Mary McLaughlin, who hasnt been shopping in the city centrein over three months, said shewas glad to be back. This is my first day back up the town and Im all hyper with it, she said. I havent been up thetown since way beforeSt Patricks Day Its been awful not being able toget up the town, butas long as we are all healthy thats the main thing. Its just great to get out again. Ive been looking forward to it. Self-confessed shopaholic Geraldine Deery has been yearning for the social side of shopping. googletag.cmd.push Im ashopaholic and its been drivingme crazy, she said. I missed going up the town and meeting people and having a chat. And I really miss going in for a cup of coffee with my sister. Ive gone abit crazy buying things, Im making up for losttime of the weeks I missed. The management at Foyleside, The Richmond Centre and Debenhams have clearly put a lot of timeand effortinto establishingand marking out one-way systems and there are plenty of signs in place reminding people to keep to the two metre social distance rule. You do be a bit nervous because youre looking at the floor, trying to make sure you are going the right way, said Mrs McLaughlin. Everything is well spaced out and the floors are all marked out. Although Im glad I came out early because its quiet at the minute. Derrys small independent retailers are also slowly getting back to business after getting the go ahead this week, David Thomas, whose jewellery shop and workshop Thomas Goldsmith has operated from Pump Street for over  years, has been surprised that some of his fellow small traders havent reopned yet.  Ive just been for a walk round and Ive noticed that a large number of small independents arent openat the minute. This is the second dayinto it and they are taking their time to get back to work. Maybe thats their own choice. It surprisedme because to rebuild businessagain is important. For a lot of them who have furloughed staff and who are self employed as it were and are receiving payments they are thinking I wont risk it because theres a safety net there. But obviously that safety net is going to start disappearing. Business has been quite slow this week, but MrThomas is hopeful that shoppers will be back. We arecompleting the work we werent able to complete in March after the guillotine came down and we werent able to finish. And then we were hit by problems in the supply chain but that has started to ease up. In the last two weeks it has relaxed and things are filtering thoughnow. Were now able to complete things we should have done in March so weve stillgot that momentum from then, but in terms of work coming through its going to be a bit slow. There are a lot of people are being made redundant or who havent been able to claim grants and things like that. But on the other hand there are people who were furloughed and had to stay at home and werent able to spend money and they should have a fairly healthy bank account and they are desperate to get out and buy stuff. Mr Thomas has made changes to the way the shop operates in order to comply with the new regulations. Only one customer is admitted at a time, staff are usingfacemasks and hand sanitiser, and jewellery that has been tried on is being cleaned before it goes back on th shelf. People are understanding and respectful, remarked Mr Thomas. He feels that lockdown has given people time to reflect on their work le balance and lestyle. People are saying it will never be the same, he said. We were all chasing our tails a bit, workingvery hard. Does it have to be like that  Can we take things a bit easier  Do we have to be rushing off to Portugal on cheap flights  It has been strangeto sit at home in the garden and look up and see the skies totally clear. Many of Derrys charity shops have also reopened their doors, with Oxfam, Kinship Care, the Red Cross and Cancer Focus back in businessearlier this week. However, the three month closure has meant some stores are struggling with low stock levels. Deborah Tracey is the manager at Cancer Focus on Shipquay Street, which opened in May .  The shop reopened last Friday after a week of cleaning and preparation and have been busy ever since. Inside there is hand sanitiser at thedoor and a one-waysystem in place. Most people have been using the hand sanitiser before they come in, said Ms Tracey. We have been busy with people bringing stuff in and buying stuff too. People seem to feel confident coming out to shop now and theyare glad toget back to a bit of normality. Cancer Focus has amanager and deputy manager but all the other staff are volunteers. Some of our volunteers have been worried about coming back because they are older and more at risk, said MsTracy. So weare lookingfor newvolunteers now. We provide everyonewith shields, masks and gloves for their safety. Cancer Focus has also launched an appeal for donations. Any donations to the shop must be quarantined for  hours when we receive them, said Ms Tracy. We are looking for donations of clothes, bric-a-brac, shoes, bags and books. If you would like to make a donation to Cancer Focus or to enquire about becoming a volunteer telephone .

At present, hospitality businesses have to adhere to strict licensing laws in terms of serving outdoors. However, local councils have been encouraged by the Northern Ireland Executive to take a flexible approach to the situation to support the sector as it emerges from the coronavirus lockdown. Derry City and Strabane District Council is currently looking at ways it can help local businesses. They have launched a short survey asking for peoples opinions on the matter. The survey can be filled in here -https:bit.ly eohTnm googletag.cmd.push A council spokesperson said: The hospitality and retail industries have been some of the hardest hit in terms of lost revenue during COVID-. They will also be one of the last to fully emerge from the lockdown. With the impact of the pandemic and the resulting social distancing measures that must continue when businesses reopen it is essential that we start to reimagine how theservice industries can adapt and operate in the current circumstances.New business models and taking hospitality and trade outdoors will play a signicant part in the survival of the service industry locally. Using private and public spaces such as pavements, car parking spaces and events spaces such as Guildhall Square, Waterloo Place and the Canal Basin in Strabane could be part of the solution. googletag.cmd.push To achieve this, Council and key stakeholders including Department for Infrastructure and the Department for Communities will be adopting a flexible approach that seeks to facilitate innovation - whilst ensuring appropriate controls such as Insurance, disability access, enforcement and public health are in place.

Following a request from the Irish Central Border Area Network , the NIAO report will also look at the process used by BT for upgrading its own infrastructure. Mid Ulster District Councillor Sean McPeake said it was a positive development. “I have been supportive of the group’s request for an NIAO report to ensure future transparency around the lack of competition for Broadband infrastructure in the North,” he said. “The report is being currently compiled and crucially includes areas such as the process used by BT for upgrading their own infrastructure. googletag.cmd.push “I am confident that any positive recommendations which emulate from the report will be taken on board by Dept of Economy prior to the awarding of Project Stratum delivery contracts. “This is crucially required for the equitable roll-out of such a major broadband scheme that will have such major implications for future generations of rural people.” poundm of funding has been secured for Project Stratum, which aims to improve broadband connectivity at approximately , premises. There has been some criticism of theof time it will take to complete the improvements, with no upgrade work planned before the delivery of the project. googletag.cmd.push “Full delivery could take another - years, which does not address present needs,” said Cllr McPeake. “Rural areas such as Mid-Ulster need to have immediate interventions in broadband improvements to remain economically competitive and meet the needs of local homeowners. “Broadband availability has become a service utility which is equally essential as water, electricity or any telecommunications. “In recent months I have been inundated from constituents who cannot access sufficient broadband speeds for home-working, home-schooling or basic socialising. “Small to medium sized businesses are also struggling to achieve adequate speeds to operate their businesses in rural areas.” The Carntogher councillor has asked residents to detail their experiences in order to help with the evidence gathering process. “An integral part of the NIAO reporting evidence gathering process is having anecdotal evidence of the challenges of home working or home schooling during the ongoing public health crisis. “I would encourage anyone who is experiencing dficulties with Broadband provision during the COVID- Pandemic to email their experiences toinfo@icban.

Patricia McCallion, who shot to fame on dating show Pretty Single, said she has used her unexpected down time to reboot and put the finishing touches to her first hair care range. I really enjoyed having that time to myselfand spendingtime with my daughter, but now that we can reopen Im very excitedto get back to work, she said. Pretty Single brought togethersix gorgeous single women who agreed to be stripped of their make-up before going on a series of blind dates. googletag.cmd.push  Patricia won the public over on the show with her bubbly personality and natural good looks and although she didnt manage to find love she says she has found friends for le. I still chat to my final two fellas on the show but its on a friendship basis, she said. I did go on a second and thirddate with Martin the barber, but I realised we are more like friends. I talk to the girls every single day though. Theres notmany times you get a group of girls togetherand everyone justgets on so well. Everybody is buying each othercards and presents on their birthdays- its lovely. googletag.cmd.push Since taking part in the show, Patricia has embraced a more natural look. I think Ive found lovely new friends and Ive found myself too, she said. I havent worn make-up in three weeks. I wouldnthave gone out the door before without running a make-up brushover my face. Itwas just the norm, like brushing my teeth. So its been very liberating. Earlier this month, Patriciafulfilled her lelong dream of launching her own hair care products, which are named Glam after her salon in Waterloo Street. It features two luxurious ranges SOS and Peyton, named after her  -year-old daughter. I started hairdressing at  and after Peyton was born working and being successfulwas all for her, she explained. I wanted her to be proud. Patricia was able to use lockdown to put the finishing touches to the range and she is delighted with the finished products. Getting to make the products was so educational but there was so much work involved in it, she admitted. Im so thankful that I had that time to properly work on it because I never thought it would be that stressful. I was nervous about it, but I have learnt to trust in myself. My clients trust that when I bring out a product I will have trialled it and tested it on myself and I have been doing hairdressing so long that I know what works. Pretty Single is available to watch now on BBC iPlayer.

Dean O’Neill, from Drumsurn, died suddenly last week and mourners at his funeral yesterday heard how the news had left the community in shock. “The church would be absolutely packed todaythings were normal,” said Fr Seamus Kelly, officiating at the funeral. “The tragic news that spread throughout the area on Thursday morning stunned the whole community. “He was one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge in Drumsurn in recent years and it was lovely to see all the young people with their shirts on as his remains were being carried in.” googletag.cmd.push  Dean, known around the community as ‘Floater’, excelled on the sports field and Fr Kelly described him as ‘one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge from Drumsurn in recent years’. In the colours of St Patrick’s College, Dungiven, he was outstanding and won a Derry vocational schools’ All-Star award in . He represented St Matthew’s GAC and Kevin Lynch Hurling Club and carried his talent with modesty. Fr Kelly recalled how he deflected praise after a notable victory at minor level. “He covered every blade of grass in defence and attack but didn’t want any great glory,” he told the congregation. googletag.cmd.push “When Drumsurn and Drum amalgamated as St Patrick’s at minor level a few years ago, he gave an exhibition of football as he dragged his team back into contention and eventually saw them defeat Glenullin having been nine points down at half time. “He declared humbly, ‘sure Micheacuteal Archibald deserves praise more than me’. He loved sport and played Gaelic, soccer, hurling and basketball with distinction for the school.”  Dean in the colours of Kevin Lynch Hurling Club. Off the pitch, Fr Kelly told mourners how Dean had a great sense of fun and spoke of his great love for his family and friends. “He tortured friends and relations with pranks and jokes. He was very close to all his cousins and friends and kept in touch with them,” he said. “When his brother, Justin, go married, he was best man for him and was godfather to their first child, Taylor. He absolutely doted on her, as indeed he did on all his nephews and nieces. “I know how proud Justin and Jordan were of their brother Dean, but they all have wonderful memories as have Gertie, Rory and wider family and friends. “He met a lovely girl in Amber and it looked like they would settle down for good. Of course, he was not known as Dean, it was just ‘Floater’ to all his friends who loved him so much. “In recent times, he had settled a lot and went to live in Dungiven, although, he always insisted, he was a Drumsurn man.” Fr Kelly spoke of the great sadness within the community following his passing. “I’m well aware that Drumsurn is in a state of mourning, as Dean was so well-known and loved here,” he said. “However, we have a promise that death is not the end, but another step on the journey to eternal le. “Everyone who knew him, or even met him, loved him. He had an amazing personality that endeared him to all and had a relentless sense of fun. “To young and old, he was a legend. It has been the most common remark uttered over the past few days. What a character.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The funding is part of the Departments Major Capital Works Programme which will see nine schools in total benefit from improvements to their sites. St Patricks College, Maghera, and St Conors College, Kilrea and Clady are the two County Derry schools who will receive funding. Speaking today in the Assembly, Education Minister Peter Weir said the investment showed the Department was planning for the future. Improving the schools’ estate is one of my priorities and in the current unprecedented and dficult times, he said. googletag.cmd.push I hope this will send a strong signal to the local construction industry and local communities that the Department of Education is planning for the future and is committed to supporting the local economy and the wider community through the delivery of our capital programme. My Department’s capital programme aims to ensure that all our young people are educated in school facilities which are safe, secure and fit-for-purpose, enabling them to receive the quality education experience required to help them to fulfil their potential. St Conors College had been operating over two sites, in Kilrea and Clady, and principal Aine Bradley says the funding will help the transition to one site. googletag.cmd.push Our school community is thriving - since September  we have been living, learning and excelling together in the classroom and on the sports field, she said. Coming together in one building will give our school community even greater opportunity and a common goal. Our pupils will finally have access to the state of the art facilities and resources they deserve. I want to say thank you to the Governors, Staff, Pupils and School Communities in Kilrea and Clady for your patience, support and steadfast belief that we could achieve greatness together. Mid Ulster MLA Patsy McGlone welcomed the inclusion of St Patricks College, Maghera in the Departments plans. I have been in regular contact with St Patricks College, Maghera on the need for improvements to the school estate over recent years. I have had visits with Department officials, the school principal, the chair of the board of governors and Councillor Martin Kearney on site to see the school facilities. While the major capital works projects for St Patrick’s College will now progress to the design stage, work will not likely commence until the   financial year. When completed, pupils and staff at St Patrick’s College will benefit from the provision of modern, fit-for-purpose facilities.

His friendly nature and party trick of singing ‘Puppy Love’ made him a popular figure. Tights lived recently at Seymour House and had previously resided at The Crescent in Shantallow. His family have thanked staff at Altnagelvin for the care he received in his final days.

In this extract the autistic teenager shares his joy of the natural world on a day out to Murlough with his sister and brother.OUR garden is thrumming with birds today: coal, blue and great tits, blackbird, thrush, magpie, jackdaw, rook, all of them revelling on the grass, pecking at the feeders.I could happily watch them all day but rain is coming from the east, so we decide to go west to the coast at Murlough to stay in the sunshine. I usually despise being in the sun. I find its light too bright, its heat too hot, and it can make me feel astherersquos nowhere to hide. But with this rain coming, I feel like being on the dunes at Murlough, pressed by warmth and sea breezes.The ancient dune system here is six thousand years old, fragile and spectacular. The unusually high dunes were formed in the late th and th centuries by massive storms, and were used by people in the Middle Ages as rabbit warrens to provide them with meat and pelts.Grazing rabbits encouraged the grassy heathland here, but when myxomatosis first broke out in the s, as it did in other parts of Ireland and Britain, the population was almost wiped out. With fewer rabbits, sea buckthorn and sycamore could grow, turning heath to scrubland. Now the National Trust have intervened at Murlough, managing the landscape so it reverts back to heath mdash and judging from the copious pings, it looks like the rabbits are thriving again, too.The day is sparkling, the wind is shaking and shaping the clouds. Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid want to swim, so I stroll along the beach with my binoculars. Shapes out at sea stop me: a trinity of torpedoing gannets. They swoop, wheel and suddenly drop, spiralling until the last second when they transform into arrows before hitting the water.Swallows are overhead ndash I can see their small bodies so clearly, weightless and constantly moving. I feel myself rising with them.My dark, knotted thoughts seem to be staying away at the moment. I feel as free as the gannets and swallows. If they can live their lives, shouldnrsquot I do the same  Can I breathe and live and also fight  The natural world mdash which includes us mdash is facing such enormous challenges that itrsquos easy to become overwhelmed and depressed. But we must fix them, andIrsquom no longer here, alive, I canrsquot be part of the solution.What is it thatrsquos holding me back  Anxiety  Depression  Autism  These are the shackles. Surely, I can break free. Or at least I can accept these things as part of me. I have no answers, but the lightness of these thoughts and these days weave my body and mind with everything around me. The only thing that I am really bound to is nature ndash as we all are.Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid are running towards me, and I run to them, and then we run together, exultant. We slow down in unison, all feeling the same pull of the large peculiar shells dotted around the beach. We each pick one up and hold them outstretched, delicate porcelain in our hands.They look like pale planets, pockmarked with symmetrical lines. I rattle mine, listening to the whisper of sand and the past. These are sea potatoes mdash a type of sand-burrowing sea urchin mdash with pocks that once held spines and a bleached calcium carbonate shell that could so easily shatter on land or at sea. Each one is a miracle. So many miracles washed up at once.We start to collect them and Lorcan decides to name three of the best specimens Sandy, Sam and Sandra. He holds a conversation with them, three sea potatoes, which makes us laugh so hard that tears well up and almost flow, and wersquore still laughing as a warm rain starts to fall on us.Under dark skies, I feel completely unburdened of any doubts in my own abilities to help our planet. Instead, I feel energised and ready. Sopping wet and cold and with chattering teeth, still giggling madly, I feel hope pouring in the rain. Being myself is enough.Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Tollerand can be bought online, or at No Alibis bookshop in Belfast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A lifetime of capturing Ireland’s scenic beauty  ","story":"AMATEUR photographer Chris Laverty spent a letime capturing Irelandrsquos scenic beauty.The former Queenrsquos University computer centre manager travelled extensively, always with his camera, and always with an eye for the magic of the countryside around him.

As we work to do so, our absolute priority will be to keep our patients, service users and staff safe. the statement adds.The health trustrsquos insistence that emergency services will be restored at the Downe comes ahead of a meeting with a Sinn Fein delegation to discuss the issue.Spearheaded by South Down MP, Chris Hazzard, the delegation will be seeking assurances that all services will be restored to their previous level.Ahead of the meeting, Mr Hazzard said that due to the pandemic, the local community was left without access to vital services at the Downe due to the health systemrsquos response to coronavirus which ldquorequired what amounted to extraordinary measures for an extraordinary time.The MP said the Downe was left ldquounrecognisable as emergency and outpatient services, amongst others, closed from the end of March.ldquoWhere required, all available staff and equipment from these units was also requisitioned for use in other parts of the South Eastern Trust area, he continued.ldquoIn agreeing to the radical reconfiguration of the Downe, the community made a big sacrice in order to accommodate the unprecedented demands made by both health trusts in the fight against Covid-.Insisting that it was the right thing to do at the right time, Mr Hazzard said there is now an onus on trust management to respond in kind to the community.He said the recently published recovery plans have delayed the restoration of vital services to the community, causing signicant concern amongst many who fear that ldquotemporary closure might inevitably mean permanent removal.Mr Hazzard said the Sinn Fein delegation will be calling for the full restoration of services at the Downe and will also be meeting with the chief executive of the Southern Trust to call for services removed from Newryrsquos Daisy Hill hospital to be reinstated.Rowallane DUP councillors are also demanding the full restoration of services at the Downe Hospital, highlighting the importance of reopening the emergency department as soon as possible.Cllr Billy Walker said it was ironic that within hours of confirmation that the Downpatrick ED would not reopen at this stage, the South Eastern Trust revealed via social media that the Ulster Hospitalrsquos emergency department was extremely busy.ldquoThis is nothing new, he declared. ldquoThere is a clear need for the Downersquos emergency department to reopen now. Having this facility available can help ease the pressure on other EDs and we cannot understand why there is not increased investment in Downpatrick.ldquoWe all understood the temporary closure of services at the Downe to allow health chiefs to respond to the global pandemic, but the time for those services to be reinstated is now.

However, bearing in mind the scheme is all but shovel ready, this should be a simple case of signing the commencement orders with construction starting as soon as possible.Mr Hazzard said the roads minister has a capital budget of more than poundm to be spent this year, suggesting that very few projects are as advanced as the Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThere is no logical reason why this long overdue project canrsquot get the green light for construction as a matter of priority, he said.The MP added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would be a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Darragh Cross residents bring cheer to local residential home  ","story":"RESIDENTS from Oakland Court in Darragh Cross made the most of the lockdown by having socially distanced nights of entertainment while helping the residents of a nearby residential home.From hosting fun events such as bingo and discos, they raised pound for Willowview Residential Home in Saintfield.Oakland Court residents would like to thank Darragh Crossrsquo Vivo shop for its donation of prize hampers and everyone who donated prizes and gts.In turn, all residents and staff of Willowview Residential Home would like to say pay their gratitude to to all the residents of Oakland Court and Darragh Cross Vivo for their kindness and thoughtfulness..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing on dog dirt  ","story":"SENIOR Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers say they will need time to research the issue of using DNA testing on dog dirt in a bid to trace animals which are allowed to use public areas as open air toilets.Members of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee will discuss the issue at their virtual meeting later today.A motion on the issue tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown at the March meeting of the full council was referred to the local authority committee for discussion.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines.Cllr Brown is also eager for council officials to draw upon best practice from other councils who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.In addition, he wants the local authority to roll out what he has described as an ldquoenhanced public awareness campaign focusing on the dangers of dog fouling.Ahead of tonightrsquos council meeting, officers are recommending that Cllr Brownrsquos motion is agreed to allow them time to research similar schemes which have been introduced where.In addition, officers say that they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme locally beforereporting back to the council committee.Politicians, who have previously asked for more enforcement staff to be deployed across the district to deal with the dog fouling problem, say the highly contentious issue is one of the single most complained about problems in the area.They say that despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Drive in assembly at Crossgar primary school  ","story":"CEDAR Integrated Primary School in Crossgar has said farewell to its P pupils.Staff held a drive-in leavers ceremony for the outgoing P class last Friday.Parents and carers were invited to park in the playground and watch the  pupils receive folders of their work from their time at Cedar.They also received a survival kit for lsquobig schoolrsquo, as well as trophies for sports, arts and ICT,.

The team, captained by Harry Manley and Matilda Harty, secured a superb win.This yearrsquos Provincial Towns League galas provided a fantastic opportunity for club members to swim competitively and aim for personal best times, whilst having fun and making new friends with other clubs.The galas included a medley relay, inidual back, breast, fly and free swims, inidual medley and finally a freestyle relay for each of the four age groups.Lecalersquos galas took place from September to February with two at Down Leisure Centre and two away. Lecale swam against Cookstown, Leander, Coleraine and Portadown with some extremely close scores. Many parents, coaches and volunteers helped time and again, and this was truly appreciated.Swimmers at Lecale are able to start on the competitive pathway through development and open galas. Thirty-one swimmers have competed this season, gaining personal best times and medals.Of particular note, Tom Williamson was a medal winner in every event he entered across the four development meets of the season, winning eight gold medals, three silvers and one bronze medal.Orla Gibney shone at the Ards Christmas meet, winning two golds, a silver and a trophy for the best performance in the age  category, while Matilda Harty was in fine form at the Templemore open meet, winning medals in all four of her events mdash one gold, two silvers and a bronze.This season Lecale also had a squad of six elite swimmers who are involved in Swim Ulster Regional Talent Development and Performance Pathway, training and competing at national level.They qualied to compete in Swim Ulster meets and were placed within the top five in their age group in the spring qualying meets.Swim Ulster National Qualying Division  times were recorded for Adam Colgan, Adam Mahon and Aidan Mallett, Division  times for Christopher Mason and Rebecca Colgan and Aoe Mason were close to Division  times as the season was interrupted.Adam Colgan, Adam Mahon and Aidan Mallett qualied for the Swim Ulster short course championships in November and Aidan and Adam Colgan qualied for the McCullagh international meet in February, competing with the best swimmers in Ireland and GB, including Olympic swimmers Adam Peaty and Duncan Scott.Adam Colgan also qualied for the Irish long course meet, which serves as the Irish Olympic trials, prior to its Covid- cancellation.In challenging times for athletes used to training five or six times a week, swimmers now take part in al land work training up to three times per week under the direction of club coaches.Up to  swimmers are regularly taking part in what has become a highlight of the week. Although it cannot take the place of training in water, coaches hope power, balance and coordination levels can be maintained and that the swimmers will be to get back to business in the pool at a future date.It is always sad to say goodbye to swimmers who are ready to move on after finishing their school career. This season, Lecale said goodbye to Year  swimmers Chloe Galloway, Sarah Colgan, Peter Murphy and Tom Rodgers.Coaches, committee and club members thank them for their long and dedicated association with the club and look forward to hearing about their successes in the future.The club also wishes to thank the outgoing captains, Chloe Galloway and James Kane, for their dedication and service to the club this season.Lecale Swimming Club continues to take their lead from the governing bodies, Swim Ireland and Swim Ulster, and look forwards to welcoming swimmers back to training before too long and new members when the next season starts..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Mr Joseph McMcIlmail  ","story":"MR Joseph McIlmail, of Crew Road, Downpatrick, died peacefully at home on Tuesday, April , at the age of .Joe, as he was known to his family and many friends, was the fourth child of the late John Joe and Margaret McIlmail, from Bright.

He was also famous for discovering milk chocolate.Born in Killyleagh on April , , Sir Hans died in Cha in , aged  and described as the worldrsquos greatest collector who, from his earliest years, catalogued and carefully encased every artefact that he found.Over the years he accumulated nearly , items many of which today are on display in the British Museum.Close to the picturesque harbour in Killyleagh stands a copy of the London statue in honour of Sir Hans with a local councillor branding the campaign to take down the statues in the capital as ldquoridiculousCllr Billy Walker insists that the pioneering physician was not a slave trader and that the clamour for many statues to be taken down was becoming ldquosilly, urging the Government to show some backbone on the matter.He said Sir Hans was ldquorevered in his home town where people were proud to have a copy of the statue to a man who did so much for the world.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoSir Hans gave us the concept of free museums, found a cure for smallpox and pioneered science and medicine to do away with magic for treating illness.ldquoHe also promoted the use of quinine against malaria, discovered milk chocolate and was the first man to lead both Royal Colleges. Sir Hans also treated the poor for free and was no slave trader.Cllr Walker said Sir Hans left Killyleagh for London when he was  where he studied chemistry, before deciding on a career in medicine, qualying in France and ing to London.He was subsequently appointed as the personal physician to the governor of Jamaica and it was there that he discovered drinking chocolate.When he ed to England, Sir Hans was able to market his find and Cadburyrsquos promoted this drink for many years.Cllr Walker said that Sir Hans, who has a centre named after him in his home town, encouraged inoculation against ious diseases and for  years was President of the Royal College of Surgeons and a Fellow and hard working secretary of the Royal Society for many years.ldquoWe in Killyleagh are rightly very proud of Sir Hans and his links with our town, he continued.The councillor added: ldquoI hope that his statue in London will remain in place as he was a man of great distinction which is evidenced by the fact that there is now a centre dedicated to him in his home town.

In addition to the services directly provided at our local hospital mdash the peoplersquos hospital mdash Downe staff were redeployed to other healthcare facilities andcontributed enormously to the NHS effort.When the emergency planning was taking effect, it was the clear understanding of many local political and community representatives, that the emergency department service would be restored immediately upon the conclusion of the pandemic.Whilst there is clearly a signicant possibility of a so-called second surge in infections mdash and we are all aware as to just how serious such a second surge could be mdash at the same time there is increased normalisation of health provision across the North.The restoration of the urgent care service previously provided at the Downe must be a top priority as part of this normalisation. It should have been included in the June action plan, published by the health trust last week.Just last week, as attendances were increasing at the remaining emergency departments, including at the Ulster Hospital, it was apparent that existing facilities are and will be unable to cope with demand.During the Covid emergency planning, decisions were taken to temporarily close the emergency departments at the Downe, Daisy Hill and the Mater hospitals.Just last week, trade union representatives received categorical assurances from the Southern Trust about the re-opening of about Daisy Hill Hospital. Similar assurances are now required about the Downe.There is also a signicant impetus gathering now for the implementation of restructuring of healthcare services generally, and of urgent care in particular, across Northern Ireland.Decisions about the future of healthcare, particularly urgent care, afford an excellent opportunity to redress health inequalities that have arisen and been perpetuated by the historic under investment in the health service by successive governments and by the pursuit of centralisation policies.Many people believe that those centralisation policies played a crucial role in leaving us facing into a pandemic with insufficient hospital beds, insufficient intensive care beds, insufficient ambulance cover, insufficient ventilators and insufficient healthcare workers.Any change to emergency and urgent care provision is only permissible where it happens with the consent of the people.In the final analysis, decisions about the allocation of healthcare resources are political decisions taken by politicians, elected by the people and not by bureaucrats. Tiers and levels of bureaucracy make no dference to where ultimate responsibility lies.I have a great deal of sympathy for the recently appointed health minister, Robin Swann, who within a few weeks of his appointment, found himself facing the biggest public health emergency in the history of the National Health Service.I would respectfully suggest that Mr Swann should insist upon the criteria for change stated by Michelle OrsquoNeill when she was Health Minister.The now Deputy First Minister stated in November  that local people should be at the centre of decision-making processes in designing and delivering services. The , people who marched through Downpatrick in support of the Downe Hospitalin the Love the Downe Rally on February , , would certainly agree with that.As far back as , Dr Michael McBride, speaking at the sod cutting ceremony for the new Downe Hospital, said that ldquothe emphasis would be on making the health system respond to the patient rather than the patient to the system. I concur with that.In the Down Recorder of November , , after the publication of the Bengoa Report, Michelle OrsquoNeill was quoted as saying: ldquoWe will deliver care and support in the most appropriate settings, ideally in peoplersquos homes and communities.Again, I would concur with that.If there is to be a change in urgent care provision across Northern Ireland, no one can expect to be immune from that change. At the same time, change would only be possible or acceptableit is to create a better service for all of the people and a fair and equitable distribution of services.Many people in this area believe that we have had a very raw deal for over  years from the health service and some politicians.It sometimes seems to be forgotten that the National Health Service is free at the point of use, but it is certainly not without cost. It is the people who pay for it.Rural communities have particular characteristics and needs that must be addressed, in terms of at the most basic, accessibility to services. Like everyone , they have rights.Access to healthcare is a right, not a privilege.If it is to be the case that urgent care is being restructured, citizens in rural areas which, for this purpose, includes virtually anyone outside the Greater Belfast area, cannot be expected to forego services so that Belfast can continue to enjoy a proleration of emergency services, with not one but two Type  emergency departments on the scale of that at the Ulster Hospital, on its overdeveloped and cramped site, the Royal Victoria Hospital and the Mater, with the Type  unit at the Lagan Valley hospital, just seven miles from Belfast, a similar distance to that travelled by the people of Ardglass to the Downe hospital.Of course, Type  emergency departments are also to be found at Antrim and Craigavon, neither of which are far from Belfast and are linked by the best possible road infrastructure.Logically, it would seem, that the existence of two Type  units in Belfast is not sustainable, given the apparent massive pressure on services.We were told by the Department of Health at the time of the January  public meeting in Downpatrick Cricket Club that the purpose of that meeting was to enable local people to ldquofundamentally shape, inform and influence the criteria to be used to deliver services in the future.We hope that is still the case and await meaningful engagement with the community before change is implemented.The then deputy permanent secretary was quoted as having said that the then Minister would want to see ldquoongoing engagement in redesigning services. I am sure that the current Health Minister has the same views.The challenge for the Health Minister in the future must surely be to develop a fair and equitable distribution of services that would end discrimination against rural communities and ensure that all services, including ambulance services, are readily accessible to all of the people.It is worth remembering as well, that there was actually a .%in the attendances at emergency departments in Northern Ireland between December  and December . In the same period, attendances at the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department rose signicantly.Decisions about change in the health service are political decisions. All of the major parties form the Northern Ireland Executive, which is collectively accountable for the program for government and all that it delivers or fails to deliver for the people.It is imperative that any attempt to change or restructure healthcare provision in Northern Ireland is done so in full consultation with the end users of the services, who are also the paymasters for it. This will be very dficult, as history has created a deep mistrust between substantial elements in our community and the Department of Health.Our community has suffered greatly from repeated cuts to services and the ruthless pursuit of a centralisation agenda a pursuit that has continued even in recent years when the NHS in England and Wales has been investing in and supporting smaller hospitals, recognising their crucial roles at the heart of local communities and using technological advances to support them.If it appears that Covid- is being used as a cover to implement long-standing Department of Health policy, then any changes would be resented by the community and in fact rejected by it. This would lead to an irreparable breach of trust between the people and the State.If an attempt is made to in any way reduce the services that are currently on offer at the Downe Hospital, this community, as it has done before, will rise up in righteous indignation.Twenty five thousand people took to the streets of Downpatrick in February . If our emergency department is not restored within a reasonable timescale mdash a matter of weeks mdash it is very likely that this area will see an unprecedented display of anger, with , plus people on the street, with legal challenges about any perceived abuse of process and a community-wide campaign, a cross-community campaign and political upheaval at the highest level of government.The people of East and South Down have had enough. They have reluctantly sacriced local services, as a temporary measure in the short term, but their resolve should not be underestimated.The people of Newcastle, Ballynahinch, Castlewellan, Ardglass, Killough, Clough, Downpatrick, Strangford, Crossgar, Lower Mourne and the vast surrounding rural hinterland need these services.Farmers, fishermen and builders need emergency care as much as ever, so too do the tourists who flock into our area every year and probably will do so in even greater numbers this year.It is time to restore the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department and it is time to concentrate investment in local services, delivering for the people who need the services, where they need those services.The NHS must serve the people from ldquocradle to grave. It is a part of the social contract between the people and those who govern them.Politicians and administrators come and go. The Downe hospital must live on, developing all the time the range of services it offers.Equality demands nothing less..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Revered servant of local cricket  ","story":"Robin Walsh remembers Alfie Linehan, the distinguished Downpatrick cricket stalwart who died last yearTHE great paradox of Alfie Linehan was to be found in his disposition on the cricket field and off it.At the crease, his was a belligerent style, hitting the ball farther than anyone , compiling his runs in a manner that kept the scorers busy. Beyond the boundary!Yet this domineering, almost bullying, approach belied one of Irish cricketrsquos truest gentlemen off it: soft-spoken, never a word that offended, never a word against him.In one of the most distinguished legacies to the local game, the late Downpatrick farmer captained the Ireland team before turning to administration in the roles of chairman and president of the Northern Cricket Union and president of the Irish Cricket Union.Yet it was where it mattered most, at the grassroots of the game, that Alfie left his indelible mark.His devotion to the Downpatrick club and its famous international ground The Meadow was boundless and le-long, from underage player to captain of the club, coach and ultimately chairman and president.He either played or captained Downpatrick in five NCU Senior League, three Senior Cup-winning sides and an Irish Senior Cup triumph along with his older brother Hugh, another talented batsman whose death at the age of  dealt a terrible blow to Alfie.In later years it was a source of great pride that Hughrsquos son, Paul, was to captain the club and daughter Anne played for Ireland.His wersquos nephew, James Cunningham, also captained the club.Alfiersquos hard-hitting ways over four decades from the s took him to  Irish appearances mdash six of them as captain mdash in the days when international caps were much less liberally awarded, and his contribution to the success of NCU representative cricket has rarely been equalled.Administration was an endless labour of love at local, provincial and national level. Such was his accommodating nature that he chaired countless committees ranging from solving an umpire shortage in the NCU to raising funds at ICU golf days.His contribution to his local community extended far beyond the boundaries of the cricket club.In his day he was a member of the NI Sports Council, a director of his local hospital trust and president of Ardglass Golf Club.Alfiersquos friends were legion, none more close than Cecil Walker, that leading light of the Lisburn club.Their playing days over, they travelled the world with their wives watching international cricket and storing delightful memories of new friendships, whether tales of the Bodyline era over tea with Harold Larwood at his home in Sydney, or a fond mention by David lsquoBumblersquo Lloyd from the commentary box.Of all thatrsquos been written down the years about Alfie Linehan, one game has been overlooked and yet it speaks more than any of his commitment to Downpatrick.It was Saturday, August , , and Downpatrick were due to play Lurgan. It was also the day of Alfiersquos wedding to his beloved Mary. No problem: wedding in the morning, cricket in the afternoon, reception in the evening, off on honeymoon the next day.Of all the tributes paid to Alfie none has been more signicant than that on BBC Televisionrsquos Sports Personality of the Year programme last December.He was included in the prestigious roll of honour of international sports personalities who had died during .

play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch on social media.There is a lsquoPODS public grouprsquo on Facebook, PODS quiz nights are being held on Zoom, and there is a website to keep track at podspenarth.org article_url   content_id   site_id

station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPoliticsProposed name for leisure centre under the spotlightArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council’s Ulster Unionist grouping will meet today to discuss a range of matters including the name of a new £ million leisurecentre.By The NewsroomMonday, nd June , : pm\"\"A perspective of the new South Lake Leisure Centre in Craigavon.The meeting of the UUP council group is, the Local Democracry Reporting Service understands, due to take place at pm, just over two hours before Council’s monthly meeting at which the DUP will present a controversial proposal to name the South Lake Leisure Centre ‘Centinary Leisure Centre’.The proposal looks certain to ide the chamber and due to the make up of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council, the Ulster Unionist Party’s vote will be crucial to its success or failure.SDLP Councillor Joe Nelson has called on the UUP to vote against it and described the move as “nothing more than a political stunt”.“The proposal will be taken by the Catholic Nationalist community as another insult by the DUP group on Council as it continues to try and drag us back to the ‘Ballygobackwards’ days of Craigavon Council,” said Councillor Nelson.“It is a slap in the face to nationalist people and I would urge the Ulster Unionist Party to stand up and be counted.”The Alliance Party has also come out in opposition to the proposal, with party group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson concerned such a move would require an equality impact assessment.“Any change at this late stage would mean further delay to the opening of the centre and additional cost to ratepayers as an Equality Impact Assessment would have to be satisfied, signage replaced at a potential cost of more than £k and planning implications would have to be considered,” said Cllr Tennyson.“We may even find ourselves in a position where residents are left without leisure provision altogether for an extended period.”He continued: “The centenary of Northern Ireland is a signicant event in our shared history, and of course it is right that we mark it in a thoughtful, inclusive and informative way.“Now, more than ever, people want to see their councillors showing leadership, working together and focused on the ongoing pandemic.“Engaging in political point-scoring or afaux fight over the name of a leisure centre ismerely a distraction from that.”Speaking last week, DUP group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter said of the proposal: “Our country celebrates a great milestone on May  next year, our th anniversary as a nation within the United Kingdom.“Given the current economic situation, we, as a party, discussed a fitting and inexpensive way to mark this signicant anniversary, so we will propose that the Council officially name the new leisure centre in Craigavon as the ‘Centenary Leisure Centre’.”A decision on the proposal will be taken at tonight’s full meeting of Armagh City, Banbridge and CraigavonBorough Council.Sinn Fein was asked for comment.Adam Morton , Local Democracy Reporting Service\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\"

From  July, subject to the rate of community transmission continuing to be low, people will no longer need to shield and should instead follow the same guidance and precautions as those considered to be generally vulnerable. That involves taking particular care when out and about - and strictly maintaining social distancing.Letters will be issued in the coming days to all those covered by shielding informing them of the planned change.Mr Swann stated: “I have been clear that shielding would not last one minute longer than it needed to. We have now reached the point where,the current trends continue, there will be no need for anyone to shield after  July. “I have listened to many of you and to the challenges you have faced during this period. I am in no doubt as to the dficulties shielding has presented for a great many people.“It is unrealistic to think these dficulties will just vanish because the need to shield has ended. That is why the letters we issue will provide details of the support which will continue to be available up to and after  July.“While my announcement today will be welcome news for many who are shielding, some will view the prospect of an end to shielding with great anxiety. I want to assure them that they should decide what to do at their own pace. Everyone will approach this situation dferently.“As is so often the case at present, this will be about weighing up the options and making informed choices. Going outside can bring some degree of potential risk but this can be mitigated and minimised by strict social distancing. Staying indoors indefinitely is not good for anyone’s mental or physical health.“Finally, I would ask everyone to be considerate as people end their periods of shielding.We should all continue to social distance, but in the coming weeks I want you to be particularly understanding of the fact you might be encountering someone who has had to stay at home for many weeks. Please be aware of this, show respect and kindness to all and keep your distance.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bbbdcfcadb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_abfecbbccebde   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
