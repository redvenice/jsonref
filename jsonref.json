Everyone on Sark loves that the place is stuck in an era long gone by.\u0027But even Sark cannot escape economic and financial reality.

You can fix up or even replace an existing building, but adding an entirely new building is restricted to residents who have been there for at least 15 years.\u0027Even during the boom of the mid-2000s, when tens of millions of pounds of tourism-related investment poured into Sark, the island only had 650 residents.\u0027The population has since gradually sunk to its current level. Jobs fell away, and the local government didn\u0027t make an effort to bring in new residents. With the shrinking population came an alarming ageing of the community. The average age of Sark\u0027s population is now over 60, compared to 42 in the UK.\u0027Mr Lorenz has launched the website and said he will do everything to help people relocate.He added: \u0027As a resident I am greatly concerned that we are reaching a point where the community is simply not viable anymore.\u0027I have just decided to step forward and put myself out there and set up a website and a service where people can get help if they want to move to Sark.\u0027Seigneur Beaumont said he had been in discussions with Mr Lorenz \u0027for a long time\u0027 about the idea.He added: \u0027If it becomes successful then we\u0027ll find more people wanting to come to Sark than we\u0027ve got space for.\u0027And I would prefer to be in that situation than in a situation where we have piles of empty properties and nobody knowing that there\u0027s a place to live.\u0027 The island’s government, the Chief Pleas, has been approached for comment. "},{"url":null,"title":"Despair delight UKs Covid exam generation","story":"Share this article England\u0027s exams regulator Ofqual previously said that the national results are likely to be higher this summer than previous years following disruption.Teachers were told to submit the grades they thought each student would have received if they had sat the papers after exams were cancelled.

His team piled in with blankets to put him out – but he still lost an eyebrow and some of his moustache’Storm Thorgerson and I had created most of the artwork for Pink Floyd’s albums, including Dark Side of the Moon. One day we were asked to Abbey Road Studios to listen to tracks from the band’s new record. The lyrics were mostly about absence, and the album’s title, Wish You Were Here, was a reference to Syd Barrett, who had left the band some years earlier due to issues with LSD. They were also making a statement about record company executives who regarded musicians as money-making machines, demanding one hit song after another – an\u0026nbspabsence of\u0026nbspa different kind.I went to Los Angeles to find a Hollywood stuntman. The photograph was taken on the Warner Bros back lot in Burbank with Ronnie Rondell, the guy on fire, shaking hands with another stuntman, Danny Rogers. I explained to Ronnie what I needed and he said: “It’s dangerous for a man to stand still on fire. Normally, you’re running and the fire’s spreading behind you, or you’re falling and the fire is above you, or you can always make out with camera angles that the stunt person is closer to the fire than they really are, but to stand still …?” He was very reluctant, but eventually agreed.\u0026nbspI had a suit and wig made that were soaked in flame retardant, Ronnie was covered in this gel – it was like napalm – and his team set him on fire. We repeated the process 14 times, took the shot, and then on the 15th a gust of wind blew up and wrapped the fire around his face and burnt him. He threw himself to the ground and his whole team piled on blankets to put him out. He said: “That’s it! I’m done!” However, I had captured the shot successfully on that last take. Ronnie was very gracious about it considering he had lost an eyebrow and some of his moustache, but as far as he was concerned as a professional in the movie industry it was all in a day’s work.I knew I had got a special picture. It took a long time to persuade Ronnie to stand exactly as I wanted but in the end he was very brave and it was a perfect composition. Years afterwards Ronnie said his only regret was most people know him more for the Pink Floyd album cover than the famous fire stunts he had performed in movies such as The Towering Inferno.Back in London, Storm suggested to the band that we should not give away the front cover picture quite so easily and if the album is really about absence we should make the cover photograph absent too. So we shrink-wrapped the whole package in black plastic. When it was released people had no idea what the album cover looked like. Some would tear off the plastic wrapping and throw it away, while others would carefully cut it open with a surgical knife, extract the vinyl and keep the package intact. It felt like Christmas – you are given something, you rip off the paper, which is physical and tactile, and when you open it up there’s a present inside.Album covers were important in those days. They were signposts to what the band was all about, because you didn’t have MTV, or Spotify or YouTube, and only four or five music papers and maybe a couple of weekly TV pop shows were available to fans.With Pink Floyd, I always seem to get into some scrape or other. At Roger Waters’ request I flew a giant inflatable pig over Battersea power station for Pink Floyd’s Animals cover, but it escaped into the flightpath of planes flying into Heathrow airport. It could have caused an aviation disaster – thank God it didn’t. We managed to retrieve the pig and rephotograph the shot again the next day, and the photograph looked fabulous in the end.The image of the band was not a priority for Hipgnosis. What we did care about was creating an eye-catching idea that would be visually and intellectually stimulating but was not necessarily related to the lyrics or the title of the album.\u0026nbspWe enjoyed creating designs that were visual puns or stories with photographs so when people looked carefully they could decide what the picture was about for themselves. Hipgnosis never gave explanations for our work, and like a mystery novel, a man on fire shaking hands was a conundrum to be solved.\u0026nbspTraining: The London School of Film Technique.High point: “A picture we did very early on for a band called the Nice. It was a picture of 40 red footballs in the Sahara desert.”Low point: “Doing a photograph that you really think’s going to turn into something great, and it’s a piece of shit. And sometimes there’s no explanation for that.” Top tip: “You have to network, have acumen, and be street-smart about how you’re going to develop this career and be something.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7d2351826f61cdbb2a9c11ee0edcf482f50e37d/612_569_2874_1725/master/2874.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f748f6a84e9ee1f3d05e462a9b510dba","title":"black excellence stars of afropunk in pictures","story":"Since 2005, Afropunk has celebrated the music, fashion and beatboxing of black artists – and seen the crowd swell to 70,000.

Unsurprisingly, it’s harder to find a job with a shorter CV while businesses are barely hiring. With the coronavirus pandemic causing the deepest recession in living memory, that task has become nigh on Herculean, writes Richard Partington.Enter the government to make matters worse. After the downgrading of A-level grades in England this year, the hard times for school leavers are multiplied even further.Official figures from Britain’s jobs market earlier this week showed that it is the youngest and oldest members of the workforce that are feeling the pinch as unemployment rises. Young adults are more likely to work in the hardest-hit sectors of the economy – such as hospitality, leisure and retail – making them more vulnerable to the recession.A month earlier Boris Johnson had promised every young person in Britain an “opportunity guarantee”. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, put some flesh on the bones of that bare statement in his “plan for jobs” summer statement. But the early evidence from companies is that they need more help to hire young people.According to the British Chambers of Commerce, a minority of companies plan to use the chancellor’s new kickstart scheme – a £2.1bn package of support to create work placements for young people. Almost a third of businesses surveyed by the lobby group hadn’t even heard of the policy.Given the scale of the pandemic, more needs to be done through the tax and spending system to support businesses to take on young workers. For others, it will be better to stay in education. Here, the Resolution Foundation has proposed a new maintenance support scheme to help thousands stay in education and build up their skills until the jobs market improves.Rather than downgrading young people’s life chances, the government must upgrade its response, and make the prime minister’s opportunity guarantee more than just a soundbite.The prognosis delivered by the International Energy Agency’s monthly oil market health check may have been poor, but at least it came as no surprise to the troubled industry, writes Jillian Ambrose.The global oil watchdog on Thursday cut its demand forecasts for this year, and the next, as the coronavirus continues to sap demand for transport fuels. Great news for the environment, some might say, but global oil demand is also a key indicator of global economic health – and there’s no sign of a speedy recuperation.In many ways, the IEA’s forecast offers final confirmation – if it were needed – that the global economy is in no fit state to bounce back from the pandemic.The basis of its decision to cut next year’s oil demand forecasts by 140,000 barrels is a surge in the number of global coronavirus cases, which is likely to keep a lid on economic activity – and therefore oil demand too. By next year, demand will be 240,000 barrels a day lower than previous forecasts as global aviation falls short of its rude health of 2019.Oil traders greeted the news with little more than a shrug, and market prices remained steady. It has already been a long year for the market, and it will take more than the now-familiar economic gloom to disturb a sluggish summer trading session.On closer inspection, the bad news is that this doesn’t represent huge pent-up demand. The majority of those 1.5m bookings are simply rolled over from people whose 2020 plans have been dashed by coronavirus – and, as Which? and other consumer groups have ceaselessly pointed out, have not been readily refunded.In fact only a measly 50,000 more people than last year have got round to booking ahead – a worrying statistic, given that usually customers would be more concerned about getting their towel on a pool lounger rather than securing a future trip.With the cash in the bank, TUI can only cut costs – such as slashing 166 UK high street stores – and hope it survives the better to dominate a battered travel market, however long that takes. As too many consumers now know, in times of pandemic, forward bookings are no longer a guarantee, for TUI’s prospects as much as their thwarted holidays."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bff1bbef7f83ca5cb98416dfba6edf5ca0b0e1e/36_47_2924_1754/master/2924.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=26201106650039221e4c9fd33f778d72","title":"share your reaction and experiences on a level results day 2020","story":"Whatever your story, and wherever you’re headed next, tell us how you feel about this year’s resultsEmotions will be running high on Thursday as students across the country get their A-level results amid a row over how grades have been calculated due to the Covid pandemic.The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, last night sought to placate pupils and their families by saying he was “incredibly sorry” for the disruption to their education during the coronavirus outbreak.

Chambers, who hopes to study maths at the University of Birmingham, considered staying in halls, but decided against it. “I chose to stay at home because it’s easier financially, and is probably a more stable option during the pandemic,” he says. “Who knows what will happen?”Chambers isn’t alone in making a difficult decision about where to live. Students must always decide between different types of living arrangements, and this year the Covid-19 pandemic is another factor to consider.In reality, the options around accommodation remain pretty much the same, says Ian Munton, director of library and student services at the University of Staffordshire. Students must choose between student halls, private accommodation such as shared houses, or commuting.First-year students normally stay in halls of residence. This year, the experience will be different, with some unis planning to create “social bubbles” where students may have to live with coursemates.Ian Jones, deputy director of accommodation at the University of Sheffield, says nothing should feel too strange for students: measures in public spaces will be similar to elsewhere, such as floor markings to ensure distance and the provision of hand sanitisers. “But we’re looking at ways to do as many in-person social activities as we can,” he says, for instance by making use of outdoor space.Jones advises students to talk to someone at the university if they’re worried. “One thing we can do is sit down in person or online with everyone in the flat and come to a flatmate agreement on how things like cleaning will be managed.”Students who are in high-risk groups don’t have to rule out student accommodation either, he says. “Ring up and speak to the accommodation office to see what’s in place,” he advises. Universities may be able to provide special accommodation with fewer people, so have those conversations, he says.With so much still up in the air, is it wise to sign up for accommodation now, or should students leave it until the last minute? Many unis say they will release you from contracts if coronavirus guidance changes pre-September. However, this may not be the case everywhere, or for private accommodation.Daniel Fitzpatrick, a housing partner at law firm Hodge Jones \u0026amp Allen, says it’s all down to the contract. So look for a clause that says if you can’t attend, you can waive the rent. “Just be wary,” he says. “A lot of students don’t know that many halls of residence are now owned privately. Ask the university what guarantees they can give you.”Dan Roberts, founder of Mystudenthalls, says some private providers have introduced special Covid-19 cancellation policies, so look for this in the contract. However, providers without such a policy may not be willing to negotiate an early release from tenancies if there is a second wave of coronavirus.All this may make commuting seem like an appealing option. If you opt to stay at home you’ll need to look at transport, as well as at the support your uni offers. You should be able to access the library and other essential student facilities.Whatever option you go for, remember it will be different this year. “It’s not going to be the same experience,” Jones says, “but I think it’ll be a really good one.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0546c021bac4427c4742ba0793eeaee5bb1aa013/1004_1695_3266_1960/master/3266.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f7ac4faf60b28cfcd9d0842242a448f","title":"who won and who lost when a levels meet the algorithm","story":"Disadvantaged students among those more likely to have received lower grades than predictedStudents from disadvantaged backgrounds were more likely to be downgraded.

But when super-rich people use the phrase, it means something quite different. Oeke Hoogendijk’s bracing and amusing documentary is about high-stakes shenanigans in the art market involving seriously minted Rembrandt fanciers. It features an awful lot of very rich, clever, cordially self-satisfied collectors and connoisseurs their pink, twinkly-eyed faces positively beam out of the screen, and surely Hoogendijk is inviting us to wonder how Rembrandt himself would have painted them.In Scotland, the Duke of Buccleuch has invited someone from Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum to advise him on the rehanging of his prize possession: Old Woman Reading (1655). Did the Dutch visitor hope that His Grace might therefore loan this exquisite painting to the Rijksmuseum? If so, he was to be disappointed. Meanwhile, in France, Eric de Rothschild is selling two spectacular Rembrandts: the twin portraits of Martin Soolmans and Oopjen Coppit, painted for their wedding in 1634. The Rijksmuseum wanted them, but to its rage had to buy them jointly, in a museum time-share with the Louvre, which had cunningly encouraged the French government to block a monopoly sale to a non-French buyer.Most controversially of all, the dapper young Amsterdam dealer Jan Six, a descendant of the Jan Six that Rembrandt painted, spotted a painting up for auction in London that the people at Christie’s didn’t realise was an undiscovered Rembrandt.

They will not merely make up the numbers but, in many ways, the numbers make them.Before May 2009, there was no team bearing the name. Now they are managed by a 33-year-old and they have, just as they intended all along, gatecrashed Europe’s biggest party with a goal from an American who turned 21 on Valentine’s Day.Tyler Adams is everything Red Bull had imagined when the idea of adding a German club to their global empire became real. He has been part of the system since the age of 12, coming through their New York operation before making the leap to Leipzig last year. In 27 appearances he had yet to score but then, finding space in a stretched finale to what had been a largely draining encounter, that changed in history-altering fashion.Atlético Madrid had looked the likelier winners after equalising through a penalty from their own tyro, João Félix, whose introduction had sparked an otherwise dreary performance from the three-times runners-up. Yet Leipzig had been the ones playing with precision and, when Marcel Sabitzer released the left wing-back Angeliño with a delicious outside-of-the-boot pass, it was fair to assume what happened next would have a point to it.Sure enough, Angeliño showed presence of mind in cutting the ball back while four defenders and two forwards hared towards the six-yard box. It meant Adams, who had been summoned from the bench after Atlético’s goal, had space to take aim from 20 yards. Maybe his daisycutter would have sneaked inside the far post maybe not. A deflection off Stefan Savic, leaving Jan Oblak with no chance, meant we will never know and nobody in Leipzig’s colours was about to concern themselves with the scruffiness of the finish.The old dog had been rendered lame by a set of new tricks that may also signify a changing of Europe’s guard. Once it was Atlético, gnarled punchers who kept bouncing back from the ropes, who ground their way to the top when eyes were largely elsewhere. Here Leipzig gave at least as good as they got physically, the brilliant centre-back Dayot Upamecano rendering Diego Costa mere dust when he was not marauding upfield or prompting attacks from deep, but also offered so much more. They were slick, structured, smart, stylish when the situation allowed, even if this was far from their most eyecatching display. It was Leipzig, whose precocious manager, Julian Nagelsmann, could probably name his price if one of the established elite called next week, who played with the clarity that suggested they wanted to win through wit and invention.At the outset it seemed they would need those qualities in bundles, given Timo Werner’s early departure for Chelsea. He was replaced up front by the strapping Yussuf Poulsen, who is the nearest thing Leipzig have to a historic totem. Poulsen joined in 2013 as arguably their first “statement” signing, when they were still a third-tier club. He sliced one second-half shot comically out of play for a throw-in but it would be a stretch to say Leipzig were poorer for his presence.Instead they got to work and trusted in their methods. Marcel Halstenberg, the left-side centre-back, should have volleyed them into an early lead and they were the better side in an increasingly attritional first half. Nagelsmann has ensured they are easy on the eye without being gung-ho: Atlético were allowed territory but, more often than not, knew little of how to use it.When the La Liga side showed some penetration, José Giménez had a header blocked and then watched as Saúl Ñíguez tumbled under a challenge from the Leipzig goalkeeper, Peter Gulacsi. Simeone screamed blue murder on the sideline and made his own signal for a VAR check, which eventually decided there was nothing doing. Before Félix eventually did win a penalty, Renan Lodi had been booked for an egregious e under Upamecano’s challenge. Leipzig were no angels, as three yellow cards would impart, but nor did they resort to anything like that.Their first goal, which mercifully opened up the game five minutes after half-time, was a beautifully-angled header on the run by Dani Olmo after another meticulous move had let Sabitzer cross from the right. A desperate challenge from Lukas Klostermann, a relative old-timer like Poulsen, on Félix led to the leveller for Simeone’s team but that aberration was among their few frayed moments.Félix, the £113m signing who has had a mixed first year at Atlético, might wonder under which of these setups he may best fulfil his potential. There is no chance of Leipzig, whose recruitment model stands far above most, shelling out fees like that. Nor is there any suggestion, after such a seismic match, that their approach is close to reaching its ceiling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7688119cd221130fe20d8ed0041218bf34864bb5/0_314_5848_3510/master/5848.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=b598f84ddc53705fe434662f7f086cbb","title":"uk passengers barred from flights to greece over confusing covid forms","story":"Holidaymakers hit by problems with contact-tracing rules and varying airline interpretationsDozens of holidaymakers have been barred from boarding flights from the UK to Greece because of confusing red tape caused by the coronavirus.In July the Greek government announced that all passengers must submit a personal locator form including their travel and contact details 48 hours before departure. They are then emailed a QR code, which must be downloaded and presented at check-in.The details are used for contact tracing in the event of a Covid-19 outbreak and arrivals who fail to comply face a €500 fine.However, delays in receiving the code and differing interpretations of the rules by airlines have led to passengers being turned away at the airport.Some travellers claim that their airline did not inform them of the new requirements or that minor form-filling errors cost them their holiday.Karoki Lewis and his family were forbidden to board their easyJet flight to Kefalonia because he had not included the names of his two young children on the form.“It appears to be impossible to add more than two passengers on the form many other families have been affected because they only managed to enter the parents’ details,” he said.“I pointed out that small children would obviously be with their parents throughout their holiday and therefore would be easily contactable for any Covid-19 tracing but I was told that even if we were allowed on the flight, the Greek authorities would send us straight home.”The family spent £1,000 on new flights and accommodation a week later. EasyJet said it provides clear guidance to passengers by email, text and Flight Tracker when they book a flightConflicting advice on official websites has caused many passengers to fall foul of the rules.The Greek government website initially stated that all passengers over 18 had to fill out separate forms this month the advice was changed to allow households to fill out a single form and the deadline was changed to 24 hours before departure.However, a confusing layout has left some passengers unclear how to add more than two names to the online form and some airlines are still insisting that each adult must submit separate forms. Carriers face steep fines if they transport passengers with inadequate documents.Last week Wizz Air offloaded 28 passengers from a flight to Athens, citing inadequately completed forms. Several were denied boarding because they had not included their middle names, even though this is marked optional on the form. The airline has since admitted an error.“As a matter of priority, we are investigating whether any passengers were wrongfully denied carriage on the flight as a result of not including a middle name on their PLF, despite correctly completing the rest of the form,” a spokesperson said.“Should there be any affected passengers, Wizz Air will contact them directly to apologise and offer the relevant compensation, as well as the options of rebooking or refunding their ticket.”The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) website confirms that only one form and QR code is required for each household but warns that some airlines insist on separate submissions and advises passengers to check with their airline what documents they need to show. In a nod to the form’s confusing layout, it also details how to add more than two family members.A spokesperson for the Greek embassy denied that delays in sending QR codes have grounded passengers and stated that it is the airlines’ responsibility to ensure that passengers have the correct paperwork.Other European countries, including the UK, require travellers from certain regions to complete health declarations or locator forms for contact tracing and passengers are being urged to check the FCO website when booking flights to ensure they comply."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/812bcecfb993889c7ac4ccce5f0067dfa6f1d0df/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d30b945e1eadbd96c699947cd13f336f 2020w","title":"a post pandemic guide for retailers think of your customers as your biggest fans","story":"Lockdown has shown us that people will support the brands they want to succeed – a business expert’s advice to store ownersThe retail sector has been in flux for some time and, post coronavirus, there’s more uncertainty to come.“There is a lot of talk about ‘returning to normal’ or of the ‘new normal’, but prior to the pandemic the only normal was that everything was changing,” says business consultant Neil Gibb. The pandemic has simply accelerated that transformation, he said ahead of a British Retail Consortium webinar on the impact of Covid-19.Even an industry that has weathered its fair share of storms has never seen an event of this size and significance, and it’s becoming clear that the rules of engagement are changing. As retailers navigate uncharted waters, these are the rules that matter right now:Put safety firstAbove all, responsible businesses have to prioritise safety, both for staff and customers. According to Kyle Monk, head of retail insights and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, retailers are working hard on both implementing safety measures and communicating them clearly. Luckily, technology is on our side when it comes to designing systems that put safety first, but not at the expense of the customer experience. He cites a technology company that has shop assistants available by video screen in-store. The remote shop assistants can engage with you in a similar way in which they would normally.While it may seem at first that the new retail environment will not make the most fun of shopping experiences, with creativity, innovation and by utilising tech, companies can get the balance right.Be collaborative“The scale of the pandemic and the speed with which we’ve had to adopt a new way of living has left many of us feeling uncertain – especially retailers,” says Andrew Lawson, senior vice-president EMEA for Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. The good news, however, is that a sense of optimism is emerging as businesses deal successfully with unstable operating conditions. “We’ve seen incredible stories of resilience coming out of the pandemic, as retailers and their suppliers band together to maintain the flow of goods,” says Lawson.This collaborative spirit will be important for the industry if it is to retain momentum, share best practice and agree about what support may be needed from the government. “It’s kind of unprecedented,” says Monk. “I don’t think, to be honest, any other industry is coordinating in the way that retail is at the moment.”PrioritiseWhile some retailers have launched e-commerce platforms in record time – one European chain that had around 1,000 stores but no e-commerce platform, managed to launch one in 13 weeks – Lawson suggests that incremental digital transformation might be the better way forward. Zendesk is finding that many of its customers are reluctant to invest time and money in total digital transformation when there is still so much uncertainty. “The priority is to identify solutions that can deliver returns on investment quickly,” he says. “For example, by looking at an omnichannel approach, you can bring all the information you have on a customer together in one place. This will provide your marketing and sales teams with invaluable insights.”Support your staffWe may never return to business as usual but, according to Lawson, companies can move forward by supporting and listening to feedback from staff. He also emphasises the connection between a happy and valued workforce, and the ability to be agile, scalable and resilient. “By helping employees adapt to new systems and processes through training and regular communication, and by really listening to feedback, the new styles and systems that we work under really can work for everyone,” he says.Appeal to your fansThere has never been a better time for companies to revisit their core purpose – building a trusted and valued brand. Research from Zendesk shows that customers have been more patient during the pandemic. While the volume of service requests and wait times have gone up, customer satisfaction remains fairly steady, indicating brand loyalty. Customers will support the brands that they want to succeed, says Monk.And Gibb believes successful retailers won’t have customers going forward, they’ll have loyal fans – people who care deeply about what that brand really stands for. For decision-makers in the retail business, who feel that the ground is constantly shifting beneath them, focusing on purpose could provide a much needed stable foundation.Things are changing fast.

Now everyone faces a new issue: how to return to some semblance of business normality.“The world of work – particularly how we think about work and how we think about where we work, has fundamentally shifted,” says coach and productivity expert Karen Eyre-White. “A lot of businesses have been in crisis mode. What we’re seeing now is them having to get back to a new normal with strategy, boundaries and structure in place.”Some things haven’t changed. As before, high productivity will be a priority – particularly given the gloomy economic predictions. Achieving it depends on motivation, training and technology, time management and support from others. But how can businesses make sure they have these essentials in place as we move out of lockdown and get back to work?Have clarity of purposeWith so much uncertainty around, business leaders need to reassure staff by projecting confidence and clarity wherever possible. “Try to be certain about as much as you can,” says Eyre-White, whether that involves scheduling regular catch-up meetings, or deciding the office won’t reopen until next year. Managers can boost their own productivity and that of their team by being clear about their priorities for any given day or week, and encouraging others to do the same.Aligning those priorities with the company’s objectives will keep even a remote team moving in the right direction, says Chris Bailey, author of Hyperfocus: How to Work Less to Achieve More. “The greatest challenge that businesses face in normal times is orienting what everybody’s working on toward what the purpose of the business is … and that’s still the case,” he says. “The more intentional we are about how we work and what we work on, the more productive we become.”Where priorities have changed, it’s important to communicate that effectively to staff, says Sarah Manning, senior HR director at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “I can’t imagine many organisations didn’t have to pivot in some way in lockdown. Leaders need to be really clear now about what the expectation of their teams are going to be and put in measures to help people adapt.”Empower staff to find their way of workingProductivity can be difficult to measure, but focusing on the tasks achieved rather than the hours someone is at their desk can boost efficiency. Despite reports that lockdown led to an upsurge in demand for workforce surveillance tools, Eyre-White says that such an approach is unlikely to be effective. “Inidually, everyone needs to do different things in order to be productive,” she adds. “I just do not see how a surveillance system is compatible with that.”Instead, businesses should be encouraging staff to find what works for them – some people might be most productive if they go for a walk in the morning, others might take short breaks after 45 minutes of focused work, while some team members might need to work around a young family at home.Projecting empathy for the circumstances many of us find ourselves in is important, says Manning. Particularly at present. “Life is crazy right now. I think employers need to acknowledge that.”Promote good communicationWhen it comes to managing virtual teams, good communication is key to ensuring staff feel supported and informed. “Once a company has made a decision, communicate it clearly,” says Manning. “You need to be careful not to go out with half a message and cause a whole lot of anxiety for people.”Keeping communication channels open can promote a culture of collaboration.Apps such as Zoom, Slack, other digital tools and internal help desks can help ensure “people still feel engaged, connected and therefore invested”, says Manning. Zendesk, for example, has held remote quizzes, yoga classes and Friday night drinks during lockdown. There are other examples of companies holding digital book clubs, remote murder mystery games, and scavenger hunts.“Anything you can do as a manager to foster meaningful connections between employees will go a long way,” Bailey says.It’s OK to have down timeStaff may be working from home, but it’s important not to encourage an “always on” culture that blurs the boundaries between work life and home life, Eyre-White says. “There’s this idea of e-presenteeism and needing to be seen,” she adds. “Staff can’t be seen in the office so they may feel they need to be replying to their emails or messages instantly. And that’s not how you get productive work done. You need time away from those things. Businesses need to be clear that it’s OK.”One way to set the tone is to offer training to managers to help them adapt to working with, and supporting, remote teams. Simple measures can set an example, such as resisting the temptation to email outside work hours, and blocking out time for breaks on a calendar that the team has access to.No one should feel guilty about taking a break from work, says Bailey. “Focusing on things all day long is one of the worst things we can do because our mind just needs a chance to wander. Mind the guilt that you experience around relaxation and know that it’s a phenomenon most of us experience.”Embrace flexibilityAlongside the difficulties of the past few months, for many firms there have also been opportunities for lasting change.“If going remote didn’t kill a business, companies are going to have to decide their answer when employees ask: ‘Can I work from home?’” Manning says. “There are huge benefits from a cost perspective … and I do think companies can potentially attract more candidates and more ersity.”Staying flexible – and that might mean some staff work remotely in the long term – will help foster an inclusive, productive culture that has broader benefits.“This has definitely opened our eyes up to those different possibilities,” Manning adds. “We are going to have a much more flexible approach to where people can work and how they work.”Things are changing fast.

A huge drop in sales during March seemed to sound the death knell for at least some sectors of the industry. Online sales, on the other hand, have rocketed and new approaches are emerging among those retailers that are learning to be agile.“Covid-19 has really accelerated a bunch of inevitables. A lot of things are just happening a lot faster,” says Steve Hewett, global vice president for retail customer experience at the tech and consultancy firm Capgemini.For many companies, online is exploding. “This was already happening,” says Hewett. “But some companies are achieving the sort of online growth in weeks that they expected in three or four years.”This has implications for how companies do business, and it’s likely to be crucial to be able to deliver a hybrid onlineoffline experience to the post-Covid-19 customer. Here are five trends currently reshaping the retail sector:Brands are getting chattierIt seems that customers engaged with brands more during lockdown. “For years, buying something meant going to a physical place, seeing the branding in the store and understanding who that brand is,” says Adrian McDermott, president of products at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “We need to establish the digital equivalents of finding, meeting and having those conversations.”Prices could remain “sticky”Rajesh Bhargave, a consumer behaviour expert, suggests that retailers need to be wary of changing their prices – whether up or down. “Consumers tend to remember what they paid previously and would view price increases as unjust in poor economic conditions.”Dropping prices is not always the answer either. Many consumers will have taken a financial hit and their wallets will be closed for concessionary spending. A knee-jerk reaction might be to cut prices to bring back that demand but, says Bhargave, associate professor of marketing at Imperial College Business School in London, this could have negative long-term effects and erode pricing power: “If you’ve been paying £10 for a meal and suddenly that’s £8 you start to wonder about the quality of the meal.”Brands have to add valueInstead of dropping prices, brands are likely to start looking at different ways to add value, says Bhargave. “If people want to dine at restaurants, they might want a more private and safe experience,” he says. “So how can you start offering a different service that charges a higher price and offers better value?”Video calling is another area that business is only starting to explore. “With so much taking place on Zoom, is there a higher-end service you can provide in this area?” Selfridges, for example, is offering online beauty and styling appointments, with products then delivered to customers at home.This is part of a move towards getting more revenue from fewer people, and appointments for in-store shopping also fall into this category. “It’s all part of offering a more customised, high-end experience,” says Bhargave.To bring the joy back into shopping, some stores are putting their energies into their window displays to encourage browsing and others are providing queue entertainment.The need for a new kind of agilityThings may never be the same. “We’ve almost got to hit the reset button,” says Hewett. “People are returning to school and the office and there’s no playbook on what the wants and needs are.” Moreover, whatever they are could change dramatically again. Hewett adds: “There’s an organisational need for agility that wasn’t there before, as brands aren’t able to be as tactical as they would like.”Things are changing fast. But you can be faster.

Despite government support, having to close their doors for months had a crippling effect on many and forced them to take action to keep afloat.For Steve Sanderson, founder of the independent menswear retailer Oi Polloi, lockdown pressed fast forward on an already tough situation for small businesses. The company’s store in Manchester has always been at its heart, but it also has a strong online and social presence. “Bricks and mortar operations are really difficult,” he says. “What’s going on at the moment is sort of a super fast wormhole journey into the future.”Sanderson says that things are going to be particularly tough for fashion stores, with an inevitable drop in footfall, plus the issues of being Covid-19-secure, such as being unable to let customers try on clothes unless the items are quarantined or cleaned afterwards. “If people can’t try things on, why would they come in to a clothes shop?” he asks.There are, though, some rays of hope. “We have a good connection with customers through our bricks and mortar business, and certain people will always like that. But we can’t afford to just be open – we have to find a way of making it work.“We’ll have to adapt and become something else, something people can’t get from anywhere else. I like the idea of click and collect because you can do something quite interesting with that. You could then also narrow down the time the store itself is open.”For Michelle Drew, co-founder of Established 25 Atelier, which sells fashion and home accessories, the coronavirus crisis forced her to reassess her ambitions. Before lockdown, Drew, who started in 2017 making scarves and bags for friends and family, was selling at a quarterly design market in Greenwich and had a monthly stall at Spitalfields market. When Covid-19 brought things grinding to a halt, her first thought was that she needed to get her website up and running, and really engage online. “I didn’t have a choice,” she says.Since then, Drew has joined online workshops and used the time to rethink her plans. “Previously, I thought I’d love to collaborate with other designers and have a premises. I’m now wondering if that’s the way forward, because so much has changed and I’m not sure things will ever be the same.”While Drew plans to return to physical selling at some point, she sees her business relying more on online trading. “It’s still a precarious situation. I definitely will return to the markets because I enjoy the contact, but I’m looking at other ways to move the business forward.”Bigger retailers, too, have faced challenges, for all their greater resources. Some have come through with flying colours, though, particularly if they had the right technology to hand.For Tesco, the coronavirus crisis brought an unprecedented surge in demand, but the company was well placed to react quickly. It already had emergency plans in place thanks to a “doomsday” management exercise four years ago. It had also embraced remote working, and had the technology to handle communication with 460,000 staff, suppliers, people services and security operations. These systems allowed the company to double its capacity for delivery and click and collect in just six weeks. Improvements to the computer algorithms used to drive picking technology – plus the army of pickers hired to cope with the increased demand – mean that whatever the future brings, the chain appears to have the flexibility to deal with it.Similarly, the online flower delivery company Bloom \u0026amp Wild proved its resilience. For its founder Aron Gelbard, protecting jobs by staying open was important, as was providing people with a way of showing they care for the loved ones they couldn’t see in lockdown.With its tailored CRM system, which manages queries from a range of channels, Bloom \u0026amp Wild now employs more than 25 customer service agents who manage between 3,000 and 3,500 inquiries every week – rising dramatically during peak times such as Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day and, undoubtedly, lockdown.The company uses Zendesk to manage its customer relationships, allowing agents to deal with inquiries across Twitter, email, phone, online chat, Facebook Messenger and SMS. Alongside this, analytics help the company forecast customer demand and plan for peaks.As a business that exists purely in the virtual world, it’s an example to retailers everywhere of what can be achieved by clever use of technology.Things are changing fast.

Sharing equipment is also not allowed and the coin tosses will take place outdoors – most likely on the pitch – and at the water break midway through each half, players will be assigned their own named bottles.All squads have also been warned over their use of bad language as the first Premiership action since March will take place behind closed doors and players will be easily heard on TV. There will also be a minute’s silence held before each match to honour the NHS, whose logo will be emblazoned on match officials’ kits.In the most recent round of Covid-19 testing, one player – from Northampton – produced a positive result but events in France, where Stade Français have had an outbreak of 25, throwing their participation in the start of the new Top 14 season into doubt, have demonstrated the dangers of a surge in cases. Premiership players have been tested twice this week and the results of the second round will be made public on Friday. If clubs are unable to fulfil fixtures due to an outbreak, the opposition will be awarded a 20-0 bonus-point victory. Teams could have points deducted in the event of a breach of their social bubble on away trips.Sale’s trip to Harlequins marks the first Premiership match for 159 days and the length of the delay means clubs face midweek fixtures and the gruelling schedule of seven matches in 28 days. Midweek matches make the dangers of an outbreak in a squad all the more acute so while players will be scrummaging, rucking and mauling throughout, social distancing measures remain in place.“Premier League football has done a fantastic job getting back with such a short timescale and we’ve rowed on the back of that,” said the Sale director of rugby, Steve Diamond. “The difference is the contact. There was some stat there is under two minutes of skin contact in professional football. I think there is 47 minutes of skin contact in rugby. Then you have the scrums and all the rest of it.”Diamond has backed Manu Tuilagi to make an immediate impact after throwing him straight into the starting lineup at the Stoop.

A 14-day quarantine on return to the UK from France will come into effect from 4am on Saturday (15 August), leaving a window of little more than 30 hours for travellers to get home if they want to escape the measures.The UK criteria for removing a country from the list is based on per capita case numbers. If these go above 20 per 100,000, the UK government categorises that country as high-risk. This Wednesday France reached 30.4, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, with significant numbers in recent days: 2,524 new cases were reported on Wednesday, up from 1,397 on Tuesday, and over 2,000 a day last weekend.For those already on holiday in France, Eurotunnel issued an advisory following the announcement late on Thursday (13 August): “In light of the change to quarantine requirements for UK travellers returning from France, Eurotunnel Le Shuttle would like to advise customers currently in France, and hoping to return early, that they must amend their tickets online at eurotunnel, before travelling to the French terminal. The service is already very busy this weekend and there is no additional capacity. To avoid long queues and severe disruption we strongly advise against turning up at the terminal outside the allocated time. Customers will be unable to board alternative shuttles without a valid booking.”Some holidaymakers may choose to accept the 14-day quarantine on return to the UK and travel regardless. Working from home may be an option, but bear in mind that quarantine rules are much stricter than lockdown. You are not allowed outside beyond your home or garden, to exercise or walk the dog. Children will not be able to start school. No visitors are allowed, apart from carers.Those in quarantine can only leave their homes to seek urgent medical assistance to obtain basic necessities such as food and medicine, where no one else can do so on their behalf, and they cannot be delivered to fulfil a legal obligation (such as a court hearing) on compassionate grounds (a funeral or visiting a critically ill family member) to access critical public services (eg social services) to move to a new place of self-isolation previously outlined in their Passenger Locator Form or in extenuating circumstances, such as a fire in the home.Anyone caught breaking quarantine faces a fine of up to £1,000 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and £480 in Scotland persistent offenders can be fined up to £5,000.As well as removing France from the travel corridors list, the Foreign Office has also updated its website to advise against all but essential travel. Although this is guidance rather than law, it could be risky to travel, given that the majority of insurers won’t cover travellers who choose to flout this guidance. Most policies will cover medical expenses for those who were already in France before the announcement – but anyone who travels after the advice changes wouldn’t be able to get help with hospital bills.Wearing masks in enclosed public spaces is compulsory for those aged 11 and over. This includes restaurants and bars, museums, shops, hotels and shared holiday properties, leisure centres, holiday parks, libraries, theatres, cinemas, places of worship, boats, covered markets, and other places where multiple people from different households gather. Masks are also mandatory on public transport and in taxis, and those not wearing them could face fines. Many attractions and restaurants will be running at reduced capacity, so booking ahead is advised.Social distancing is expected in other public areas, such as beaches – some of which have roped-off zones for sunbathers – as well as in town squares, campsites and around swimming pools.You have until 4am on Saturday (15 August) to get home before the quarantine requirement comes into force. Expect a rush to the ferry ports, and some very expensive last-minute flights home if you need to shorten a trip. Eurotunnel has cautioned about trying to make a dash home as it is currently fully booked meaning those cutting their trip short are unlikely to get on a train home.Unless you booked a fully refundable ticket, it is unlikely. However, the ferry firms are mostly allowing passengers with bookings up to 31 August to rebook for free, or offering vouchers that can be used next year. DFDS is offering travel credits that expire on 1 September 2021 and P\u0026ampO’s vouchers last a year. Brittany Ferries is the exception: it is saying that normal terms and conditions apply, so you will lose your money unless you booked a refundable ticket.Eurotunnel is allowing passengers who can’t travel the option to rebook next clear, or ultimately claim a voucher.The fact that flights are still operating means airlines are under no obligation to give refunds to those who choose not to travel. When Spain was taken off the no-quarantine list, British Airways and Ryanair both declined to help passengers who could no longer travel.The Ryanair website states: “Please note that a government imposed advice on quarantine period will not result in the flight being cancelled and an automatic entitlement to refunds.” EasyJet did offer passengers heading to Spain the chance to switch to alternative flights, but has yet to state its policy on trips to France.Eurostar says passengers with a booking up to 7 September can request a voucher that would be valid for 12 months from the date of issue.Again, accommodation providers are under no obligation to offer a refund, unless it was part of the original terms and conditions. Some hotels did offer cancellation options to encourage bookings, so check the reservation terms.Airbnb is allowing those who booked their trip on or before 14 March the option to cancel trips up to the end of August if “the pandemic is preventing you from completing your reservation”. Its standard cancellation terms apply to all bookings made after 14 March. Some people will end up losing half their money.Package holidays are Atol-protected meaning holidaymakers are entitled to a full refund when the Foreign Office advises against all but essential travel to a destination. The opportunity to change to alternative dates or destinations may be offered first.A few of the best travel policies offer cancellation cover if a quarantine is imposed, so check your policy terms. However, in most cases your travel policy will not pay out. You’re not automatically entitled to statutory sick pay if you are self-isolating after returning from holiday, according to industrial relations body Acas. If you can work from home, for instance, you can be paid as normal. But if you can’t, a solution could be to take annual leave. Downing Street has said those denied pay after being forced to isolate should claim universal credit, or seek arbitration.Employment lawyers have said that only those with two years’ service are protected against being made redundant for failing to come to work. Those with Covid-19 symptoms and who are self-isolating are entitled to statutory sick pay of £96 a week or higher."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d550e17b45a8adca4b7fef00d16fd8e1a7e15116/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a79e1de7659baef59754558d2b73713e","title":"global report covid 19 spikes across europe linked to young people","story":"Surges in Covid-19 cases in countries across Europe are due largely to a rise in infections among young people, data from national agencies shows, prompting fears among experts that the virus could soon spread back to more vulnerable groups.In Germany – which on Thursday reported a three-month high of 1,445 infections in 24 hours, against about 6,000 at the height of the pandemic – the health minister, Jens Spahn, said the rise in the infection rate among young people had been “significant”.The average age of people being infected with the virus was now 34, the lowest since the start of the epidemic, Spahn said. He described the development as concerning because it “could indicate the spread of the illness through the wider population”.The Netherlands is recording an average of just over 600 new cases a day, more than half its total at the peak of the pandemic. The chief epidemiologist, Jaap van Dissel, told MPs this week the surge had not led to an increase in hospitalisations, intensive care admissions or deaths because “so many cases concern young people”, who generally have milder symptoms.According to France’s Santé Publique agency, which on Thursday reported 2,669 cases, a new post-lockdown daily high, the Covid-19 incidence rate per 100,000 inhabitants in the 20 to 29 age group has risen to nearly 45 from 7 in early May.The incidence rate has also climbed from from 6.1 to 26.5 in the 30 to 39 age group. Over the same period, the infection rate among 80- to 89-year-olds halved, while in the over-90 age group it fell from 60 to 13.France’s health minister, Olivier Véran, confirmed late last month that those testing positive were “younger than during the previous wave” of the virus, suggesting that “people in more vulnerable groups have doubtless remained more prudent” while “young people tend to pay less attention”.The demographic shift appears clear, although experts warn that other factors – such as changes in testing policies – explain at least part of the increase. In France, for example, testing at the peak of the pandemic was confined mostly to older patients arriving at hospital it has now been massively expanded.One consequence is that compared with early May, when roughly 225 people per 100,000 under the age of 30 were being tested for the virus each week in France, the weekly total has now more than doubled, to nearly 500.“Young people – who were simply not being tested back in March and April but were clearly being infected, even if they were displaying only mild symptoms – are now being picked up,” Martin Blachier, a French epidemiologist, told BFM-TV.“These are young people, who obviously felt the need to start socialising again. During the lockdown they followed the instructions they were given, and they’re taking advantage of what they’re allowed to do now.”The challenge for governments and health agencies, experts say, is to prevent the virus from spreading to more vulnerable populations. “There’s no reason to imagine it can be contained to just one age group, without affecting others, Pascal Crépey, an epidemiologist and public health expert, told Le Parisien.“Older and more vulnerable people are certainly protecting themselves more, paying greater attention to wearing a mask, observing distancing measures. But they do not live in isolation. They have contact with their friends and families.”The next few days and weeks, experts warn, could be critical to avoiding a potentially disastrous resurgence of Covid-19 among older and more at-risk groups.“We need clear, consistent information to young people, but without in any way stigmatising them – they are far from being the only ones out and about in cafes and bars,” the sociologist Olivier Cousin told l’Obs magazine.“Young people would be wrong to think Covid does not concern them,” Crépey added. “The health consequences or the pandemic may affect mainly other age groups, but theirs risks being the group that will be hardest hit by the economic consequences.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb146c723e820087cb3bb446570387049f6976b3/127_0_3746_2249/master/3746.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63100cc841f156a4c0ac4b47e76d5227","title":"greek military put on high alert as tensions with turkey rise","story":"Dispute over exploration of energy reserves in eastern Mediterranean escalates Greece has placed its military forces on high alert, recalling its naval and air force officers from holiday, as tensions with Turkey over exploration of potentially lucrative offshore energy reserves escalate in the eastern Mediterranean.With Ankara dispatching the Oruç Reis, a drillship escorted by gunboats, to conduct seismic research in contested waters, Athens stepped up calls for Turkey to stop the “illegal” activities, intensifying a diplomatic offensive that has prompted the US, EU, France and Israel to express growing anxiety over the situation.Amid the mounting international concern, Mitsotakis on Thursday thanked Emmanuel Macron, calling him a “true friend of Greece and fervent protector of European values and international law” after the French president demanded Turkey halt its explorations and said he would reinforce France’s military presence in the area.France’s armed forces ministry confirmed it was dispatching two Rafale fighter jets and a naval frigate to the eastern Mediterranean after Macron voiced grave concern over the situation in a call with Mitsotakis the previous day.Turkey’s prospecting should “cease in order to allow a peaceful dialogue between the neighbouring Nato members”, Macron tweeted in a strong statement, describing the situation as “preoccupying” and blaming Turkey’s “unilateral decisions” for mounting tensions.France would “temporarily reinforce” its military presence, he said, to “monitor the situation in the region and mark its determination to uphold international law”. Last month Macron called for EU sanctions against Turkey for what he described as “violations” of Greek and Cypriot sovereignty over their territorial waters.The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, described the mobilisation of naval forces as “extremely worrying” in a statement as the bloc scrambled to arrange an emergency foreign affairs council for Friday.Greece’s foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, will also meet his US counterpart, Mike Pompeo, in Vienna on Friday for talks focusing on what Dendias described as “developments in the eastern Mediterranean in light of Turkey’s escalating violations of international legality”.In an abrupt move, the Turkish navy issued a navigational advisory, or Navtex, early on Monday stating the Oruç Reis would be carrying out the exploratory search in the disputed area until 23 August. The communique came as the country also launched naval exercises in the region.At the height of summer, with tourists once again heading to Greek island resorts and beaches, diplomats in Athens are eager the standoff is defused peacefully. But as warships coalesce, the spectre of conflict being triggered by a miscalculated move is also real, analysts say.“On a scale of one to 10, I would say bilateral tensions are at a level of seven to eight,” said Constantinos Filis, a professor of international relations. “This could easily erupt into the most serious crisis between Greece and Turkey in almost 25 years. Room for human error is very real if Turkey continues on this path of revisionist brinkmanship.”It was, he added, “simply illegal” to conduct seismic research in waters that had neither been defined by an agreement nor the verdict of an international court.Tensions over delineation of territorial waters have long festered between Greece and Turkey. But as the dispute worsened this week, the rhetoric also went up a notch.Dendias insisted Athens’ centre-right government would have no choice but to defend the country’s territorial integrity if maritime boundaries were breached in the race to tap regional energy reserves.On the other side of the Aegean, the Turkish defence minister, Hulusi Akar, similarly vowed that Ankara would protect “its rights, ties and interests” in coastal areas. “Despite all this, we want to believe that common sense will prevail … it should be known that our seas are our blue homeland. Every drop is valuable,” Akar told Reuters.Competing maritime claims have revolved around the failure of both Greece and Turkey to agree on exclusive economic zones in shared seas.Athens maintains its islands – no matter how small – have their own continental shelves Ankara argues that, if upheld, the Aegean would effectively be turned into a Greek lake, which, say Turkish diplomats, is utterly unacceptable to a country that sees itself as a regional power and has no intention of being left out of any energy bonanza.The discovery of deep sea gas fields, first off Egypt and then Israel and Cyprus, has proved the eastern Mediterranean to be rich in natural resources – even if, in the case of Cyprus, hydrocarbons are still a long way from being extracted from the seabed.Egypt and Israel have found enough gas reserves to become energy sufficient for the foreseeable future.Last month, in an incident described as a “very near miss” by senior Greek officials, the two neighbours almost came to blows after Ankara announced it was dispatching the Oruç Reis to the same disputed area south of the Aegean isle of Kastellorizo for 10 days of oil and gas exploration. Resolution came at the 12th hour when the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, intervened, appealing to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in a telephone call to halt the operation. Erdoğan pulled back, ordering the drillship to remain in port and agreeing to let diplomacy run its course by holding informal talks with Athens to finally settle the issue of maritime delimitations between Greek islands and mainland Turkey."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/202b4bc6805818a8aefdff656b50727ec7b8c301/0_1434_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44aa490c7bf8cb4d3f96ac1ba7177871","title":"irish paddle boarders survive night adrift clinging to lobster buoy","story":"Fishermen found 17-year-old girl and 23-year-old cousin 17 miles from Galway BayTwo paddle boarders who vanished off the west coast of Ireland survived a night of rain, wind and thunder by clinging to a lobster pot buoy.Two fishermen found the 17-year-old girl and 23-year-old woman on Thursday two miles south of the Aran islands, about 17 miles from Galway Bay, where they were last seen on Wednesday night.The pair, cousins from Galway city, spent more than 15 hours in or on the water. They are said to be well and are being treated at University Hospital Galway.The alarm was raised at about 10pm on Wednesday after they failed to return to Furbo beach. Strong winds are believed to have pushed their inflatable paddle boards out to sea.Coastguard helicopters and vessels searched overnight and hundreds of volunteers on land and sea joined the search after daybreakPatrick Oliver, a fisherman who is a member of the Galway Lifeboat Station, and his 18-year-old son Morgan found the women clutching a lobster pot marker buoy.Oliver told RTE he had used wind speed and direction to guess their location. “They travelled there about 20 miles from the beach to the side of Inis Oirr.”Oliver said he and his son gave the pair oilskin jackets and hats to regain warmth. “They were definitely in shock but the weather is warm so they were lucky.” The women were not wearing wetsuits but had buoyancy aids and had stayed on the boards.The women had not panicked and waved their paddles to attract attention, said Oliver. “They had us spotted. They are weak and tired of course but they were sitting up and a little bit of chat out of them. We got them in the boat and we brought them into the island and the chopper landed there. They were fairly shook but they were thankful.”Barry Heskin of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, told RTE that news of the rescue prompted tears at the lifeboat station.“It is a truly fantastic result,” he said, and paid tribute to the volunteers: “Once we had so many people on the water we could allocate them to different locations and then we could spread more resources further afield to locations we might not have gotten to until later this afternoon and it might have been so late.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9313012a788762521cc1b4c85d54d6a14d2c0ad4/0_153_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0425e668f7fedc8c9452b84c7b55370a","title":"italy pandemic plan was old and inadequate covid report finds","story":"Outdated guidelines and lack of protocols may have led to thousands of extra deathsA severely outdated pandemic plan could have contributed to thousands of Covid-19 deaths in Italy, according to a report set to be presented to prosecutors investigating alleged errors by Italian authorities.Italy had only “an old and inadequate plan” that “makes no mention of scenarios and planning assumptions”, according to the 65-page report compiled by the retired army general Pier Paolo Lunelli, and seen by the .Lunelli estimated that as many as 10,000 of Italy’s over 35,000 deaths may have been attributed to the lack of sufficient anti-pandemic protocols.Italian authorities allegedly failed to update the country’s pandemic plan in 2017, when the World Health Organization (WHO) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) established new guidelines.A “Flu pandemic plan” published on the Italian health ministry’s website shows it was last updated on 15 December 2016. However, the document’s properties on Abode Acrobat Reader show it was created in January 2006.“When you change a document, you should also change the title,” Lunelli, a specialist in NBC warfare and planning operations, told the . “It could be correct that Italy may not have updated its plan since 2006.”In his report, Lunelli compared Italy’s plan with those of other European countries.“We’re not the only ones with an old plan,” he said. “The difference was that we were the first European country to be hit by the virus, whereas others had time to plan.”The UK had an “exemplary” anti-pandemic plan and should have been able to contain the virus even better than Germany. The UK was considered to be one of the world’s leaders in pandemic planning, rated last year as second in the world after the US by the Global Health Security Index for its biological security strategy, published in 2018. But as with the US, it has been criticised for the gap between theory and action.Britain found itself at the back of the global queue for essential pandemic-fighting equipment, including masks and other protective equipment for health staff and carers and vital chemicals for tests. The House of Commons public accounts committee also expressed astonishment last month that there was no planning for the impact on the economy.“I have to say that the UK was in the best situation, but performed the worst,” Lunelli said.Italy was the first European country to be hit by the coronavirus pandemic in late February, when the country scrambled to quarantine 10 towns in the Lombardy region and one in Veneto after the first local transmission was confirmed.A national quarantine was enforced on 9 March as the death and infection toll climbed rapidly and hospitals became overwhelmed. The majority of Italy’s Covid-19 deaths have been in Lombardy, where an investigation driven by NOI Denunceremo, a group set up by relatives of the dead, is under way into possible criminal negligence by authorities.As a result of Lunelli’s report, the group, which has already submitted over 150 legal complaints to prosecutors, will also file a complaint against all of Italy’s prime ministers and health ministers since 2013 for failing to update the pandemic plan.Lunelli, who said he would be willing to face a prosecutor, wrote in his report that the lack of an effective plan had serious consequences on the number of victims and the economy.“Coping with a pandemic without good plans, with insufficient intensive care skills and a scarce stock of health protection devices, is like finding yourself driving a bus on a mountain road in the middle of a sudden and heavy snowfall without snow chains,” he wrote.“Unfortunately, the Italian bus ended up off the road with serious consequences in terms of direct and indirect victims as well as the economic downfall of some regions that mostly contribute to the national GDP.”On 13 May, the WHO published an independent narrative report, examining what happened at the beginning of the pandemic in Italy. The objective was to help other countries avoid the sort of disaster that occurred in Lombardy. It was called: “An unprecedented challenge Italy’s first response to Covid-19”.But the following day, the report was taken down from the WHO website and references to it were deleted, at the request, the  understands, of Dr Ranieri Guerra, WHO’s assistant director-general for strategic initiatives.The report, prepared by the Covid-19 Emergency Team at the WHO European Office for Investment for Health and Development in Venice, stated that Italy’s pandemic plan dated to 2006, in the aftermath of Sars, and was later “reconfirmed”.Dr Guerra has been the director general for preventive health at the Italian ministry of health and chief medical officer of Italy since 2014 – in charge of the office that was responsible for any updating.“Italy was not totally unprepared for an epidemic when the first news bulletins came from China,” said the deleted report. “In 2006, after the first severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) epidemic, the Italian ministry of health and regions approved a national pandemic influenza preparedness and response plan, reconfirmed in 2017, with guidelines for regional plans.”Guerra declined to speak to the  when contacted on Wednesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/551f9ac151cf3f94db3f0226425cc52f2dac98ab/0_603_3002_1801/master/3002.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ecceb0d5e62774d2599bf2b76fd2233","title":"nearly 300 workers test positive at ms sandwich factory in northampton","story":"Greencore started testing staff after local rise in coronavirus casesAlmost 300 workers have tested positive for coronavirus following an outbreak at a factory in Northampton that makes M\u0026ampS sandwiches.Greencore said some of its staff are self-isolating after a significant number tested positive for coronavirus. The company took the decision to proactively test workers as a result of a rise in cases in the town.A spokeswoman for Northamptonshire county council said 79 people returned positive NHS tests and a further 213 tested positive through Greencore’s private testing.In a statement, Greencore said: “As a result of the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the Northampton area, we took the decision to start proactively testing all of the colleagues at our Northampton site.

Health officials had been closely monitoring clusters of new cases linked to food processing plants following similar outbreaks in France and the US.

It is evident that Greencore has highly effective measures in place and they continue to work extremely hard to exceed the requirements needed to be Covid-19 secure within the workplace.“Northampton borough has been experiencing a high number of cases over the last four weeks and residents and employees have been asked to ‘act now’ to follow additional measures, to avoid a local lockdown or further government intervention.”Ian Hodson, national president of the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union, said: “We have been concerned about Greencore.

The ports of Trieste and Genoa are said to be more practical for access and for managing passenger flow safely within coronavirus regulations.Other cruise companies that usually stop in Venice, including Royal Caribbean, are said to be on standby, with services more likely to resume in 2021.No Grandi Navi has organised a celebration on San Giorgio island on Friday evening. “We said it, we promised it, and this is how it will be: no ship will enter the lagoon for the entire season,” the group said in a statement.However, the planned celebration has been criticised in some quarters because around 5,000 jobs that are maintained by the cruise industry are at risk. Staff at the Venice cruise terminal have been furloughed since the outbreak of the pandemic.“We receive calls every day from people who haven’t worked since March,” Antonio Velleca, a spokesperson for Portabagagli, a luggage handler cooperative in Venice, told the Italian press. “Many have not received their furlough money and are anxious about the future.”Protesters argue that cruise ships have seriously damaged Venice’s fragile lagoon and pollute the environment. They have long called for the vessels to be banned from the city, and the protests grew more fervent in June last year after four people were injured when the 13-deck MSC Opera crashed into a wharf and tourist boat along the busy Giudecca canal. A few weeks later the 12-deck Costa Deliziosa narrowly missed colliding into a yacht during a storm. The Italian government pledged to reroute the vessels, but a plan is yet to materialise.“The loss of the cruise industry is an economic damage that Venice can’t afford,” said Pier Paolo Baretta, an under-secretary at the economy ministry. “But to maintain it, we need to find a solution as soon as possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/803842d572757e662324d16832ba12a78e18e36c/0_103_4404_2645/master/4404.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=068e2d0ce725488a33a59b628e8e6f0a","title":"beirut explosion devastates sursock palace and museum in pictures","story":"Among the many homes and buildings damaged by the Beirut explosion were the Sursock Palace and Museum.

Transport secretary Jean-Baptiste Djebbari added that he had spoken to Mr Shapps about the decision.He tweeted: “France regrets the British decision and will apply reciprocal measures in terms of transport.“I told my counterpart Grant Shapps of our will to harmonise health protocols in order to ensure a high level of protection on both sides of the Channel.”Hi, Helen Sullivan joining you now. I’ll be bringing you the latest for the next few hours. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan@the with questions, comments and news from your part of the world. The UK’s decision to impose a 14-day quarantine on all arrivals from France will lead to a reciprocal measure, the French junior minister for European affairs, Clément Beaune, said late on Thursday, who added that France regretted the move.Mexico plans to extend the closure of its shared border with the United States for another month to non-essential travel, Mexico’s foreign affairs secretary, Marcelo Ebrard, said.The current agreement runs through 21 August, but Ebrard said it does not make sense to reopen the border at this time.“We already told the United States that we’re of the idea that it’s extended because of what we have along the strip on their side,” Ebrard said, referring to a surge in cases in the south-western United States.The travel restriction at the shared land border was first announced on 18 March and has been renewed monthly. It has included the US-Canada border as well.“The border couldn’t be opened right now,” Ebrard said. “It wouldn’t be logical that we change it right now, so it will be another month.”Mexico has reported about 500,000 confirmed Covid-19 infections and about 55,000 deaths, both considered to be significant undercounts due to very limited testing.As Australia wakes up, here’s a summary of some of the key developments from the last few hours.Brazil reported 60,091 new cases of coronavirus and 1,261 deaths from the disease caused by the virus in the past 24 hours, the health ministry said on Thursday.Brazil has registered 3,224,876 cases of the virus since the pandemic began, while the official death toll from Covid-19 has risen to 105,463, according to ministry data. Brazil ranks as the world’s worst coronavirus outbreak after the United States.The UK prime minister Boris Johnson confirmed plans to open up more of the economy from Saturday, including giving the go-ahead to delayed plans to resume socially distanced indoor performances and allowing beauty salons to offer more treatments in England.The moves were postponed from 1 August due to concerns about a slight increase in the number of people in England testing positive for Covid-19 but that now appears to have levelled off.The changes will not apply in the specific areas where local restrictions are in place. Johnson said: Most people in this country are following the rules and doing their bit to control the virus, but we must remain focused and we cannot be complacent.That is why we are strengthening the enforcement powers available to use against those who repeatedly flout the rules. At every stage I have said our plan to reopen society and the economy is conditional and that it relies on continued progress against the virus.Today, we are able to announce some further changes which will allow more people to return to work and the public to get back to more of the things they have missed.However, as I have always said, we will not hesitate to put on the brakes if required, or to continue to implement local measures to help to control the spread of the virus.New guidance will also mean that staff offering “close contact” services, including hairdressers, will now have to wear a face mask as well as a clear visor.The move, which follows new evidence from the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) is aimed at protecting customers and staff from respiratory droplets caused by sneezing, coughing, or speaking.The guidance also applies to businesses that operate remotely, such as massage therapists working in people’s homes, and those learning in vocational training environments.More detail on the new enforcement measures will be set out in the coming week.The home secretary Priti Patel said she would not allow progress in tackling the virus to be undermined by “a small minority of senseless iniduals”.These measures send a clear message - if you don’t cooperate with the police and if you put our health at risk, action will follow.Hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers’ plans have been plunged into chaos after the government confirmed that France would be removed from the UK’s travel corridor list following a surge in Covid-19 cases.The move, which will mean arrivals into the UK from France will have to quarantine for 14 days on their return or face a fine, will come into effect at 4am on Saturday leaving a window of little more than 28 hours for travellers to get home if they want to escape the measures.The UK government will also remove the Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks \u0026amp Caicos and Aruba from the list, the transport secretary Grant Shapps confirmed. Travellers arriving in the UK from those destinations from that time will also be required to self-isolate for 14 days.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has updated its travel advice for those countries, now advising against all but essential travel based on the current assessment of Covid-19 risks.The decision comes after the Joint Biosecurity Centre and Public Health England indicated a significant change in Covid-19 risk in all six destinations."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"\u0026lsquoExtensive Irish commitment to data centres\u0026rsquo could cause cost to consumer, study findsBuyers may want to go green, but for those travelling long distances the range is smallReform needed to safeguard \u0026euro6bn income while promoting electric vehicles, economist warns"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoring"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Six people have since gone back into the house. Photograph Nick BradshawThe The majority of tenants who were evicted from a property they were renting in Phibsborough, north Dublin returned to the home on Thursday. Nine tenants, many of whom are foreign nationals, were removed from the Berkeley Road property on Wednesday morning. Several men wearing all black, face coverings, caps and sunglasses entered the house on Wednesday morning, instructed the tenants inside to leave and then boarded up the front door and windows. A number of gardaí attended the eviction and watched from the street outside the front door, as one of the tenants was physically removed from the property, according to video footage.The tenants spent several hours afterwards outside the house, with their belongings and bin bags full of clothes on the pavement. On Thursday, activists with the Dublin Central Housing Action group removed the boarding and allowed the tenants to re-enter the property. The housing group was previously involved in several high-profile occupations of vacant Dublin city properties in 2018, to protest the housing crisis. The tenants claim they had not been served written eviction notices to vacate the property prior to it being repossessed on Wednesday. Six of the tenants were back inside the property on Thursday. Upon re-entering the home tenants said significant damage had been caused inside the property, including windows, doors and toilets being broken, with bed mattresses in the house also removed. Gerry Ward, who had earlier been the tenant’s landlord, said he had been involved with the property since around 2004. He said there was a legal dispute over it since 2017 with a property fund, Beltany Property Finance.“That has not been finally resolved, that has not been fully resolved,” he said, adding he had not been aware of the property’s repossession until he was contacted by the tenants.ConfidentialityA spokesman for Goldman Sachs, which controls Beltany, said the fund had sold the property on June 2nd, but was unable to disclose the name of the buyer citing confidentiality reasons. One source said the property had been sold to a Dublin-based company. Two iniduals listed as directors of that company did not return requests for comment on Thursday.KBC Bank had owned the loan on the property previously, but sold it to Beltany around two years ago, a KBC spokeswoman said. A number of the housing activists assisted tenants in cleaning the property, as well as supplying new mattresses, installing a new toilet and replacing the front door on Thursday. Elias Niyi Adbo Jegede (47) is one of the tenants, who came to Ireland from Nigeria in 2005, and had been living in the home for several years. “What happened here is someone that has lived here for several years was evicted within 10 minutes . . . I don’t see how this is happening in Ireland,” he said. Speaking after tenants re-occupied the home on Thursday he said: “I am very grateful for the Irish people who have helped us.” The Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL) has written to Garda Commissioner Drew Harris querying the presence of gardaí at the eviction. The civil rights organisation stated gardaí should not be playing any supportive role in property evictions, unless it was in response to criminal behaviour. ‘Chaos’Another tenant, Theresa Chimamkpam (45), said she had been living in the house since 2011, and had not been served an eviction notice to vacate the home. “This is our home, in the middle of the pandemic you threw us on the road,” she said. Ms Chimamkpam said the property was in a “state of chaos” when the tenants returned on Thursday. Emergency accommodation was sourced for a number of the tenants on Wednesday night by a voluntary group, Inner City Helping Homeless.A Garda spokesman said legal representatives of the property’s owner attended Mountjoy Garda station on Wednesday, “to inform gardaí that they intended to secure their premises”. Gardaí “noted the proposed activity but did not attend the premises at the time”, he said. During the eviction a tenant made an emergency call to gardaí at 11am, and a number of units attended the scene, but “the majority were quickly stood down”, the spokesman said. “Subsequently a number of Garda personnel remained at the scene with the primary function to prevent breaches of the peace and ensure the safety of all persons involved,” he said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4323855.1596723404!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"look to lichens for dating with a difference","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Charles Fort, Kinsale, Co Cork, where the tops of the walls are home to flowering grasses, mosses and heathers.

Photograph:  David HaskellAt a distance Charles Fort in Kinsale looms up from the landscape in shades of grey stone but once you get closer you can see that its surface is actually multicoloured. Lichens crust the walls, including the bright yellow Caloplaca decipiens and the deep black Varrucaria maura. The tops of the walls are home to flowering grasses, mosses and heathers. Rather than a dead artefact it is a living habitat.Of all the organisms now living among the 17th-century walls, the lichens have probably been there the longest. Lichens are an organism made up of fungus and algae and they can live for thousands of years, growing very slowly and regularly. Recognition of their age and their regular growth rate led to the science known as “lichenometry”, pioneered in the 1950s. It uses the growth rate of lichens to determine the age of the surface that they grow on.Movement of glaciersRoland Beschel, an Austrian scientist, first suggested the use of lichens for dating. He had noticed that larger lichens appeared on older glacial moraine (the rocks left behind when a glacier retreats) and proposed that a lichen growth pattern could be used to date the movement of glaciers in the Alps. Lichenometry continues to be an important way to study the retreat of glaciers, especially now in the context of climate changes observed at the poles. Other geological events can be dated using lichens including volcanic eruptions and landslides.Lichenometry has also been extended into the realm of archaeology where it can be useful when radio carbon dating is either not possible or not likely to prove especially helpful.The technique is not without difficulty. Lichen growth rates can be affected by weather changes and the same species will grow differently in different environments (despite the fact that a single species of lichen may be found across the globe). Lichens on a surface may merge with one another, making it difficult to determine the precise size of a single specimen. Fire destroys lichen thereby “resetting” the lichenometric clock. The technique further assumes that a lichen immediately colonised the rock in question, but this may not be true.GravestonesNonetheless, lichenometry can be helpful in dating particular kinds of sites and objects when other methods of dating prove difficult. Unmarked or degraded gravestones are one useful example. A study by Brandy Luthe et al in 2018 used lichen growth to date headstones in a cemetery in Arkansas that was associated with the advance of western settlement.No documentary evidence existed about the establishment of the cemetery and some headstones were not dated. Dated headstones could be used to establish a growth curve for the relevant lichens. Lichenometry (combined with other methods) suggested that the cemetery was founded about 1800, earlier than the dated headstones.The fact that lichens need sunlight to grow is also helpful in dating. For example, a rock that has lichens on a surface not exposed to the sun suggests that the rock has been recently moved. For archaeologists studying Native American sites lichenometry can help to establish how much the form of a wall, for example, has been altered by 21st century hikers or campers moving the stones out of place.In Ireland, lichens have been used by Eoin Halpin to make an argument about the shape of portal tombs. Halpin supports the idea that the tombs were not fully covered with cairn stones by the observation of a lichen “tide mark” on the large stones forming the portal. Lichens above the mark are different than those below, suggesting that the lower parts were originally covered with cairn stones. Lichens only began growing below the tide mark after the cairn stones were disturbed.Matilda KnowlesIrish botanist Matilda Knowles dedicated many years to the study of lichens, identifying new species and publishing a book on them in 1929. Her list of lichen species found in Ireland is a compilation of her own diligent work and that of many Irish naturalists over more than a century and a half.Lichens have born silent witness to thousands of years of Irish history, colonising new surfaces as they have become available from trees in the deer park of the Castlemartyr estate, to the sea wall in Sutton, to limestone walls at Tara, to the Fort Hotel in Greencastle, to mud walls on the Circular Road in Dublin and apple trees at Ardnacrusha.Dr Juliana Adelman lectures in history at Dublin City University"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Jacinda Ardern sounds warning as number of cases in locked-down Auckland rises to 17Hundreds of police had raided Apple Daily in move decried as assault on press freedom\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceReaders queue from 2am to buy pro-democracy tabloid after owner Jimmy Lai\u0026rsquos arrestFair Work Commission\u0026rsquos decision that man made \u0026lsquooffensive\u0026rsquo video overturned on appealMaria Ressa\u0026rsquos news organisation Rappler is a buffer against dictatorship in PhilippinesLai has been a prominent democracy activist and an ardent critic of BeijingAuthorities warn against complacency as other countries battle a resurgenceCrack in hull of Japanese-owned ship is spilling oil into country\u0026rsquos famed blue lagoonsAttitudes still shaped by legacy code of conduct that dictates women must be submissive and patientAircraft with 190 passengers and crew on board overshoots runway in heavy rain in CalicutAbe avoids reference to nuclear treaty during scaled-back ceremony due to coronavirus\u0026lsquoWhat frightened me the most was how we got used to the piles of dead bodies\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash survivorIndia\u0026rsquos supreme court handed site to Hindus last year in culmination of complex disputeChina says attempts by Washington to engage more closely with Taipei \u0026lsquodoomed to fail\u0026rsquoCountry\u0026rsquos move closer to China set to be confirmed after unusually subdued pollThree men stuck on tiny Pikelot Island after boat ran out of fuel spotted by military aircraftAustralian state to deploy military, impose hefty fines to enforce Covid-19 isolationNorth Korea subject to UN sanctions since 2006 over nuclear and ballistic missile programsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4329623.1597349201!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ban on beer kiosks draws ire as berlin dances on edge of volcano","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHasenheide park in Berlin became a spontaneous outdoor techno party location early in the lockdown. File photograph: GettySummer in Berlin is why most locals can cope with winter in Berlin. Scorching 35-degree days end with long, balmy evenings: a dip in a lake and a picnic, or a cool drink in a beer garden.The German capital in summer easily beats out Disneyland as the happiest place on Earth – and is far better value. With the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, everything should be different this summer. But everything is the same as ever.Cycling around town these last evenings in a T-shirt and shorts – another Berlin summer bonus – the street cafes are abuzz with chatty customers, the Arab Shisha bars still reek of liquorice tobacco, while the late-night kiosks haven’t sold as much beer since the 2006 World Cup.Berlin’s late-night kiosks (Spätkauf or Späti) have sprung up like mushrooms in the last years: younger party people enjoy €1 beers, a third of the bar price, while organised crime gangs have shifted from restaurants to kiosks as a more efficient way to launder money.City authorities are worried about the Späti clusters of drinkers, less interested in social distancing with each successive beer.“I think it’s also a mental problem: people see rising numbers but think it doesn’t affect them,” says Stephan von Dassel, the mayor of Berlin’s Mitte district. “You can get used to everything and comfort often goes before caution.”Street dramaHe has called for a ban on kiosk sales of alcohol from 6pm, following the example of some Hamburg districts, but the idea has gone down like a lead Zeppelin. Most theatres are still closed but each summer evening in Berlin offers spontaneous street drama, usually variations on a morality play where concern for others collides with the right to inidual happiness.Berlin is ided once more, this time in three camps. You can spot the archetypal member of the first camp outside their apartment, watering a parched tree while glaring at the street party before the adjacent Späti.The second camp – think beer garden families with hyperactive young children out long after bedtime – are anxious to salvage something of the summer, anticipating a long winter lockdown.Meanwhile a third camp – young revellers on a rocket fuel of cheap beer and schnapps – have embraced Summer in Berlin 2020 like hardened hedonists.You’ll find many of the third camp after 10pm in the Kreuzberg neighbourhood, heading up the hill into the dark expanse of the Hasenheide.This park, adjoining an abandoned airport airfield, became a spontaneous outdoor techno party location early in the lockdown. On my last visit in early June it had a pleasant neighbourhood feel: people dancing away their worries while keeping their distance.Each week since has brought exponential growth in numbers, thanks to social media. Two weeks ago was the last big party, several hundred people dancing in the dark while DJs – equipped with laptops, mobile speakers and generators – pumped out the tunes.Lingering on the fringes, drink and drugs were in ample supply. “We just want to party, forget about things for a while, celebrate life,” said Klara, a 25-year-old medical student, emerging with a gleam of sweat from a throng of dancers.Magical meadowNot everyone is here for the music. A skinny young man with blonde hair, dark roots and a glazed expression asks me if I know the way to the “Zauberwiese”, the magical meadow.He’s looking for a copse of trees off the beaten track, repurposed as a stopgap darkroom. A makeshift tent has been pitched in the undergrowth and, for the slow learners, a sign has been added: “Sex House”.In a pandemic like this, every parent’s worst nightmare is a potential public health emergency. But Berlin has always had its own rules. Around 1am, resigned police turn on floodlights and break up the party, sparking a game of cat and mouse in the dark.Many revellers have already moved on from parks to industrial ruins where, partying undisturbed beneath the stars, it feels like a renaissance of Berlin’s post-wall days.If it wasn’t for Covid-19. With Germany’s new daily infections now beyond 1,500, levels last seen in early May, the party may be over soon.It’s nearly 3am as I near home, passing the plaque to Anita Berber who lived and died here aged 29. The dancer was notorious in Weimar Berlin for drug-fuelled show routines she called her “dance of vice, horror and ecstasy”.After her death, a friend said Anita was driven by the “wild urge of her generation to live, without thinking of an already lost future”.With its street kiosk drinkers and park raves, time will tell if party-loving Berliners were right – or terribly wrong – to seize this summer.As the August evenings grow shorter it’s hard to shake the feeling that, like a century ago, this city is dancing on a volcano.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Countries to open diplomatic relations for first time and Palestine accuses UAE of selling outAgreement between the two countries described as \u0026lsquoa complete sellout\u0026rsquo of PalestiniansMove seen as victory for Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu and will infuriate PalestiniansCountry needs administration that can fight graft, says German ministerWith 200 dead, 6,000 injured and 300,000 destitute, the mood in Beirut is unbendingNames of victims read aloud at demonstration near site of explosion that killed at least 171Prime minister Hassan Diab says blast that killed at least 163 was result of endemic corruptionResignation of government could enable international donors to sideline corrupt administrationPolice fire tear gas near parliament as donors pledge \u0026lsquomajor resources\u0026rsquo after explosionPort officials globally have a tough time preventing the abandonment of ships or seafarersTwenty-five years after the Balkan conflict\u0026rsquos worst atrocity the Bosnian town remains idedDemonstrations stretch far beyond prime minister\u0026rsquos official residence in Jerusalem\u0026lsquoWe have no trust in our government . . .

Photograph: Abir Sultan The Israeli government is to “suspend” plans to annex parts of the West Bank as part of a US-brokered deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates announced on Thursday.The two states will open diplomatic relations for the first time, with the UAE becoming the first Arab state in the Gulf to recognise Israel.“HUGE breakthrough today! Historic Peace Agreement between our two GREAT friends, Israel and the United Arab Emirates!” US president Donald Trump tweeted as he announced the plan.Later he told reporters that the relationship between Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Emirati crown prince Mohammed bin Zayed was “like love” – “ a tremendous relationship that’s been built up over the last year”.US alliesIsrael and the UAE – which have been increasingly aligned in recent years over their shared hostility to Iran – agreed to open diplomatic missions, introduce direct flights, and develop investment and technology links. Detailed negotiations between the two sides will now begin. Both countries are traditional allies of the United States in the region.While the rapprochement between Tel Aviv and the federation of sheikhdoms is a win for Mr Netanyahu, who had been seeking to build Arab allies across the Middle East, his decision to back away from annexation of Palestinian lands reflects growing international pressure on the Israeli government. Coalition dealHis government had pledged to expand into swathes of Palestinian-controlled territories as part of a coalition deal signed off this year.Several prominent Palestinian voices criticised the deal, named the “Abraham Accords”, accusing the UAE of selling out to Israel.The agreement gives Mr Trump the opportunity to tout a foreign policy win, less than three months before November’s presidential election. He said he expected more Arab and Muslim countries to follow the UAE’s lead “now that the ice has been broken”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4329817.1597351438!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"biden urges us mask mandate to deal with covid 19 pandemic","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDouble act: Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his vice-presidential running mate Senator Kamala Harris arrive for their first press conference in Delaware. Photograph: GettyDemocratic US presidential candidate Joe Biden has called for a national mask mandate to be introduced to combat the coronavirus pandemic, following a briefing with public health advisers.Mr Biden and running mate Kamala Harris were briefed by officials on coronavirus in Wilmington, Delaware, a day after making their first public appearance together since Ms Harris was added to the Democratic ticket.“Every single American should be wearing a mask when they’re outside for the next three months, at a minimum,” said the former vice-president. “Every governor should mandate mandatory mask wearing.” He added that experts had advised that widespread wearing of masks could save more than 40,000 lives in that period.“It’s not about your rights,” he said. “It’s about your responsibilities as an American . . . Be a patriot. Protect your fellow citizens . . . Do the right thing.”Mr Biden was speaking as infections continued to spread in the United States, with 163,000 deaths now reported. Almost 1,500 deaths were registered on Wednesday alone – the highest single-day total in August.The Biden campaign is expected to focus heavily on Donald Trump’s handling of the pandemic in coming weeks as the presidential campaign heats up.Ms Harris highlighted Mr Trump’s handling of the virus outbreak in her debut speech as the vice-presidential nominee on Wednesday.“The president’s mismanagement of the pandemic has plunged us into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression,” she said, noting that an American dies of Covid-19 every 80 seconds.Mr Biden and Ms Harris wore masks as they entered the room where they delivered their speeches and maintained a social distance during the event.The issue of mask wearing has become highly politicised in the US. While Mr Trump has rarely been seen wearing a mask, in recent weeks he has encouraged citizens to wear a face covering.Also on Thursday the Biden campaign confirmed it had seen a surge in fundraising since Ms Harris’s appointment was announced earlier this week.Speaking at a private grassroots fundraiser on Wednesday evening, Mr Biden said that $26 million (€22 million) had been raised in the 24 hours after Ms Harris’s nomination was announced. This was followed by a further $6.2 million on Wednesday, the campaign confirmed.Ms Harris’s strong track record in securing donations during her campaigns for political office is likely to be a boon to the Biden-Harris ticket. \u0026nbspWhile Mr Biden had been trailing Mr Trump for much of early 2020 in terms of fundraising, he has been closing the gap since March when the Democratic establishment rallied behind his candidacy.Mr Biden and the Democratic National Committee more broadly raised $141 million in June – $10 million more than Mr Trump, though the Trump campaign has significantly more cash on hand as the presidential election approaches in November.Trump reactsMr Trump, who is trailing Mr Biden in the polls, renewed his attacks on Ms Harris in an interview on Thursday, describing the Californian senator as a “mad woman”. In a morning radio interview with Fox Business, he said Ms Harris was part of a group of “seriously ill people” who had questioned Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing to become a supreme court justice.\u0026nbspDuring the interview, Mr Trump also appeared to admit that his recent threats to cut funding for the postal service was linked to efforts to suppress mail-in votes.\u0026nbsp“They need that money in order to make the post office work, so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots,” he said. “If we don’t make a deal, that means they don’t get the money. That means they can’t have universal mail-in voting, they just can’t have it.”\u0026nbspMr Trump has consistently queried the trustworthiness of postal voting, amid expectations that there will be an increase in mail-in ballots in the election due to the pandemic.\u0026nbspResponding to the president’s comments, Mr Biden’s campaign accused Mr Trump of “sabotaging a basic service that hundreds of millions of people rely upon”.In some good news for the president, data released on Thursday showed that the number of Americans filing for state unemployment benefits fell below one million last week for the first time since March.Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4329364.1597312869!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"kamala harris s policy vagueness could yet be a drawback","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKamala Harris: “Looking back, it is odd that such a fancied candidate did not do better in her own presidential campaign.”  Photograph: Carolyn KasterAPJoe Biden is not 77 in the way that Mick Jagger is 77. The Democratic candidate for the White House wears the years with a heaviness that is not lost even on his enthusiasts. While he never rules out a second term, this self-avowed “bridge” to the next generation implies just the one. With its lack of travel and live events, this Covid-19 election campaign, The Campaign That Isn’t, has spared him. The grandest public office in the world will not.Kamala Harris is, then, in line to be as much co-president as vice-president of the US. In the senator for California, Biden has hired not just a running mate but an executive burden-sharer and – forgive the macabre note – a viable stand-in. Given Biden’s taste for foreign affairs, she might have space to impose herself on the domestic realm in particular. Her potential influence is vast.It is also ambiguous. Biden has chosen Harris, yes, but which one? Disaffected Republicans will hope for the tenacious prosecutor with the Third Way patter. “It’s not progressive to be soft on crime,” she said, running for district attorney of San Francisco in 2003. As California’s attorney-general, she confronted the parents of truant children more zealously than she did the state’s draconian justice system.Progressives, for their part, will expect the other Harris. This is the one who opposed the death penalty earlier than many in her party and votes well to the left in the Senate. She was the untiring scourge of Republican nominees and witnesses in that chamber.There is no disgrace in inconsistency: give me an opportunist over an ideologue. Whether he actually said it or not, John Maynard Keynes’s airy line, “When the facts change, I change my mind”, is too stifling. People’s views can evolve even where the facts do not.It is just that Harris is such a pronounced case. A 55-year-old political lifer – she has never worked in the private sector – should have some definition by now. “Enigma” is the euphemism for someone whose core beliefs are so up in the air. Were she bidding to be a ceremonial vice-president, a less maladroit Dan Quayle, we need not worry. If elected, however, she is going to matter. And therefore so do her views.Presidential campaignLooking back, it is odd that such a fancied candidate did not do better in her own presidential campaign. She was a major politician from a state with a larger economy than that of most G20 countries (and all the donors that implies). She was of mixed race in a party that draws much of its support from minorities. Her Senate performances suggested not just ruthlessness but guile.In the end, what she did not have was perceived authenticity. In fact, every candidate in the Democratic primaries who had made a late-career turn to the left, namely senators Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand, flopped. Voters preferred the real thing (Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren) or an unabashed moderate like the South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg. Policies mattered less than the conviction with which they were espoused.Biden ran some way to the left of his former self, but then he already commanded trust. Personal tragedy and almost 50 years in public life will do that. He had “earned” the right to stick a licked finger in the air and sense the wind’s direction.Of course, the national electorate is not the Democratic base. And had Biden named Warren or an untested mayor this week, President Donald Trump might be high-fiving campaign aides. The Biden-Harris pairing is far more daunting.Just not, in part thanks to that vagueness of hers, unbeatable. In a reptilian passage of Tony Blair’s chatty memoirs, the former UK prime minister explains how to go about negative campaigning. The classic error, he says, with the sureness of the thrice-elected, is the lurid, over-the-top attack. Swing voters learn to tune these out. What moves them is the lesser charge, expressed more in sorrow than in anger.UncertaintyTrump will never persuade Americans that Biden is a menace to the republic and “against God”. The criticism that might land is that he is too old and weak to run his presidency. Other forces will end up dominating. If one of them is a protean vice-president, a crime-hawk until she wasn’t, with changeable healthcare plans, the uncertainty is doubled. Caveat emptor.“Look, I like Joe,” a canny president might say. “But do you really know what you’re getting?” It would insinuate that Harris is an agent of the far left, but then blank canvases are there to be painted on. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"a level fiasco just startof lockdowns betrayal young","story":"Over the past few years I’ve had the great honour of being involved with the Social Mobility Foundation, which helps bright pupils from poor backgrounds get into good universities. I heard from one of them yesterday. She had an offer from Oxford to study medicine, one of the greatest opportunities our country has to give any young person. They wanted an A*AA in A-levels: she was delighted, as she was predicted (and on course for) three A*s and an A. But when the envelope came yesterday, it showed the computer had allocated her ABBB. No reason was given. Oxford has, as a result, withdrawn its offer.It’s heartbreaking. She had no chance to sit the exam, no chance to prove that someone like her – who arrived as an immigrant from Iran 10 years ago – is bright enough to ace the toughest of England’s exams. Perhaps an official (or a bot) decided that a girl from a Yorkshire comprehensive would never get such good results. Don’t worry, ministers say, such pupils can use their mock exams to appeal. But not every pupil sat mocks: she, for example, didn’t. She has no idea what to do now. What was so nearly a British dream has turned into another Covid nightmare.There will be all too many such stories. Kaya Ilska, another brilliant student on the Social Mobility Foundation scheme, was predicted four A*s. She found out yesterday she had been allocated AABB, so her offer to study medicine at UCL has been withdrawn, as has her backup offer from Cardiff. And her mocks? She sat them in January but her focus was on medical school interviews taking place at the same time. The mocks, she thought, would highlight areas where she needed to improve: they ended up determining her fate. She told me about a digital chat group she has with other university hopefuls where they call themselves the “lost generation”. As she puts it: “We have just had our futures stolen from us.”This is true in many ways. The young are the least likely to be affected by Covid but usually the first to be hit by the reaction to it. Schools were closed before lockdown was implemented and kept closed after pubs reopened. Exams could easily have been carried out under social distancing, had anyone thought it important enough to give students the chance.A study by the Brookings Institute in America has calculated that, even adjusting for online learning, four months out of the classroom cuts future earning power by 2.5 per cent every year. The World Bank reckons that this “lost generation” will, collectively, earn $10 trillion less because of the schooling denied to them.Students who do move on to university will find classes cancelled, with online tuition taking its place. It’s hard to find strong justification for this, given how the under-30s are at such low risk from Covid. Sweden kept schools open, and studies show that both pupils and teachers were at no extra risk of catching the virus. But universities, now, know they have the upper hand. The evaporation of job and travelling opportunities means young people don’t have many other options. So there’s a surge in applications for universities and vice-chancellors can lay down any terms they like.Overall unemployment numbers haven’t budged but the number of under-25s on benefits has doubled. Apprenticeships for the under-18s are running at about a quarter of the level of last year. Perhaps the biggest conspiracy against the young is when senior people in a company decide to keep everyone working from home. It’s perfectly feasible to run a company like this, in a way no one imagined a few months ago. For the senior staff, who are most likely to have bigger houses with gardens, it can be bliss. No 6am alarm, no soul-destroying commute and the same amount of cash. What’s not to like?But the people who lose most when offices close are the new recruits. They may be given little in the way of formal training but get ahead by watching and learning from others. Overhearing conversations, squirming at the mistakes of others: more can be learnt this way than on any MBA. Being in an office lets newbies see how a company works, who needs help, where the gaps and opportunities are. The never-ending Covid-19 office regulations are big on the duty of employers to provide a safe environment. But no one is speaking up for the duty to train and develop young staff, to offer internships, to extend the ladder of social mobility.This madness will resolve itself, eventually. But some opportunities seldom repeat themselves, and a university offer is a classic example. Which is why it’s odd, this year, to see university places capped by the Government.The fear was that the drop in international students would see the best universities compensating by making more offers to British students, poaching them from less popular colleges. But how would this have been such a bad thing? The idea of university reforms, surely, was to let the market decide. If having no cap on places means more places at great universities, it could be a rare upside to an otherwise miserable situation. Yes, having more students might cost the Government a bit more. But so does unemployment, which may well be the alternative.It’s easy to ignore all these problems. Ministers can say that school closures didn’t really hurt, that standards may even have risen (as the A-level results absurdly suggest). It would be hard to carry out mass pupil testing to find out who has fallen most behind – in all age groups – and who needs the most help catching up now. It would be hard to set up a huge university appeals process, making sure each student’s case is now given the attention it deserves. It may be hard, too, to lift the cap on university places to make space on campus for all those who deserve it.At every stage in lockdown, the priorities of the young have tended to be the least important factor in any given consideration: their education, their prospects, their future. It’s time for that to change. Sorting the university mess would be a good place to start.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ben jerrys wokeness irritating savvy firm right stand ground","story":"In a world where tea brands are voices of reason and TV stars are presidents, why shouldn’t ice-cream makers chip in on immigration policy? That’s what happened this week, with Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s and Priti Patel engaging in a war of words over migrants in dinghies crossing the English Channel.As is customary when a company raises its head above the parapet, Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s soon found itself at the centre of a “Twitterstorm,”. The company’s mistreatment of migrant workers being one major bone of contention.Normally what happens when a company comes under fire is capitulation. The firm will rush out a statement about owning up to its mistakes, ignorance, and about how it will use this opportunity to listen and learn from those it has wronged. It will usually also allude to some form of structural prejudice at its core (sexism, racism, a dislike of the lactose intolerant) which it needs to address. It may, too, say it has sacked an employee or two, who it has deemed responsible (and expendable).Does anyone think Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s is about to do any such thing? Of course not.Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s is a junk food company that has decided to take on the British government just as Westminster contemplates restrictive bans on junk food advertising, not to mention a sugar tax. Moreover, it has decided to do so at the exact moment a heat wave has engulfed the country. It wants as much publicity at this point as it can get. But though Twitterstorms are largely seen as bad things, it has worked out this need not be.The phenomenon known as the Majority Illusion, where the amplifying of certain, well-connected voices on social media gives the impression of a view being more popular than it really is, is what allows many of these Twitterstorms to blow. Plenty of companies have folded on a position as a result, over the fear that a woke horde is descending across the digital steppe, when in fact just a few high-profile activists can create a whirlwind from waft. It also works in reverse — even if a majority of people are outraged over something, all it takes is for a similarly connected network to praise something (like, say, an ice cream company criticising a wicked, anti-migrant government) to amplify its message as the mainstream view.It’s not just through social media. Despite the majority of the nation being opposed to illegal immigration, that is not entirely true of those who control the channels through which news filters to the masses. For standing its ground, Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s will continue to garner favourable coverage on this issue, rather than negative, for as long as it chooses to be vocal.What are those who disagree with that stance to do? Declare they’ll never buy the product again? We all know it would be a lie few of the people now haranguing Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s seemed to have a moral issue over its exploitation of migrant labour. A tedious double insult ordinary people, who just want their borders properly policed and to be able to eat ice-cream in peace, could frankly do without. From a PR perspective, Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s is right to stand its ground. It has more to gain from doing so than abandoning their position. What grates is that so many other companies that should stand theirs fail to, for fear of the online mob. How many people have been sacked, and how many firms have gone grovelling to a few outraged keyboard warriors, because of perceived injustice, hypocrisy or prejudice that didn’t really exist? We can all think of plenty of examples. Every time it happens, the majority feels a little more disheartened. It feels as though our prevailing view is less prevalent than we had thought, and we wonder what hope is left, as one by one, companies “go woke” to avoid going broke. It may sound counter-intuitive, but more need to do what Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s have done, and stand their ground when the shadowy monsters come for them. The idea of monsters can terrify us into doing things we don’t want to, but we shouldn’t be scared of shadows. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cannot anything bitterly disappointed a level results","story":"When the announcement was made in March that the summer exams were to be cancelled we and our students, along with teachers and students across the country, went through a form of grieving process.  So much had been invested in terms of time and hard work by all those young people and their revision programmes were just gathering momentum when suddenly everything came to an abrupt halt. Without doubt, our students - like most around the country - wanted to sit their examinations they wanted to have the opportunity to show the work they had done. They moved through the gamut of emotions but trusted that the Government and Ofqual would be fair in awarding them the grades they deserved. We all know that Ofqual has had a very challenging task and understand that any statistical modelling process that tries to be fair to all may not work for some schools. However, schools and students have trusted that this would be resolved before results were issued.Headteachers and their teams across schools approached the decisions about centre assessed grades with enormous care and professionalism these students are not statistics to teachers they are young people who they have worked with for many years. The consultation documents and guidance provided by Ofqual and JCQ were very thorough and senior leaders followed daily webinars and videos the Association of School and College Leader’s support for senior leaders was outstanding in guiding us how to put forward our grades. Equally the explanations about how the model would ensure that schools would achieve grades in line with their last few years attainment were clear as was the information about prior attainment and how this would be applied. Therefore we have trusted the system and I appeal to Ofqual and the boards to look closely at and respond quickly to us and the schools affected by the model not working for them. Young people’s future’s are at stake. I have to say that many of the universities have been incredibly supportive and sensitive in their management of a situation where they have been given new information at the eleventh hour. Not all have been able to be flexible, however, and the result is still that we, and many schools, have young people who have already been through a gruelling five months and are still faced with uncertainty. Time is of the essence here. I do urge Ofqual to move quickly in explaining and revisiting their model where schools have been adversely affected and the outcomes are unfair for the students. Places cannot be held open as universities need to fill their courses. They need answers in days not weeks and the students absolutely deserve a response that meets the clearly stated aim of the process that no student would be disadvantaged by not having the opportunity to sit the exams.Kay Mountfield is the headmistress and James Simpson is the deputy headmaster at  Sir William Borlase\u0027s Grammar SchoolMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dithering britain denial eu turkey geopolitical time bomb","story":"President Macron’s lightning visit to Lebanon after the Beirut explosion highlighted France’s increasingly active interventions around the Mediterranean. Yet few policymakers here seem to have taken on board the risk of a geopolitical explosion at sea between France and Turkey.The two estranged NATO allies are jousting for influence and energy resources from Libya to Cyprus. France is sending out warships and fighters as the war of words between President Macron and his Turkish bête noire, Recep Erdogan, intensifies.France is backing Greece and Cyprus with a show of force as Turkish warships escort a Turkish drilling ship into waters claimed by the two EU states. That Turkish exploration vessel is named in honour of the great Ottoman pirate and slaver, Oruc Reis, whose rampages ranged as far as the French coast from his Algerian base. The symbolism of its name is obvious. High summer ought to be holiday season around the Mediterranean but the buzzing of fighter jets increasingly disturbing.Our Foreign Office provides travel advisories for danger zones, but its advice about Greek islands in the frontline in sight of the Turkish coast is about the marginal risk of Covid-19 not war. If Whitehall had given travel advice in August 1914, it probably wouldn’t have noticed the unusually busy trains on German railways heading towards Belgium. Post-Brexit Britain has its own problems with France over cross-Channel illegal migration, but President Macron is showing how an independent foreign policy might look.Don’t let President Macron’s rhetoric about defending the European Union’s borders and sovereignty mislead you. The reality is that Greece and Cyprus are looking to France as a great power ally. The rest of the EU maybe good for a statement of support and even a threat of sanctions but when it comes to possible use of force only France counts. Paris has military power. Brussels has words. Britain still has two sovereign bases on Cyprus which is in the eye of the storm. Turkish troops still occupy the northern half of the island. Ankara remembers  the crisis of 1974 when Turkey intervened in Cyprus. Britain remained passive despite being a guarantor of Cyprus and its constitution.That was at the low point of our post-war decline. Yet today, Harold Wilson rather than Margaret Thatcher, let alone Winston Churchill, seems to be the guiding spirit of British policy towards the gathering storm in the Eastern Mediterranean. British expats and tourists in Cyprus might continue to enjoy a quiet life if the tensions lift, but there is little sign that London is alert to the risks to them and our military there.Nonchalance in a crisis can be an impressive pose, but the lassitude gripping British foreign policy this mid-summer is a symptom of a deeper confusion in Whitehall about what this country’s role should be around the world post-Brexit. It is not a conscious retreat to a “Little England” outlook. That would be a policy. Instead passivity seems a substitute for knowing what Britain wants and how it can achieve that. President Macron may be stretching France’s resources thin but he is purposeful.  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"do feminists want force george eliot back crinoline","story":"The #ReclaimHerName collection is republishing 25 well‑known works under the real names of the women who wrote them, discarding their authors’ male pseudonyms, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Women’s Prize for Fiction. According to novelist Kate Mosse, a co‑founder of the prize, this will empower women, “igniting conversations and ensuring they get the recognition they deserve”.“Igniting conversation” has become the default defence for bad ideas, such as defacing even the most distinguished statue – as in: “They weren’t graffiting Winston Churchill, they were sparking a conversation about empire.” Though well-intentioned, #ReclaimHerName is clunky revisionism masquerading as feminism.Indiscriminate re-feminising obscures the authors’ varied motives for adopting male pseudonyms for some, the economic necessity of publication, for others, a matter of choice – or both. George Eliot, for instance, primarily wished to separate her work from her scandalous domestic set-up (cohabitation with a married man in Victorian England), but she also enjoyed the sound of her pen-name, “a good mouth-filling, easily pronounced word”. Even the compulsion to adopt male names tells us much about the age.For George Sand (Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin) and Vernon Lee (novelist Violet Paget), male monikers reflected their taste for outraging bourgeois sensibilities and transgressing the boundaries set down for women. Both regularly dressed à la garçonne, relishing the freedom male clothes offered. Who are we to drag them into the daylight, forced back into crinolines and bonnets?Eliot’s renaming seems particularly incoherent given her solemn, near-doctrinaire approach to her craft. In the essay Silly Novels by Lady Novelists, she brilliantly (if brutally) skewers the work of many female contemporaries as shallow and simplistic. For Eliot, the imaginary Lady Novelist “mistakes vagueness for depth, bombast for eloquence, and affectation for originality… struts on one page, rolls her eyes on another, grimaces in a third, and is hysterical in a fourth”. Forcing a novelist who so consciously distanced herself from other female writers, and embraced an unorthodox bohemian life, into the retroactive mould of Nuneaton’s own Mary Ann Evans does little to elevate her. It is the literary equivalent of “outing” someone against their will.Women, past and present, have adopted male personas for erse reasons. Most recently, JK Rowling chose the alias Robert Galbraith to experience “unvarnished” critical reaction, untainted by Harry Potter hype. Second-guessing their motives is not just historically illiterate, it undermines female agency, as too much contemporary feminism does.Eliot’s readers have long lamented her heroines’ unsatisfactory endings Maggie Tulliver’s drowning in the River Floss, Dorothea Brooke’s underwhelming marriage to Will Ladislaw, or Adam Bede’s Dinah Morris, meekly abandoning her sermons on the green when the Methodist Church forbids women to preach. Yet they also reflect the realities of that era – something a tough-minded realist like Eliot was keen to achieve. It may disappoint feminists, but attempting to redact literary history is no more natural than rewriting The Mill on the Floss to spare Maggie her watery demise.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"greens force tour de france change starting point","story":"Green municipal councillors in Brittany have blocked a plan for the Tour de France to start from the city of Rennes next year on the grounds that it would damage the local environment.The Greens have long been enamoured of environmentally-friendly bicycles, but they are up in arms over what Jean-Marie Goater, a Rennes councillor, described as the  “disastrous environmental impact and waste management” of the world’s most famous cycle race.The Tour’s organisers have been forced to change the route  and start the race in another Brittany city, Brest.Valérie Faucheux, co-president of a group of Green councillors in Rennes, said: “This race has had its time but now run its course and it’s struggling to reinvent itself.”Mr Goater urged cycling fans to rediscover the virtues of the sport “far from the race, where money is king, with its sponsoring, TV business and doping”. The Greens, riding high after local election victories in several French cities in June, are determined to prove they can make a difference. But their opposition to the Tour, which attracts a huge international following and is a source of pride for many French people, has exposed them to attack.Bernard Hinault, a national icon as the last French winner of the race in 1985, said Ms Faucheux’s attitude made him angry. “You can’t say cycling is a thing of the past. It’s ridiculous,” said Mr Hinault, himself a Breton. “I think she should think before opening her mouth.”   A local news website, Rennes Infos Autrement, described Mr Goater as “green with rage”.However, it is not the first time that a local authority has refused to host a stage of the Tour. In 2018, the Right-wing mayors of Garches and Marnes-la-Coquette, near Paris, informed the race organisers that hosting it would be too disturbing and not beneficial for their local communities. Last year Grenoble’s Green mayor, Eric Piolle, refused to host the first stage of the race.This year, the coronavirus pandemic has forced organisers to delay the Tour, which is to start on August 29.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"israel normalise relations uae historic deal","story":"President Donald Trump on Thursday hailed a massive diplomatic coup as Israel agreed to normalise relations with the United Arab Emirates in return for suspending its controversial annexation plans. The historic deal, in which the UAE will become the first Gulf state to establish a full diplomatic relationship with Israel, was overseen by the White House and gives the president a major boost ahead of elections in November. President Trump unveiled the news on Thursday with a tweet which said: “HUGE breakthrough today! Historic Peace Agreement between our two GREAT friends, Israel and the United Arab Emirates!”The President also called on “more Arab and Muslim countries” to follow the UAE in normalising ties with Israel, suggesting that early talks may already be underway with other key Arab states. The news was swiftly followed by a joint statement from President Trump, Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Emirati premier Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed. “This historic diplomatic breakthrough will advance peace in the Middle East region and is a testament to the bold diplomacy and vision of the three leaders and the courage of the United Arab Emirates and Israel to chart a new path that will unlock the great potential in the region,” the statement said.The three leaders finalised the details of the deal during a phone call. Under the terms of the deal, which will be signed in the White House in a few weeks, Israel and the UAE will sign treaties on a plethora of key issues, including tourism, flights, technology, healthcare and the environment. But in return, Mr Netanyahu has agreed to suspend his longstanding ambition of annexing up to 30 per cent of the West Bank, which is claimed by the Palestinians as their own land. The annexation plans, which were envisaged as part of President Trump’s peace deal for the Middle East, caused an international outcry from the Arab world and key Israeli allies, including Britain. However, a senior Israeli official told local media that the government had not abandoned annexation altogether, in a sign that the deal could alienate Mr Netanyahu’s right-wing base. Emirati officials appeared to be under the impression that the deal would prevent any further annexation, rather than postpone it. The agreement is the third Israel-Arab peace deal since Israel declared independence in 1948, following Egypt and Jordan. The delay to annexation will come at a cost to the Palestinians and their long term ambitions of establishing their own state. This is because the deal has undermined one of the Palestinians’ key demands, which was that no Arab nation should normalise relations with Israel until after the creation of a Palestinian state. Palestinian leaders reacted with anger to the deal within minutes of it being announced. Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas said in a statement that his administration rejected and denounced what he described as a betrayal of the Palestinian cause.The UAE deal hints at a major shift in the attitude of Arab nations towards Israel, which traditionally regard the Jewish state as one of their key enemies in the region. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, told reporters that the deal was an “enormous, historic step” towards peace in the Middle East as he boarded a plane in Slovenia on Thursday afternoon. And Yousef al-Otaiba, the UAE’s ambassador in Washington, said: Today\u0027s announcement is a win for diplomacy and for the region. It is a significant advance in Arab-Israeli relations that lowers tensions and creates new energy for positive change.”The news was also welcomed by Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, he president of Egypt. He said: “I value the efforts of those in charge of this agreement in order to achieve prosperity and stability for our region.At a White House press conference, Jared Kushner, Mr Trump\u0027s son-in-law, hailed him as a deal maker who was changing the landscape of the Middle East.Another Arab country could very soon make a similar deal with Israel, while others would hopefully follow suit, he claimed.National Security Adviser Robert O\u0027Brien said Mr Trump should be a frontrunner for the Nobel Peace Prize because of the agreement. Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, hailed “an historic step, saying the UK welcomed both the normalisation of relations and the suspension of the annexation plan which would have been counterproductive to securing peace in the region.“Ultimately, there is no substitute for direct talks between the Palestinians and Israel, which is the only way to a reach a two state solution and a lasting peace, he added.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"must remember forgotten army","story":"It is my privilege to represent Her Majesty The Queen at the Sovereign’s Parade at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. It is the culmination of a year’s intensive training for officer cadets and sees them officially commissioned into the British Army. It will be a proud moment for hundreds of cadets as they anticipate the next stage of their military career. It will also be a poignant moment for me as, almost 30 years before, I was one of those marching onto the parade ground. And this is a profound moment for the nation on the eve of the 75th anniversary since Victory over Japan.That earlier generation has often been labelled the “Forgotten Army”, but it is clear the passage of time has not dimmed the legacy of those proud warriors.The multinational, “million-man” army that formed in Burma reminds us of the power of international cooperation. Made up of nations from across the Commonwealth and beyond, this vast collective endeavour not only stuck together through adversity but repelled an invading force once described as “invincible”.The actions of the British Pacific Fleet underline the virtues of persistence and reach. They never stopped intercepting Kamikaze attacks or harrying mainland Japan, despite being under constant enemy fire.And in a time when coronavirus is testing nations’ resilience, the value of constant readiness is surely embodied by allied air crews who, heedless of the danger, dropped 615,000 tons of supplies, airlifted 315,000 reinforcements and evacuated 210,000 casualties.Most importantly, despite living in the face of new threats and technologies, those heroes of the Pacific teach us the timeless values of courage and selfless commitment. Not purely the physical courage and personal sacrifice that saw 21-year-old Lancastrian lieutenant William Basil Weston lay down his life to capture a heavily defended bunker against fanatical opposition during an attack on Meiktila in Burma. But the moral courage that Field Marshal Slim, commander of the Fourteenth Army, referred to when he spoke at the Sovereign’s Parade at Sandhurst seven years after the war ended: “Moral courage is the courage that makes him do what is right because he believes it to be right.”Despite jungle heat, disease, monsoons and the loss of more than 30,000 of their comrades, those soldiers kept on going. And their sacrifices not only helped achieve collective triumph, but paved the way for new institutions devoted to halting tyranny and granting freedom to those in pursuit of peace and prosperity.That is why I have been determined to make sure those heroes receive a fitting remembrance on this great anniversary. Tomorrow morning a lone piper will play Battle’s O’er on the deck of HMS Belfast, herself a “veteran” of the British Pacific Fleet wreaths will be laid at the Cenotaph and the Red Arrows will conduct a national tour, before soaring over both HMS Belfast and The Royal Hospital Chelsea, home to three Burma Star recipients.The BBC will broadcast the Royal British Legion’s Remembrance Event at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, including a flypast by the RAF’s Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, before showing a unique VJ Day commemoration from Horse Guards Parade. The broadcast will recount major moments of the conflict. It will feature performers, musicians from across the UK Armed Forces, our great servicemen and women, and most importantly the veterans themselves.It is fitting that we should be rediscovering that “forgotten” generation. The proud young officers who I address at Sandhurst today will face very different challenges, requiring new skills and tools, as part of a more modern, nimble, and integrated Army. But triumphing again will require the same values of courage and selfless commitment, and for that they and the whole nation can draw inspiration from our Pacific heroes.So when I lay my tribute at the Arboretum, it won’t just be to commemorate those giants who, in Field Marshal Slim’s unforgettable words, did “the hard marching, hard fighting, hard living and hard dying”. Nor will it be just to say thank you to those brave veterans we are still so privileged to have with us. It will be to honour and pledge anew to the upholding of their lasting legacy – the freedoms we enjoy today. Freedoms born of collaboration, of persistence and resilience, of courage and sacrifice, and above all of hope.Ben Wallace is the Defence SecretaryMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"oldham brink full lockdown coronavirus cases surge","story":"Katrina Stephens, the director of public health for Oldham Council, said a full lockdown could take place in days rather than weeks unless people adhered to rules.Mr Burnham said a full lockdown should only be considered when everything else has been tried first, adding: To go from where we are today to full lockdown, that would present serious difficulties for the public but also for Greater Manchester services as well.He confirmed he had written to Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, alongside the Manchester City Council leader, Sir Richard Leese, to set out his concerns.Speaking during a weekly press briefing, he said: We need to see the pubs, particularly, implementing the measures, capturing people\u0027s names and addresses, so we can then make sure that the test and trace system is working as well as it should do.He also said he would be writing to the major supermarkets to call for a stricter approach to enforcing the wearing of face coverings in stores.There have been 70 confirmed cases in the region in the past week, and council leader Jonathan Nunn said the situation could go either way.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"swedens chief epidemiologist wanted keep schools open spread","story":"Sweden\u0027s state epidemiologist suggested to his Finnish counterpart that keeping schools open might spread the virus faster and speed up the path towards herd immunity, according to newly released emails.The email, obtained by a Swedish journalist under freedom of information laws, appears to contradict Dr Tegnell\u0027s public assurances about school closures and Sweden\u0027s controversial low-restriction coronavirus strategy.The release of Dr Tegnell\u0027s emails has caused a sensation in Sweden, highlighting the uncertainties and conflicts involved in the early days of Sweden\u0027s coronavirus response.In an email sent on March 14th, three days before Sweden closed down upper secondary schools and universities, Anders Tegnell wrote to Mika Salminen, his Finnish counterpart, suggesting that allowing the disease to spread among children might be desirable.One point might speak for keeping schools open in order to reach herd immunity more quickly, Dr Tegnell wrote in the email.Herd immunity requires 60 percent to 70 per cent of the population to have been infected or vaccinated to slow the rate of the disease spreading.Mr Salminen replied that his agency had rejected the idea after considering that allowing a spread between children would also increase the rate of spread elsewhere in society.We have also considered that, but over time the children are still going to spread the infection.True, Dr Tegnell replies, but probably mostly to each other because of the extremely age-stratified contact structure we have.Dr Tegnell has consistently argued in public that as well as being generally asymptomatic, children do not spread coronavirus to any great degree, even to each other.The email suggests that, at least in the first half of March, this was not something he was wholly convinced of, because if that were the case keeping schools open would have little impact on levels of immunity.Four days later, Dr Tegnell said on Swedish state television that he didn\u0027t think children spread coronavirus.When we ask around in China we find that they haven\u0027t been able to see any spread from children, he said. That doesn\u0027t mean children don\u0027t get the disease at all, but they don\u0027t seem to spread it.When approached for comment, Dr Tegnell argued that he had been discussing possibilities not expectations in his email to Mr Salminen.Other emails support this, indicating that at this early stage, Dr Tegnell had yet to fully decide on the role of children.The day after his email to Mr Salminen, Dr Tegnell replied to his predecessor as state epidemiologist, Annika Linde, who had sent him an email arguing that children, who can be heavily affected by flu, appeared to be symptom-free spreaders of coronavirus.This can ease the build-up of at least temporary immunity in the population..., she wrote to him. But nearly asymptomatic spreading also increases the risk of spreading to risk groups.In his reply, Dr Tegnell questioned her argument. The role of children in this epidemic is hard to understand, I think. Apparently they are not the motor of the epidemic as with influenza.In July, The Public Health Agency of Sweden published a joint study with the Finnish Institute of Health and Welfare, which found a similar rate of coronavirus cases among children in Sweden, which kept schools open, as in Finland, which closed them.This suggests that keeping schools open did not increase the spread among children.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"teachers accused submitting implausibly high predicted grades","story":"The exam regulator has accused teachers of submitting implausibly high predicted grades amid a growing fall-out over A-level results day.On Thursday, official data revealed that close to 40 per cent of results were downgraded from teachers\u0027 predictions (see graphic below), prompting students to complain that they had been let down by the system.But the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) said that, while the vast majority of teachers had submitted accurate estimates to exam boards, some had put forward wildly inflated grades.Because the circumstances meant there was no opportunity to develop a common approach to grading, the standard applied by different schools and colleges varies greatly, a spokesman for the regulator said.A rare few centres put in implausibly high judgments, including one which submitted all A* and A grades for students in two subjects, where previously there had been normal distribution.The intervention came amid a growing row on A-level results day, with pupils and schools complaining that they had been unreasonably punished by the statistical mechanism used to calculate grades. Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, came under pressure to follow Scotland, where grades created by an algorithm were withdrawn and teachers\u0027 predicted results will take their place. Mr Williamson faced calls to address the huge injustice for this year\u0027s pupils from Labour as well as headteachers after results showed that poorer pupils in England were more likely to have their marks downgraded by the algorithm. Universities promised to be flexible and hold open places for students while they appeal against their grades, with many desperate to fill courses as overseas students fail to take up places. Sources close to Mr Williamson insisted there would be no U-turn and said the model used was the fairest in the circumstances (see video below). They pointed to Ofqual figures which showed that almost twice as many pupils would be awarded A*s than in previous years if teachers\u0027 optimistic grades had been allowed to stand.Do teachers really think this year\u0027s cohort at the top end is nearly twice as bright as previous years? It just doesn\u0027t stack up, one source said. It is the most blatant demonstration that teachers are not to be trusted on grading. Some is optimism – some is just playing the system.This year\u0027s grades were calculated using a statistical model which took into account pupils\u0027 past performance and their school\u0027s historic grades, combined with the rank order drawn up by teachers, after exams were cancelled due to coronavirus.A Government source said: There are always people who do not get their predicted grades. People seem to be operating with the notion that everyone should just get what their teachers think they should have got.Pointing to the grade inflation that resulted from teachers being left to predict results elsewhere, the source added: The whole point is to avoid what has happened in Scotland and France. No one will trust the Scottish 2020 results. Another said: It\u0027s a matter of downgrading versus undermining.Sources highlighted figures from the university admissions service which showed that 79 per cent of students accepted to university last year did not meet their predicted grades.On Thursday night, Amanda Spielman, the chief inspector of schools, intervened, saying: We have to minimise the amount of extra unfairness created. Standardising grades, with a right of appeal, is an important part of the jigsaw.Not to do so would be unfair for last year\u0027s school and college leavers and next year\u0027s, who are competing for jobs, training and higher education places.Headteachers called for an urgent review into the statistical model, with some claiming it may even be systematically biased against disadvantaged children who were more likely to have had their results downgraded.A former minister said: He\u0027s clearly seen the chaos in Scotland and is trying to move to prevent that scenario. Instead he\u0027s just made himself look panicky and incompetent. In short, he\u0027s justifying his own sacking.A third backbencher added: It\u0027s a farce, it\u0027s a disgrace, and Gavin Williamson should hang his head in shame and resign. He was a useless Defence Secretary and even worse Education Secretary.However, allies of Mr Williamson said on Thursday night that he had the support of Boris Johnson, hitting out at rival MPs\u0027 briefings. One said: As a former Chief Whip, he\u0027ll always have some enemies.Data published by Ofqual showed that students from wealthier backgrounds were more likely to benefit from a boost in grades than those from more deprived families (see graphic below).While A*s and As rose by 4.7 per cent at fee-paying institutions from last year, they only rose by two per cent at comprehensives, 1.7 per cent at academies and 1.2 per cent at grammars.Meanwhile, pupils classified as being of lower socio-economic status were more likely to have their grades downgraded from their teachers\u0027 predictions. One in 10 teenagers from this group had their A-level marks lowered, compared to eight per cent of pupils of higher socio-economic status, Ofqual\u0027s data revealed.Mr Johnson said the exam results published on Thursday were robust and dependable. He congratulated students on their results, adding: I think that there\u0027s a record number of candidates, of students, who are able to get their first choice course at the university of their choice.Plus, there\u0027s a record number of students, of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds who now, as a result of these grades, will be able to go to university.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"went aab dae missed place university unfair system","story":"Top students across the country opened their results today in a state of shock - expecting A*s, As and Bs after two years of hard work, they found they had been \u0027downgraded\u0027 to Cs, Ds and Es.Teachers had to explain to their brightest pupils that they had been judged partly on the basis of what last year\u0027s class achieved, rather than just on the quality of their work or how hard they revised for their mock exams.Maks Ovnik has achieved a string of As and Bs throughout his time in sixth form, including in his mock exams for Mathematics, Physics and Computing, and was predicted to get AAB.But the 18-year-old opened his results to find he achieved a D in Computing, an A in Mathematics and an E in Physics, meaning all hope of taking up his place at Southampton University was lost.Mr Ovnik believes it is because his school, Christ the King College on the Isle of Wight, recently came out of special measures, and those in the cohort above him scored poorly on their exams last year.He told The : The majority of my class were high performing in physics this year and last year the cohort was low performing which has affected it.After a long stretch in lockdown unable to see his friends or go to school, he is now likely condemned to take a year out so he can resit his exams in the autumn.The student explained: I am also going to try and appeal my grades because going down three grades in two subjects is a bit ridiculous.The teachers feel awful about it but obviously it isn\u0027t their fault. I am hoping the government sees how many people this is happening to.He believes that he would have performed even more highly in the exams than in his mocks, in which he scored AAB, as he had spent four months diligently studying.  Delilah Lees was hoping to change the world by studying robotics engineering in order to help disabled people and the environment. Predicted AAB in Maths, Physics and Computer Science, and having been studying every day, she was confident she would get the grades, as were her teachers.However, come results day, she was shocked to lose her place at Bath university and be given ABD by the algorithm. Her mother, Amanda, said she was devastated.This is particularly upsetting for the family as Delilah had overcome many hurdles to achieve good grades at school. Developing anorexia after suffering bullying, she taught herself from her hospital bed during her GCSEs and achieved straight As. This gave her the confidence to take on six placements in her summer holidays, including one at TfL, and she has given speeches on artificial intelligence.Amanda Lees told The :  We rang them first thing and told them we were appealing. We have spoken to the school and they are writing to Bath today to put her case. She really does have a special case after spending so much time out of school and working so hard.It seems that while schools are horrified and very supportive, our experience so far is that we are completely confused.Her school, Goldolphin and Laytmer in Hammersmith, is going to try to appeal all the grades en masse after facing large numbers of downgrading.Mrs Lees explained: She has the grit and determination and tenacity and a brilliant mind and she wants to do good with her degree. After covid we need people like Delilah.They are not looking at inidual cases. They are looking at algorithms and crunching numbers.   It\u0027s brutal because this is their future. She has been remarkable, she studied every day during lockdown just in case she needed to. She\u0027s taken online Stanford university course, all the things that could help her in her first year she\u0027s already covered the material. It\u0027s a phenomenal waste of an amazing brain.  She\u0027s achieved in spite of everything. She\u0027s never asked for special consideration.Hannah Gofton was given lower grades than she had ever achieved in an exam because she was deemed to be from a deprived area.The teenager missed out on her place at the University of Nottingham after receiving BBB, despite being predicted AAA and achieving AAB in her mocks.She told The : I have been completely downgraded on my grades and cannot get into my firm university.The University of Nottingham will not accept me considering they gave me a contextual offer and I can’t get in touch with anyone at the university to explain my situation.I come from what is classed as a ‘deprived’ area as my college is in Hartlepool (English Martyrs School and Sixth Form College).I just want some recognition for this issue as my future is now completely ruined.Thomas Kinsella was ready to go and study Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Durham University until he was given results lower than his mocks.A straight-A student, he was predicted A*AA. However, the teenager from Cheltenham College in Gloucestershire was given ABB.He told The : The school have told me that they don’t think an appeal is viable in my position and I will have to re-sit. I have phoned Durham and they say there is no way for them to accept my re-sit grades when I get them and I will have to do a full reapplication.I got ABB in Maths, French and Physics having been given A*AA CAGs by my teachers. Just by chance my three subjects happened to be significantly stronger this year than they were for the last 3 years at my school. I assume therefore my grades and ranking didn’t fit the distribution assigned to my school by the algorithm.I have now missed out on my offers to go to Durham or Exeter. I have been strong academically  throughout my time at school (11 A*s at GCSE) and feel like had I sat my A Levels I would have done far better, but instead have been caught out by a poorly made algorithm that relies too much on past data for something as complicated to predict as education.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/08/13/19/job-application-1-0.jpg","title":"job vacancies data applications rise unemployment","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Companies are receiving thousands of applicants for roles that would normally attract only a handful, jobs website saysCompanies are receiving thousands of applications for jobs which would only have attracted a handful of applicants before the coronavirus pandemic, research has found.The most popular role was an entry-level position as a paralegal which received 4,228 applications.

Jobs website Indeed saw a 56 per cent drop in vacancies compared with the same point last year.The end of summer and early autumn is traditionally a busy time for recruitment with thousands of graduates and school-leavers looking for new roles. The class of 2020 faces the toughest jobs market since the financial crisis 12 years ago.The number of people in employment dropped by 730,000 between March and July, official figures showed this week.CV-Library said it received a record number of applications last month as huge numbers of professional workers were made redundant or were furloughed.Lee Biggins, chief executive of CV-Library, said: “On average, our clients’s jobs receive around 25 applications per vacancy, so these figures really are massive.“The job market has done a complete 180, so, while companies may have struggled to recruit before the pandemic, they’re now being bombarded with applications from professionals who are desperate for a new job.“Of course, this is good news for companies that are recruiting, but it does mean you need a robust hiring process which enables you to easily monitor applications, screen applicants and make the right hires, quickly and effectively.”The research showed that 146 jobs on the CV-Library website received between 500 and 3,000 applications in July, 44 attracted between 500 and 600 applications, 26 drew between 1,001 and 2,000, and 26 got between 601 and 700.Mr Biggins added: “Companies also need to remember that they’re dealing with humans.

The US and eurozone have both already been confirmed as being in recession.There were signs of a recovery beginning, as monthly gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 8.7 per cent in June but is 17.2 per cent below February 2020 levels, the Office for National Statistics said.Britain faces up to the prospect of mass unemploymentSurvey results showed that businesses are increasing output as demand has risen following the easing of social distancing and lockdown measures.Manufacturing, construction and services all experienced widespread growth in June as businesses were allowed to resume trading, but output in all three sectors remained significantly below pre-pandemic levels.The output of service industries remains 17.6 per cent below the level of February, after growing by 7.7 per cent in June.Manufacturing remains 14.2 per cent below February levels after growing by 11 per cent since May.Construction saw the biggest fall in output and the sharpest rebound. It expanded 23.5 per cent in June as sites reopened but output is 24.8 per cent down on February levels.Some services sectors continue to be more severely affected as many businesses remain closed, the ONS said. Among the biggest declines were in the food and beverage services industry where output was barely a quarter of pre-lockdown levels in June. Government ministers and economists will be closely watching the data for signs that any recovery continued to gain momentum in July and August as pubs, restaurants, bars and hairdressers, among other businesses, were allowed to reopen.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While that was largely expected as broad sections of the economy shut down, it remains to be seen how quickly people will have returned to their old spending habits in recent weeks.  Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: “The recession brought on by the coronavirus pandemic has led to the biggest fall in quarterly GDP on record.“The economy began to bounce back in June with shops reopening, factories beginning to ramp up production and housebuilding continuing to recover.“Despite this, GDP in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck.“Overall, productivity saw its largest-ever fall in the second quarter. Hospitality was worst hit, with productivity in that industry falling by three-quarters in recent months.”Economists forecast that, although the coronavirus recession is unprecedentedly deep, it should be of short duration.“While the UK recession involved a record contraction, it should at least be limited to two quarters,” said Howard Archer, chief economist of the EY Item Club. “The economy has been growing at an increasing rate since May and it appeared to take a further step forward in July as lockdown restrictions were eased further.“The substantial fiscal and monetary stimulus that has been enacted should provide ongoing support to the economy.”He added: “There should also be some pent-up demand following the overall reduction in consumer spending in the second quarter, while household purchasing power is being helped by very low inflation. Global economic activity is also now improving as other economies recover from the impact of coronavirus. This will help UK exports.”Moving out of the technical recession does not mean that the economic pain is over, however. Businesses hit hard by the pandemic are expected to lay off large numbers of staff over the coming months as support measures such as the furlough scheme come to an end.Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that the ONS figures “confirm that hard times are here”.“Hundreds of thousands of people have already lost their jobs, and sadly in the coming months many more will.“But while there are difficult choices to be made ahead, we will get through this, and I can assure people that nobody will be left without hope or opportunity.”Official data showed this week that around 730,000 UK workers have been removed from the payrolls of British companies since March when the coronavirus lockdown began.The number of hours worked each week plunged by a fifth and 7.5 million people were temporarily absent from work in July.The Bank of England forecast last week that the economy will shrink by 9.5 per cent in 2020 after a rebound in the second half of the year as restrictions ease and activity gears up again.It upgraded its forecast after energy usage and travel data suggested a faster pick-up than had been predicted. The bank previously predicted a 14 per cent contraction.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

applicants for roles that would normally attract only a handful, jobs website saysCompanies are receiving thousands of applications for jobs which would only have attracted a handful of applicants before the coronavirus pandemic, research has found.The most popular role was an entry-level position as a paralegal which received 4,228 applications. Some 3,333 people applied for a job as a human resources assistant and 3,272 for a trainee accountancy job, according to jobs website CV-Library.An advert for a job as a warehouse worker in Northumberland received 2,932 applications, 2,653 applied for a factory job in Sunderland and 2,154 for an administrator role in Coventry.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe findings underline how tough the job market is amid the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic.One in three UK companies expect to cut jobs by September, poll findsJob listings dropped sharply in March and April and have only recovered slowly in the following weeks. Jobs website Indeed saw a 56 per cent drop in vacancies compared with the same point last year.The end of summer and early autumn is traditionally a busy time for recruitment with thousands of graduates and school-leavers looking for new roles. The class of 2020 faces the toughest jobs market since the financial crisis 12 years ago.The number of people in employment dropped by 730,000 between March and July, official figures showed this week.CV-Library said it received a record number of applications last month as huge numbers of professional workers were made redundant or were furloughed.Lee Biggins, chief executive of CV-Library, said: “On average, our clients’s jobs receive around 25 applications per vacancy, so these figures really are massive.“The job market has done a complete 180, so, while companies may have struggled to recruit before the pandemic, they’re now being bombarded with applications from professionals who are desperate for a new job.“Of course, this is good news for companies that are recruiting, but it does mean you need a robust hiring process which enables you to easily monitor applications, screen applicants and make the right hires, quickly and effectively.”The research showed that 146 jobs on the CV-Library website received between 500 and 3,000 applications in July, 44 attracted between 500 and 600 applications, 26 drew between 1,001 and 2,000, and 26 got between 601 and 700.Mr Biggins added: “Companies also need to remember that they’re dealing with humans. While it’s not feasible to give feedback to every single candidate, acknowledging applications and sending polite rejection emails to people who aren’t successful will be appreciated.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Just as the Reddit user described, it is indeed possible to glimpse an operator’s hand just as the shot is panning away from the raptor.While other Reddit users expressed surprise at the discovery, errors like this are common in films. IMDb has identified 341 goofs in Jurassic Park, many of which are to do with continuity. Sam Neill: ‘Science was neglected, and that’s biting us on the arse’Jurassic Park actor Sam Neill says new film is ‘best yet’Certain errors in major films have become infamous over the years, such as the appearance of a white van during a battle scene in Braveheart, or the presence of bullet holes in a scene in Pulp Fiction before guns have been fired.In another Jurassic Park scene, the untrustworthy Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) is seen talking to someone by “video link”, but viewers are able to clearly discern that he is simply watching a pre-recorded video.The lead stars of Jurassic Park – Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Laura Dern – are set to reprise their roles in the upcoming Jurassic World: Dominion, which recently resumed filming, having been suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Reports say that Oxfordshire Fire Service put the fire out and that nobody was injured.The costly stunt is thought to have been six weeks in the making, with a source admitting: “Unfortunately, it was miscalculated.”Subtitles for ‘inaudible’ Avengers scene may reference X-Men characterIs Tenet a sequel to Inception? Farfetched theory explainedTimothy Dalton: ‘Why do we need to offer people gratuitous sex?’They continued: “The heat and the friction of the tyres meant that when the bike crashed, the cardboard padding sparked and went up in flames.”According to reports, Cruise is “frustrated” by the delay, with the inside calling the situation “a catastrophe”.The Independent has contacted Paramount Pictures for comment.Earlier this month, the sequel – which is being directed by Christopher McQuarrie – found itself in deep water after it was reported the film’s crew is pushing to blow up a bridge in Poland that is considered a national monument by locals.Part of the disused bridge, which is situated in the village of Pilchowice, would be detonated for the stunt.However, crew members are facing obstruction from local citizens despite Deputy Culture Minister Pawel Lewandowsk claiming that the bridge has no cultural value.Production on Mission: Impossible 7, which will be directed by Christopher McQuarrie, is set to resume in the UK in September, before heading to Poland in April.The film will be released in November 2022.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I have got them outlined and a chapter written I think of the first one, so I know it’s there.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, it could be a while before fans will be able to get their hands on the next Twilight instalments.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.At the Tommyfield Market in Oldham – the Greater Manchester town now on the front line of the UK’s battle with coronavirus – on Wednesday morning, there was frustration and fear in equal measure.Frustration because of an overnight council warning that, after weeks of increasing infection rates, the borough may be just “days away” from becoming the first place in England returned to lockdown. “How did they let it get to this?” asked one person.But fear too. Fear most of all perhaps. Fear that if pubs, restaurants, leisure centres and non-essential businesses in this historic mill town really do have to shut again for a prolonged period, it could cripple the entire area – for years to come.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Look around,” said Dale Robinson, owner of Blooming Dale’s florists in Tommyfield. “Oldham’s been struggling for decades. Now this. There’s a lot of shops here that just about survived the first lockdown. They’ve scraped through. But a second one…”A shake of his head. A glance down Albion Street where empty units are already dismally plentiful.“I don’t know if there’d be much of a town to come back to afterwards,” he concludes.That Oldham has had a difficult modern history, few would argue.The destruction of both its mill industry in the Seventies and Eighties and then its engineering base in the Nineties was followed from 2010 by an especially eviscerating austerity: some 42 per cent of the council’s budget was cut here in a decade.The result has been huge levels of hardship. Four wards within the Oldham Council area are in the top one per cent of the country’s most deprived. Three of England’s 20 worst patches for child poverty are here too.Even the popularity of Tommyfield – an Aladdin’s cave built just 30 years ago and serving everything from fresh meat and veg to haircuts – is to some extent evidence of a population without disposable income. “People come here because they need good value just to get by,” says Robinson, who has run his business in the town for 19 years.Now, the concern is that a second lockdown could decimate the still struggling economy here.Robinson, himself, had to throw away £2,000 worth of stock during the national closure from March to June, while the council here - much to the astonishment of many – continued to charge traders full rent. “If there has to be another lockdown to save lives, so be it,” the 54-year-old, who employs four staff at the unit, says. “No-one’s going to argue with that. But don’t think it won’t hurt. It would be devastating.”Pertinently, perhaps, if the dilemma is Oldham’s right now, it appears increasingly unlikely it will be the only place to find itself wrestling with the same predicament. With new infections across the country topping 1,000 for a second day running on Wednesday – the first time that’s happened since June – it is almost certain more towns will face such tough measures.“It was crippling first time round and would be worse second,” says Ray Aslam, in between serving sweets and lollies at his Kandy Kingdom shop. “I know for a fact a lot of businesses here managed to get by because of the £10,000 grant from the government. But if there’s a local lockdown without that support, there would be closures all over town.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe 35-year-old is a spokesperson for the Tommyfield Market Traders Association but he’s not just talking about the entrepreneurs there: “restaurants, pubs, businesses across the board – they have used everything to survive and get to a position where they could reopen – they don’t have anything left to fall back on.”The wider issue, perhaps, is that once those businesses go, jobs, money and opportunities all disappear from the town. Council and support services already under strain become further stretched, while young people leave in search of work elsewhere. It is a vicious circle that could last decades, reckons Aslam.“Oldham has been here before so we know how it goes,” he says before turning to a customer brightly. “Pear drops, love?”There is another concern beyond the economy here too: that a new lockdown may lead to inter-community tensions.Already it appears some residents are blaming spiralling infection rate on certain communities. Specifically, they are blaming the town’s 20 per cent Muslim population.This, to be clear, is against the evidence. The spread, says Arooj Shah, the council’s cabinet member for Covid-19 recovery, is “in all areas, in all age groups, and in all communities”.Nonetheless, there are concerns that, in a town where race riots exploded in 2001, such disinformation could lead to a rise in Islamophobia. “It is unfortunate that this is happening,” a spokesperson for the Oldham Muslim Centre said. “Members of the Muslim community have made – and continue to make – large sacrifices to stick to the guidelines and to play their part in bringing the spread under control.”This, certainly, is supported by Katrina Stephens, Oldham’s director of public health, who says infections are occurring right across the board.It was she who took the decision to warn residents that if restrictions already in place in the borough – mainly, different households not mixing – were not followed more rigorously, stricter measures may be imposed.She did so after becoming alarmed that the infection rate had almost doubled in the last week. It now stands at 107.5 per 100,000 population. For context, when Leicester was kept in local lockdown in July – as the rest of the country was released from restrictions – the rate there was 135 per 100,000 people.Covid-19 is airborne and social distancing ‘not helpful’, study saysCoronavirus cluster linked to Glasgow high schoolSecond consecutive day over 1,000 new cases for first time since JuneRecord 30 million people sought help from NHS 111 during pandemicIt is not solely the number of infections which will be considered over the next couple of days as officials wrestle with the dilemma. It will also be proportions of positive tests and hospital admissions. Counter-intuitively, perhaps, part of the problem in Oldham has been that there has been specific major outbreak. Officials cannot pin a spread down to a certain business, bar or neighbourhood. It appears to be circulating everywhere.“Which makes it difficult to tackle with more targeted measures,” Stephens said.Reasonable enough but would a decision on a total lockdown take into account the sheer economic hardship people feared they would face? It would.Would there be help from either central government or the council for those facing such hardships? A more ambiguous answer. “There are a range of discussions being had,” she said.That probably isn’t the definitive answer that may have reassured many here.But outside Smoke Yard – a burger and cocktail joint close to the recently refurbished town hall – manager Dave Turner felt the moral case for help was incontestable.His restaurant had turned to deliveries during the national shut down and had managed to generate about 40 per cent of usual business. All the same, it had lost three staff and he wasn’t sure another prolonged period of closure could be survived.“As I understand local lockdowns,” he said, “you shut one area so the virus doesn’t spread to other parts of the country. So Oldham would be bearing the brunt to protect others. Surely, if we’re making that sacrifice, it’s only fair that we get some help in return.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The US and eurozone have both already been confirmed as being in recession.There were signs of a recovery beginning, as monthly gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 8.7 per cent in June but is 17.2 per cent below February 2020 levels, the Office for National Statistics said.Britain faces up to the prospect of mass unemploymentSurvey results showed that businesses are increasing output as demand has risen following the easing of social distancing and lockdown measures.Manufacturing, construction and services all experienced widespread growth in June as businesses were allowed to resume trading, but output in all three sectors remained significantly below pre-pandemic levels.The output of service industries remains 17.6 per cent below the level of February, after growing by 7.7 per cent in June.Manufacturing remains 14.2 per cent below February levels after growing by 11 per cent since May.Construction saw the biggest fall in output and the sharpest rebound. It expanded 23.5 per cent in June as sites reopened but output is 24.8 per cent down on February levels.Some services sectors continue to be more severely affected as many businesses remain closed, the ONS said. Among the biggest declines were in the food and beverage services industry where output was barely a quarter of pre-lockdown levels in June. Government ministers and economists will be closely watching the data for signs that any recovery continued to gain momentum in July and August as pubs, restaurants, bars and hairdressers, among other businesses, were allowed to reopen.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While that was largely expected as broad sections of the economy shut down, it remains to be seen how quickly people will have returned to their old spending habits in recent weeks.  Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: “The recession brought on by the coronavirus pandemic has led to the biggest fall in quarterly GDP on record.“The economy began to bounce back in June with shops reopening, factories beginning to ramp up production and housebuilding continuing to recover.“Despite this, GDP in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck.“Overall, productivity saw its largest-ever fall in the second quarter. Hospitality was worst hit, with productivity in that industry falling by three-quarters in recent months.”Economists forecast that, although the coronavirus recession is unprecedentedly deep, it should be of short duration.“While the UK recession involved a record contraction, it should at least be limited to two quarters,” said Howard Archer, chief economist of the EY Item Club. “The economy has been growing at an increasing rate since May and it appeared to take a further step forward in July as lockdown restrictions were eased further.“The substantial fiscal and monetary stimulus that has been enacted should provide ongoing support to the economy.”He added: “There should also be some pent-up demand following the overall reduction in consumer spending in the second quarter, while household purchasing power is being helped by very low inflation. Global economic activity is also now improving as other economies recover from the impact of coronavirus. This will help UK exports.”Moving out of the technical recession does not mean that the economic pain is over, however. Businesses hit hard by the pandemic are expected to lay off large numbers of staff over the coming months as support measures such as the furlough scheme come to an end.Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that the ONS figures “confirm that hard times are here”.“Hundreds of thousands of people have already lost their jobs, and sadly in the coming months many more will.“But while there are difficult choices to be made ahead, we will get through this, and I can assure people that nobody will be left without hope or opportunity.”Official data showed this week that around 730,000 UK workers have been removed from the payrolls of British companies since March when the coronavirus lockdown began.The number of hours worked each week plunged by a fifth and 7.5 million people were temporarily absent from work in July.The Bank of England forecast last week that the economy will shrink by 9.5 per cent in 2020 after a rebound in the second half of the year as restrictions ease and activity gears up again.It upgraded its forecast after energy usage and travel data suggested a faster pick-up than had been predicted. The bank previously predicted a 14 per cent contraction.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.It was a particularly cold June morning in northern Kenya when rangers working in Loisaba Nature Conservancy first spotted a large male elephant limping near a watering hole. The rangers began monitoring the elephant, a large bull with enormous tusks, who was nicknamed Alan. Max Silvester, a Conservation Volunteer in Loisaba, said “the injury was likely the result of a botched poaching attempt. Alan had some of the biggest ivory I have seen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA wounded animal is liable to attack anything that comes close to it, and the elephant charged at the team who assembled to help him. “I was very afraid because he was huge,” said Loisaba’s Security Assistant Rita Orahle, who assisted KWS vet Dr Dominic Mijele.“He was trying to scare us by trumpeting because he knew he could not run away due to his injury”, said Dr Mijele. “I darted him and it became obvious that the wound was caused by a bullet which had entered the animal’s right foot, having first grazed the trunk.“After cleaning the injury and administering antibiotics I gave him an antidote and he walked off. If the elephant had been left untreated he would have been dead within a week.”All hunting is illegal in Kenya, a nation that has led the war against the plundering of wildlife, and ivory trafficking in particular. The Independent\u0027s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign was launched to call for an international effort to clamp down on poaching and the illegal trade of wild animals.Funds raised will to pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants. This will work to help stop the poaching and illegal trafficking of animals.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHowever the impact of Covid-19 means help is urgently needed to protect elephants against an increased threat of slaughter.In 2015 Space for Giants worked with international conservation organisation The Nature Conservancy to establish Loisaba as a conservation trust in perpetuity, protecting a critical habitat for a ersity of endangered species.Covering an area of 57,000 acres in the county of Laikipia, Loisaba has an increasing resident population of elephants, estimated at around 800, as well as an abundance of other fauna, including more than 260 bird species and 57 mammals, such as lions, leopards and cheetahs.Space for Giants supports wildlife monitoring, security and conservancy management in Loisaba, financed by The Nature Conservancy and other donors, including San Diego Zoo. The communities around Loisaba understand the value of wildlife, and the happy result is the conservancy is a zero poaching zone - a fact that even pachyderms themselves might understand. Silvester told The Independent “it’s likely that Alan the elephant was shot elsewhere, but the intelligence of this bull, in moving quickly to a place of safety Loisaba Conservancy, allowed the rangers and the vet team to assure his wound was treated quickly and successfully.“He continues to roam Laikipia as a testament to his forefathers, the huge tuskers before him.“Orahle adds “the rangers continued to monitor the bull, and he was last spotted in early August looking happy and not limping at all.”Alan was not the only animal to be rescued in Loisaba that day. The ranger team rushed off to treat a giraffe with a split hoof. In the midst of a raging global pandemic Loisaba’s wildlife operations continue to protect endangered species, preserving bioersity and supporting local communities in the process.The wildlife veterinary unit that saved the elephant is sponsored by Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, working in collaboration with KWS, to attend wildlife cases in Laikipia.

Yesterday, the Prime Minister hit the road to inspect the measures schools have put in place.He said: “It’s not right that kids should spend more time out of school. It’s much better for their health and mental wellbeing, and obviously their educational prospects,everybody comes back full-time in September. It’s our moral duty as a country to make sure that happens.”Thanks to social distancing and hygiene measures, St Paul’s Church of England Primary School in Swanley, Kent, fully reopened in June.Here, its head teacher blasts the unions for failing children with their “can’t do” attitude. AS a country, we are trying to get back to some sort of normality — and schools have a big part to play in that.Getting children back into the classroom is vital so parents can get back to work.Yet this is proving anything but child’s play.Unions have hit schools with a checklist of  demands before opening next month. This exhaustive list includes assurances that schools will take specic measures to stop children drinking hand sanitiser, extra support for the wellbeing of staff suffering from workload worries, anxiety or the effects of trauma and insisting classes be held “one week on, one week off”.Union members have been urged to present this checklist to headteachers and to expect its completion.It is not helpful. Unions should be working with schools to ensure there is a safe , not creating ision — which is what this will do. If we keep looking at checklists of things that need to be ticked off, we will never get schools reopened.It will never be perfect for everyone. Nothing is. There are always dfering opinions.When askedthe checklist raised the bar too high, NEU president Amanda Martin responded: “This is people’s safety. What cost is safety ”Of course safety is important. But unions should be pulling together and supporting schools, rather than making it very dficult for them to come back.Before my school reopened, I was stunned to hear some unions were encouraging teachers not to engage in conversation with head-teachers. How is that helpful to anyone We have a responsibility to children to be back. If we don’t come back now, when We can’t keep putting it off. We must come back at some point and September is as good a time as any.It is about common sense and making sure the school community is as safe as it can be. Get the basics done from the off and tweak it as we go. That is how it should work.And I know — because I made it work.When we reopened our school in June we followed the guidance the Government set out to the letter.We didn’t have any cases of staff or students falling ill with the virus.We installed a marquee in our playing field to create extra space, as well as supplying portaloos and mobile handwashing facilities to keep pupils and staff safe.Classes were kept apart with inidual entrances and exits. Yes, we are a smaller school with fewer children.But I have fewer staff and less space to play with.As a community, the school came together, did the right thing and got the children back. That’s what it is about: Working with your community — the pupils, parents and staff.Inevitably, there was going to be some sort of drop in pupils’ learning. But children are really resilient. We saw that when they came back.They were straight back into six-hour days, with a full timetable of learning.They dealt with it really well. Actually, they loved coming back to the stability and routine of what they knew.As much as you try to put in a timetable at home, you don’t follow it because the environment is very dferent.I have two children myself and know how hard it was during that time . . . and I’m a teacher.My we and I were both working full-time from home. To get my six-year-old to do more than an hour’s work was incredibly dficult.You don’t get the same experience sitting in front of a screen watching a teacher online as you do being in a classroom interacting with other people.I strongly feel schools have a responsibility to give parents the opportunity to get back into some sort of normality with work.Because we brought all our children back, parents were able to work better from home and do the things they needed to do.We had a number of parents who were made redundant during lockdown.With not having the children at home, they had the chance to look for other work. Meanwhile, their kids were safe.Just this week, Professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the “very low” risk to children from Covid- meant the reopening of schools is safe.Research carried out in  institutions across the UK will confirm “there is very little evidence” of coronavirus transmission where pupils have ed.I hope this will help reassure parents, as the negative impact of keeping children away from classrooms runs deeper than their education.The effect on the mental health of our nation’s youngsters could be catastrophic. The social impact of schools is vital.We were back for a month before the summer holidays and that was one of the overriding factors parents talked about. Lots of children were sad, very quiet and not their normal selves during lockdown.But coming back to school really changed them. That was evident from day one.Parents had been concerned about their children’s mental health and could see how happy they were to be back at school, where they were able to interact with their friends and peers and reignite those friendships.It was wonderful to hear children laughing and enjoy- ing each other’s company.That is something you can’t get in lockdown — the social aspect of school le.Schools are at the heart of most communities.Andschools can get back safely, the rest of the community will hopefully follow back into some normality.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It looks good on the CV.I say “results” — of course, they are not results, as such. Instead, teachers have been tasked with deciding how well each student might have donerequired to sit an exam. These predictions are then weighted by the exam boards.As you might expect, teachers tend to overrate the abilities of their students. Not least because it makes THEM look good. In Scotland, they were over-generous to the tune of  per cent — and even more so in some “deprived” areas.The Scottish schoolkids were pretty hacked off to find their grades reduced by the boards, and moaned about it. So the Scottish government caved in and let them have their original grades. The ones that were overvalued.And so when little Jimmy proudly displays his long list of As and Bs to prospective employers — or, God help us, a university — people will just snigger.They know he can’t spell his own name or, like the rabbits in Watership Down, count past five. Nobody will take the results seriously after the Scottish government did its cowardly U-turn.Sadly for the youngsters, they will be pretty meaningless results. Which is a horrible thing to say after they’ve been studying for so long.South of the border we’re doing things a little better. Kids will be able to take the grade awarded to them. Or they can choose to use the result they got in their mocks — exams taken before Mr Covid arrived on the scene. Or they can take a special written exam in the autumn.That’s more sensible. But I suspect, even so, that employers and the universities will be a little wary of taking the results at face value. They will have their doubts.All of this has happened because we’re trying to be kind to the kids. And the reason we’re being kind is because these past six months we have let them down badly. The Government has let them down — and even more so, the teachers.Too many schools had no virtual classrooms at all during lockdown. The kids might have been sent a few worksheets. But time with their teachers was non-existent, even via Zoom.Too many teachers have been absolutely bone idle. Two-thirds of children have taken part in no virtual lessons whatsoever. Schools refused to make them — so the kids skived. And that’s in schools where there WERE regular virtual lessons.My own child, a girl of , completed five physics papers during lockdown. And being my daughter, sent them to the wrong email address. Nobody checked, nobody cared.The truth is our kids have had six months of doing nowt. Being nice to them now because we ignored their needs through spring and summer is all well and good. But it does not excuse the disgraceful behaviour of the teaching unions. Nor the failure of the Government to stand up to the unions.The result of all this will be a bigger ide than ever between poorer and richer kids. The middle classes are flocking to the private sector — where schools WILL be open and there’s always a full timetable of virtual work.For the rest — just the suspicion that they have been treated very badly indeed. By the people whose responsibility it was to look after them.It’s time Labour came clean about our teachers. Do they want the schools to reopen or not  And no more weasel words about keeping everybody safe. You cannot eliminate risk entirely, as Sir Keir Starmer well knows.We are now in a recession. Nothing will drag us out of it more quickly than the schools reopening, full-time, no s nor buts. Then the rest of us can get back to work.THE former boss of McDonald’s is in trouble for having exchanged nude pics with fellow workers.Brit Steve Easterbrook, pictured with Alesha Dixon at the London  Olympics, is also in trouble for having slept with a few colleagues.Now, those pics.I don’t knowSteve has a Whopper, a Quarter Pounder, a Big n’ Tasty – or just a chicken nugget. But nobody complained about them at the time. All of his relationships were consensual. And Steve was a orcee. What seems to me wrong is McDonald’s banning all of its staff from having relationships in-house.I WONDER how Prince Andrew has been coping during this heatwave If you remember, he explained to the BBC’s Emily Maitlis that he has an inability to sweat. Just can’t do it. He must be bursting, underneath his skin. Perhaps he will explode.Me, I’m sick of sweating. A three-minute walk to the local river ends up with me looking like I’ve just swam a mile in it.I’ve even started wearing shorts, which I hate. The noncey scout leader look – it’s all the rage.The BBC was worrying about this hot spell. Wonderedit was the result of global warming.Isn’t it something to do with that thing called “summer” I seem to remember it kind of happening before, you know I’m talking about the people who, in the middle of a global pandemic, travel abroad for their holidays. And are then surprised there are problems on account of the fact that we are in the middle of a global pandemic.Truth is, I have about as much sympathy as I do for people who travel to appalling war-torn countries for their hols then whine at the British Government to get them out.Would it hurt THAT much just to stay in the UK this summer WEDNESDAY was a pretty bad day for grouse.They have it circled in their diaries each year, in red. The “Glorious Twelfth”. This is when City boys and braying toffs take to the grouse moors and start blasting away at anything that moves. Especially grouse. Slow, heavy birds. Not very bright. Hard to miss them from eight yards with a -bore, evenyou’re a halfwit.It’s a bad day for the rest of us, too. And for our countryside. Grouse moors take up an astonishing eight per cent of our land. And yet they are kept solely for the grouse and the , or so numpties who try to shoot them every year.As a result, these moorlands are almost entirely devoid of wildle. Just barren deserts full of heather and nothing .And the gamekeepers burn the heather every spring – just when any songbirds might be nesting. The rest of their time is taken up shooting or trapping our most beautul and endangered birds of prey.Gamekeepers have almost wiped out our hen harriers, for example. Those moors should be teeming with le. Andthey were they’d be a much more attractive proposition for tourists – who would really bring money in to the local communities.Why do we preserve eight per cent of our land for the benefit of just . per cent of our population  Just so they can wear tweed for a day and pretend they’re Carlos The Jackal Probably end up glowing like one of those light sticks kids have on Bonfire Night. One expert reckoned that a side-effect was swelling up until you’re the size of the Kremlin.In the US, President Trump was suggesting swallowing disinfectant as a cure.

The aim of the app is to ensure people who have been in contact with a case of coronavirus, but do not know them, to be able to be tracked down and isolated in case they develop symptoms. It will log the time and distance a user has spent near to anyone, eventhey dont know them, so it can alert themnecessarythat person later tests positive for Covid-.Health Secretary Matt Hancock had pledged the ground-breaking and world-beating app would be ready by mid-May.Officials have blamed delays on the launch of the app on its ability to measure exact distances between phones. But they are now confident those glitches have been ironed out. The software works by using Bluetooth to log when another user’s smartphone has been in close proximity.A confirmed case can report their status to the app, which automatically sends out an anonymous alert to other users they may have infected urging them to self-isolate and get a free test – thus stopping further spread.Test and Trace head Baroness Dido Harding has described the app as the cherry on the cake and refused to give a date for the release of the app.But people working on the project said it is still expected to be released this year, according to Sky news. NHS England is hoping to add personal benefits to the app to help encourage people to download it. The features include Fitbit-style alerts letting people know whether they might be at risk of being infected with coronavirus. They also want to roll out check-ins at venues with QR codes, according to a person involved with the project. The QR feature would meana person went to a coffee shop and scanned to say they had been there, they could later be easily contactedthere was an outbreak. One person described the alerts to look like: We noticed you checked into Pret the other day. Theres been an outbreak, please stay inside for a couple of weeks. But this could lead to a clash with Apple, who have already denied another countrys request to add a QR feature. Officials at NHS Englands innovation unit, NHSX, believe this could get more people to download the app after a series of delays and failures. The botched app cost the taxpayer £ million.

I am proud to “confess” that I have been on two foreign holidays in the past month, utilising legal air bridges, and I am far from ashamed.The myth in coronaphobic Britain is that overseas trips are for the elite, rich and powerful: If you dare get on a plane to low infection-rate locales such as Italy or Greeceyou’re not showing solidarity to the Covid cause and risk spreading the damned virus.That rhetoric hasn’t been helped by the Government’s feeble air bridge policy, which puts any country with a region experiencing a minor outbreak at risk of being added to the quarantine list.The reality is the total opposite. If you and me are shamed into staying home now, travel WILL soon be limited to the elite, rich and powerful.The democratisation of tourism has been one of the most pleasing developments of this new millennium, with the explosion of budget airlines causing price wars and a move towards all-inclusive package deals.Yet our ability to keep seeing the world is now in real peril.Airlines are on their knees. Hotels are closing at an alarming rate. Many popular European tourist destinations remain ghost towns.Goons in the Extinction Rebellion movement have already talked weak parties including Labour into backing the introduction of more travel taxes.All for a virus that, albeit nasty, killed just a fth of the number of people who died from run-of-the-mill flu and pneumonia in the final week of July in the UK.If you’re one of the many people currently tormented over whether to take the risk and book that break, I implore you to go for it.On a practical level, both my week-long trips to Europe were pure ecstasy, with responsible and reassuring safety measures that never came close to overshadowing the glorious experience of being overseas again, something unimaginable just a couple of months ago.Yes, the airport is a little more torturous than usual and you do have to keep the mask on at all times.When I arrived on the Greek Island of Mykonos last week, I was random Covid tested at immigration, causing a touch of nervousness while I waited -hours for the result.  And you’re not going to be able to dance or listen to loud music at night.But the benefits are endless. Your favourite tourist destinations are emptier than they’ve ever been during peak season, you’ll always get into your favourite restaurant, and the staff on British Airways have never been happier to see you on board.Most importantly,more of us choose to fly now, we will help keep affordable travel and tourism viable for years to come.I was one of just three people in total in a gym this week for a pre-booked, hour-long session.When we were booted out the moment our  minutes were up, the entire fitness centre was shut for a -minute deep clean.While we should, of course, encourage cleanliness, these types of self-imposed and over-the-top rules will make it impossible for most businesses to survive long-term.A healthy dose of common sense should be required, too.THE Prince of Woke emerged from his latest multi-million pound Calornian mansion this week to preach to the world, yet again, about racism.In an online conversation with Rashad Robinson, president of US civil rights group Colour Of Change, the usual clichés and judgy mumbo jumbo were out in full force.He spoke of “acting, rather than just saying”, going to “the root of the problem” and charity being “like bringing a bucket of water to a forest fire”.But what Harry didn’t talk about was his own notorious past of racist language and cultural insensitivities.After all, this was the Duke who was forced to undergo racial sensitivity training in the Army after using the P-word to refer to an Asian soldier.And this was the Duke who wore a Nazi unorm to a friend’s birthday party.If Harry wants to help spark real change and debate, it would be much more effective for him to stop the meaningless platitudes and talk publicly in some detail about his own journey.How did he realise that using the P-word as an adult is not unacceptable in any circumstances How did he learn that larking about with a swastika around your arm as a member of the Royal Family is just plain wrong The Duke does have a valuable contribution to make about the need to stamp out everyday racism in society – one that will involve less pious preaching and more examination of his own notorious follies and foibles.LIKE Emily Maitlis, Naga Munchetty has become such a powerful BBC News presenter she believes the rules of the public service broadcaster no longer apply to her.First, the Breakfast presenter threw impartiality out the window to express a negative view about the US president Donald Trump.Now this week she has been caught pocketing cash to appear in corporate videos for the troubled car company Aston Martin.The Sun’s TV Editor Andy Halls revealed Naga didn’t follow protocol by seeking approval from her Beeb bosses and did not declare the fee she received either.That would be a sacking offence for most Beeb newsreaders.But Naga received the most minor slap on the wrist, with BBC bosses saying, “She has been reminded of the risk of conflict of interest when undergoing external engagements”.No wonder other BBC news presenters don’t want to follow the rules either.The corporation’s weak approach is asking for trouble.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It should have been a day of excitement, a day I was hoping to keep the promise I made to you four years ago at your brother Haydon’s surprise st party.That day I crossed my fingers and hid them behind my back as I smiled and said, “I promise I will not throw you a surprise birthday party on your st. We will go on holiday instead.”Leah, I had no intention of ever keeping that promise.Yes, we wanted to take you on holiday, we wanted to take you to Costa Rica for your st.But I was planning one big surprise party before we went, with family and friends all there to help celebrate.We had a meal with family for your th — that is what you wanted. You were never one to look for attention.Always trying to hide in the corner, usually attached to you phone.You like a family party, you just don’t want to be the reason it is being held.Tomorrow it is another milestone in your disappearance — you will have been missing exactly  months.On Friday, February , last year you woke about ten minutes after we left the house to go to work.You got ready for work, opened the curtains, made your bed and left the house at your usual time.CCTV caught you walking, on your phone as usual. We know you sent Snapchat streaks to friends as always. And then you vanished.Roughly  minutes after being captured on CCTV your phone was switched off and it has never been turned on or used in any way again.That is when you vanished for real. No one has seen or heard from you since. No one has found any of your belongings.That was my reality  months ago and is still the same today.We have had so many acts of kindness. Random hugs from strangers, cards through the post, messages of support on social media, food parcels from friends.One kind lady sent me a book from the US on coping strategies for grief and loss.There have been many donations of money, first for the JustGiving page to raise funds for posters, then the Missing People charity and then for the Papyrus charity after the tragic loss of your brother Haydon.Not to mention the two angelic donors of the reward money of £, and the people who paid for posters on vans and trucks.We are grateful for every act of kindness from every single person who has helped.A lady from my estate dropped flowers and a card on my doorstep, letting me know that everyone is hoping for you to be found.To believe that you ran away is a stretch of the imagination, because you were so happy at home.We had been looking at wallpaper for your room and you wanted to buy a new bed.

We will never heal from the needless and heinous pain you have caused.You have taken a kind, naive young lady who had everything to look forward to and stopped her le in her prime.You have robbed her family and friends of a caring, loving inidual. You broke her brother, Haydon, mentally.You have taken away grandchildren that we will never meet. Stopped two wedding days that we will never get the chance to plan.To lose one child is the most horrendous experience in le, one you would not wish on your worst enemy.To not know why that child is no longer with you, or eventhey are OK is torturous.To lose two children is soul-destroying.I do not know how I get up every day.

Im just hoping Leeds will let me in with these grades. Her principal Mr Britain said: Its completely unfair when students like Megan when an algorithm, some sort of standardisation process has meant she hasnt got the grades that she should have got.Yes, hopefully youll still get into the university, but its still not right that these young people havent got the correct grades.Students were left in tears after being disappointed with their results - with some even burning their letters.Abby, from Hull, admitted to breaking down after seeing her results after receiving D, D, E grades in her A-level subjects – meaning she missed both her firm and insurance university places.She told the BBC: “My future has been set back completely. I might have to wait one or two years now to go to university.“There’s been loads of people crying, not getting the results they wanted, and it’s down to something that wasn’t our choice.Lilly Keeley Watts achieved A*, A, C meaning she didnt get her place at Durham University even though she says she knows she deserved more than a C.I have called up this morning and I havent got in. I am absolutely gutted. I know our school has been hit by these science grades.On the verge of tears she told IV: I know I deserve more than a C in biology. I dont want to be big headed, but I know I would have done better than that.Its very unfair that because of past performance in this area and in my school, that I havent got in. Its heartbreaking seeing my friends upset because they havent got in because of previous results, because of what school you go to. It shouldnt determine how you can do.Abbie Cooper, an AS-level student from Cwmbran, said she was distraught after receiving two Ds and a U.The -year-old said: Last year I couldnt attend college a lot due to anxiety and mental health issues but any time I did a mock or a piece of work Id still get a D, a C or a B. The Ds that I did get had been improved to a B and a C at the end of the year, and my predicted at the end of the year was a B-B-B.I thought Id pretty much secured at least a C, but I checked my results this morning and it said U-D-D.In a snap poll run by The Student Room this morning, already close to % of students have already responded saying that their A-Level grades were worse than expected. One student commented “I honestly have a rock in my stomach, I wanna get blackout drunk and just cry right now. I got predicted a ABC and just received CCE, I got all s and s during GCSEs and didnt do well during mocks but at worst expected BCD or something like that. I cant even apply for clearing with hope.A number of parents and relatives also took to social media to vent their frustrations after seeing their family members predicted results drop.One dad, Nick Day, tweeted his dismay at his daughters results being marked down blasted: My daughter, whose predicted A-level grades were A,B,B has just been ‘awarded’ C,C,C and all of her UCAS offerstr have been withdrawn. @GavinWilliamson@BorisJohnson You are an utter disgrace and we won’t put up with this #AlevelResults.Another added: Please can someone explain to me how my god-daughter, who was predicted A, B, C, can be given B, D, U for her A-level results. Ungraded ! It’s outrageous!However, after record high grades for many, other pupils were delighted with their marks.Lorna Gauvain, , collected three A* grades at Norwich School and plans to study forensic psychology at the University of Kent starting in  after a year out.She said the results are what she was hoping for but added: For the first few months it didnt really feel like they were going to be our results.Lorna, who lives near Wroxham in Norfolk, said: I was happy and very relieved.Identical twin sisters Arianne and Enyala Banks are setting off to Oxford University together, too.Arianne will study Law with French Law at Mansfield College - while Enyala will read Materials Science at Queen’s College.A Level student James, from Brighton, is overjoyed after beating leukemia and smashing his exams.During chemotherapy he focused on academics as he was unable to play sports other than tennis. Having secured ten -s in his GCSEs, James is now celebrating outstanding A*A*A*A results . He has beaten leukemia, and plans to study Economics at Warwick University. Kids cant launch an appeal, but the schools can do it for them. And they can use their mocks to help decide on a grade after a last-minute change of plan.However, exams regulator Ofqual havent yet set out the details of how to submit these appeals - and what mocks will be valid to use.Students can also choose to sit the exam in the autumn too, and pick the best mark they have available. GIRLS beat boys in the number of pass grades achieved at A-levels and the number of kids who managed an A* or A. The number of female students achieving a pass hit . per cent this year in comparison to . per cent of boys. The gap between boys and girls has grown from  per cent in  and  to . per cent this year. More boys were given an A* with . per cent being awarded the top mark, in comparison to . per cent of girls. But overall more girls achieved either an A or A* with . per cent compared to . per cent of boys. More girls are also taking sciences - biology, chemistry or physics - at A-level, according to data from Ofqual.The number of boys dropping language subjects also fell by . per cent, while female entries in French, German or Spanish rose by . per cent.Some schools will today send out the teacher-predicted results they would have got to kids - who can then decide whether to appeal or not.Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, has been under fire for the last minute change of appeals process - which isnt yet ready for kids to use.And he refused to apologise for the standardising system which led to grade being marked down.The Cabinet minister told Sky News: If we do not have checks and balances within the the system youll have even greater unfairness.Potentially some people would take advantage of the fact that there arent checks and balances.He defended not ditching standardised grades and using teachers ones in a fiery exchange on This Morning.Mr Williamson was confronted by Christine Cunnfe, the principal of LVS Ascot.Ms Cunnfe said she had seen some of her top students downgraded by two grades as a result of the system put in place by the Government for moderating exam results in England.She urged the Education Secretary to follow the example of Scotland and abandon the system, saying students had been through enough.But he told the show:: “Well, overtime they [students] are in competition and you have to have some consistency in terms of grades. We have to be sure that we maintain standards… Not having standards, not having the same level of consistency, we’ve had some schools, for example, that have put every child in as either an A or an A* or B.”Meanwhile heads and teachers lashed out at the results today.A survey of sixth form college principals suggested the process for calculating this years A level grades is flawed and unreliable.The Sixth Form Colleges Association said that switching to grades predicted by teachers is the only way to address failure of the system.Commenting on today’s A-level results in England, Geoff Barton, General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the system was having a devastating impact on kids today.He blasted: “While there has been an overall increase in top grades, we are very concerned that this disguises a great deal of volatility among the results at school and student level.“We have received heartbreaking feedback from school leaders about grades being pulled down in a way that they feel to be utterly unfair and unfathomable. They are extremely concerned about the detrimental impact on their students.This is in terms of both the number of grades lowered, and some students’ results being pulled down by more than one grade.He said the way kids get their grades has created clear injustices.Teachers are calling on the Government to review the system as a matter of urgency but Mr Williamson has insisted there will be no more changes.Mr Barton added: “We have done everything we possibly can to support the grading process in dficult circumstances, but there is a time to say enough is enough.”Michelle Meadows from Ofqual admitted that poorer kids did have their grades pulled down more than richer ones.She said earlier today: “The research literature shows of A-level predictions for university entrance is that there is a tendency to be more generous for students of lower socio economic status.“So there will be a tendency for there to be more generosity.“The important thing is to look at the analysis for the end grades students take away – you can see there is no evidence of systematic bias.”According to UCAS, a total of , people, from the UK and overseas, have had university places confirmed - an increase of .%.Ministers have urged universities to be flexible and take into account a range of evidence when choosing which youngsters to admit to their degree courses on Thursday in the wake of coronavirus. Clare Marchant, the Chief Executive of UCAS, said that this will be a “big year for clearing” following the last-minute change to the appeals process.At least , students are expected to go into Clearing, in comparison to last year’s ,, according to Marchant.Phones have been “ringing off the hook” in the call centre at Bristol University this morning - as thousands of students attempt to secure places amid A-level grading confusion.Here are the rates for students receiving the top grades : Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Exam boards downgraded nearly two in fiveresults - amounting to some , grades, according to data by Ofqual. Teachers had predicted results for students unable to take their summer exams due to the pandemic. But many school leavers were left disappointed when their grades were lowered by a computer model designed to standardise grades. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson announced last-minute changes on Tuesday to allow pupils who want to appeal to use their mock result or sit an exam in the autumn. He is now facing calls to overhaul the system following mass downgrading of marks, and evidence showing that poorer pupils have been hardest hit. Here we take a look at the data. The poorest pupils are the most likely to see their marks downgraded Pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds were most likely to be marked down in their results. Some % of teenagers from the poorest households were predicted to get C or above by their teachers - but this fell to .% under the new moderation process - a drop of . percentage points. Pupils from middle-income backgrounds also saw their marks downgraded, from .% to .% - a fall of .%. Students from the wealthiest families fared best, as numbers awarded a C and above fell by . points during the process, from .% to %. Private schools have seen the biggest boost in top marksPupils at state schools and sixth forms colleges were more likely to lose out in the A-Levels chaos than private school children. Data from the exams watchdog shows a .% increase in A grades for independent school pupils compared to last year. State sixth forms and colleges saw an .% increase in the top marks, while the number of comprehensive pupils attaining A grades rose by %. Selective state schools saw .% increase from  and academies saw a .% rise. And surprise surprise, schools in the North lose out  In a blow to Boris Johnsonaposs levelling up agenda, schools in the North saw the lowest increases in A grades. Pupils in the North East and the North West had the smallest rises in top marks of .% and .% respectively. Schools in the East Midlands saw the biggest rise in A grades on .%, followed by London on .% and the South West on .%. The South East and Eastern region saw an increase of .% each. Schools in Yorkshire and Humber and the West Midlands reported an increase of .%. What does the exams regulator say  Dr Michelle Meadows, executive director for strategy, risk and research at Ofqual, said its analyses showed there was no evidence of systematic bias in the exam assessment model used this year. She added: Outcomes for dferent groups, whether that be by socio-economic status, ethnicity, gender, the outcomes for these groups are very similar to those in previous years. Askedthere was a relationship between social disadvantage and the moderation of exam results, she said: There was a tendency for some more generosity to be there in the predictions for students with lower socio-economic status, backgrounds. She added: There is a small effect of a greater dference between the end calculated grades and the centre assessment grades. What does the Government say   Mr Williamson insisted the Government would not be making further changes to the system - despite a similar u-turn in Scotland earlier this week. We believe that weaposve put in place - in terms of the triple lock, in terms of the actions weaposve taken - a system that is able to put its arm round those youngsters where there has been a grade that has been unfair on them and is able to put that right, he told Times Radio. He claimed that the most disadvantaged pupils would be at high risk of losing out compared to their wealthier peersexams had been delayed rather than cancelled. What do critics say  Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , demanded a review of the moderation process in England as a matter of urgency. He said: We would warn them [the Government] against simply digging in their heels, and insisting all is well. The Association of Collegeshas also called for a review of the process. We cannot stand by when the evidence suggests that many thousands of students may have missed out on their grades because of a systemic bias, said its Chief Executive David Hughes.

One of the customers at  Stories in Manchester said they were turned away for not following the venue’s dress code while another alleged they were misgendered multiple times by staff. DD London, the group that owns  Stories, has apologised for both incidents and promised to learn from the mistakes made. Jamie Rose Dee, , visited the venue with her boyfriend for drinks and said it was somewhere she had been looking forward to visiting for a while.“I’ve always had it in my mind that I wanted to go as it looked like such a nice place,” Jamie told the Manchester Evening News.  “When we got there, there was a bit of a queue outside so we just went up to the bouncer and askedthere were any tables for us to have drinks. “He just looked at me in such a negative way, cut me off speaking and pointed to the side where the queue was.” Undeterred, Jamie and her boyfriend queued up outside the venue. When they were at the front of the queue, they were approached by the same staff member who asked them to fill out a form with their contact details on. But thataposs where Jamie then said the problems continued. “When we got to the entrance, he said to me ‘can you sign here, bro ’ and it made me feel really uncomfortable, Jamie said. After I signed the form, he said ‘thanks mate’ with a real emphasis on it.” Jamie said they then walked into the venue but didn’t say anything as they didn’t want to cause a scene. However, the incident didn’t sit right with her. “As we were sitting at the bar, I started to decompress what had happened,” Jamie said. “I just couldn’t sit there and enjoy it. My boyfriend wanted to say something but I told him not to and we decided to leave. “As we walked out you could just tell that the doorman knew because he looked so guilty and quite nervous.” Upon exiting, a female member of staff askedeverything was okay and the couple informed her that the bouncer had been transphobic.Jamie, who has more than , followers on Instagram, posted about the incident shortly after on her social media.She was inundated with messages of support from her followers.  “I’ve been really feeling confident and comfortable with myself recently,” Jamie says. “I felt like I was really starting to blend in outside of Canal Street. “I put my story up in the hopes that they’d reach out to me. I feel like people don’t take these types of incidents seriously andI didn’t have a , I believe this could have quite happily been ignored. “I donapost want anyone in the LGBT+ community to go to places and spend their money where they’re not welcome.” Frustrated at the incident, Jamie’s followers started leaving comments on  Stories social media pages but she claims they were being deleted by the venue almost as soon as they were posted. The venue eventually reached out to Jamie and called her.  “I was waiting for the phone call with the tiny smidgen of hope that this was going to be resolved,” she explained. “I didn’t want anything other than confirmation that LGBT+ people are welcome there. “I had it in my head that I was going to ask them what kind of ersity training they had in place but when the manager rang me and askedit was Jamie he was speaking to, he went ‘hello sir’. “I asked him to repeat himself and he said ‘hello sir’ again. I was so angry because the whole point of the conversation was because I had been misgendered. How tone deaf can you be  “At that point, I realised an apology wasn’t going to be enough and I just put the phone down. I knew I wasn’t going to get anything.” Another customer said they felt excluded from the venue on Wednesday evening after they were told they didn’t fit the ‘dress code’. Teddy Lamb, , had visited Manchester from London with their housemates. They had booked a table at  Stories for drinks and food with the intention of having a ‘fancy dinner out’. “Normally I’d be prepared to write it off as someone just having a bad day or something I misinterpreted,” Teddy, who is non-binary, said. “But when I saw another girl have an experience, it seemed to be quite pointed and specic. “When we got to the front of the queue, the woman at the door was very nice to us but said she just needed to call down the manager. “I shrugged it off but as soon as he came down, he looked at us, shook his head and walked off. “I tried not to look into it too much, but I asked what that was about. She said we didn’t meet the dress code, but it was specically me that didn’t. “The dress code says no flip flops, sweatpants or football shirts and I definitely wasn’t wearing that - that’s not my vibe.” Teddy said they were wearing a green camo top and pink tapered trousers and that their party was ‘visibly queer’ with coloured hair and facial piercings. Teddy and their housemates went to another venue afterwards but said they didn’t stay long because the experience had ‘changed the vibe’. “It was just mortying,” Teddy added. “There was a big queue and we were just so embarrassed. “It wasn’t an expected experience in Manchester. That’s not what the city is known for.” DD London, the restaurant group that owns  Stories, apologised for the incidents and said they have launched an investigation into what happened. We are extremely sorry to hear of two incidents that occurred at  Stories last night, DD London said in a statement. This morning we have launched a full investigation both internally and with our external security team. This is not representative of our company values and it is something we are taking very seriously. Equality, ersity and inclusivity is very important to DD London and we welcome all communities into our venues across the world. These incidents have highlighted the need for us to relook at all our procedures across the group. We will be examining our own policies as a priority, both internally and externally with our suppliers. We have opened a direct dialogue with the iniduals affected – to discuss the incident, to apologise and to learn from the mistakes made. Our Chairman and CEO Des Gunewardena has spoken directly with Jamie today. They have agreed to meet to discuss educating the hospitality industry as a whole on issues relating to LGBT+ discrimination. We are committed to learning from this. Carl Austin-Behan, LGBT adviser to Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham, said he was shocked to hear about the incidents. When businesses take on external suppliers to do work for them, they need to use their due diligence, he told the M.E.N. The supply-chain needs to be upheld and brought to account on this. “I was disturbed about the comments made and I have since spoken to the people and the business involved. The way the manager spoke to Jamie on the phone was embarrassing and just wrong on every level. “This highlights the fact that people are still LGBT+-phobic in our city and when incidents like this happen, they need to be highlighted and treated with respect and dignity so that other people feel like they can report when like this happens to them.

Devastated pupils from Mulberry School for Girls in east London, have slammed the governmentaposs grading system, saying it is flawed and biased against poorer students after receiving their heartbreaking results. The school serves girls living in Poplar and Limehouse in east London - the area in the UK with the highest level of child poverty - so many of its pupils aim to educate their way out of deprivation. According to several pupils at the school, many A-level students had results downgraded leaving many scrambling to find university places as conditional offers were withdrawn. Eighteen-year-old Thamima, who lives in Tower Hamlets but attended a school in west London after winning a scholarship, said it was disappointing from a government supposed to be promoting social mobility. Local councillors said the downgrading was disgusting and that young people deserve so much better.Due to the coronavirus pandemic closing schools for months, pupils were unable to sit their exams so instead teachers submitted assessment grades , saying what they expected students to achieve. Have your grades been affected  Email us at webnews@mirror.But today exam chiefs said nearly % of students were awarded lower grades than their teachers had recommended, otherwise national results would have been implausibly high. According to several pupils at Mulberry School nearly everyone in the sixth-form had at least one subject downgraded. Abida Mostafa, , from Bow, east London, had predicted grades of A*-A*-B but instead she was given A*-A-C. She toldshe had an offer at University College London to read comparative literature provided she received her predicted grades. Luckily the university said she can keep her place but Abida said it was heartbreaking that she will never get the chance to prove she was capable of achieving the higher grades.  If I had sat the real exams I know I would have done better, she said. Almost everyone in my school has suffered at least one downgrade. I donapost understand how the government can standardise a system that was already flawed as we are already live in a disadvantaged area. Iaposm lucky as I kept my university places but others havenapost. I just will never get the chance to reflect my true A-level potential. Another A-level student at the school wasnapost so lucky. The -year-old, who wishes to be anonymous, has lost two university offers to study medicine.When the Mirror spoke to her she was trying to get through to the UCAS clearing system to find an alternative university place. She said: I am desperately trying to find somewhere  to go. This highlights how the education system is stacked against the poorest pupils as the results do not show our true abilities. The Government should have listened to our teachers, not use a standardised system that penalises the poorest.  If we had been allowed to sit our exams we would have done so much better. The Office of Qualications and Examinations Regulationadmitted .% of students had one grade knocked off, with .% of results downgraded altogether. Explaining the decision to downgrade grades, Ofqual said: Our initial analysis of the CAGs showed that they were, in general, optimisticand the combined effect would be likely to lead to overall national results that were implausibly high. If we had awarded grades based on CAGs we would have seen overall results increase by far more than we have ever seen in a single year. At A level, we would have seen the percentage of A* grades go up by  percentage points from .% of grades in  to .% of grades this year, and the percentage of grades that were B and above increase by over  percentage points from .% in  to % this year.  Eighteen-year-old Thamima who lives in Tower Hamlets did get the grades she was predicted. But she said she believes its because she studied for her A-levels at a school in West London after winning a scholarship there. So unlike her friends she will be going to the university of her choice - Oxford. She told : Almost everyone I have spoken to have had at least one subject downgraded. This is disappointing from a Government that is supposed to be promoting social mobility.

Greggs launched its Quorn sausage roll as an experiment and found it was a runaway success. That proved to be just the beginning. For me the start was in childhood. My dad, a health freak, used to go in for “nut meat” which my mum did her best to dress up by grilling to make it more palatable for my sister and me. We hated it.Fast forward a few decades and the big fast-food chains have found fake meat to be popular. Burger King’s meat-free Rebel Whopper is doing well in Europe and the UK, and McDonald’s PLTburger is on the market. Meatless burgers are on sale in all Wetherspoon pubs.

Danni Harding, from Barry, had been running a security firm after  years working on the doors of pubs across South Wales before her accident - which also saw her lose the use of her limbs. The -year-old bouncer and entrepreneur went tombstoning with friends in Pontneddfechan, Glynneath, on a boiling hot summer day in . She plunged off the highest waterfall around nine times before disaster struck - but surprisingly she was able to initially walk away, despite being in pain, before collapsing soon after.  Danni ended up requiring a catheter and several operations, reports Wales Online. The mum has decided to tell her tale as a warning to others after a -year-old boy had to be airlted to hospital by mountain rescue teams last week after leaping from the exact same spot. When I read about that lad it took me right back to when my own accident happened, she said.  It was a boiling hot day and me and a group of friends had gone up to Sgwd Gwladys to cool down - we made packed lunches, took lilos and everything. Referring to the final jump, she said: I must have hit the bottom or a rock with my backside, because straight away I knew something was very wrong. But, being as headstrong as I am, I fronted out the pain and managed to walk out of there. It wasnapost until weaposd all hiked a bit further on that the pain overcame me and I collapsed. Danni, who hit the headlines months before when she rushed to the aid of a reveller mowed down by a car outside the Cardf pub, would later discover her coccyx had snapped off and was now inverted inside her.  I couldnapost so much as sit down or go to the toilet - it was horric, she said. I had to have a catheter inserted  in me and the bag filled up with blood  - my son, who was only three at the time, is responsible for saving my le because he alerted hospital staff after Iaposd fallen on the floor in AE and started having a fit. Danni said the seizures were due to FND, or Functional Neurological Disorder, a rare medical condition she developed after the tombstoning incident. Had you talked to me about a year ago I doubt youaposd have been able to understand me, because it caused my speech to sound really addled too. Two years of my le have been ripped away from me - Iaposve lost work, had to shut down my business and even simple things like cooking a meal - which is one of my great passions - is beyond me now. Iaposve been offered a care worker but Iaposm lucky enough to have lovely neighbours who do a lot for me with regard to everyday things, although thataposs hardly ideal.    She added: Now Iaposm still awaiting three operations - all of which will leave me bedridden for long periods, along with requiring a colostomy bag for about a year.   "},{"url":null,"title":"northampton brink lockdown after 300","story":"NewsNorthampton on brink of lockdown after  MS factory staff test positive for coronavirusThe Greencore-owned factory has seen  members of staff test positive for coroanvirus amid warnings that Northampton could be placed into a local lockdown after a spike in casesShareCommentsByJack EvansJamie Hawkins:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsNorthampton could be put into lockdown after  workers at an MS sandwich factory test positive for coronavirus\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

A total of  out of , employees at the Greencore-owned factory in the town have tested positive for the virus and are self-isolating. One of those to test positive is the Bakersapos Unionaposs branch secretary for Greencore Northampton, Nicolae Macari. Mr Macari told the BBC he tested positive on August , along with his mother and father - who also work at Greencore - as well as his we. He said: When suddenly three or four people are pulled out of a line because they have tested positive, people are terried. Making sandwiches seems to be much more important than everything . In the past seven days there were  new confirmed cases in Northampton alone and the infection rate is well above the county rate with  cases per , population. Leader of Northamptonshire County Council Jonathan Nunn said: We were a while ago stood at a fork in the road. Letaposs hope we have taken that road away from a local lockdown although we have to say at this stage it is not certain.  We can see the impact of all the hard that business and residents are doing but it is still up for grabs and it could go either way. Iaposd reiterate personal responsibility. In some areas we are regulated. When we go to a shop they insist we wear a mask. At work we are probably well organised. It is what we do outside of those. It is car sharing, it is going on a bus and taking your mask off. One particular thing we are keen people to engage with is track and trace. If you go into a hospitality establishment,they do not ask you for their personal details, which will enable them to alert you later,they do not ask, they have little care for you and your loved ones. If they do ask you and you resist, well actually it is you who is showing a lack of are for your loved ones.  It is still within our grasp to avoid local lockdown but we have got to keep the pressure up. Iaposm afraid we have to keep our foot on the gas and keep going. We have to continue all these initiatives. Whatever you have heard is a good precaution, just keep doing it now. Greencore has responded to the outbreak by saying it is doing everything it can to keep colleagues safe. A spokesman said: As a result of the rising number of Covid cases in the Northampton area, we took the decision to start proactively testing all of the colleagues at our Northampton site.

Punters and pub staff at The Hope Inn in Stockport heard a booming crack that sounded like a aposbullwhipapos as a blinding flash lit up the boozer. The bolt fried sockets and brewing equipment, set off alarms and left everyone inside apostinglingapos from the shock blast during last nightaposs thunderstorms, and left its landlords devastated. Brewer Martin Wood said he smelt sulphur and realised he had just experienced the second lightning strike of his letime - and lived to tell the tale. He said: Iaposm obviously relieved no one was hurt and the building didnapost catch fire, but at the same time Iaposm thinking - whataposs going on with   I thought it couldnapost get any worse. Then we got hit by lightning. We were just trying to get back to some kind of normality, like, and this happens. Lightning struck the road right next to the path he was been walking on when he was a paperboy of about . Reminded of the phrase aposlightning doesnapost strike twiceapos, the stunned pub owner laughed: Clearly it does. He and landlady and partner Chloe Walshaw have spent the day frantically trying to get the pub back in order after the bolt fried electrical equipment, knocked out their phone lines and destroyed vital brewing equipment. Ms Walshawaposs two-year-old daughter Emily was at her dadaposs when the lightning struck. She would normally have been sleeping upstairs in their flat above the pub. I felt so lucky it didnapost strike while Emily was home, her mum said.  The bolt rattled staff and customers and frightened the daylights out of the coupleaposs English bulldogs, Harvey and Waffle, who also live above the pub. The couple have owned The Hope Inn for seven years and had only just reopened as Englandaposs coronavirus lockdown eased on July . They had gotten through with multiple award-winning brewer Mr Woodaposs mini-kegs. But the couple had been desperate to get back up and running when they finally welcomed customers back just weeks ago. But around .pm last night, dramatic storms that chased out the heatwave and sent thunderclaps booming over northern England arrived over The Hope Inn.   The thunderclaps had been getting louder as Ms Walshaw was downstairs in the pub, and Mr Wood was upstairs in the flat. Ms Walshaw recalled: There were a lot of thunder and big flashes of light, and we were all sort of like aposthereaposs the thunderstorm again.apos There was a few that sounded louder, and we thought apositaposs getting really close.apos Suddenly a blinding flash and thunderclap lit up the pub.  The next thing we knew there was this massive sound - honestly one of the loudest things Iaposve ever heard - it sounded like a bull-whip in your eardrums. I was shaking. One of the customersapos hands was shaking and he said he could feel the electrical current moving through him. Ms Walshaw said she stood stock-still for seconds, fearful anything she touched would electrocute her. The people that were downstairs with me felt this sort of tingling sensation throughout our whole bodies.  Meanwhile, Mr Wood upstairs in the flat heard the aposbangapos and smelled sulphur, instantly transporting his memory back to a narrow miss as a lad. I was young and on my paper round and lightning hit the path I was walking on. There was a really strong smell of sulphur and a very bright flash and where it hit on the road it left this black mark. The bolt set all of the pubaposs alarms ringing, and Mr Wood rushed downstairs to find his partner and all the punters safe.  But fearing a fire or another strike, the couple ushered everyone out before checking for a blaze. Mr Wood had to smashed the pealing alarmaposs housing to turn it off. Nothing caught fire, but they found sockets fried and blackened, the phone lines, CCTV, WiFi, Sky box and a laptop were zapped, and Mr Woodaposs brewing equipment has blown out. They have spent today rushing to save the brew, as the equipment used to ferment and control temperatures is destroyed and the pub still reeks of sulpur.

Lauren OaposConnor, , was shopping at the Staines supermarket branch when she says a staff member approached her and told her to pull down her T-shirt over her shorts. Despite temperatures reaching a scorching C as she shopped yesterday, the PR manager said the member of staff went on to tell her a complaint had been made about her outfit. Taking to Twitter in anger over the incident, Lauren said: I am so angry right now. Just been approached by a @sansburys staff member in Staines store to apospull my t shirt downapos. An elderly man made comment to staff member who felt compelled to come and and tell me as I was shopping. What do you think of this story  Let us know in the comments Itaposs  degrees. If I want to wear shorts I will. Lauren went on to share a picture of her outfit which comprised of a pair of casual jersey pink shorts and a green and white striped T-shirt. With the image, she added a message reading: For reference, this is my outfit. All I wanted was ice lollies and I get shamed in store doing so. So disappointed.

One said: Thataposs disgusting. Why do people love giving their unwarranted opinions . Another jokingly wrote: aposPlease tell me you pulled your shirt all the way down from neckline to waist. Speaking to FEMAIL, Lauren said she was humiliated by the incident that occurred as she popped into the shop to buy ice lollies for her mother to cool down in the searing heat.

Figures from the COVID Symptom Study app suggest Halton in Cheshire is now the worst-affected place - overtaking Blackburn as the number one hotspot. After analysing data, experts believe that Dumfries and Galloway, Thurrock, St Helens, Middlesbrough, Blackpool and Lancashire have emerged as areas of concern. All six have been added to the appaposs watchlist, which also includes Tameside, Halton, Bolton and Blackburn with Darwen.In Halton, one in  people are thought to have symptomatic coronavirus.St Helens has a rate of .%, while third-placed Blackpool has .%, nearly one in  people. It is estimated that there are , new infections per day, with , currently ill with symptomatic coronavirus. The app was developed by Kingaposs College London, with data based on , swab tests done between July  and August . But scientists say there are encouraging signs from the figures, suggesting the outbreak is contained. They believe the UK is not experiencing a second wave - because some areas are still feeling the effects of the first. Although most of the affected areas are in the North of England, Thurrock in Essex and Dumfries and Galloway in Scotland have both appeared on the list for the first time.  Nevertheless, scientists are hopeful that outbreaks appear to be contained. Tim Spector, Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at Kingaposs College London, said:“It’s encouraging to see that the numbers are coming down slightly across the UK and that the isolated outbreaks in the North of England appear to be well contained so far. This is further confirmation that we aren’t at the beginning of a second wave and rather, still trying to end the first.

He insists the man pointing the finger at his jailed client is unreliable. German prosecutors have claimed Brueckner, , who is a convicted rapist and paedophile, is their prime suspect for Madeleine’s disappearance. The three year old girl was abducted from her holiday apartment in Portugal in . Last month search teams in Germany spent two days digging up his former garden allotment near Hanover. The prosecutors have said they believe Madeleine is dead but don’t have enough evidence to charge Brueckner. But his lawyer, Friedrich Fulscher, believes the informant who claims Brueckner confessed his guilt to him in a bar, may have done so purely to get help from detectives. The witness is thought to have told detectives that the German drter, that he knew what had happened to Madeleine. Mr Fulscher believes the informant may later, in , have got early release from a sentence he was serving in a foreign country.  Mr Fulscher told Martin Brunt from Sky News: “If this is the same person, I think it’s the worst witness you can get. “A human who has spent his whole le cheating people for his own benefit is never a reliable witness.” Brueckner, serving time for drug offences, is currently being held in isolation in prison amid fears he could be targeted by other inmates. The prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters said this week that he would not let the investigation drt on and would announce any decision to drop it.  But Mr Fulscher said such a development would be too late for his client’s reputation. He said many people would always blame him for Madeleine’s disappearance. He said: “If you pee in the same place long enough it will stink. And that’s definitely what’s happening in the Christian B case. “He won’t be able to lead a normal le at any point, without being recognised and facing hostility. “A prosecutor who goes publicknows that. He can destroy a reputation and it was taken very lightly in this case.” Brueckner was flagged up as a potential suspect as early as  but nothing came of it. Four years later in , he emerged as the main suspect when an informant told police that he’d confessed his involvement during a chat in a bar.  But the lawyer claims he revealed the alleged confession because he needed help himself from detectives. Mr Fulscher also said that just because Christian B’s phone was logged at the Ocean Club apartments where Madeleine was taken didn’t mean he was responsible. He admits he is “no innocent lamb” but he has served his punishment and deserves to have a chance to be “part of society again”. Brueckner is currently in jail in Kiel and is eligible for parole after serving  months of a  month sentence for drug trafficking. His lawyer Friedrich Fulscher has filed a request with authorities demanding his release. His lawyer said: “He is  hours a day, isolated in a seven square metre cell. “ He said that he is segregated because he is in danger of being attacked, physically and verbally, by fellow inmates.

As things currently stand they cannot squirt out more than . gallons a minute, which is the equivalent of five and a half large bottles of Fanta. The Trump administration is calling for this to change however, arguing that the limit should apply to each nozzle rather than the overall fixture. The Department of Energy proposed the changes on Wednesday, the month after Trump made his opinions on shower nozzles clear. So showerheads - you take a shower, the water doesnapost come out, he said at the White House. You want to wash your hands, the water doesnapost come out. So what do you do  You just stand there longer or you take a shower longer  Because my hair - I donapost know about you, but it has to be perfect. Perfect. As much as the Presidentaposs bouffant is important to him, it is further down othersapos agendas. Andrew deLaski, the executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, said the proposals were “silly” and could result in enough gushing water to flood a bathroom. Last December, Trump said environmental regulators were looking at sinks, faucets and toilets to revise rules meant to conserve water and fuel that heats it. People are flushing toilets  times,  times, as opposed to once, Trump told a meeting of small business leaders at the White House. Consumer groups decried the plan, saying current rules saved consumers money by conserving water and fuel.  The proposal would effectively allow shower fixtures to include multiple shower heads that would get around the . gallonper minute standard Congress set in , when Trumpaposs fellow Republican George H.W. Bush was president. The Energy Department also proposed easier standards on clothes washers.

The charity provides shelter and resources to families while their children receive treatment at a nearby hospital.

These details are uncorroborated, partially because CPD also claims there is no body camera footage available for this interaction, the group said. At least  police officers have been injured in the riots and around m property damage has been caused. Several videos posted to social media showed large mobs breaking windows and entering stores along the Magnicent Mile, State Street and parts of the Gold Coast neighborhood, South Loop and Near North Sides.As thousands of people went on a looting spree, the city authorities raised bridges leading to the downtown area and halted public transportation.

However, she later found out her sister had pre-approved her mumaposs speech - and was left wishing she had done the same.

The gang is said to have preyed on British and Irish tourists on holiday in Spain. Investigators estimate that the gangaposs leaders were raking in a shocking £.m a year from their nefarious activities. The astonishing figures came to light after  alleged members were arrested in the Majorcan capital Palma on Tuesday. The gang, which often used children in echoes of Charles Dickens’ fictional Oliver Fagin-led operation, has been described locally as Europe’s main pickpocketing gang. They are said to have been operating in Majorca for several years, with many members allegedly travelling to the sunshine island every summer specically to take advantage of the rich pickings. The pickpockets are said to have swiped items from tourists while they were distracted, or left their mobile phone and bag unattended, and are also accused of shoplting. Email us about your holiday experiences at webtravel@trinitymirror The  people arrested are expected to face charges of theft and money laundering as well as membership of a criminal organisation. The group was set to appear in court today. Police made no official comment in the aftermath of the operation, which began around am on Tuesday and targeted a hostel in El Arenal east of the Majorcan capital Palma as well as a sex club and several private apartments. Bu they confirmed the huge scale of the alleged criminal operation - describing it as a military-style organisation to maximise profits. A spokesman for the National Police in Majorca said: “Their objectives were mainly tourists who holidayed in Majorca. “A total of  people have been arrested and  European Arrest warrants are going to be issued.  “Police were alerted by a rise in the number of complaints from victims who reported wallets, rucksacks, bank cards and mobile phones had been taken in areas like Palma’s old town and near the cathedral, Andratx port, and Bellver Castle. “The suspects tried to make sure the value of the objects they took never exceeded € and avoided violence and intimidation so as to ensure they always received the most lenient punishment possible under Spanish law. “Minors were sometimes used to carry out the crimes.  “The alleged authors formed part of a well-structured, hierarchical gang. “All its suspected members are Romanian. They were operating in several European countries.” Revealing how the criminals would meet up every morning in areas near hotels to “plan their day”, the spokesman added: “They would disguise themselves as tourists, with maps, and would familiarise themselves with the timetables of buses, ferries, and visiting hours for places like tourist monuments, and work until they stole the amount of money they had set themselves as a target.

It was a wee bit early for him this evening but he is improving all the time.“We hope he comes back into things for the weekend.”There was also encouraging news regarding Jamie Robson, who was involved in a terrible head clash with Hibs player Paul McGinn.Mellon added: “He took a nasty head knock in what was a really honest challenge.“Common sense has to prevail there. Why would he want to knock himself out going for header “He came off the worst but he is all right and we have good medical people here.“We will make sure he is well looked after.”Central defender Ryan Edwards, who made his debut, came off with what looked like a hamstring injury but Mellon was upbeat, saying: “He is all right. That’s the problem when you bring in players who are a bit behind in their match fitness.”Dundee United fans# group warns jobs could be lost nationwideScottish football shuts down\" title\"#Dundee United fans# group warns jobs could be lost nationwideScottish football shuts down# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp fears-for-livelihoods--scottish-football-shutdown-after-coronavirus-rule-breaches embed # secretfSEMzreV\" data-secret\"fSEMzreV\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I thought I had discovered it like some sort of palaeontologist.#Connor#s dad Craig added: #If I remember correctly a sperm whale beached sometime in  between Monieth and Barry Buddon and was then buried.#It looks to me like this is the skull of the whale, exposed now the sand has been washed away.#It was the stench that initially drew our attention and our pup was far too interested.#The whale#s remains have caused issues in the past, with some in the area complaining of the smell.One resident described it as #a real heavy smell of decay and rotten flesh.#A spokesman for Angus Council said: #We are aware and will be attending tomorrow to make further investigation and take any action as appropriate.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Covid is still present and it will spread really rapidlygiven an opportunity#.The Scottish Government estimates around  people were infectious with the virus last week, a signicant drop from recent months.Ms Sturgeon said it was important to keep the R number in perspective but it served nevertheless as a #further reminder of the fragility of our position, and of the need for all of us to do all of the things that are required to keep the virus under control#.A total of  cases has been identied in Grampian since July  and  cases have so far been linked to the Aberdeen outbreak associated with pubs and other nearby venues, with  close contacts being identied.The NHS Grampian area accounted for  of the  new confirmed cases in Scotland overnight, taking the total to ,, with three being attributed to Orkney and  being linked to NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.Ms Sturgeon said such outbreaks are #inevitable” and the public #should become more used to hearing about several dferent clusters because the virus hasn#t gone away#.The first minister also spoke of her concern over house parties, warning they could pose “considerable risk” in spreading coronavirus.Ms Sturgeon said test and protect data had flagged up house parties as a particular problem and she did not want to be in the position of having to introduce tighter restrictions on indoor gatherings.#I can’t make this point strongly enough, these rules should not be seen as optional, they are absolutely vital,# she said. #In many respects, they are the most important part of our first line of defence.“What people do within their own houses is harder for any enforcement action to work against, so more than ever it relies on the good sense and judgement of all of us.”Current guidance states no more than eight people from a maximum of three households should meet indoors and they must stay two metres apart.Ms Sturgeon said: #I make a really strong appeal today, particularly to young people # let me stress again, I#m not trying to single out young people or blame young people. I just understand the things that young people with a bit more freedom now, as we have started come out of lockdown, want to do. Please, take great care. House parties really are not sensible things to do right now.”No new deaths of people who tested positive for coronavirus in the past  days were reported, meaning the total remains at ,.Ms Sturgeon said there are  people in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-, a decrease of seven in  hours.Of these patients, three were in intensive care, no change from Wednesday.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July .

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society. Now that it is realised how our inidual decision making makes a dference, whatever our age, we have no need to feel helpless.It is time to ask for the information and support we need."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures july 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSimon Macdonald from Kilmichael Glassary submitted this week#s featured image.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy. Teaching children the beauty of the outdoors and how to care for it can bring a lelong love for natureyou love something you usually wish to protect it.And learning never stops for any of us. Sometimes it is the basics that are needed before we move on to the complexities of natural navigation or learning our stars.So for this month here is one tip : learn how to go to the toilet in the outdoors!Doing this responsibly and teaching your children makes for a lelong enjoyment of walking and exploring without the bane of wondering where the next toilet is.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotland"},{"url":null,"title":"creative writing how to begin","story":"Kenneth StevenUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe last few months have been a dficult and unsettling time. But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

I#d thought with it being near a pre-historic site they might say no, but he thought it sounded great. I was a bit taken aback. The forestry people were also up for it and all of a sudden it was all go,# said Gabi.Weather depending, it should take  days from start to finish. The first job is to clear brambles and other trip hazards before the lime washing can be applied.Dr Aaron Watson from Kilmartin Museum will be documenting the project.Gabi continued: #When I was researching what to white the stumps with I knew I wanted to use something traditional to Scotland that would not contaminate the place. Limewash is used to paint houses here. Then I discovered it creates crystals. Rockart was made using quartz # they would peck at rocks with it to make their marks. I liked the link. It was a good coincidence.#The shape will change depending on where it is seen from. As visitors walk towards it, it will be like an oval but once at the rockart site it will look like a circle.To follow Ormaig Landart Project follow these links:  Instagram: @gstuckemeier"},{"url":null,"title":"rest and be thankful diversion route to close for second night","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFor the second night running the old military road ersion route at the Rest and be Thankful will close.Met Office weather warnings for thunderstorms mean that the route, which runs below the landslide-hit A trunk road, will close overnight again from pm on Tuesday August  as a safety precaution.The local ersion route closed during the hours of darkness on Monday night due to forecast heavy rain, re-opening around am on Tuesday.All traffic will be erted from pm on to the standard ersion route via the A, A, A and A.

I think it was Michael Gove who said, Your example gives us hope. And she instantly responded and said, We dont want your hope, we want clear, cost-effective but very radical policy responses to the climate change.

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to. Going for a walk is a great way to start the day.\"RoutineIt is only natural that during lockdown many of us have found that we have lost our routine and have been staying up later and lying in bed

and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you

of cometary dust - producing up to  meteors every hour.If skies are clear, the display of celestial fireworks should be visible across the UK from about midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather forecasts."},{"url":null,"title":"confident-borders-schools-safe-says-council-chief","story":"THE leader of Scottish Borders Council says she has \"every confidence\" that schools have been made safe

financial dficulty, with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic being the final nail in the coffin.Staff will be made redundant, with the exception of the groundskeeper who will be retained until the estate is sold.Margot Swanston, who has visited Netherurd for  years as a guide and leader, described herself as ldquodevastated.The stunning Georgian mansion and its extensive grounds have served

increased dramatically this year with COVID-.ldquoEven before the pandemic came along, Girlguiding was planning to set up a digital hub to provide training online, and whilst we know the value of being together, volunteers across Scotland are finding the online or local training options more convenient in terms of both time and money.ldquoWe had hoped to build external business for mid-week, especially schools, but we were unable to build a wide enough business base to rely on this.ldquoEach year we have tried other avenues including holidays for Trefoil groups, retreats for local churches, private family gatherings and occasional weddings, but overall we could not generate enough routine business to help us improve the finances.ldquoThis was the situation before we were forced

Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.There are right and wrong ways to store your food. For example, some food must be refrigerated while other types need to be kept at room temperature.Some cooking oils are fine on the countertop, and others should be stored in the fridge.Even some of your expired foods arenrsquot really expired, and you might be using the wrong containers. With food storage at a premium, you dont want to let anything go to waste.Wersquove done the legwork to figure out the right ways to store your food so that it tastes best and lasts the longest.Here are the answers to ten common kitchen storage mistakes.. Youre throwing out your lsquoexpiredrsquo foodCertain expiration dates have less to do with safety than they do quality. Credit: Getty   FangXiaNuoItrsquos important to know the dference between food that has passed the lsquoBest Beforersquo date and food that has passed the lsquoUse byrsquo date. You should never eat food that has passed its lsquoUse byrsquo date, but lsquoBest Beforersquo dates often reflect quality control, not safety or nutritional value. In determiningthe food that has passed the lsquoBest Beforersquo is safe to eat read up on Food Standards Agency guidelines, use your eyes and nose, and follow your gut.Smell:If it smells fine and it was stored properly, its likely okay to eat.Sight:Donrsquot let your eyes fool you when it comes to fresh food like produce. Bumps or bruises donrsquot mean something is ruined.Dont can the cans:Canned goods can last for decades. Even a can thats started to rust should still be okay, as long as it isnt bulging and the seal is intact.Check the packaging, use your senses, cook food thoroughly, and donrsquot let the perfect become the enemy of the good. A proper understanding of expirationdates could drastically cut down on food wastemdashnot to mention wasted money out of your pocket.. Youre using plastic wrap to save your leftoversBees Wrap can be used to store anything from biscuits to sandwiches. But not soup... yet.

Surprised . You dont know how to store your cooking oilsSome cooking oils are best stored in the cabinet, while others can be refrigerated. Credit: Getty   Angelina ZinovievaCooking oils sourced from fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds each have dferent storage needs. Exposure to oxygen, light or heat will subject oil to oxidation, eventually turning it rancid. While some cooking oils can be stored at room temperature, others do best when stored in the fridge.Corn and rapeseed oils:These do just fine stored in a cool, dark cabinet, or you can refrigerate themit takes more than a year to get through a bottle.Olive oil:Leaving olive oil out on the counter or a table, especiallythe bottle gets direct sunlight, or storing it on or near a stove are surefire ways to turn it rancid quickly. Place it in the coolest, darkest place in your home or use a smaller glass bottle in the kitchen.Peanut oil:Can be kept for as long as two yearsstored tightly capped and away from heat and light. Keeping peanut oil in the fridge may extend shelf le even further.Coconut oil:Very stable andhas a shelf le of two years or more.Avocado, grapeseed, hazelnut, sesame, truffle, walnut, safflower and sunflower:Delicate oils that are especially prone to rancidity, especiallyexposed to too much light or heat. Refrigerating after opening is recommended. Kept cold, these oils will remain viable for six months or more.. Youre using the wrong containers to store your foodWe tested the best-selling plastic and glass food storage containers on the market to find the best of the lot. We dropped them onto a linoleum floor, froze them, microwaved them, stained them, pried them apart, stacked them back together, and lots more.Best glass container:Pyrexs Cook and Eat Glass Storage Setisa great choice. Food wont leak, and the glass wont shatter. While the BPA-free lids maystain, they will come clean after a run in the dishwasher. Therersquos a vent for microwave reheats and, as long as the contents are defrosted, itrsquos also preheated oven safe.Best plastic container:Rubbermaidrsquos Easy Find Lidscontainers wonrsquot spring a leak unless you shake them violently, and drops arenrsquot a problem unless the container happens to fall on its side or a corner. No plastic container is oven-safe, but the set is marked dishwasher- and microwave-safe and carries a letime warranty. You should avoid freezing this set, as expanding food may pop the lid.. Youre incorrectly storing fruits and veggiesDo you know which vegetables should stay at room temperature, which should be kept inside a salad drawer, and which should never be stored together  Are you sure Do not refrigerate:Potatoes, onions, garlic, winter squash, tomatoes, bananas, peaches, plums, avocados, mangoes, melons, apples, pears, kiwis, and citrus. Exceptions include freezing for smoothies, or refrigerating for brief periods when theyre close to spoiling.Keep separate:Produce that emits high levels of ethylene gas, including ripe bananas, apples, stone fruit , cantaloupe, honeydew melons, mangoes, pears, ripe kiwis, tomatoes, onions, and leeks.Store alone:Ethylene-sensitive produce, including aubergine, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, caullower, cucumber, leafy greens, peas, peppers, squash, sweet potatoes, strawberries, and watermelon.,params: .push. Youre letting your avocados turn brownThere are many ways to store a cut avocado, but only one that will actually keep it from browning and preserve the flavour: Leave the pit in an avocado, and tightly wrap the half in plastic wrap to keep the flavour and texture intact.. Youre letting the food in your fridge accidentally freezeFoods in your fridge shouldnt be freezing. Credit: Getty   IssaurinkoBiting into frozen food thatrsquos merely supposed to be refrigerated isnrsquot just annoying: Freezing can completely alter the taste and texture of your food. And itrsquos probably because yoursquore probably arranging your fridge the wrong way.Check your fridges temperature settings:The ideal temperature range for the interior of your fridge is degC and below.Determine problem areas:According to appliance manufacturer GE, the most common problem areas are the top shelf, the bottom of the fridge , and door shelves.Avoid vents:Most fridges have a cooling vent above the top shelf. This is where most of the cold air comes from, so keeping food away from here may prevent freezing. Adjust your freezer:Turn up your freezer temperature settings, but nothing north of degF, which will facilitate bacterial growth and accelerate food spoilage.Check your ice maker:Make sure that your ice maker is not constantly running. This could make your freezer too cold and subsequently cause your refrigerated foods to freeze.Stock up your fridge:Refrigerators need to be well-stocked to absorb all of the cold air being vented into the cavity. If it is relatively empty, all of the cold air will sink to the bottom of the cavity and freeze your food. A fully stocked fridge will help maintain temperatures and, as a result, use less energy.. Youre not fixing a door that wont shut properlyIf your fridge door wont close, its probably due to an old, dried-out gasket, the rubber seal that runs along its edge. Luckily, the fix is simple: wash the gasket, and apply petroleum jelly to the rubber to revitalize the old rubber.. Youre not regulating your fridges temperatureA full fridge will help keep the temperature consistent. Credit: Getty   Group StudioDid you know your fridge could actually be making you sick  To keep food out of what the Food Saftey Agency calls lsquothe danger zonersquo, it needs to remain below degC. The freezer should be set to -degC to keep freezer burn at bay. If your fridge and freezer are regularly warmer than those temperatures, yoursquore risking faster spoilage. Here are a few things you can do to keep your fridge properly chilled:Invest in a fridge thermometer.To use, place the thermometer in a cup of water. Why  Your refrigerator measures the temperature of the air around your food, but you want to simulate the temperature inside your foods. Check the thermometer after  hours and then, adjust the temperature of each appliance based on the results.Check to make sure the gasket is in good shape, and seals well.If you can open the door with one finger, your seal isnt tight enough. A leaky seal is an energy waster, and may be a risk to your food.Dust your refrigerators cooling coils,theyre visible. You can use a long, skinny brush made for this purpose.Cover your food.For example, leave eggs in their carton, not in the door.Keep a full fridgeto retain the cold, but leave enough room for air to circulate.The product experts at Reviewedhave all your shopping needs covered.

midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather

by these redundancies but there is no denying itrsquos a worrying indication for the future of this historic racecourse.ldquoWe believe that Chester havenrsquot explored all possible options to protect the employment of the existing workforce, including the use of the Government furlough scheme until its deadline, and this looks like the easy option rather than the right thing to do for the long-term.ldquoWe struggle to see how Musselburghrsquos five-star status can be sustainedsome of the workers who help make it what it is are losing their livelihoods, and it poses questions of the Chester management over their vision for the future of this course.Musselburgh Racecourse was run jointly by East Lothian Council and Lothians Racing Syndicate for more than a decade under the Musselburgh Joint Racing Committee.However, issues within the committee led to the British Horseracing Authority demanding an independent inquiry into its governance, which revealed a toxic relationship had developed between the two parties.The council set up Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash a new governance body ndash to oversee it as it sought a third-party operator to take over the management of the course.Staff at the racecourse at that point became council employees.When Chester took over on June , they transferred to the company.Mr Farnsworth said that the course finances had been hit by lockdown and, even when racing resumed behind closed doors, it was with no spectators or hospitality.He said: ldquoIt would be inappropriate to comment on the details but, like every racecourse in the country, we are having to review operational costs across the business in light of the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThe reality is that since we resumed racing behind closed doors on June , we are a racecourse which is now racing again but without spectators, without hospitality revenues and with reduced sponsorship and media rights income.ldquoThe racecourse is unable to carry on as normal.ldquoLike every other business, be it in the sports, leisure, tourism, retail, professional services or industrial sectors, we are having to review everything we do in order to have a sustainable business, so that we can recover from the coronavirus pandemic.Kenny MacAskill, East Lothian MP, described the redundancies as ldquodeeply concerning.He said: ldquoThe change of ownership was meant to secure the course and the jobs, not threaten them.ldquoThese are dficult times but staff have maintained a marvellous facility before and during the crisis.ldquoThey are entitled to be treated better.ldquoIrsquoll be seeking assurances from the new management."},{"url":null,"title":"patrols-carried-human-waste-left-campers","story":"Problems surrounding irresponsible

year for students because of the coronavirus pandemic and teachers were asked to submit expected grades for each senior pupil based on prelim results and course work.However, the Scottish Qualications Authorityreviewed the submissions and using a lsquostatistical modelrsquo, which took into account the historic exam performances of schools, downgraded thousands of submitted grades, causing a national outrage.In East Lothian, , pupils received some grades which had been marked down.Only  of the , young people who were due to sit SQA exams had any of their final grades increased.The results dropped through letterboxes last Tuesday and sparked a furious backlash from students who received lower grades than expected.Erin Campbell, , Member of the Scottish Youth Parliamentfor Musselburgh, said many friends had been left worried and scared after the initial results came out, warning that the fiasco had been ldquobad for their mental health.Erin, who was a sixth-year student at Musselburgh Grammar School, said: ldquoOn a personal level, I was lucky to receive the results that I needed in order to move on to university however, I am aware of a lot of young people, including close friends, who were left scared and worried after not receiving a conditional offer to uni that was reliant on these results.ldquoThis badly impacted their mental health, particularly during the period of uncertainty before [Education Secretary] John Swinneyrsquos announcement [on Tuesday].Student protests were held in Glasgow and Edinburgh and politicians piled on pressure for the Scottish Government to step in and overturn the results.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray, Labourrsquos education spokesperson, called on Mr Swinney to resign after he initially backed the modied results before bending under pressure and telling the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday the Scottish Government had got it wrong.Mr Swinney said it was ldquodeeply regrettable we got this wrong and ordered the SQA to amend awards which had been marked down back to the submitted grade provided by teachers and reissue them.Mr Gray said Mr Swinney had spent five days defending the results before changing his position on Tuesday, asking him: ldquoWhy did he defend the results of this moderation for five days  Why did he leave these young people twisting in the wind for a week, hopes and aspirations in shreds Speaking after the decision, Mr Gray said: ldquoGiven the scale of the exam results scandal, it was inevitable that many local students would have been affected. I have certainly had a number of young people and parents contacting me over the last week to express their concerns about their grades being adjusted down by the SQA and the impact it might have on their futures.ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos u-turn will bring relief to these worried young people and their families as they will now see their estimated results reinstated.ldquoHowever, the fact remains they should not have had to experience this worry and uncertainty in the first place. The Education Secretary has let them down and should be held accountable for this fiasco.Schools in East Lothian were yesterdaycontacting pupils who had been affected to let them know they would receive new awards.Across the county, , grades were submitted to the SQA for pupils at the end of May across National , Higher and Advanced Higher level by their teachers.In total, , were acceptedwith  adjusted upand ,adjusted down.In terms of pupils who were due to sit the exams, the council said just over  per cent saw at least one grade marked down.Councillor Shamin Akhtar , cabinet spokesperson for education and childrenrsquos services, said: ldquoIrsquom delighted that John Swinney has finally decided to do the right thing for pupils on the exam results fiasco.ldquoYoung people have faced a very tough and stressful time already and this is something they should never have had to go through.ldquoSchool staff worked extremely hard to submit grades for their pupils to the SQA and the adjustments undermined their professional judgement.ldquoThis u-turn is a victory for young people who have led the campaign against the unfair results and should be commended for standing up for their rights.And Councillor Craig Hoy , a member of East Lothianrsquos education committee, said: ldquoI am delighted that grades have been restored to hardworking pupils in East Lothian who faced huge uncertainty over the last week for no good reason.ldquoEveryone can see that John Swinney has presided over a litany of failures, any one of which could have been a resignation issue on its own.ldquoThe SNP defended their appalling grading system to the hilt, even after it became clear that pupils, parents and teachers had no confidence in the system.On Monday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon issued an apology to students across the country who had been marked down by the SQA.She said: ldquoOur concern, which was to make sure the grades young people got were as valid as in any other year, perhaps led us to think too much about the overall system and not enough about the inidual pupil.ldquoThat has meant too many students feel they have lost out on grades they should have had, and that that has happened not as a result of anything they have done but a statistical model or algorithm.ldquoDespite our best intentions, I do acknowledge that we did not get this right and I am sorry.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council welcomed the u-turn, adding: ldquoThroughout this process our schools have sought to represent the academic achievements of our young people in a way that provided a fair and accurate reflection of attainment using the guidance and methodology provided by the SQA.ldquoThe announcement by the Education Secretary will be welcomed by young people who saw their results downgraded, and by our teachers and schools who used their professional judgement when providing grade estimates.East Lothian MP Kenny MacAskillpledged his support to headteachers in a letter at the end of last week after the original results came out.He said: ldquoI welcome the Scottish Governmentrsquos announcement.ldquoAs I said last week in a letter to East Lothianrsquos headteachers, I believe the people best placed to know about pupils are those overseeing and working alongside them during their academic journeys.ldquoThis decision is the right one, and I want to send my congratulations to all students in East Lothian for the work they have achieved both before and during this pandemic, as well as a huge thanks to the teachers and school support staff who have worked so hard over the last few months."},{"url":null,"title":"betrayal-claim-mcdonalds-musselburgh-recommended-approval","story":"In a letter to the Courier, Fraser McAllister hit out at their ldquoillogical recommendation which,approved by councillors at an online meeting next week, would grant permission for a restaurant to be created in the car park of the Tesco store off Olivebank Road.He claimed that the drive-thru, which would operate  hours a day, seven days a week, would be ldquonext to the most congested roundabout in the county.The former SNP councillor for Musselburgh West said: ldquoTragically,  local objectors and , petitioners have less value than the share value of these gigantic corporations.He called on councillors on the planning committee, which will debate the proposal on Tuesday, to halt the ldquobetrayal.Mr McAllister also lodged a formal objection, citing a range of concerns including traffic congestion, pollution, litter, obesity, residential amenity and economic damage.He claimed: ldquoThe custom predicted for this -hour McDonaldrsquos drive-thru and the intensity of the declared deliveries needed to service it are on an industrial scale. The impact on Olivebank Road would be truly calamitous.The plan will go before a lsquovirtualrsquo meeting of the planning committee after being called off the delegated list by ward councillor Stuart Currie because of the level of local concern.He said: ldquoI have called this application off the list to ensure that all the concerns raised by local residents are discussed and elected members can understand not only the strength of feeling but also the planning issues that exist as a result of this application.Musselburgh  Inveresk Community Council has lodged an objection, citing traffic congestion, emissions, and the facilityrsquos close proximity to local schools as concerns.A public campaign lsquoNo McDonaldrsquos in Musselburghrsquo was also launched in a bid to halt the plan, highlighting concerns such as increased traffic congestion, litter and air pollution.The planning report stated that there were  written representations to the application and, of these,  were objections.It said: ldquoThe councilrsquos road services advise they accept the conclusions of the traffic network modelling exercise, that the traffic impact associated with the proposed development would be minimal and there would be no adverse impact on the operation of the local highway network.ldquoMany written objections are made on the grounds of the proximity of the proposed drive-thru restaurant to Musselburgh Grammar School, and that such a facility promotes unhealthy eating and thus would lead to harmful health consequences.ldquoThe East Lothian Local Development Plan  does not contain any policies restricting the location of drive-thru restaurant facilities to a certain distance from schools, or any other educational establishments. Nor does it contain any policies relating to unhealthy eating or the health consequences of proposed developments. Thus, and in the absence of national guidance on health consequences of proposed developments, no signicant weight can be given to these matters.The report added: ldquoOn the matter of air quality, the public health and environmental protection officer advised that the proposed development was anticipated to result in up to  customer vehicles visiting the premises daily, which was a signicant number of additional vehicles given the proximity of site to the Air Quality Management Areaon Musselburgh High Street.The officer agreed with the conclusion of McDonaldrsquos Air Quality Assessment that impacts upon air quality at ldquosensitive receptors would not be signicant. The officer advised that, whilst it was acknowledged that additional traffic would have an impact upon queuing and reduce traffic speeds, the composition of the increased traffic would be from passenger cars, which are less polluting than HGVs and buses.The officer concluded that the proposed development would have ldquono harmful impact on air quality nor on the objectives of the AQMA and would not harm the amenity of the area.A McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWe look forward to progressing with this application and believe a new McDonaldrsquos would bring signicant investment to the local community, as well as create at least  new jobs.A supporting statement from the company added: ldquoThere are few restaurants in the country who can claim to have made so many positive changes to support healthier lestyles. McDonaldrsquos believe that the lessons they have learned in making these changes can be used to support a wider drive to reduce obesity.Planners are recommending the plan be approved with a number of conditions, including submission of litter and pest management plans.A council spokesperson declined to comment, saying the planning committee would consider the application next week."},{"url":null,"title":"wavegarden-scotland-surf-resort-takes-step-closer-reality----looks-unreal","story":"Artists drawings of the plans for Wavegarden Scotland show the extent of the project - which is hoped to create  jobs and generate up to poundmillion for the local economy every year.The visitor attraction is planned for the disused Craigpark Quarry near Ratho on the outskirts of Edinburgh.Artist impressions for the food and retail hubsThe project will involve the installation of underwater technology that can create , waves per hour, from slow moving white water for beginners through to powerful barrels up to two metres high for experts.Yesterday, the teams developer confirmed it had been backed by planners to include a food and retail hub, as well as glamping pods for accommodation.Tartan Leisure Ltd, developers of Scotlandrsquos first articial surf park, Wavegarden Scotland, received planning permission today.

Emma Donoghue wrote this startling and extraordinary novel before the coronavirus pandemic hit ndash but it couldnt be more prescient. The Pull Of The Stars takes place across three days in , where on a makesht, thoroughly understaffed maternity ward in Dublin, Nurse Julia Power is trying to support pregnant women through labour, while Spanish Influenza goes about its insidious, fatal work. Eerie comparisons with Covid asideJulias observations on the odds pregnant women in poverty already face, and the havoc wreaked on their bodies from having too many children, too young, is devastating - and fascinating - to read.Donoghue deftly weaves in politics, policy, the impact of war, feminism, violence and the minutiae of changing bed pans and sterilising instruments, while dealing with dismissive male doctors and birthing babies. And thats all alongside the awful things happening in Irish convents and childrens homes. But throughout, the pragmatic, thoughtful Julia keeps the overwhelming darkness shes tackling, in abeyance - just about. A powerful, persistent, highly detailed and incredibly moving book that speaks through time. Donoghue is an absolute marvel of a writer.Ella WalkerMiss Bensons BeetleRachel JoyceDoubleday, priced pound.

My Darling From The Lions is the debut collection from poet Rachel Long. Founder of the Octavia Poetry Collective for Womxn of Colour, Long focuses on womens experiences, race and heritage, all intertwined in the recurring mot of hair and wigs, used in the title of one of the collections three sections - A Lineage of Wigs. The collection also covers relationships, religion, family and school, skilfully highlighting the tension between the latter when describing day-long hair styling in Jail Letter: \"Mum, my scalp burns!

Gravel gardens can make it look like a beach,\" says Cha Gold medallist Perkins, whose  Facebook show garden Growing The Future will be displayed at next years show.\"You could do worse than put down four or five inches of gravel, and many seaside plants would be happy growing in it. If you have poor drainage or heavy soil, build up a gravel layer, adding sand or soil to add nutrients.:Letters: When it comes to language, lets live and let live\"A lot of coastal plants will be perfectly happy growing into that layer and many of them dont need much soil, andthey do, like sea kale, they will have a deep tap root which theyll send down to stabilise themselves.\"\"Treat your seaside garden like an alpine garden,\" says Talbot. \"You want free-draining soil, which you can build up like a rockery or clf face, incorporating shorter grasses like carex or small miscanthus, to give you the feel of the wispy grasses along the edge of the shoreline.\"Pick suitable plants\"If you like the spartan look, you could make a gravel garden planted with rivers of thyme, dwarf myrtle bushes and some evening primrose coming through it.\"Stock up on free-draining species\"Other good plants to create a sea feel would include santolinas, lavenders, silver-leaf plants and some sea poppies, which need to be planted in a very free-draining, gritty soil, with a good sand and compost mix because they dont like being in a very fertile garden. Known as the horned poppy, these perennials have lemon flowers and large, bean-like seed heads,\" continues Talbot.:Herald Diary: Getting to grips with a Titanic struggle\"Thrtis another good choice and comes in colours from white to darkish red. You can buy any of the Ballerina Series in the alpine section of a local nursery.\" She also recommends sea holly , sedums, artemisia and mallows.For border colour, you could go with acanthus, euphorbias, Phlomis russelianaand valerian , erigeronand low-growing herbs such as thyme, lavender and rosemary, Perkins suggests.Add seaside accessories\"Create a small area with some shingle and put some posts on the side, with a rope link between them or some firemens buckets or tyres or rings which could be painted red to resemble lebuoys, or get some glass fishermens jars. You might be able to get hold of some crayfish or lobster baskets, which give an area a nice seaside feel,\" Talbot advises.\"Thick ropes, which you often see tying a boat to a mooring, are a great accessory. You can get a garden-sized boat and plant that up, putting it on a small shingle bed, with alpine grit over the top to finish.\"Display beach finds carefullyPerkins says you have to be careful when putting shells or drtwood youve found on beach-combing walks on display at random points in the garden. \"Instead of dotting things around, make a display cabinet of perhaps a series of shells, which makes sense of them being there.\"Create a beach-inspired social spot\"For me, being on the beach is about getting together in the evening and relaxed social gatherings, so I would think about fire pits, deck chairs and that sort of low-slung seating you can really relax into. Fire pits are great, whether you choose gas or wood fire,\" Perkins observes.Hammocks and outdoor bean bags could also be added to create that beach feel, he suggests."},{"url":null,"title":"travel-royal-family-retreats-scotland-every-year","story":"Travel: This is why the Royal Family retreats to Scotland every yearUndated Handout Photo of the Morrone Birkwood trail.

WARNING: This picture must only be used to accompany PA Feature TRAVEL Braemar.The Aberdeen-born poet and writer, whose face now adorns the Scottish pound note, made it her les quest to find the \"essential nature\" of the Cairngorms. In the process of exploring its graceful, gleaming rivers and high plateaus \"as delectable as honey\", she discovered a lot about herself too.Twice the size of the Lake District, East Scotlands Cairngorms National Park is a wilderness area of crisp, clear lochs, ancient forests and glens bristling with vibrant purple heather. Promising calm, quiet and the freedom of space, it seemed an obvious choice for a post-lockdown adventure with my mum, Gabriella.Aged over  and recovering from heart surgery, my mum had been shielding since March. Im not a fan of Zoom or FaceTime, so when we met at Heathrow airport to catch our flight to Aberdeen, it was the first time Id seen her in four months.In a world where every move seems to be dominated by Covid-, the decision to travel isnt an easy one to make at any age. But as days disappear and months march on, theres an urgency to get moving. Ive never really understood why time accelerates with age. The harder we grip, the more it slips away. Maybe its the realisation that everything is finite, including us.Then there was the risk of being indefinitely confined by anxiety.\"If I dont go out soon, Ill never have the confidence,\" my mum confessed.So, armed with face masks, sanitiser and a sensible degree of caution, we refused to be beaten by fear.Nan chose to camp her way around the Cairngorms. But weve opted for a greater degree of comfort at the Fe Arms, a regal Victorian property in the village of Braemar on the banks of the River Clunie, matched in magnicence to its surrounding mountain landscape.After having our temperatures checked, were ushered inside by the hotels welcoming ghillies who apologise profusely for the impersonality of Perspex  on reception, visors and the absence of Fes bespoke tartan blankets in rooms.Scotland only recently emerged from lockdown on July , and the hotel Is quickly adapting to a new and unfamiliar way of working. Rooms are deep cleaned between guests, breakfast buffets have been ditched in favour of timed sittings, and a one-way system is in place throughout the property.Otherwise, it all feels refreshingly normal.Owned by art dealers Iwan and Manuela Wirth , who breathed new le into its rundown shell and re-opened in , the Fe is filled with , artworks, antiques and collectables.When youve been indoors for so long, everything has a new and shiny appeal. But here in this Disneyland of culture and creativity, my mum has the wide-eyed wonder of a child embracing infinity and beyond.Paying homage to Braemars Victorian roots, furnishings reflect the grandeur of that time: an ornately carved walnut wood fireplace depicting works by Scottish poet Robert Burns dominates the reception chairs upholstered in Liberty fabrics decorate the drawing room and natural history specimens are displayed in curiosity cabinets, or used to create whimsical tableaux in bell jars. Not to everyones modern PC tastes, one corridor alone has  pieces of taxidermy, upstaged only by an eery waxwork model of Queen Victoria in the library, purchased from Madame Tussauds.If a wall of stags heads is isive, modern artworks incorporating antlers are pleasingly palatable: hanging above the main staircase, Richard Jacksons Red Deer Chandelier is a tangle of neon bagpipe drones and glass antlers.From outspoken sculptures to understated sketches, every corner of the Fe is covered in conversation-provoking art.Works by Picasso, Brueghel The Younger and Man Ray hang on walls one of Louise Bourgeois bronze spiders straddles the courtyard. But an even more impressive find are some watercolours of royal estates painted by Prince Charles and a sketch by Queen Victoria of a stag shot by her close confidant John Brown.Braemars relationship with royalty reaches back to  when Prince Albert purchased Balmoral Estate for his sovereign we. \"She was passionate about this place,\" Katy Fennema of Braemar Highland Experience tells me. The former musician, whose family have  years of history in the area, now runs local history, wilderness and wildle tours with her husband, Julian.During a morning driving tour, she shares tales of brigands hung from tree boughs, and delights in stories of Chanels fashion rival Elsa Schiaparelli, who became fascinated with Braemar when her friend, Vogue editor Frances Lovell Oldham, married a laird. The two ladies would literally go on to paint parts of the town shocking pink, and an art deco bar at the Fe is named after Elsa.Much of the land here has been shaped by aristocracy. Patchworks of charred heather on the hillside are the remnants of controlled burns, used to boost a grouse population in time for shoots.Yet so much remains wild. Along the Queens Drive walking trail, trees are laden with tufty beards of lichen, an indicator of the airs purity.At .am one morning, mum and I ramble through the Morrone Birkwood, a relic of deciduous woodland that once covered the Cairngorms. On the way up, we watch hares and red squirrels scamper through a stadium used to host the Braemar Gathering, one of the most popular Highland Games. And we detour past the house where Robert Louis Stephenson spent a miserable, rainy three months in , emerging with the first  chapters of Treasure Island.Its a very dferent scene today. Sunlight splinters through gate pickets as we clamber onto a trail scattered with pinecones. Streams trickle melodically from the mountainside and the scent of honeysuckle is dizzying.Juniper, blaeberries, meadowsweet and yarrow - so many plants thrive in this healthy environment. Later in the day, herbalist and forager Natasha Lloyd introduces us to her open-air medicine cabinet. She recommends treatments for my mums liver, and I learn how to eat a raw nettle without getting stung. The common nettle is packed with Vitamin D, which may boost the immune system against respiratory viruses such as Covid-.Fortunately, there were no cases of coronavirus in Braemar. Although one famous figure down the road made headlines: Prince Charles self-isolated at Balmoral when he fell ill at the beginning of lockdown.Its easy to see why the royals come here to escape and recuperate. This month, the Queen will arrive for her annual summer holiday. We follow one of her favourite trails through the Ballochbuie Forest, a protected tract of -year-old pines saved from felling by Queen Victoria, leading to the Honka Hut - a simple cabin where Elizabeth II likes to picnic.In the past, hikers claim to have \"run-into\" Her Royal Highness walking the corgis, but blissfully, we dont see a soul.It was silence and solitude that guided Nan Shepherd into the mountains. Similarly, it helps my mum readjust to an outside world fraught with complications, but beautul at its core.How to plan your tripRooms at the Fe Arms start from poundin a Croft Room.

Independenceis a prerequisite for so many desirable changes.Mary McCabe, Glasgow G.MARK Smith concludes that by concentrating on combating the pandemic, Nicola Sturgeon has a strategy that has made both independence and her party more popular. This is a two-fold issue. The first is that polling had independence rising in popularity before the pandemic struck. The second might bolster Mr Smiths case, but as a mirror image.It is British nationalists who have continued to push the constitution as their main concern in Scotland, with a parade of little-known politicians now wandering round our country, eulogising the virtues of a Union, even while forcefully removing Scotland out of another union that had all the positives they extol. That might go some way to explaining their unpopularity in this country. We will have an election in , where British nationalism will be represented by two politicians, one who will be a peer by then and one still an MP, both of whom refuse to consider that Scots should have a say in their own future. Their policy will be apparently guided by an Australian who is being invited into interfering in the Scottish democratic process. Mr Smith should see this as a problem of British, not Scottish nationalism, because that is what it is.GR Weir, Ochiltree.ANDY Maciverproposing the formation of a new Scottish political party talks a lot about social democracy and social democratic ideology but signally fails to attempt a definition of what these old, hackneyed phrases actually mean. If we can infer that he means a free market system tempered by light-touch state interference in social and economic affairs he has to explain why, in the two biggest crises of this century, the financial collapse of  and the current pandemic, social democratic models have been set aside in favour of massive state assistance and bail-outs.I am certain that many of the New Labour politicians who oversaw economic meltdown and shameful wars in the first decade of the century would have happily understood themselves as \"social democrats\". This shameful record may explain why the Scottish urban working class, as Mr Maciver describes it, has deserted Labour.Reading Mr Macivers article closely gives a further clue to his thinking, politics as a career, not politics based on deeply held principles, this all too often has been a trait of \"social democratic\" politicians.Brian Harvey, Hamilton."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-comes-language-live-let-live","story":"I suspect there are myriad instances of misuse of language in all its multiple genres or categories.

While the Scottish Government, which is ultimately responsible for safeguarding public health, has a major role to play, I believe businesses are better placed to make things happen and to do so far more quickly.The best way forward should involve a new approach with business taking the lead to implement greater safety measures with the support of government and other public sector bodies.This will start with business owners and managers stepping up and being more proactive in ensuring they operate within a safer framework to stop the spread of this virus. As well as providing a clean and safe environment for their customers at all times, they will also need to consider implementing other creative measures and better utilising existing technology.We are already seeing a number of examples of this across the globe where businesses are driving forward on-the-ground initiatives to reduce the risk of a further lockdown. Restaurants in Kinsale, in County Cork, Ireland have, for example, begun testing the temperatures of all their customers upon entry. Meanwhile Tourism Portugal has introduced ldquoSafe  Clean certication which enables participating hotels to provide the reassurance they have undertaken the appropriate level of disinfecting and have made hand sanitiser available to guests throughout their stay. Even McDonaldrsquos has gone beyond government guidelines by making the wearing of masks mandatory for all customers entering any of their , US restaurants.While businesses in Aberdeen and throughout Scotland should be taking the lead in bringing new and effective measures to fruition, the support of the Scottish Government will be essential as well as beneficial. Agencies including Scottish Enterprise, where we have made initial representations on this issue, could provide grants and other support measures.

We await the Governmentrsquos response. This week Labour also called for the licensing of grouse shooting after a big increase in the illegal killing of birds during the lockdown.But in Scotland, Irsquom afraid, the signs of progress are not good. For a start, the Werritty report was based on the flawed premise that driven grouse shooting can be made acceptable. Werritty was explicitly looking for ways in which grouse moors could continue to be a part of the economy instead of questioning whether Scotlandrsquos countryside should tolerate a business that harms the countryside ndash through the burning of heather, for example.The reportrsquos conclusion on licensing also ended up being rather limp because the group that led the report was ided, which meant the compromise of suggesting a licensing systemthere is no improvement in bird of prey populations. Which gives the Scottish Government a get-out: wersquore waiting, theyrsquoll say, to seetherersquos been an improvement hellip still waiting hellip still waiting. The Government has also shown a lack of urgency in responding to Werritty. It does not look good.There are also serious question marks over whether licensing will work. First off, the people who are illegally killing birds of prey are unlikely to be deterred by a licensing systemtheyrsquore not deterred by the law as it stands Scotland for more than  years.Therersquos also a danger thatan ineffective licensing system will be introduced and then everything will just carry on as normal. I spoke to the conservationist Mark Avery about this recently and his view was that the whole idea of licensing depended on how robust the system was a weak one would pretty much allow the wildle criminals to carry on regardless.Some people in the shooting community feel theyrsquore being unfairly singled out over this. I remember speaking to one guy who runs a training school for gundogs who said he was frustrated that certain ways of killing animals ndash fishing for example ndash were seen as socially acceptable whereas shooting had a stigma attached to it. A farrier also told me that at least shooting enthusiasts are being honest about killing animals ndash townies on the other hand will happily tuck into burgers and fish and chips and yet judge people for shooting birds or deer.In some ways, I can see where the country sports enthusiasts are coming from on that one ndash for most of us, grouse shooting is a weird and distant practice and maybe that makes it easier to support moves to control it. But fishing doesnrsquot involve killing every other species in the water, whereas the ideal grouse moor from the point of view of landowners and gamekeepers is one thatrsquos devoid of any predator, which leads to predator control on a mass scale ndash legal and illegal.That is the key to the problem: a model that is effectively based on the killing of birds of prey. Perhaps licensing can do something to improve it. I hope so. Perhaps the Government will support licensing. I hope for that too. But it may be that it all rests on a simple question. Mark Thomas of the RSPB said this week that most of the bird of prey deaths theyrsquod seen during lockdown were linked in some way to shooting. So the question is: will licensing change the behaviour of those people  Or do we have to go further and ban driven grouse shooting completely Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

This is not true but we are currently experiencing a constant bombardment of the SNPs mantra with little air-time given to the opposition viewpoint.We are in danger of losing our way and having independence foisted upon us with all the rather unpleasant consequences that the SNP, with Green support, are happy to sweep under the carpet. Independence must be demonstrably earned over a long time period, with most of the problems ironed out by a competent government and with the support of the vast majority of Scots and not simply rushed whilst a few polls appear favourable.Keeping Mr Swinney in office is a bad start.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.I MAKE no comment on the suitability of the current Education Secretary as it is blindingly obvious he has neither the competence nor the stature to hold this or any other post in government.That he is probably no worse than the majority of other ministers, especially health, says all there needs to be said about this administration ...

Reading that, I wondered what parallel universe I have been living in since .Later in the same article, he touches upon the SNP Governmentrsquos record and mentions only a few areas where it has fallen short and concedes that \"we are not the envy of the world\".

Secondly, he produces a set of statistics which accurately show how far the UKs NHS is falling behind its OECD equivalents, and somehow implies that the Scottish Government is equally responsible for that.

Please would someone call Amnesty International Ian Forbes, Glasgow G.THERE is an interesting contrast in apparent attitudes to taking responsibility between Fiona Robertson, Head of SQA and Leslie Evans, boss of our civil service. Ms Robertson has been willing to take the  on her own to defend her agencys position that, unmoderated, this years results would have been unfeasibly higher than the previous years: an attitude for which she courageously offered no apology . Her problem may well be that the model employed was crude in terms of statistical theory and practice, as one of your recent correspondents has helpfully pointed out, but that doesnt take away from the principle thatthe numberslook wrong, they probably are. Criticism of her and her staff should be balanced by that and by recognition that this was never going to be an easy job.Leslie Evans , in contrast, seems to be doing everything possible to avoid recognising that a hash was made of a relatively straightforward disciplinary process, which likely was or should have been set down in the Scottish Governments code of working practices . All this to the extent that anyone with any knowledge of the judicial review process would have backed Alex Salmond for a winner. The inquiry chairman is to be congratulated for demanding clear and personal answers from Ms Evans.Brian Chrystal, Edinburgh EH.JUST who is the Scottish Government  Your reportage of the Holyrood inquiry into the Alex Salmond debacle continually links ldquothe Scottish Government with behaviour likely to obstruct the investigators getting access to facts related to the original botched probe into the alleged behaviour of the former First Minister. However, the name that persistently crops up is that of a civil servant rather than one of a minister or elected or list MSP.I would have thought that a civil servant, as the name implies, is neither a member of nor part of a government but an inidual in a supporting structure charged to carry out the instructions of the sitting executive.It is important in view of the upcoming Scottish elections that there is clarity in just who is not being completely cooperative with the current investigators is it the civil service or is it the SNP administration.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.ROSEMARY Goring says that the Prime Minister is coming to Scotland again because he wants to save the Union . But does he Consider this his parliamentary majority of  must be in danger, judging by his calamitous approval ratings, and the fact that Labour now has a credible leader.So might he not welcome the chance to lose  non-Tory seats before the next General Election, thus improving his chances of winning He may lead the Conservative and Unionist Party, but he has already jettisoned the support of the Northern Ireland Unionist faction, whence comes the \"Unionist\" part of the party name, with his border in the Irish Sea to finalise the EU withdrawal agreement. Might he find it even easier to let Scotland secede, taking its troublesome non-Tory MPs out of the House of Commons  The six Tories would be collateral damage but a price worth paying.Also, by dint of the border and the dependence of the vast majority of Scottish exports upon English ports, he could still keep Scotland on a tight rein.In the meantime we face the prospect of a disrupted food supply due to the forthcoming Brexit shambles.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

The rest were reduced by a single grade and she has missed out on As in English, Biology and Modern Studies, as well as a C in Higher Chemistry.Eva said to have her grades knocked down so signicantly has made her “completely reconsider her career path”.Exams were cancelled this year because of Covid- and replaced with estimated grades based on past attainment, and the school’s previous exam record.The modelling system adapted by the Scottish Qualications Authority reduced the grades of around , results, with analysis suggesting youngsters from poorer backgrounds and historically poorer performing schools suffered disproportionately.In her letter, shared almost , times on Twitter, Eva said that “it was clear” that her grades had been signicantly adjusted “because I go to a school classed as underperforming”.Her letter calls for the system, which she describes as discriminatory, to be urgently investigated, adding: “The government has been pushing the ‘no wrong path slogan’ but why should pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and deprived areas be forced into a pathway they didn’t want and worked tirelessly to avoid”.Eva had been predicted in her fourth year to achieve  As and two Cs at national five level, but in her exams she improved to come out with five As and a B.She added that her school’s recent performance had been affected by staff shortages.She had stayed behind after school for extra tuition, aiming to secure a university place and a career in the field of medicine.“Any further efforts by pupils to achieve higher grades in schools which have historically underperformed has been disregarded, she added.“SQA results this year have been more about fitting the statistical trends than the inidual pupil.”According to the Scottish Government#s own statistics, the estimated . per cent of most deprived pupils who would have expected an A-C band at Higher was lowered to . per cent by the SQA#s moderation system. By contrast, for the least deprived pupils, the predicted . per cent for A-C grades was lowered to . per cent.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday that it would not be “credible” to have accepted the high pass rates as recommended by teachers.The First Minister and education secretary John Swinney both urged pupils to appealthey feel they have been treated unfairly.Both Highland Council and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar have said overall pass rates in the region were up on the previous year"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Shieling-on-Barvas-River-I-F-Grant-Collection-Edinburgh-Central-Library-2-scaled.jpg","title":"digging where we stand memories from the airigh shieling for a post covid new","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineOur hyper-globalised, high-octane way of le was stopped in its tracks in a matter of weeks, and many of us found ourselves confined to our local communities, with a great deal of spare time on our hands.The TaD team have – fortunately – been able to continue working from home, and over these past few months I have been lucky enough to have conversations with some of our contributors and their families, speaking about recordings from the past, but naturally reflecting on those times and comparing them with the situation we find ourselves in today.One conversation of note was with a relative of a contributor who was recorded in the early s., the ethnologist and previous TaD columnist, Mairi MacFadyen, referred to Alastair McIntosh’s idea that we should ‘dig where we stand’ in order to find meaning and to regain a ‘sense of place’.Mairi then explains: “The idea is that by researching and learning about our own history and the place we are living, we – as iniduals and as groups – can regain some control over the understanding of our lives and our inter-connectedness..”, or the shieling. – the seasonal moving of livestock and people, still practiced today in many parts of the world including the mountainous regions of Norway, Alpine and sub-Alpine Europe, and the Pyrenees.In the Highlands, the practice was widespread until the early to mid-th century when much of the moorland on which the communites had their shielings were claimed by the landowners and used for sheep runs, and for hunting., where the contributors are well aware of the custom of going to the shieling in their parents’ and grandparents’ generation... # of the sheep.Historically, this allowed the unenclosed crops in the township to grow undisturbed, and it allowed the livestock to take advantage of the superior seasonal grazing on the hills.. – the first day of may.The flitting took a lot of effort, but it was also a time full of excitement, for man and beast:., including cats for hunting the rats, but according to Donald MacDonald, dogs were not taken to the àirigh.On the first day the men would prepare the shieling huts, and the women would prepare a meal for everyone who had helped with the move, before leaving the children and younger women once everything was prepared.In Lewis the people stayed at the àirigh until the beginning of August., and they would come home at the weekends to go to church, often bringing fresh milk with them.. recited here in  by the Rev.

Both creations have been made by the hands of very talented local Cullybackey people.Shellinghill Park in Cullybackey has for some time been the focus of the ‘CCP In Bloom’ team. Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing!

After the devastation caused by the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, , British and Commonwealth troops were posted to Japan to help support the US occupation and reconstruction effort.Among them was Tom Clarke from Ballymena and his daughter Sandra gave theaccess to her collection of photographs of her father and spoke about his memories to mark this sombre anniversary.Sandra, who lives in the village of Lundin Links on the coast of Fe, still keeps in contact with her old friends locally via social media.“Dad was born to Joseph and Jeannie Clarke nee woodcock at Clonavon Place. “He must have been a character in his earky years because he ran away to Belfast at  to try and join the RAF, but he said they gave him a good kick in the backside and and sent him home,” laughs Sandra.SELECTIONEventually Tom met the selection criteria and joined the RAF, subsequently being posted as groundcrew to the Far East where he served in Burma, India and Japan. “My dad was fiercely, proud of his time in RAF. He valued the comradeship and the friends he made during times of hardship far away from home. “I suppose that’s why he took so much interest in the Burma Star Association in later years. He could talk with people who’d been out in the South East Asia theatre and who had experienced similar things.”When Tom was quizzed by his prooud daughter about his role in the war he often preferred to joke about his experiences.“I asked my dad how many planes he had shot down but I remember him saying the closest he got to flying, was laying in bottom of flat bellied boat going into Hong Kong harbour! “Lots of servicemen ended up with bad illnesses out in the Far East and Dad was no exception.“I remember him telling me how he suddenly took sick in the street. He had to throw up and it was then that his  teeth came out and fell into the stream of filthy water which was running down the alley.“He had to chase after them and give them a rinse off - he was never going to get replacments in India during the war!” But it was in the immediate aftermath of the conflict that Tom became one of a very small number of British servicemen to be posted to the Japanese mainland to help with the clean-up of the devastated cities.With the prospect of terrible losses in any military invasion of Japan, the decision had been taken to unleash the Atomic Bombs in a bid to force the Japanese into surrender. The United States detonated two nuclear weapons over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August  and , , respectively, with the consent of the United Kingdom. The two bombings killed between , and , people and remain the only uses of nuclear weapons in armed conflict.Tom received a medal for working in the zones but rarely talked about the more distressing experiences. “He would just say that the whole city had been wiped out. He - and no-one  - had ever seen anthing like it,” says Sandra. “You can only imagine the kind of things he saw.”In later years, Sandra remembers her father’s breathing problems.“My dad was a chronic asthmatic and I remember, after he died, a woman came to see me. They were trying to seethere was any link about ex-servicemen with chest problems and whether it was related to working in areas,that were contaminated after the bomb.“My dad had his normal medals then years later he got the Southeast Asia Medal and I believe he was was the only member in Ireland to hold it“As a wee girl about , I can remember people in the house, were discussing what they would like to inherit.“I wanted my dad’s medals. He was very proud of me taking an interest so he made it his job looking to see any medals he should have had. So he always used to phone me saying I’ve got you another medal - he actually got another  medals,which were commemorative only.”Sandra looked set to follow in her father’s footsteps but her initial attempt ended in failure!“ I asked at  for my dad to sign my papers to join WRAF, but he refused, only for me to join QARANC  years later.” Sandra’s memories of her father also revolve around musicianship.“I asked him one day what would you like to be remembered for and he said his love of music. “He played the trumpet all his le and was in the Silver Band with his brothers Joe and James and their cousins the Woodcocks.“He had a little dance band in the early s ,I remember them playing in the green hut down Harryville Park.”Footnote: Japan surrendered to the Allies on August , six days after the Soviet Unions declaration of war and the bombing of Nagasaki. The Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender on September  in Tokyo Bay, which effectively ended World War II.

These have been in the following council areas: Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council , Ards and North Down Borough Council , Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council , Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council , Mid and East Antrim Borough Council , and Newry, Mourne and Down District Council .In addition, there have been  clusters across Northern Ireland with fewer than five people.These figures are up to pm on th August . Cases in a smaller cluster may also be associated with a larger cluster, for example a common geographic location or common social setting.The PHA will be publishing cluster data on a weekly basis each Thursday until further notice.A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period.Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings. COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters.The PHA’s Contact Tracing Servicecontinues to engage successfully with the vast majority of identied contacts and provide appropriate advice to help prevent any onward spread.Over the week up to pm on th August , the number of positive tests reported to the CTS was  – the number of positive cases requiring contact tracing was . There were  positive cases that completed contact tracing, and  contacts identied. There were  contacts successfully contacted and advised. [see Notes to Editors for further explanation of these figures]Since July, the average number of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing.Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe.“Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app.“This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts.“Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters.Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings.“Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner.Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful.“We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.”Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible. For further information on the virus, its symptoms and how to book a test, visit www.pha.site coronavirusWe must be aware that COVID- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading.If you receive a positive test result you will be contacted by the PHA’s Contact Tracing Service from .Members of the public are also encouraged to download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app on Android or Apple, which complements the work of the Contact Tracing Service.

Ulster Unionist education spokesman Robbie Butler called on Mr Weir and his department to sort the situation out as a matter of urgency.Regrettably, this A-levels results day has been a nightmare for some, he said.Whilst many students will be happy with their results, some have been left devastated.

In a statement Mr Weir said his aim has always been to support a full timeto classrooms for all pupils where appropriate.“This latest guidance takes into account the Executive’s agreement of August  that the requirement for strict social distancing between children may be relaxed in the presence of other mitigations,” Mr Weir said.“In many ways, it reinforces practices we have all become accustomed to, promoting regular hygiene practices on arrival at schools and throughout the school day, and the application of the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ principles.”He added that the current social distancing guidance of two metres must be followed between adults in the education sector.Read More Belfast Royal Academy tells pupils they must wear masks Teachers# union urges NI schools to make face coverings compulsoryThe guidance is part of the Restart Programme, which was developed by the Department of Education, school leaders and key partners.Engagement with managing authorities, trade unions and sectoral support bodies has also been in place since March and will continue.Minister Weir continued: “I have at all times recognised the stresses felt by teachers, parents and pupils due to the ongoing disruption and uncertainty regarding the future. “That is why I would urge all in our society to continue to play their part in addressing the challenges posed by Covid-.”This includes keeping students away from schools with any Covid- symptoms including a high temperature, persistent cough or a loss of smell or tasteMinister Weir said that in circumstances where strict social distancing is not possible, measures like the use of “protective bubbles,” decreased interaction and movement around schools must be followed.He said this flexible approach had been a success in other countries and would allow the maximum opportunity for face-to-face teaching, but that the advice would remain “agile” to reflect public health advice.Dr Patrick Roach, NASUWT’s General Secretary, commented: “It is entirely unfair and unrealistic to expect schools to be able to respond effectively to this guidance with just one week before they are due to open fully to all students.“Given the commitment to reopen schools fully for the start of the autumn term, Ministers must now commit the resources that will be needed to enable schools to implement the guidance and to reopen safely.” He added that employers must ensure that the health and safety of pupils and staff remained “paramount”.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNASUWT’s Justin McCamphill FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNASUWT’s Justin McCamphillJustin McCamphill, NASUWT National Official for Northern Ireland, said: “It is now abundantly clear that ing without the guarantee of social distancing will increase workload burdens for school principals and teachers. Without social distancing schools will have to implement more mitigating measures not fewer.“The NASUWT reminds schools that they must consult with NASUWT school representatives in developing reopening plans while ensuring that these plans do not erode teachers’ contractual conditions.“The NASUWT will monitor the situation closely in every school. The Union has written to every employing authority, advising them of their legal obligations to their employees, reserving our members’ legal rights and entitlements and setting out the actions we expect them to take to safeguard the health and welfare of staff.”Belfast Most ReadBrexit will lead to united Ireland in  years, says Sinn Fein#s O#NeillShock as BBC NI axes popular traffic and travel bulletins #out of the blue#Coronavirus Northern Ireland: R number rises to . as A Level results controversy rumbles onBelfast bonfire disorder: Images released in police appealA Level results: Northern Ireland#s students and principals #shocked and angered# as exams board lowers % of grades,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

PACEMAKER BELFAST   FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPupils at St Dominics Grammar in west Belfast turn up for their A Level results. PACEMAKER BELFAST  August   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailWith over  years of teaching experience and  years as principal, this was one of the most upsetting results days I have experienced.After arriving in school on Wednesday excited about downloading the A-level results, this quickly turned to upset when I had seen how many pupils’ grades were marked down at A-level.I was expecting, as St Kevin’s College was ranked as the highest performing non-selective school in  and second highest non-selective school in , that this year’s A-level results would follow the student cohort pattern from when these pupils were doing GCSEs one or two years ago. But no — approximately % of Year  A-level pupils had A-levels downgraded with the CCEA Exam Board. The picture with other exam boards was better than this, down slightly. It was with a heavy heart that I awoke this morning to release grades and speak to pupils and parents.Normally I take delight chatting with pupils and parents on results day and congratulating them, but not this year.I was consoling them and offering a shoulder to cry on and a possible hope of an appeal to help their well-being and mental health, with the knowledge that this could take weeks and months to sort out —ever.In all my years as principal I have never had to deal with so many upset pupils and parents as this year.I understand this is a very dficult process to estimate A-level and GCSE grades with the Covid- outbreak.But why ask teachers to spend days and weeks examining past pupil work, holding standardisation meetings online and socially distanced in school and entering marks for the majority of the teacher predictions to be downgraded as we did in our school and most schools across Northern Ireland It is not all doom and gloom - the vast majority of our pupils have got their first preference course at university, which is good, our three A*-C pass rate is up on last year. But what we have discovered is that it is the high performing pupils’ grades that have been downgraded most and that Northern Ireland CCEA exams have been downgraded more than any English exam board. Pupils are saying “you know me Sir or Miss – I am much better than these grades. Look at my exams in school, my coursework, my GCSE results”. They say: “I might have got into university but I have to carry these results for the rest of my le and put them down on every application form I write – what does this say about me”. I have had lots of parents and pupils in tears today – normal we get four to five appeals on a normal exam result day. This year it’s more like  to .I don’t often complain, but when there is such an injustice, I feel we must speak out for our young people both here and across the whole of Northern Ireland.Gary Kelly is principal of St Kevin’s College, Lisnaskea  Belfast   Related ContentEilis O#Hanlon PremiumEilis O#HanlonOpinionA-Level results: In an extraordinary year, nothing has gone right.

The new centre will be moved a short distance to Anderson House at Altnagelvin. Derry was the first city to set-up a COVID centre back on March  at the out-of-hours Western Urgent Care building. The other Covid centre in the Western Trust area opened at South West Acute Hospital on March . The Trust continues to maintain a state of readiness for admissions of patients with suspected Covid- and a further surge. Speaking at the Western Trust’s monthly board meeting, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Chief Executive, said: “Both centres continue to operate, preparing for a potential second surge. googletag.cmd.push “The Altnagelvin centre will move to Anderson and South West centre will reduce its footprint to free up space in the outpatient department. “Movements are allowing us to recommence our outpatient services.” Antibody testing has been offered in the Trust area as of July , she told the Western Trust board. These tests are used to detect antibodies to the COVID- virus to seeyou have previously had the virus. The test works by taking a blood sample and testing for the presence of antibodies to seeyou have developed an immune response to the virus. A total of  tests were carried out and only  ed as positive, which Dr Kilgallen described as an ‘interesting find’. googletag.cmd.push A Covid swab testing service available to staff, patients pre-operatively and staff in the independent sector continues to operate at C-TRIC at Altnagelvin Hospital and Lackaboy in Enniskillen. However, those services are also relocating in August as part of reset plans. The latest NISRA statistics show that  people have died of Covid- in Derry City and Strabane. In the council area there have been  confirmed coronavirus cases –  in the last  days. In response to the Coronavirus pandemic a network of new Primary CareCovid- centres were then rapidly established to manage the growth of Coronavirus cases in the community. They were seen as an essential part of the fight against this virus.  To ensure vital GP services can be maintained, it is believed to be absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with nonCovid- related conditions.  These centres are not testing facilities and are only for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of havingCovid- and require medical attention.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This is unacceptable, has reducedthe future options for many school leavers and caused immense distress. Teachers’ assessments should have been trusted much more than they have been. Education minister Peter Weir must intervene and do so urgently.”SDLP Education Spokesperson Daniel McCrossan MLA also expressed his concern and disappointmentat reports from young people that their grades were unfair and inaccurate. He has urged Minister Weir to ensure a robust appeals process is in place.The West Tyrone MLA added:“This is a highly stressful time for pupils across the North and their families. The failure of CCEA to remove the contentiousstandardisation from the grading process and the subsequent failure of the Education Minister to act has compounded that stress. It is not good enough.“The SDLP first raised these issues with CCEA and the Department of Education many months ago. They have been aware of these issues since April and utterly failed to act, at the expense of our young people.It is unacceptable and frankly disgraceful that our children have been left subject to a postcode lottery in relation to their exam results.This is about the future of our children and there can beno room for inequalityor unfairness.“The grading systemsusedmust not be allowed to disadvantagehigh-achieving pupils fromareas of deprivation.Standardisation cannot be allowed to become a euphemism for discrimination against working class children - even unintentionally.It is a crude and ineffective tool and has no place in a modern, fair education system.“It is clear the Minister should never have let this situation escalate and thestandardisationtool should have been put in the bin many months ago. However, Minister Weir must now act urgently to ensure the appeals process is robust and allows young people the opportunity to challenge grades they are deeply disappointed with.“The Minister must also compel CCEA to publish themodelling and calculation process used to determine grades this year, to allow young people all the information they need to seetheir grade is fair, accurate and reflective of their ability.“I want toapologiseto school children right across the North, particularly those getting A-Level grades today and GCSE grades next week. You have been put in an intolerably dficult position and I am sorry thatthis failure was allowed to happen.This is not your fault and we have got your back.“The SDLP will continue to fight for grades to be restored, based onteachersjudgement, and without the crude bias of thestandardisationstool.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The start of the summer. A time of hope. A time of new beginnings. To celebrate my th birthday, my friends and I had travelled to Belfast on a minibus on a school-night in the middle of A Levels for that momentous YES concert. We were thrilled to get to see Ash and Bono at the Waterfront. We were extra ebullient at the sight of John Hume taking to the stage. The unlikely trio of David Trimble, John and Bono were applauded with yells of “Yesss!”. googletag.cmd.push  The burning pride deep inside on that night could have set the world alight. To the friends I had yet to meet, some of whom were at that concert, I would always be Proud Mary from Derry. I had come of age just in time to vote in the referendum three days later. Not all of us would have that privilege. My sister, Deirdre, who was singing and shouting her heart out for the entire excursion, was  months shy of voting age. In fact she would never get to vote as she was killed in a car accident we were involved in  months later. googletag.cmd.push I had meticulously studied the Good Friday Agreement text during the referendum campaign. As excited as I was to be on my way to Loch an Iuacuteir for Cuacutersa na Casca that Good Friday, my inner political nerd was sorry to be missing all the TV and radio coverage. No mobile phones or social media in those days. Just two days before the signing of the Agreement, I was at Stormont with a delegation of Derry Girls lobbying the British Government for a new school. I was on The Thornhill Talks Team with Mrs Boyle, Miss Hamilton and Head Girl, and my lelong friend, Emmylou. The eyes of the world were on these negotiations and the hand of history was on our shoulders. John Hume took time out to facilitate the meeting withMinister of Education, Tony Worthington MP. John was the architect of the unfolding momentous peace accord, but he was focussed on bread and butter constituency issues. He knew the importance of education in creating opportunities and building inclusive and peaceful communities. I was engaged in current affairs and local politics from a young age. I was fascinated by the work of my godfather, Uncle Mark. His job as John Hume’s parliamentary aide brought him to ious countries. He gted me with great stories and good lessons over the years. I proudly flaunted a “Hume for Europe” Tshirt in . I read newspapers. I listened intently to the kitchen wireless and followed the TV debates. Always rooting for John and rehearsing the Humespeak: You can’t eat a flag. Spill sweat, not blood. Respect ersity. An accident of birth. Dference is the essence of humanity. This language is now common parlance. John brought others on to his page and round to his way of thinking and speaking. It is impossible to consider John’s achievements without recognising the influence of his we and key adviser, Pat. On completion of my A Levels, I had the pleasure of working in the Bayview Terrace constituency office in the run up to the first Assembly elections. I learned so much about public service, not least in witnessing the compassion and care shown by Pat to every person. The office was buzzing. Phone calls were coming in from journalists, humanitarians and politicians from all over the world. I could hear John speaking in French on the phone one minute, then dealing with a constituent on a housing issue the next minute. Pat had time and warmth for everyone. Amidst the flurry, Pat still found time for banter and indulged my frivolous chats about nights out. I still regard Pat as a mentor and hero. I can only try and imagine the extent of sacrices made by Pat and her family over the years. After that short stint in the office, I spent three months working in Seagate , before starting my chapter at Queen’s and all the adventures that came with that and after that. The Omagh atrocity that summer was a stark reminder of the fragility of the hard-earned peace. John Hume was a political giant, a living legend and an international statesman. Above all, he was a Derry champion. He was a man of global thinking and local action. First-hand experience of poverty in his community motivated his relentless quest for social justice, and his role in founding the credit union movement was instrumental in giving opportunities to people and families. His civic leadership in the community was as impressive as his political leadership on the world stage. John Hume was a man of vision. Steadfast in his ambitions. Resolute in pursuit of solution. Willing to work with anyone. Determined not to be distracted by the viliers. He kept his shoulder to the wheel and his eyes on the prize. Not any of the acclaimed world prizes he won . Ultimately the prize for John was the prize for everyone: peace and the prospect of a brighter future. Those coming of age today face immense challenges as we emerge from a global health pandemic and enter a world recession. Climate emergency is real. In this part of the world we face the added challenges of Brexit uncertainty. Today’s generation need an injection of the hope that my generation were given  years ago. We still have much work to do. The “isolation of the West” remains a pertinent issue. The fight for a proper university presence in the city continues. “I sometimes wish it was that summer again…..” We should always maintain a little bit of that summer, even in the middle of the longest winters. The spirit of partnership and reconciliation underpinning the Good Friday Agreement and defining Hume’s pathway must be restored. And we shall overcome.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Is it any wonder after weeks, months and years of looking out at their peers playing in the middle of the action, many of our players will just throw in the towel. Bulging benches at U level soon subside and by the time minor level comes along, clubs can sometimes be scraping to get  and have to go dipping into the Us. Worse still, some of the star underage players dont cut the mustard at senior level. The bright lights and party scene of university becomes too appealing for some. For others, study and work will take them out of the country, never to . Some may fall out with the club and out of love with sport. googletag.cmd.push The other scenario, one that is all too common, is the man child who relies on power and when everyone  grows up, they havent the skill to offer anything more against players who have caught up in the physicality stakes. At the end of the day, in my opinion, underage is about giving the youth a purpose within a healthy lestyle and a social circle. It needs to provide players for the senior team and strive to pick up some silverware along the way. If a club can do this and win every title along the way, then even better. googletag.cmd.push In an ideal world, the club U championship would be the best barometer of success. By that point, the players have demonstrated a level of commitment to stay on board for the guts of  years and could backbone the senior team for a further . Perhaps with the GPAs new proposal for a split season, county boards will be able to properly schedule their U grade so it gets the proper slot. In recent seasons, Slaughtneil, Glen, Lavey and Magherafelt have pulled out of the competition as their main players were preparing for senior county finals. Its the younger grades that are the concern, as many coaches adopt a win at all costs attitude to their teams. I once heard an U manager talking about needing an extra session per week to prepare for a big game. The fixture in question was a Feacuteile group game. For the love of God, people need to take a step back. If you have a team talented enough to reach a final, then go all out to win it. As a general rule, dont listen to the doting parents chirping over the wire about getting the perceived strongest team out. Most of the time, they only have their sons or daughters interest in mind and not the clubs overall health  years down the tracks. All underage leagues and group games should be treated accordingly, a chance to develop. In any  of players, there will be many dferent levels of skill and physique. Any club serious about underage, will have enough helpers with their teams to cater for it. Set them targets. Condition players to work on their weak sidethey have mastered a skill. Or better still, encourage them to improve the pace of its execution and challenge them to make better decisions when in possession. For players that are struggling with a skill, thats the dficult part. That is real coaching, requiring both patience and dedication, with very little instant satisfaction. The earlier in the players coaching journey, the easier it will be. Break down the skill into manageable chunks. Where possible, link in with parents, so it can be worked on outside of training sessions. Parents have to take ownership as well. Even something as simple as video examples posted in a Whats App group. In many ways, this is where the most improvement will happen. There will be late developers, sometimes ing from other sports, but iniably those who strive to improve will always blossom. If you cant bring them all along with you, then you cant say you didnt try. At the end of the day, GAA is not for everyone. There are other sports and interests out there. The approach to games is the deal-breaker. It will dictate how many players you will retain. Managers should arm themselves with a piece of paper to plot a grid of who starts each game, how many minutesthey play and how long each substitute gets on the pitch for. Make a note of any players who have had school games that week or with the age group above. It will allow you to give more action to those who need it. All through the league, maintain a strong spine to your team so that it can always be competitive, but make some of your key players sit out some action and challenge others to play central roles in the absence of the so called star players. Better still, play them in dferent positions and tinker about as much as you can. Does anyone really care who wins an underage league or blitz game  Give others an opportunity to wear a starting jersey and watch how your grid changes. Make sure everyone gets starting in a number of games and not token five-minute appearances when the game is over. Youngsters are far from stupid. Its amazing what a jersey number below  can do for someones self esteem. It can feed into the development work you have been talking to the parents about. At the end of the day, championship is where the main focus will always be. And rightly so. A competitive edge must also be developed. If you can get a number of challenge games in and everyone gets playing, it will help maintain a bigger squad. This enables your coaching team to ide themselves up to work on dferent players and aspects of play. Take turns to be the stats person for a night to count things like use of weaker side, playing the final pass for a goal or the number of blocks. It is the perfect psychology to get inside the heads of the players in the top bracket of your squad. Also fire in wee reminders to others you see improving. In Thursdays documentary, iconic Meath midfielder Gerry McEntee referred to how Seaacuten Boylan would always have one on one chats and make him feel like he was the most important person in the world. It was a persona that made people want to improve. Mary K Burke snapped this gem of a photofrom a recent Feacuteile final. Look at the joy on the youngsters faces. Victory helps instil that type of emotion, but imagine an environment where everyone felt like that. Coaching sessions where learning overspills into laughter and where every player gets their fair share of game time. Imagine. That world would be a much better place, somewhere nobody would ever want to leave.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Is it any wonder after weeks, months and years of looking out at their peers playing in the middle of the action, many of our players will just throw in the towel. Bulging benches at U level soon subside and by the time minor level comes along, clubs can sometimes be scraping to get  and have to go dipping into the Us. Worse still, some of the star underage players dont cut the mustard at senior level. The bright lights and party scene of university becomes too appealing for some. For others, study and work will take them out of the country, never to . Some may fall out with the club and out of love with sport. googletag.cmd.push The other scenario, one that is all too common, is the man child who relies on power and when everyone  grows up, they havent the skill to offer anything more against players who have caught up in the physicality stakes. At the end of the day, in my opinion, underage is about giving the youth a purpose within a healthy lestyle and a social circle. It needs to provide players for the senior team and strive to pick up some silverware along the way. If a club can do this and win every title along the way, then even better. googletag.cmd.push In an ideal world, the club U championship would be the best barometer of success. By that point, the players have demonstrated a level of commitment to stay on board for the guts of  years and could backbone the senior team for a further . Perhaps with the GPAs new proposal for a split season, county boards will be able to properly schedule their U grade so it gets the proper slot. In recent seasons, Slaughtneil, Glen, Lavey and Magherafelt have pulled out of the competition as their main players were preparing for senior county finals. Its the younger grades that are the concern, as many coaches adopt a win at all costs attitude to their teams. I once heard an U manager talking about needing an extra session per week to prepare for a big game. The fixture in question was a Feacuteile group game. For the love of God, people need to take a step back. If you have a team talented enough to reach a final, then go all out to win it. As a general rule, dont listen to the doting parents chirping over the wire about getting the perceived strongest team out. Most of the time, they only have their sons or daughters interest in mind and not the clubs overall health  years down the tracks. All underage leagues and group games should be treated accordingly, a chance to develop. In any  of players, there will be many dferent levels of skill and physique. Any club serious about underage, will have enough helpers with their teams to cater for it. Set them targets. Condition players to work on their weak sidethey have mastered a skill. Or better still, encourage them to improve the pace of its execution and challenge them to make better decisions when in possession. For players that are struggling with a skill, thats the dficult part. That is real coaching, requiring both patience and dedication, with very little instant satisfaction. The earlier in the players coaching journey, the easier it will be. Break down the skill into manageable chunks. Where possible, link in with parents, so it can be worked on outside of training sessions. Parents have to take ownership as well. Even something as simple as video examples posted in a Whats App group. In many ways, this is where the most improvement will happen. There will be late developers, sometimes ing from other sports, but iniably those who strive to improve will always blossom. If you cant bring them all along with you, then you cant say you didnt try. At the end of the day, GAA is not for everyone. There are other sports and interests out there. The approach to games is the deal-breaker. It will dictate how many players you will retain. Managers should arm themselves with a piece of paper to plot a grid of who starts each game, how many minutesthey play and how long each substitute gets on the pitch for. Make a note of any players who have had school games that week or with the age group above. It will allow you to give more action to those who need it. All through the league, maintain a strong spine to your team so that it can always be competitive, but make some of your key players sit out some action and challenge others to play central roles in the absence of the so called star players. Better still, play them in dferent positions and tinker about as much as you can. Does anyone really care who wins an underage league or blitz game  Give others an opportunity to wear a starting jersey and watch how your grid changes. Make sure everyone gets starting in a number of games and not token five-minute appearances when the game is over. Youngsters are far from stupid. Its amazing what a jersey number below  can do for someones self esteem. It can feed into the development work you have been talking to the parents about. At the end of the day, championship is where the main focus will always be. And rightly so. A competitive edge must also be developed. If you can get a number of challenge games in and everyone gets playing, it will help maintain a bigger squad. This enables your coaching team to ide themselves up to work on dferent players and aspects of play. Take turns to be the stats person for a night to count things like use of weaker side, playing the final pass for a goal or the number of blocks. It is the perfect psychology to get inside the heads of the players in the top bracket of your squad. Also fire in wee reminders to others you see improving. In Thursdays documentary, iconic Meath midfielder Gerry McEntee referred to how Seaacuten Boylan would always have one on one chats and make him feel like he was the most important person in the world. It was a persona that made people want to improve. Mary K Burke snapped this gem of a photofrom a recent Feacuteile final. Look at the joy on the youngsters faces. Victory helps instil that type of emotion, but imagine an environment where everyone felt like that. Coaching sessions where learning overspills into laughter and where every player gets their fair share of game time. Imagine. That world would be a much better place, somewhere nobody would ever want to leave.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lisa McGee was doing her A-Levels at Thornhill College when the Good Friday Agreement was signed in , and grew up knowing about Mr Humes work for the peace process. He was just there all the time, she recalled. There wasnt a time that you didnt know about him. There was never any debate about it, he was a good man. At a time where everything was debated about and talked about nobody ever questioned that. Not that you would ever have needed to, or have wanted to, question what he was doing. googletag.cmd.push Ms McGee said the news of Mr Humes death on Monday morning came as a shock, despite knowing that he had been ill for some time. He was a hero who walked among us, she said. I got really upset I was surprised at how emotional I felt. We were just so used to having him. It was phenomenal what he did, the influence he had and the amazing vision of what our future should be. Ms McGee believes hundreds of people owe their le to Mr Hume, due to his role in the cessation of violence. He was an incredible person and he was sent here for a reason, she said. googletag.cmd.push I was just thinking yesterday of all the people that may not be herehe hadnt been able to do what he did and built the peace process. When you think of everything he did and he never gave up- thank God. Ms McGee doesnt knowJohn Hume ever watched Derry Girls, but she hopes he would have approved. I dont knowhe ever saw it, but he and Pat knew I was a big fan, she said. I hope they thought it was alright. He was always in the background in the news, so he was present in the show. And Erin chats about him a lot in the Derry Girls book that I did recently. There would be no Derry Girls without John Hume because I wouldnt have had the opportunities that I had,” she added. The Derry writer that she wants her two young children to learn about John Hume as they grow up. There was an amazing image of him on the front of thetoday [Tuesday] and I want to get that framed for the house because its important that they know about him, she said. This was always going to be a very sad time because it was always going to be about looking back over the past and that was a very painful time in our history. It has been a sad thing for me that towards the end of his le he couldnt remember everything he achieved. Thats why we have to remember for him.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dr Janice Bailie, Assistant Director, RD Division, Public Health Agency, said: “Health researchers are currently working to find a vaccine for COVID-, but without the help of members of the general public willing to participate in vaccine trials, this work will not be able to succeed. googletag.cmd.push “The NHS COVID- vaccine registry allows people to register their interest and be potentially contacted with an offer to participate in clinical studies. “You can sign up to give permission for researchers to contact you about taking part in COVID- vaccine studies. By collecting details about people who are interested in taking part in vaccine studies, the registry service will help cut down the time it takes to find volunteers for vaccine studies. This will help us to carry out studies and find a vaccine faster.” The registry is available to anyone aged  or over, living in the UK. To register, people fill in some personal and contact details, and answer a series of basic health screening questions on an NHS web form atwww.nhs.uk researchcontact. googletag.cmd.push   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Cllr Kathleen McGurk, who helped instigate the initiative, said the cost of school unorm can be a problem for some families. “I firmly believe unorms are a hidden cost of education,” she said. “Branded blazers and jumpers can be extremely expensive and beyond the reach of some families, but they are mandatory in most schools and that leaves parents in a dficult situation.” A survey completed by the Irish League of Credit Unions found that % of parents found school costs a financial burden. googletag.cmd.push It indicated % of parents get into debt for back to school costs, while % of those have used payday or doorstep loan providers. Cllr McGurk added: “This program aims to help local families reduce the cost of purchasing unorms. “However, we are relying on the generosity of the local community to donate items of unorm which are in good condition and are no longer needed by their own family. “We would appeal to all families whose children have moved out of school, or outgrown items of unorm, to donate to the program at any on the drop off points advertised in social media.” googletag.cmd.push Once items are received and sorted, families will have an opportunity to book an appointment to pick up items they need at Benbradagh Community Support or Hands That Talk.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dan McGrellis passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by his family and friends. He was a well-known and much-loved member of the community, parish and local GAA club. At his funeral, Fr McGavigan paid tribute to a ‘good father, grandfather and great grandfather’. “Dan was a remarkable man. He knew from a young age the importance of a father, losing his own father to cancer when he was only twelve,” he told mourners at St Joseph’s Church, Fincarn. googletag.cmd.push “He was the second of nine children, and took on a father’s role, moving to Scotland to work so money could be sent home for his mother and siblings. “Such instinctive sacrice and generosity, learned at a young age, was to be the mark of the man. Dan was to have very soon celebrated  years as a pioneer, the pin proudly worn on his lapel. “He was far from a shrinking violet, though, and was a regular in the pub in his youth, enjoying a game of darts with friends. The soberest, but perhaps the most sociable of all his friends. googletag.cmd.push “The parish of Banagher has lost a faithful friend who was a companion to many people work colleagues, extended family, GAA, pioneers and the community association to name but a few. “He had a huge heart and had room for everyone, so of course we are sad, even though he lived a long and incredibly full le.” Dan and the rest of the St Marys committee pictured at the opening of the new pitch in . The McGrellis family are steeped in the tradition of the club, and Dan’s seven sons wore maroon ties at his funeral in a nod to their father’s deep affection for St Mary’s. Dan was chairperson of St Mary’s GAC, Banagher from  to , having been vice chairperson in  and . As well as his involvement with the GAA, Fr McGavigan told the congregation that Dan contributed greatly to parish and community le in Banagher. “Parish and community were central to his le,” he said. “He lobbied the council for a footpath from Feeny village to the chapel, ensuring access for the local primary school, and was an early member of Feeny Community Association. “Helping to establish the parish bingo, he was involved in the renovation of the parish hall and ably served for many years as a sacristan in this church.”  Dan’s most loyal commitment, though, was to his family and his we Anne. Fr McGavigan told mourners how the couple encountered each other long before they were married. “The story is told of how he, as a young boy, watched a christening pass his mother’s shop on the way to the chapel,” he said. “The baby was a certain Anne Conway, who was brought here to be christened. “He recalled how he wasn’t much interested in a baby at eight years old, but recounted how a neighbour remarked, ‘this could be the girl you marry’. “Years later, they met again at a dance in Aghabrack and they soon married and settled down to begin a family. So began the McGrellis dynasty. “Dan and Anne patiently, generously and faithfully raised their twelve children, instilling in them their own virtues of hard work, kindness, generosity, respect and good humour.” Fr McGavigan concluded by encouraging Dan’s many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren to be inspired by his le. “Dan was a powerhouse of prayer and work and an inspiration for all of the McGrellis family,” he said “To his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren be inspired today by the holy le and death of a good man, and see in his le the virtues you would like to see in your own. “If you do this, Dan will live on in you and future generations. Woven into your sadness, there is a deep gratitude to God for all that this man has been to us. “We are happy, because we know deep down that his le was complete and that he, in the end, was ready for God.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As well as his involvement with the GAA, Fr McGavigan told the congregation that Dan contributed greatly to parish and community le in Banagher. “Parish and community were central to his le,” he said. “He lobbied the council for a footpath from Feeny village to the chapel, ensuring access for the local primary school, and was an early member of Feeny Community Association. “Helping to establish the parish bingo, he was involved in the renovation of the parish hall and ably served for many years as a sacristan in this church.”  Dan’s most loyal commitment, though, was to his family and his we Anne. Fr McGavigan told mourners how the couple encountered each other long before they were married. “The story is told of how he, as a young boy, watched a christening pass his mother’s shop on the way to the chapel,” he said. “The baby was a certain Anne Conway, who was brought here to be christened. “He recalled how he wasn’t much interested in a baby at eight years old, but recounted how a neighbour remarked, ‘this could be the girl you marry’. “Years later, they met again at a dance in Aghabrack and they soon married and settled down to begin a family. So began the McGrellis dynasty. “Dan and Anne patiently, generously and faithfully raised their twelve children, instilling in them their own virtues of hard work, kindness, generosity, respect and good humour.” Fr McGavigan concluded by encouraging Dan’s many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren to be inspired by his le. “Dan was a powerhouse of prayer and work and an inspiration for all of the McGrellis family,” he said “To his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren be inspired today by the holy le and death of a good man, and see in his le the virtues you would like to see in your own. “If you do this, Dan will live on in you and future generations. Woven into your sadness, there is a deep gratitude to God for all that this man has been to us. “We are happy, because we know deep down that his le was complete and that he, in the end, was ready for God.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Along with drivers of internal combustion enginecars using EV charge points as makesht parking bays, EV drivers listed poor maintenance of the existing network as a major problem. Phil Gordon, a Donegal resident who works at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, said the majority of the city’s charge points are not ing. “It’s been slowly falling apart for years and nobody is doing anything about it. It was developed around -,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I got my EV in  and at that point, in Derry alone there were seven standard chargers and one rapid. At the minute there are only two of the slow chargers left working. “There one on Carlisle Road has been broken for as long as I can remember. There is one in the Diamond that has been out of order for about  or  months. “We’ve been told by eCars that it’s beyond repair, they can’t fix it and there is no plan to replace it. The north west in general has been very badly served by eCars for a long time. googletag.cmd.push “You look at how many there are in Belfast. It’s the biggest city and it has four or five rapid chargers. Derry is the second biggest city in the country and it’s only ever had one.” A map showing EV charge points across County Derry. Responsibility for the network across the island of Ireland lies with eCars, a specic section of Electricity Supply Board . The company began charging last year for the use of its rapid chargers in the Republic of Ireland and further pricing for standard network charging points came into effect yesterday. ESB have said they hope to be able to replace broken chargers, but that ‘planning issues’ are causing a delay. “In County Derry, there are  chargers in total each with two charge points. Of these  are working correctly and our systems indicate recent usage,” a spokesperson said. “There are, however, a number of chargers in Derry City which have faults which cannot be resolved, and new chargers are required. “This is due to the age of the equipment and that they are no longer supported by the original charger manufacturer. “In addition, one charger was removed at the train station due to building works and which is due to be reinstated in coming months by the building contractor. “ESB ecars has plans to replace a section of the existing Standard AC network in Northern Ireland including in Derry. “There are a number of planning issues which need to be resolved first and work is on-going with relevant stakeholders in relation to it at present. “It is hoped that these issues can be overcome with a view to beginning to replace chargers in the coming months.” At present, it is free to charge an electric car using the Northern Ireland network, something EV driver Ronan McElholm feels leaves the system open to abuse. “They’re free, and this is half the problem. When you get something that is free, it’s subject to abuse,” he said. “There is a lot of funding from the government in the Republic, but added to that is the fact you’re now having to pay for it and it makes things easier. “It’s not a fortune to charge your car. It’s only slightly more than the day-time rate. It keeps the freeloaders away because it’s now cheaper to charge at home than on the network.” While the lack of maintenance on the network has caused problems, EV drivers are also having to contend with ICE drivers using the charge points as parking bays. “A lot of places, they’ll put a charger in but don’t enforce the parking, so people park an ordinary car in it because it’s a handy space and they leave it there,” said Phil Gordon “There is no punishment for that. In Derry City, you will get a ticketyou’re parked in an EV charging bay, but a in lot of places, that’s not enforced. “It’s ridiculous. They call it ‘ICE-ing’. Internal Combustion Engine. If they’ve parked an ordinary car in your place, you’ve been ‘iced’. It’s such a common problem there’s a term for it. “You wouldn’t park a car at a petrol pump and walk off and leave it. That’s the equivalent.” Ronan McElholm regularly travels from Derry to Belfast and Dublin for work, and has encountered the problem on numerous occasions. “It causes a problem. I was going to Belfast, finding an abandoned car on a charger with no way of knowing when this person is coming back,” he said. “I’ve never had any issues with the rapid charger on the Glenshane, for example, apart from non-electric cars parking in it. One day there was a van parked and left there for three hours. “Once you hit five o’clock, non-electric cars just park in it, which is an incredibly selfish thing for anyone to do. “They can get a ticket for it, but once the traffic wardens go home, there is no one to ticket you, because the police say it’s not their responsibility. “In the Republic, they are upgrading all the street chargers to rapid chargers, which is a good thing, but unless there is proper policing on it, people just pull in and park. “It needs a change to legislation and the police need powers to ticket cars parked on them.” DfI Minister Nichola Mallon arriving for work in her EV. The political lag caused by Stormont’s two-year period of stalemate has resulted in a backlog across all departments which has delayed any upgrade to the EV charging network. Department for InfrastructureMinister Nichola Mallon raised eyebrows when she arrived in an EV on the day Stormont ed in January. “That was a show. People like myself have tried to contact her to get something done about it and they just don’t reply. All talk and no substance,” said Phil Gordon. “When I got my first Leaf in , there were only about ,-odd cars in the whole of the Republic of Ireland. Now there are about , in the south and -, in the north. “The users are there, but bureaucracy and red tape has left it way down the list of priorities to get the network to a al level.” “They really would need to get their finger out,” added Ronan McElholm. “They certainly do need to get things moving with regards to legislation. The complete charge network needs and overhaul and massive funding. “As an electric car user, I’m prepare to pay for it like it is in the Republic. They’ve really started to upgrade the network there in the last few years, but you can see a big dference.” The UK government has committed to banning the sale of petrol, diesel and hybrid vehicles from . The DfI have said they are engaging with the UK Office of Low Emission Vehiclesto ‘determine how to meet this challenge’. A DfI spokesperson said: “The Department provides advice and guidance in relation to electric vehicles, working closely with OLEV. “The Department is working to identy actions to support the decarbonisation of transport including how best to support the uptake of ultra-low emission vehicles to the Northern Ireland market. “The Minister has engaged with the DAERA Minister to begin working collaboratively to promote the use of electric vehicles and specically to improve the charge point network in Northern Ireland. “She is committed to exploring all options and new solutions to enhance the charge point infrastructure, improve lives and tackle the climate emergency. “The DfI continues to closely monitor funding opportunities for the installation of additional charge point infrastructure. “We will work with commercial providers to ensure that the installation of any additional charge point infrastructure remains fit for purpose commensurate with growth.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Aoibhine McFlynn, from Ballyronan, was chosen for the role of ‘Cassie’ in the film, which was produced in East Susseux, England and released in cinemas on July . The plot follows a reclusive writer who forms a relationship with a young London evacuee named Frank after adopting him during World War Two. Her mum, Edele, says rubbing shoulders with stars like Gemma Arterton and Sir Tom Courtenay, has left Aoibhine keen for more acting experience. “She enjoyed it. She says she wants to do more and that’s what she wants to get into. Hopefully, on the back of this, something  might pop up,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I don’t think people thought it was going to be such a big movie. Aoibhine got into it through Alison Campbell models, who put her in for it. Aoibhine with Sir Tom Courtenay. “They flew us over and set us up for four or five nights. The crew and all had been filming for about six weeks, so we were over on the second last week for her scene. “Her role is ‘Cassie’, an evacuee child. It’s a small role, but she features three or four times, so we’ll have to go to the cinema and see her.” Despite her new-found fame, mum Edele says the -year-old has remained grounded after initially filming the scenes almost two years ago. googletag.cmd.push “She’s actually a shy wee thing, a very modest wee girl. She wouldn’t tell anybody that she’s in anything,” she said. “We obviously had to get confirmation from school to let her go, so before she left, Mr Scullion at the Loup called her up in front of everyone and I think she nearly died! “She’s just taken it in her stride. She was a bit younger when we went and did it and it was amazing to see the whole set up and how it was all done.” Pictured with the films lead, Gemma Arterton. Aoibhine’s family are hoping to get together over the next few weeks to watch her on screen, but in the meantime, cinema goers may unknowingly find themselves sharing a room with a film star. “I’ll make them all aware, I’ll roar at the screen,” said Edele, who was planning on visiting the cinema at the weekend with Aoibhine and her husband, Shane. “We might be able to get it here streaming with the family next weekend,we don’t get to the cinema.” Edele says Aoibhine, who also features on a current Phoenix Gas television advertisement, didn’t have to abandon her Loughshore tone for the role. “They wanted the Northern Irish accent, so she didn’t have to change it or anything.” Summerland is in cinemas now and can also be streamed on Amazon Prime Video.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The poll, conducted before the NI Executive’s decision to make the wearing of face coverings compulsory from yesterday, indicated that .% would be in favour of the move. When askedthey would comply with a ruling to make face coverings in shops compulsory, the amount of positive responses increased to .%. % of respondents who listed Maghera as their nearest town or village indicated they would not complythe wearing of face coverings was made compulsory. googletag.cmd.push The survey also found that a large majority of residents in the county are already in possession of a face covering. .% of respondents indicated that they had either bought or been given a face covering since the beginning of the Covid- pandemic. Of that number, the most popular setting for wearing a face covering was the supermarket, with % of respondents indicating they had worn their covering there. Petrol stations and local shops were the next highest on .%, with hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons close behind on .%.  Just % said they had worn a covering on public transport, where they have been compulsory since July , while .% of those who took part in the survey said they never wore one. googletag.cmd.push Asked to comment on face coverings, many of those opposed to wearing one said they didn’t feel it would have any impact on the spread of the virus. One respondent said: “I really dont think they are necessary. Wearing them is not effective. Hand washing  social distancing are the best preventative measures. Others felt the issue should be a matter of personal choice, with one respondent stating, ‘it should be a choice, not an order’. “If it’s not safe enough to go out without a face mask then its not safe enough to go out period. The number of people with ill-fitting masks is unbelievable,” said another. “Gaping holes, noses uncovered, constantly adjusting them with their hands are all defeating the purpose of the masks.”  Protecting the vulnerable was a motivator for many of those who were in favour of mandatory face coverings. “We should protect each other as best we can. Currently the advice is that face masks help prevent the spread of Covid-, so take responsibility and wear one,” said one respondent. Some also felt that coverings should have been mandatory since the start of lockdown, while others who are shielding said the lack of face coverings makes them anxious. “I dont see enough people wearing them coming out of shielding myself,” said one respondent. “I feel really unsafe and anxious about going into enclosed places as it is with my mask on so when people are not wearing them it concerns me and my safety.” As the requirement came into force yesterday, the NI Executive launched their ‘Wear One For Everyone’ campaign, stressing the move was to make things safer for everyone.  A joint statement said: “The use of face coverings is a vital defence in our battle against Covid-. “This is about looking after each other and doing everything we can to stay on top of this virus. It will help to save lives. “It also has to be remembered that some people cannot wear face coverings, due to a disability or health condition. “There should be no stigma attached to anyone in these circumstances. If those of us who can cover up do so, then it will help keep everyone safe. “We are confident most people will comply, but those who do not wear a face covering without a reasonable excuse risk being issued with a fixed penalty notice by the police.” Mid Ulster MLA, Emma Sheerin, said making face coverings mandatory was a positive step. “I welcome the move to make face coverings mandatory, and I think that we all should be doing whatever we can to minimise risks to ourselves and others,” she added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

To date, that remains the only such cluster in the Causeway Coast and Glens area identied since contact tracing began on May , which is one of eleven identied across Northern Ireland. A Public Health Agencystatement revealed that Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilhad the highest number of identied clusters, while Mid and East Antrimis next highest. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council,Ards and North Down Borough Council andArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council all have one identied cluster of over five people. googletag.cmd.push There have been no large clusters identied in the Derry City and Strabane or Mid Ulster districts, that cover the remainder of County Derry. However, the PHA have also said they have identied  smaller clusters, of less than five people, across Northern Ireland, and said they would continue to publish data each Thursday. A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period. Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings.  googletag.cmd.push COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters. Since July, the averagenumber of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The PHA say the rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing. Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe. “Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app. “This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts. “Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters. Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings. “Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful. “We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.” Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible.

The Latvian event is the first loose surface event of the ERC season and despite fluctuating travel restrictions around Europe, the event has attracted a strong entry and Devine will start the event at number  in the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy entered Hyundai i R. Despite limited loose surface experience in the  wheel drive Hyundai, Devine and co-driver Brian Hoy are looking forward to seeing what they can do in Latvia. googletag.cmd.push “Obviously Italy was a disappointment but thankfully the car has been repaired. I need to put that behind me now”, Devine said. “I’ve only had a little bit of loose surface experience with the Hyundai so at the moment my preparation has been about watching onboards but we have the official test ahead of the event which will be a help. It’s going to be a bit of a challenge but we knew from the start of the year this would be the toughest event, just because it’s something we are not used to. Myself and Brian both did Finland a few years ago as part of the Junior World Rally Championship and it wouldn’t be too dissimilar, but that was in an R car, an R car is so much faster! From what I’ve seen the rally looks really good and the stages look nice but it’s a place where you wouldn’t want to get it wrong because it’s so high speed. googletag.cmd.push A lot of the guys will be quite used to it having done it before andyou are not on it from the beginning, you can get left behind very quickly. But we have to start somewhere, that’s how we are looking at it this year. I also have to remember that I need points on the board.” Devine’s involvement with the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy and Hyundai’s Customer Racing Junior Driver programs also saw him take in Rally di Alba recently. “It was great to get out straight after the disappointment of Rome and especially on such a star studded event. It was also interesting to run with a new team for that weekend which was a great experience and I’m very thankful to Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing for setting it up, he added. Callum and Brian will be partnered in Latvia by  other all Irish crews in Hyundai’s. Craig Breen and Paul Nagle will tackle the event as they continue their development of MRF tyres while Cathan McCourt and James Fulton will join Callum is the PCRS camp. “When you’re abroad, it’s nice to have a few competitors from home around too, it helps you relax a little”, said Callum. Rally Liepāja will begin on Friday, August  with pre-event practice and shakedown before the event properly gets underway on Saturday which will see Callum and Brian tackle  stages before a further  stages on Sunday conclude the event. The competitive mileage of the event will come in at just over km  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours. However, to reduce disruption to businesses and the public, some night-time works will be required at key locations.The work will take place at ious locations around the Downpatrick area, including some of the main streets within the town centre.NI Water has confirmed that the contractor working on the Downpatrick scheme mdash Geda Construction mdash will liaise with any affected businesses and properties.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWe appreciate that this work is disruptive and would like to thank the public in advance for their patience as we complete these essential improvement works.ldquoWe are all practising social distancing and our priority is to keep customers and colleagues safe. Please keep your distance and our workers will carry on with their essential work for you.South Down MLA Colin McGrath has met with NI Water officials ahead of work starting in Downpatrick, highlighting the need for communication with the community and the need to complete the scheme quickly.He said it was imperative that consideration was given to the works being done in the evening and at weekends to ensure that the level of public disruption was kept to as low a level as possible.ldquoI canrsquot think of a time in recent memory when Downpatrick has suffered road works after road works than has happened over the past few years, the MLA continued. ldquoIf the public is frustrated by this, it is entirely understandable and entirely justied.ldquoThe past few months have been incredibly worrying and stressful and people are finally able to step out of their homes. Shielding finally came to a end last week and the most vulnerable in our society are able to take those first tentative steps out of their homes again. It would have been altogether unacceptable for them to have to navigate this with works going on in their town.Mr McGrath said that having raised these issues with NI Water, the organisation is planning to use underground trenchless techniques, with contractors also working in the evening.He added: ldquoI will be in regular contact with the project manager to ensure that these works are completed as quickly as possible and due consideration given to the public.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has appealed to residents and the business community to remain patient as the work progresses.ldquoThis is an important scheme for Downpatrick and, as such, there will inevitably be disruption. NI Water intends to keep this to a minimum and it is important that this is the case, he continued.ldquoThis is a signicant investment in a much-needed scheme to not only upgrade the existing infrastructure, but also prevent so-called out-of-sewer flooding. Upgrading town centre sewers is an important scheme and NI Water must honour its commitment to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said improving the town centrersquos waste water infrastructure was good news for residents and the business community.He added :ldquoThe suggested timetable to complete the work is five weeks and I hope that every effort will be made to ensure that back-to-school traffic is not impacted as the start of the new term is less than one month away..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Downpatrick Cricket.jpg","title":"Downpatrick see off Saintfield by four runs in close contest  ","story":"WHAT a dference  hours makes in the game of cricket.Downpatrick, who had been humbled by Ballymena on Thursday, got back to winning ways at Saintfield with the batsmen showing some pride and application.Ross Boultwood won the toss and decided to bat first.

The original proposal was to end the scheme on August .Downpatrick councillors Gareth Sharvin mdash who initially proposed the free parking initiative ndash and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the extension of the free parking scheme.Cllr Sharvinrsquos suggestion was tabled at the June meeting of the local authorityrsquos Strategic, Policy and Resources when it was also agreed to review the decision in early August.ldquoI proposed the initiative to encourage shoppers back into Downpatrick to provide a boost for our local businesses who have continued to provide key services during the pandemic and the easing of lockdown restrictions, Cllr Sharvin explained.He revealed that when he used the Irish Street, Scotch Street and Church Street car parks theywere extremely busy and he was heartened by the usage, admitting that he did receive some feedback that there were some all-day parkers taking up vital spaces which would have had a negative impact on our local businesses.Agreement to extend the free parking initiative was accepted by the local authority on Monday following a proposal by Cllr Sharvin.ldquoThe near eight weeks of free car parking have been a great benefit to Downpatrick and in my proposal to extend the scheme until August , I have asked that the car park strategy the council is completing is fast tracked.ldquoThis is important to ensure equality across the district and to review the car park tarf of p an hour, with a reduction in the hourly rate being considered.Cllr Sharvin said while shoppers will not have to pay to park for almost two more weeks, he has vowed to continue working with local businesses to ensure that the local authority is doing everything it can do to support them.He added: ldquoWith this feedback from local businesses, I would not hesitate to call on the council to reconsider the car parking charges again,traders feel it is impacting on them signicantly during this continuing pandemic.Cllr Hanlon said while free parking had been extended, it was important that the public remembered that charges would be introduced shortly.However, she expressed disappointment at the lack of signs informing people that parking is free which confused some shoppers.Cllr Hanlon said a number drivers contacted her regarding the issuing of enforcement tickets whilst using the car parks for minor offences.She continued: ldquoThis, in my opinion, was counter productive to the reason why councillors had agreed to the extended free parking to encourage people to shop locally and provide businesses with some breathing space to adapt to the new way of working.She also highlighted the need for the local authority to press ahead with its car parking strategy and for an equitable charging system across the district..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C August 5%2C 2000  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK

Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district.

He was detained on suspicion of collusion with foreign powers, in the highest-profile use yet of the new national security law Beijing imposed on the city after protests last year The latest incident on August  involved the arrests of leading democracy activist, Agnes Chow and media tycoon and also leading democracy activist and critic of China, Jimmy Lai. Mr Lai is the owner of Hong Kong daily newspaper Apple Daily. His two sons were also arrested. Prior to this another one of the key figures in thepro-democracy movement, Benny Tai, who was a Professor of Law in the University of Hong Kong was sacked from his job because of his political activities four young activists aged between  and  were arrested for allegedly “inciting secession online” and  pro-democracy candidates were disqualied from standing in the forthcoming elections to the Legislative Council which is Hong Kong’s mini parliament.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Pictured with Martin Lee, leader and founder of Hong Kong Pro-Democracy Movement and Chris Patten, EU External Relations Commissioner and before that the last governor of Hong Kong. Picture taken some time in The current Hong Kong government disqualied these  pro-democracy candidates from contesting the legislative election on the grounds that they were deemed unable to perform the duties of a lawmaker. One of the main reasons cited for their disqualication was because they “had objected in principle to the National Security Law and its promulgation”. According to the Hong Kong government, candidates must not only not oppose this law — they must also promote and support it.The National Security Law has been widely condemned by the world’s leading democratic governments because it effectively ended the autonomy of Hong Kong, suppressed human rights, free speech and political dissent.However, an even more serious development took place last Fridaywhen the pro-Beijing Hong Kong government postponed the elections that had been scheduled for September  for  months on the pretext of concerns over the resurgence of Covid . The real reason was somewhat dferent.In November , pro-democracy candidates swept the boards in the District Council Elections. Hong Kong authorities are fearful that this will be repeated in the Legislative Council elections in the wake of what has happened since then given the size of the demonstrations that were organised by pro-democracy supporters and the resentment that has been caused by the passage and implementation of the National Security Law. They are fearful that democracy campaigners could win a first ever majority in the -seat legislature. Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing supporters want to use the year long delay to use the National Security Law to introduce measures including further disqualications to guarantee a pro-China majority.This objective has been fully understood by the international community who are only too well aware that since the outbreak of Covid , elections have been able to take place in  countries without any serious health consequences including Japan, Singapore and South Korea all of which had more serious problems with this virus than Hong Kong.Increasingly concerned about recent developments the five foreign ministers of the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States on Sunday August  issued a joint statement of condemnation stating that “moves to disqualy candidates and delay the elections have undermined the democratic process that has been fundamental to Hong Kong’s stability and prosperity”.They added “We support the legitimate expectations of the people of Hong Kong to elect Legislative Council representatives via genuinely free, fair, and credible elections”. These five counties along with two fellow EU Member States, Germany and France, had earlier also suspended their extradition treaties with Hong Kong.Given the continuing crisis in Hong Kong, absolute clarity is required as to where all leaders of democratic parliamentary institutions stand on this issue. This is not the case in Northern Ireland following a meeting that First Minister, Arlene Foster accompanied by Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill had with China’s Consulate General in Belfast, Madame Zhang Meang.The Chinese consulate subsequently reported that at the meeting the two leaders of Northern Ireland’s Executive said “the Northern Ireland government cherishes friendship with China, understands and respects Hong Kong’s national security legislation...”Their attempts to distance themselves from these remarks have not been convincing and have only added to the confusion.Action should be taken to prevent China exploiting the reported remarks by Ms Foster and Ms O Neill allegedly on behalf of the Northern Ireland Executive. China will use these for propaganda purposes to justy their actions in Hong Kong. There is a simple and effective way of dispelling any doubt as to how the Northern Ireland Assembly feels about what is happening in Hong Kong — MLAs should express solidarity with their fellow pro-democracy parliamentarians in Hong Kong by condemning China’s actions and add their names to the former Hong Kong governor Chris Patten list of almost one thousand cross party international parliamentarians worldwide who have already done so.And in an act of all island parliamentary solidarity, TDs and senators in the Oireachtas should be asked to join with them in expressing their total opposition to China’s attempts to crush democracy and human rights in Hong Kong.• John Cushnahan is a former Alliance Party leader, Fine Gael MEP and European Parliament Rapporteur for Hong Kong -——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Since ing to site Farrans, the contractor in charge of the build, has ensured the contract is completed ready for opening in the Autumn.Farrans has been spearheading the build since initial enabling works got under way early in , creating  jobs on site during construction as part of a project which has delivered at least £. million in direct wages to the local economy.Located at the south side of Craigavon’s balancing lake, the facility is a landmark venue for the area and is situated within a pre-existing network of walking and cycling paths covering around three miles. The council hopes the new leisure centre will welcome visitors from across the borough and beyond to its new -metre pool, a young children’s indoor leisure water feature, a ,m state-of-the-art gym, multiple studios, health and wellbeing suite, sensory room, eight-court sports halls, spin studio, soft play area and an on-site café.It also incorporates an outdoor water sports provision offering a wide range of water based activities including windsurfing, water skiing and paddle sports.

to staff during armed robbery branded ‘reprehensible’NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPoliticsPlan for  homes in Portadown gets green lightA controversial plan for a further  houses to be built near Lisnisky Lane, was approved at August’s meeting of Armagh, City Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council’s planning and regulatory services committee.By The NewsroomThursday, th August , : am\"\"The outline application lodged by agent Alan Patterson Design Ltd, on behalf of applicant Sustar Ltd will see approximately  dwellings and a crèche built on lands to the east of Bracken Lodge Lisnisky Road and Lisnisky Lane.The development of this . acres site will be delivered in phases, each of which will require further planning approval.There are also conditions attached to phases withplanning officers wanting to ensure plans for the proposed crèche are submitted and approved by the Council by the time the th dwelling is approved.The crèche must also be completed and operated prior to the occupation of the th house.This is to ensure that the community facility approved within the application is provided.One of the conditions attached to this approval will ensure a two lane approach to roundabout  is submitted to and approved in writing by the Council and this work shall be completed prior to the occupation of  households.The outline proposal also includes a new access point to these lands to be created approximately m south of No  Lisnisky Lane.The application has receiveda total of  letters of objection from four separatepostal addresses and one letter of support.Speaking against the proposal on Wednesday afternoon, Councillor Margaret Tinsley said she was not against the application for new housing but was very concerned about “traffic congestion in the area at peak times”.“Prior to COVID, traffic was queuedback from roundabout  to roundabout  already so how will these roads cope with potentially another , cars,” said the DUP representative.“Any improvement the Department for Infrastructureare to make to the roads need to be in place now, not when the houses are built.“I am not against these new homes totally I just want to ensure these traffic problems do not escalate further.”Speaking on behalf of the application, SDLP Councillor Joe Nelson reminded the committee the lands are already zoned for housing.“These proposals are for very high quality development, there will becrèche facilities on site and homeowners will be able to walk to local places of employment.“This fits in with the singular concept of Craigavon and will be a great boost to the local economy with development costs of over £ million.“I understand the concerns around traffic but I trust the DfI engineers have done their job and I commend the developer and the team working on this proposal as they have clearly worked hard to come up with this excellent proposal.”Ulster Unionist Councillor Sam Nicholson identied traffic congestion as the biggest bugbear with regards to this application and asked road service how they had got to the point where they are happy with the application.A member of Road Serviceinformed the committee that a transport assessment had been submitted as part of the application and was found to be acceptable.“A range of road improvements are being delivered with this application in a phased manner, including a link road to Old Lurgan Road and a two lane approach to roundabout ,” said the DfI representative.It was also revealed that traffic management modelling showed Craigavon’s roundabout’s worked in isolation but when joined together, the problems stemmed from the hospital roundabout junction.“This was passed on to my colleagues in development control and it was their decision to accept what was presented,” said another DfI representative.Following questioning about the condition of Lisnisky Lane from Councillor Peter Lavery, Council’s case officer in charge of the report advised this application was an outline application.“In future applications access will have to be considered and no development shall commence until work has been carried out at roundabout ,” said the case officer.“Proposals for a new access to the hospital have been submitted this week but that has to go through due process we can’t take for granted that will be approved when considering this application.”Alderman Sydney Anderson said he saw this development as an opportunity.“As the development is being built I would like to think Road Service would take on board the need to develop the road network as well,” said the DUP representative.Sinn Fein Councillor Paul Duffy describedthe area as “growing” while his party colleague Councillor Garath Keating said it was clear that traffic was a problem in the area but didn’t feel this was the developer’s fault.“I don’t think we can lay the blame for traffic problems on a new development,” said Cllr Keating.“If you are going to use traffic problems as a reason to refuse this application it would be very prejudicial on availabilityof new housing.”Councillor Peter Lavery said he was in agreement with this assessment but was mindful of the need to continue to monitor road use as the dferent phases of this application were submitted.Ulster Unionist Councillor Sam Nicholson said there was work to be done with this application.“The traffic problem is not a unique problem and I don’t think we can blame the developer for that, the onus is on the Department to future proof the road network,” said Councillor Nicholson.SDLP Councillor Mealla Campbell said she had been reassured by all she had heard and proposed accepting the outline application.This proposal was seconded by Councillor Paul Duffy and committee members voiced their agreement.Speaking on behalf of Sustar, development consultant Michael Hannath welcomed the positive decision for this application which he said will be very signicant for the local area. He said: “Demand for new homes in this location remains very healthy and our agents have already received direct expressions of interest from over  parties for future housing in the next phases since the first phase at Bracken Hall was completed.”Michael went on to point out that the application has already gone through a rigorous planning process and has been subject to a wider environmental impact assessment and subsequent comprehensive environmental statement. As part of that process, he said, there have been detailed traffic assessments carried out and important input from a multi-disciplinary team of competent experts led by planning consultants Oriel Planning. Detailed surveys and reports have been carried out in Traffic and Transport, Ecology, Hydrogeology, Geology and Soils, Drainage and Flood Risk, Noise and Vibration, Air Quality and Contaminated Land and Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment. In addition, community consultation events have taken place at which feedback has been received and taken on board. He said: “Some local residents have objected to the proposal because of concerns that they believe increased housing will add to an already congested stretch of road between the Lisnisky Lane roundabout and the hospital roundabout and heading into town. The main concerns appear to be around traffic congestion at peak am times particularly where we have the merging of traffic from the two-lane carriageway into a single lane coming from Craigavon direction and heading towards the hospital.”Michael pointed out: “Numerous consultations with Dfi roads over the past three years have informed the proposals and detailed design considerations have been integrated in order to address these concerns. The development team are confident that the development meets the design requirements and policy set out by Dfi Roads and this has been confirmed by Dfi roads in their final consultation responses. “The current proposal includes the widening of Lisnisky Lane at the approach to roundabout . There will be a flare lane added at the bottom of Lisnisky Lane for traffic turning left towards town which should reduce the traffic backing up in this area and permit traffic flow coming down Lisnisky Lane to go around the roundabout and head out of town.“In addition, the approval has a condition which requires the delivery of a second access to the lands before the occupation of the th house.“Sustar have been working with Dfi Roads and the Trust to assist with the delivery of a suitable option and a design for a new roundabout on Lisnisky Lane at the back entrance to hospital has now been finalised.“The developer has been working with Dfi roads and the Trust to facilitate the delivery of this for some time now and we understand a planning application is expected to be lodged imminently by the Trust. The proposed roundabout approved will provide a new well needed second access to the Hospital, a realignment of Lisnisky Lane heading to the old Lurgan Road and a connection into the development lands. This roundabout would greatly relieve the peak hour traffic congestion.”Michael was keen to point out that the positive economic impact of this development is “very signicant for the local economy. It will generate employment and jobs across a iety of disciplines, construction jobs, both skilled and unskilled as well as jobs in the materials supply and marketing sectors”. In total the development costs of this housing scheme are estimated to be in excess of £ million at present day costs “with a consequential inflow of benefits both financial and social into the local and wider economies”.
