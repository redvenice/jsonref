He was born in Oxford in 1946, went to university in Ibadan, Nigeria, is based in Berlin and has spent long periods in Khartoum, Bamako, Cairo and Dakar. He has suggested that the cities choose him: “They call out my name, and if I am fully awake, I hear the call and gradually wend my way toward them.”\u0026nbspHe took this picture at Bar Beach on Victoria Island in Lagos in 2006. The woman in her white Sunday robes stands in curious relation to the three deck chairs. In other pictures in an ongoing series from the beach – Sea Never Dry – white tourists sit in similar chairs watching the procession of workers and schoolchildren pass by on the sand. Here the chairs are empty, and the woman expresses a quiet gesture of expectation or supplication, almost lost against the pale greys of sea and sky. The picture sets the tone of a retrospective of Akinbiyi’s work in Berlin entitled Six Songs, Swirling Gracefully in the Taut Air. Lagos is a city of nearly 20 million people, yet in among the frenzy of street scenes, Akinbiyi’s camera invariably locates little moments of stillness, like cool alleyways of time.\u0026nbspAkinbiyi studied literature before he became a photographer and his model has always been Langston Hughes, the great poet of the Harlem renaissance. In particular he has been drawn to Hughes’s philosophy, encapsulated in the title of his autobiography, I Wonder As I Wander. Like Hughes, Akinbiyi is a walking artist, part of the scene he describes, waiting for images to make sense around him. When he was interviewed about his Berlin show, and asked about his photographic technique, he preferred to talk of conscious breathing, of finding the mental space in the midst of frantic urban busyness to see what might actually be going on.\u0026nbspAkinbode Akinbiyi: Six Songs, Swirling Gracefully in the Taut Air is at Gropius Bau, Berlin, until 19 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46ee1252232101b3ad892d05ac8432ac19fcd71b/0_0_2399_1440/master/2399.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79b7797d29ee03a402acf5f76ef3d044","title":"the uks government coronavirus strategy shoddy by design","story":"Are the haphazard, confusing and ‘strikingly ugly’ visuals of the government’s Covid-19 messaging a cunning attempt to connect with ‘real’ people or just one more measure of its incompetence?“It looks like a brochure for a very bad wellness clinic,” says Simon Esterson, designer and co-owner of the graphics magazine Eye. He’s describing the announcements made by the chancellor on social media, in the middle of the gravest economic and health crisis of most people’s lifetimes, to impart matters of vital importance to the public. CORONAVIRUS JOB RETENTION SCHEME EXTENDED, says one, all caps, sandwiched between the words WE STAND TOGETHER. Underneath, like a celebrity endorsement, is Rishi Sunak’s signature.\u0026nbspAnother, announcing the Treasury’s bounce-back loan scheme, randomly extends a horizontal off one “B” and the vertical off another such that they randomly cross over each other. “It looks to me more likely done by someone who’s got a degree in economics than design,” says Esterson. “It can only have been done by someone who’s in a graphic timewarp, unless it’s a very sophisticated parody.”\u0026nbspThe colours, font and layout of the different announcements vary wildly, and are at odds with the usual sober graphics of government departments. They are part of a more general haphazardness in the government’s visual imagery, such as the “stay homestay alert” virus messages (designed by the MullenLowe marketing agency), which Eliza Williams, of Creative Review, calls “strikingly ugly” and “very confusing”.\u0026nbspOr the five-level “alert system”, which was rapidly compared to Nando’s “peri-ometer”, for measuring the spiciness of chicken.\u0026nbspA 3D example is Boris Johnson’s delivery of a crucial speech from behind a back-to-front desk wedged into a Downing Street doorframe. Sometimes there’s the pomp of symmetrical union flags and oak doors sometimes the ad hoc informality of Dominic Cummings sitting behind a cheap-looking table in Number 10’s rose garden while sitting on an incongruous maroon and gold chair. As was pointed out on Twitter, he looked like he was selling raffle tickets at a village fete. Johnson, in his doorway, looked like he was welcoming visitors to a stately home.\u0026nbspWhich, very possibly, is the point. If this government likes to define itself as the opposite of the metropolitan centrism of Tony Blair, then it follows that it rejects New Labour’s embrace of contemporary design. If Blair got Terence Conran to furnish the setting for an international conference (“I’ve seen the fuchsia and it works”, wrote the witty  columnist Boris Johnson), then it’s unsurprising that the current government looks as if it has bought its furniture from a Cotswolds charity shop. Uncool Britannia, you could call it.The guffaws of experts, in this reading, are what the government wants. “Who cares,” as Cummings said in a slightly different context, “about good looks?” Such disdain for consistency and elegance would be of a piece with Cummings’s famous trackie and beanie fashion sense. It would also follow on from the Conservatives’ “get Brexit done” election campaign, in which the party drew contempt for its use of the much-derided Comic Sans typeface and for its appropriation of club culture.\u0026nbspThe negative reaction was intended: not only did it get their messages retweeted, but it also portrayed the Tories – as Creative Review put it – as “‘real’ people, just as terrible at graphic design as the next normal person and in no way part of the London creative elite”. The campaign was credited to the creative agency Topham Guerin, which had previously helped Scott Morrison win re-election as prime minister of Australia with what it called “boomer memes”. These, as an anonymous insider put it, were “really basic and deliberately lame”.Esterson is himself at pains to stress the relative unimportance of design at this moment. “It’s much more useful to be a shelf-stacker in a supermarket than a graphic designer,” he says. But looks still matter to this extent: if it’s essential to deliver clear messages about the pandemic, then the clarity of their visual presentation is also important. Esterson argues that the overuse of capitals makes it harder to take in information. Williams says that the “stay alert” signs’ use of green – a colour denoting “go” – obscures the order to stay (mostly) still.\u0026nbspThe Sunak messages, she says, “lack seriousness”. She compares the current use of visuals unfavourably both to the memorable public information posters of the second world war and to the New Zealand government’s “well thought-out” campaign in the current crisis. This uses simple and ordered visuals, together with popular icons such as the Eden Park rugby ground, both to deliver information and promote a sense of national togetherness.\u0026nbsp“If they think it’s what the person in the street wants it’s a failure,” says Esterson of the British government’s efforts. “The person in the street is being patronised.” He does, however, note that the “stay alert” posters have at least achieved at least one kind of success. Like the “Keep Calm and Carry On” poster (which was conceived during the war but not widely used at the time), it lends itself to endless parody. They lodge in the brain, even if their messages don’t.\u0026nbspAs often with this government, it’s unclear whether we’re dealing with bumbling fools or tactical masterminds. Perhaps the Sunak signature is a brilliant way to connect with the general public. Perhaps it is simply a symptom of rivalry between numbers 11 and 10 Downing Street, with the chancellor wanting to imitate Donald Trump’s signing of US coronavirus relief cheques before Johnson got the idea for himself. A Treasury spokesman was unable to tell me who designed Sunak’s announcements nor was he aware of any Whitehall masterplan to impose consistently inconsistent graphics on the nation.\u0026nbspThe most likely explanation, given what else we know about the handling of the pandemic, is offered by Williams: “If the design looks a bit shoddy, you think what’s going on is a bit shoddy.” In which case, whoever is behind the government’s visual imagery, they speak more truth than they realise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf659f34c6db1fec8de8326097dcfe7c71d9cf51/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dd4749f1f00e4abe131b3ea35ef82c1","title":"yinka ilori colourful world london nigeria public spaces","story":"The British Nigerian designer on thinking big, bright and positive Walking into Yinka Ilori’s west London studio from the drab suburban business park outside is to enter an oasis. Floor-to-ceiling shelving is lined with the brightly coloured, upcycled chairs, painted or upholstered in West African fabrics, that made Ilori’s name when he first left college. Lush houseplants are dotted around and a portrait of his smiling grandmother sits behind his desk, resplendent in a gele, a traditional head tie. He refers to the picture as we talk about his family’s influence on his work.“My work is very much about inclusivity and how people enjoy design,” says the 33-year-old. There is also a sense of story, of people communicating, something that started at London politan University when he was in his second year studying product and furniture design. He was set a project called Our Chair, which referenced Italian designer Martino Gamper’s 100 Chairs in 100 Days (Gamper transformed 100 discarded chairs into entirely new, brilliantly sculptural pieces).“That was my introduction to Gamper in 2008,” says Ilori. “I thought it was incredible: old objects, new stories, new functions. Simple, but so powerful. That’s what I love – storytelling and exploring memories through design.”Ilori ran with the idea. He scavenged chairs from skips and picked up those dumped on the street. He also incorporated his own history into his designs. Ilori is British with Nigerian parents: his father, a manager for B\u0026ampQ, and his mother, who first ran a corner shop – “I was very popular with my friends as we’d get our sweets after school” – and now cooks professionally for large events, raised Ilori and his two brothers and sister on an estate in north London.“You’re told you are Nigerian at home, but then you go to school and you’re British,” he says. “I lived in Essex Road in Islington, which is a really multicultural neighbourhood and that was nice, so I had the best of both worlds. But it was only when I visited Nigeria that I really got it. I got it that respect is hugely important for my parents: the culture, the language. I get why my parents wear a lot of colour. I understand their journey, their graft. I tried to complain less and respect the fact that they could leave Nigeria and start afresh. And so surely I can make something of myself here? That’s what I try to do.”His Nigerian heritage also appears in his designs. The parables that his parents told him as a child became an inspiration, the morality tales taking on new meaning now he was working to make a career for himself. Some chairs referred to the idea of hierarchy, the huge ide between rich and poor he saw firsthand in Nigeria. For some seats, he’d imagine very particular stories for their owners. Histories based on people he’d known at school who were headed for trouble, boys who had been abandoned by teachers, boys who didn’t fit in because English wasn’t their first language.Post-degree and after a three-month internship with the furniture designer Lee Broom (“I learned a lot from him”), Ilori applied for a £3,000 loan from the Prince’s Trust, wrote a 10-page business plan, and was off. “I wanted to be in the design industry, so I went away to work out who I wanted to be and how I was going to tell my story.”Johanna Agerman Ross, curator of 20th century and contemporary furniture and product design at the V\u0026ampA, nominated Ilori to take part in a project with the Danish textile brand Kvadrat . “I discovered Yinka when he was working with the Restoration Project, a charity in east London that brought together people in need of respite from difficult circumstances to restore old furniture. For me it was a simple, but effective way of using design as a communication and interaction tool. It’s clever and intuitive and, for me, really sums up Yinka.”The Kvadrat project is a group exhibition showcasing furniture created by 28 different designers using its Febrik material – Ilori’s project focuses on interaction: a key theme for the British-Nigerian designer. “We’ve created a crosshatch, four-way bench,” he explains. “In a public space you might find a bench fixed to the ground and that’s it. This is created so that four people can sit on it and change it around. It allows them to engage.” The upholstered seat is called A Trifle of Colour and is covered in Febrik’s ice cream-sprinkle pattern fabric. It has wooden backrest spindles that can be moved or removed altogether so that users can face in or turn away for their own space.Agerman Ross thinks the way Ilori proclaims his culture in such a forthright way is positive. “He foregrounds his British-Nigerian heritage so strongly – that’s one of the first things he says about himself when he presents his work. The design scene as a whole tends to focus on the northern hemisphere and there isn’t enough interaction with different cultures. In that regard Yinka as an artist is a really positive presence.”During a speech Ilori gave at the South African Design Indaba festival in 2017, so his audience might better understand his Nigerian background and its important to his work, he recreated one of his parents’ house parties on stage during his lecture. Kenyan musician “Blinky” Bill Sellanga DJed, and fellow lecturers and audience members danced. His vision of Nigerian culture feels celebratory and joyous, and that is apparent in his work. There’s a sense of Nigerian sunlight, energy, music and family in the forms, colours and patterns of just about everything he designs.“I’ve also grown up watching my mother and grandmother style themselves. How confident and bold they were with colour combinations. It’s beautiful.”Ilori founded his four-person studio in 2017 and the last few years have proved transformational for the designer and his team. A very conscious move from being known as the “guy who does colour” and upcycling (a word that Ilori isn’t fond of: “I prefer pre-loved”) to taking on public projects on a greater scale.In June 2019 there was a playground installation for Pinterest shown at the Cannes Lion International Festival of Creativity, which encouraged adults to cut loose and play, followed by an immersive exhibition design at Somerset House in London for Get Up, Stand Up Now – a show celebrating 50 years of black creativity in the UK. Ilori also created the highly successful Happy Street, a permanent enamel-panelled installation under a bridge in Battersea’s Thessaly Road, after winning a competition run by the London Festival of Architecture and the local council. And last summer he won another contest with The Colour Palace , a wooden pavilion inspired by Lagos markets, installed in the grounds of the Dulwich Picture Gallery during the festival. It has given Ilori a taste for more architectural-scale projects.“There’s a great honesty and integrity in his approach and a real belief in the ability of good design and colour to uplift a place and uplift people,” says Tamsie Thomson, the festival’s director, who commissioned Happy Street and The Colour Palace. “That’s why he won both competitions. The underpass was hideous. It’s right next to a school and is heavily used by pedestrians. The impact that a piece like his has on improving everybody’s daily life is huge.“From the London Festival of Architecture’s perspective, that’s really important to us – improving the everyday. Yinka and I have a standing joke that he’s not going to be happy until he’s done an airport, but that’s where I can see it ending up, with really significant commissions way beyond the level he’s getting now,” she says.Ilori’s confidence is rising as his projects increase in scale and ambition. “I like the idea of doing civic projects, but wasn’t sure that I could do it until now. Before doing the underpass in Battersea, I was scared of working with engineers and architects, but having done it and then the pavilion, I’m really hungry for more. I love that people will have access to my work – that makes me really happy. Architecture and design should be for everyone.”Ilori’s 2020 has been rerouted like everyone else’s. Projects have been pushed back or fallen away during lockdown. “But actually I’ve been looking at how to use this time positively,” he says when we speak in May. “I’ve spent a lot of time developing ideas during these months of being forced to slow down and evaluate.”Time alone in his studio has led to the development of a homeware range. “I’ve been meaning to do it for ages – plates, bowls, trays and mugs – people have also been asking for upholstery fabric so we’re working on that.”He has also created a public art installation in response to Covid-19 in support of the NHS in a poster space at Blackfriars in Southwark. It’s inspired by sketches for the A\u0026ampE department at Chelsea \u0026amp Westminster hospital. The message, written in vibrant pink, is the perfect message from Ilori: “Better days are coming, I promise”.• Knit! by Kvadrat will be launched at Denmark’s 3 Days of Design in September﻿"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cae6e7ff4d0d003889c73f5c89bedf73c859c753/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f43747c6fa0d37620cdb07b7b1f19249","title":"are you returning to work in a non essential shop in england","story":"We would like to hear from those who will be going back to work in retail shops that have been closed during lockdownAll non-essential shops in England will be able to reopen on Monday as announced by the business secretary, Alok Sharma.

Has the prospect of wind-powered cargo finally landed?The French schooner De Gallant docked in Falmouth harbour at the end of May, three months after leaving the port of Santa Marta in Colombia laden with tonnes of sustainably sourced coffee beans.This wind-powered sail cargo of carbon-neutral coffee was worth the wait, according to Yallah Coffee, a single-origin coffee roastery only a few miles away in the Cornish port town.Yallah’s special Colombian coffee grounds and beans are finding their way into coffee shops and restaurants across the country. Using a sailboat to import the beans into the UK made the first leg of their voyage almost entirely carbon neutral.For Richard Blake, the owner of Yallah Coffee, the delivery was the culmination of almost five years developing the idea for a sustainably sourced coffee without the huge carbon footprint of most imported beans.\u0026nbspBy using a traditional sailboat, the 7,500-nautical mile trip has a carbon footprint close to zero. A traditional shipping container might have emitted two tonnes of carbon. A plane would expend 178 tonnes of CO2.\u0026nbsp“It has been quite a long road for us to get to this point,” Blake said. “The idea is great, but when you’re running a business it’s so much easier to go down the well-trodden path and buy coffee through traditional routes.“There is a toss-up between the ideal and trying to make the product affordable. We have realised that it is possible – it just might take a little longer. So we changed how we look at stock levels, and where we need things when, so the extra transit time didn’t matter – it just needed a little extra planning,” he said.The realisation that sail cargoes can make sense from a business perspective is slowly percolating through ethically minded firms, giving rise to new supply-chain practices and shipping ventures.“Whilst the shipping cost was higher than if it had gone on a big tanker, we worked with the right people and were able to produce a reasonably priced product. There are savings in the fact that we are cutting out the middle men and buying directly from our partners in Colombia. The price the farmers received for this coffee was way higher than the ‘fair trade’ price, by quite some margin,” Blake says.The price for consumers, although far from cheap, is a fair one too, says Blake. Yallah is selling its sail cargo coffee at £9.30 for a 250g bag, in line with its other imported coffees and on a par with other specialty coffee companies, including Caravan and Monmouth Coffee.Sail cargoes are likely to remain limited by their logistical challenges there are only a relatively small number of vessels on offer, which undertake a limited number of runs and only at certain times of the year. But wind-powered cargo shippers note a growing interest in a carbon-neutral alternative to traditional fossil fuel-powered tankers and planes.Alex Geldenhuys, the owner of New Dawn Traders, which shipped Yallah’s first carbon-neutral coffee cargo, says inquiries for sailboat shipping have been on the rise in recent years.“In general the public awareness around the impact that a product’s supply chain can have on the environment is growing,” Geldenhuys says. “The volumes in sail cargoes are still really tiny, but the trend is there. It will play a part in a multi-faceted attack on the way we trade today.”New Dawn delivered its first cargo in 2013: a barrel of fine rum from the Dominican Republic, which was blended and bottled in Falmouth as New Dawn Rum. Today olive oil makes up the largest proportion of New Dawn’s cargoes transported throughout Europe alongside wine, almonds, olives and specialty honey.Today New Dawn’s Voyage Co-Op project allows buyers to pre-order cargo ranging from a single bottle to several tonnes of goods and fetch it from the ship. The company is one of more than 70 shippers that are part of the International Windship Association set up to help the sector collaborate on initiatives which can help to make wind-powered shipping more economic.Beyond the carbon emission savings, the mission of many in the burgeoning sector is to shorten supply chains to allow more transparency for customers, and fairer prices for farmers and consumers.The beginnings of this trend are already apparent in the rising number of consumers opting to buy locally sourced goods which rely on more sustainable practices and reduce their “food miles”.“I hope that evolves into thinking about the whole system,” says Geldenhuys. “Sometimes long-distance transport is necessary for a balanced and sustainable supply chain, so sail cargoes have a role to play in that.“Twenty years ago, buying organic was seen to be a bit ‘hippy’, but that has gone mainstream now along with buying fair trade and recycling. Understanding the impact of transporting goods is the next frontier.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb4dc73a1dc8dc5ab331ffe78654595094a554e8/0_117_3538_2125/master/3538.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51e5fbe8fe9d209e975fc53c1424e8dd","title":"uk economy to shrink 8 percent in 2020 with coronavirus recovery not until 2023 forecasters say","story":"EY Item Club further downgrades UK economic prospects with full recovery unlikely until 2023Mark Gregory, EY UK’s chief economist, said: “This is an undoubtedly challenging environment for businesses and forecasting is extremely difficult.

It’s the same pattern. These companies advertise due diligence and transparency – and in practice it’s exactly the opposite. As an archaeologist, my first responsibility is to let people know about my research and findings.”Tsirogiannis, a former senior field archaeologist at Cambridge University, is associate professor at the Institute of Advanced Studies at the University of Aarhus in Denmark. Because his academic research has focused on antiquities and trafficking networks, Greek and Italian authorities gave him official access in the early 2000s to tens of thousands of images and other archival material seized in police raids from iniduals involved in the illicit trade.Included in that were photographs and documents seized by the police from Gianfranco Becchina, who was convicted in Greece for illegally dealing in antiquities.Tsirogiannis was shocked to discover apparent links to Becchina in the four antiquities offered in a three-part Christie’s auction that ends on 16 June. He downloaded the original printed catalogue, but later discovered that those four objects were subsequently removed from the online site with no explanation.The Roman marble hare, for example, originally appeared as lot 49, dated to the second to third century AD with an estimate of $20,000 (£15,900) to $30,000. Now lot 48 simply jumps to lot 50.Tsirogiannis said: “The hare is depicted in the Becchina archive with its ears broken, but at least one of them is depicted lying in front of the sculpture. It was obviously restored later to its original position.“According to a Becchina document, the hare was bought for 13,000 Italian lire, from a looter called ‘Tullio’ in 1987, which predates the ‘provenance’ given by Christie’s. Tullio sold several other – also unrestored – antiquities to Becchina at the same time.”Tsirogiannis also recognised the bronze Roman eagle, from around the second to the third century AD and originally lot 25 in the Christie’s sale, from the Becchina archive.He also had no doubt that the former lot 121, an Attic red-figured pelike dated around 430-420 BC, was “definitely the same piece as the Becchina one,” and that lot 113, an Attic black-figured band cup, from around 540-530 BC, was almost certainly the same as one in the Becchina archive. He said: “Its Polaroid is stuck on an A4 page together with other Polaroids depicting other wonderful antiquities, also pre-restoration, that were supplied to Becchina by Raffaele Monticelli, a convicted middleman and one of the main suppliers of Becchina of illicit antiquities from south Italy.” Monticelli was sentenced in 2002 to four years in prison for trafficking illicit antiquities.Over 15 years, Tsirogiannis has identified about 1,100 looted artefacts within auction houses, commercial galleries, private collections and museums. In alerting Interpol and other police authorities, he has played a significant role in securing the repatriation of many antiquities.A Christie’s spokeswoman said: “Christie’s can confirm that lots 25, 49, 113 and 121 were withdrawn from the auctions following the provision of new information by the appropriate authorities from archives currently still unavailable to our researchers. We take our research very seriously. We always act appropriately on additional information when provided, particularly where we don’t have access to helpful archives, and the number of lots affected by such situations remains very few.”But Tsirogiannis believes auction houses have a responsibility to make effective checks with the archives. He said he had repeatedly told them that it was possible to send photographs of any antiquity to the Italian or Greek authorities to be checked. If they had done this, he said, “they would have found these objects depicted in those archives before they compiled the catalogue”.Among other antiquities identified by Tsirogiannis is an ancient Greek bronze horse, which Sotheby’s New York had planned to sell in 2018 until he notified Interpol and the US authorities of its links to the disgraced British antiquities dealer Robin Symes. Last week, Sotheby’s lost its legal challenge and Greece’s culture minister hailed the court’s ruling as a significant victory for countries fighting to reclaim antiquities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db5d5e77954c2a2fcf4cf2426a9743ba7fd36daf/0_104_2981_1788/master/2981.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=660a19353a4525393f7bff5a63cc6cc9","title":"a rewrite of the history syllabus is long overdue","story":"Calls for more inclusive teaching in schools have been ignored for years, writes Marika Sherwood, one of the founders of the Black and Asian Studies Association. Stewart Fergusson reminds us of Gove’s response to an expert review. Plus letters from Maria Goulding, Alan Jenkins and Belinda KingThat the school curriculum had to be changed (MPs demand review of national curriculum, led by black leaders, 10 June) was a major issue taken up by the Black and Asian Studies Association from its foundation in 1991. We were in constant correspondence with the Department for Education, including Ofsted, and even met with their heads. In 2005 we organised a conference on “Putting the ‘black’ back into British history: teaching inclusive history in schools”. As we all know only too well, we were ignored.The history we teach must include not only Africa prior to the arrival of Europeans, but the history of Africans in this country. As far as we know at the moment, they first arrived as a whole regiment within the conquering Roman army some settled here when discharged. So it is a very long history.My research has been mainly on black political activists from around 1900, when the first pan-African conference was held in London. Through interviews in various cities I discovered that there have been black organisations everywhere, for many years, often taking up issues of racial discrimination. So I tried to search local archives and the National Archives at Kew. The very few files available indicated that the organisations and activists had been under surveillance and that reports had been sent to government departments. So I made requests under the Freedom of Information Act for the release of papers on these organisations and activists.In 1988 I also began writing to the Foreign Office, the Home Office, MI5 and the politan police, asking for the release of papers. Nothing was released. Not wanting to give up, I asked Paul Boateng if he could ask in the House of Lords for the release of files. In October 2019 he asked for the files on Claudia Jones and George Padmore – two activists on whom there should be many files. Response: no files on Jones two on Padmore – one will continue to be withheld, the other will be “edited”, then released.So the government manipulates “history” by withholding files from researchers. So no black population here prior to the Windrush, and no racial discrimination issues!Marika SherwoodOare, KentBewitched by the outdated Our Island Story of Henrietta Marshall, Gove predictably ignored the advice of the experts. Schama panned Gove’s response as “insulting and offensive” and characterised the proposed curriculum as “1066 and All That, but without the jokes” and Evans wrote of the “narrow tub-thumping jingoism of Gove”.If we are to get young people to have a balanced view of our history then I hope Gavin Williamson will be open-minded. He could usefully start by consulting Cannadine’s two thoughtful books on the subject, The Unided Past and The Right Kind of History. But don’t hold your breath.Stewart FergussonCountesthorpe, Leicestershire• What a wonderful piece by Diana Evans (Overcoming fears, discovering nature ... what I have learned from lockdown, 13 June). She’s given Gavin Williamson what he needs for a long overdue rewrite of national curriculum history. Rosa Parks, the slave trade, Christopher Columbus and the meaning of colonisation, the bloodthirsty greed of the British empire, Jamaican independence, Nelson Mandela, the indigenous tribes of the Caribbean islands and the kingdom of Benin. Her own children and her primary pupils are lucky indeed, but what about all other children of whatever heritage who are denied this knowledge?Maria GouldingGateshead, Tyne and Wear• The Fawlty Towers episode titled The Germans should be a compulsory part of the school history curriculum (UKTV to reinstate Fawlty Towers episode The Germans, 12 June). As someone born in 1940 I grew up with the history of the evils of the Germans in the 20th century. Sadly I doubt my children got a more nuanced critical perspective on such issues. Nor do I expect the current school curriculum à la Michael Gove offers such understanding.However, that episode opens up such understanding as to take us forward – into complexity.Alan JenkinsOxford• Lockdown gave my husband the chance to sort out his study.

The letter notes that the school has a house named after Richard Hakluyt, who promoted the English colonisation of the Americas, and boasts a society named after John Locke, whose Constitutions of Carolina justified slavery. It also has a statue to Elizabeth I, whom the pupils describe as “the monarch who began the English colonial project”.The UCL Legacies of British Slave ownership website reveals that Westminster School has at least 28 alumni linked to the slave trade. These include William Beckford, a former lord mayor of London who inherited an estate in Jamaica with 3,000 slaves.Dr Miranda Kaufmann, a historian whose blog promotes greater understanding of black British history, welcomed the pupils’ intervention.“There’s been quite a lot of movement on this among universities over the last couple of years but I’m not very conscious of many schools doing much. But … the pupils need to think personally about what they can do as well.”The letter also claimed that racist incidents at Westminster had been brushed aside.“It would be great to hear from you what concrete measures you have taken, or intend to take, to reverse a longstanding toxic culture of racism within the student body, which has long gone unpunished,” the pupils ask in their letter.In a statement, Westminster said it had established a “challenging racism committee” made up of staff and pupils and that it was reviewing its procedures to identify ways in which it could “ensure a erse school community that is truly reflective of the multicultural city in which we live”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85ceb82e8fc86ca40d78d67f86eabac18dc7bc5d/0_1590_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bf0af661816c0c3c3a2dbb6b8f24ba5","title":"margaret howell 50 years design katharine hepburn","story":"This year, Howell celebrates 50 years in design, from postwar austerity and men’s shirts for women to becoming a British national treasureIt’s half a century since Margaret Howell first ran her fingers over the cotton of the white shirt she is holding, but it still elicits a grin. “It’s that I was excited about,” she says, “Do you feel it? I wanted that softness, proper shirting and all the detail of buttons and buttonholes, but without any of the stiffness.” That feel was something she had first found in markets and jumble sales after she left art school in London in 1969. She initially used to refashion the old Jermyn Street shirts she rummaged for, and then, having sourced the precise weight of Egyptian cotton from David \u0026amp John Anderson in Glasgow, started to make her own.The shirt Howell is holding is in the basement archive of her shop on Margaret Street in London. It is “filed” on a rack with some of her other original pieces, all made nearly 50 years ago, and lovingly retained, along with drawings and adverts and photos and press clippings that chart the beginnings of her eponymous brand. From those beginnings Howell has established not only her landmark Wigmore Street store up the road, but a global presence that includes outlets in Paris and Florence and New York, more than 100 shops in Japan and revenues in excess of £100m a year.Howell is a spirited 73, slim and nervily self-effacing, in dark jeans and a green wool sweater. When she talks about the clothes she has made and kept, you are also aware she is talking about her life. Associations bleed into each other. A beautiful unlined linen jacket on the archive rack, another first that has become a staple, brings back childhood images of “men on the seafront, on the south coast, with their Sunday jackets on”. And also memories of her grandfather, who had a barber shop in Walton-on-the-Hill in Surrey, and a Victorian house where he grew peaches up the garden wall. And of visits to his sisters – Howell’s aunts – who lived in a Nissen hut on the South Downs, “built up on stilts, with a laundry underneath”, which Howell and her two sisters would visit on summer Sundays and then go swimming in the sea at Rottingdean.Other fabrics in the archive bring other memories. There is the memory of the worn gabardine of a coat that her father – an army captain in the war – gardened in, and the smell of bonfire smoke that it carried when he came up to read her a bedtime story. A corduroy jacket that recalls the style of a geography teacher at her school, which prompted her to find the best corduroy from a maker near Hebden Bridge. And then the trademark tweeds, Harris and Irish, that bring to her mind “going out from primary school and out on to the common and sitting on tufts of dry grass in the summer. Something of that feel.”All of these sensory elements were part of Howell’s original collections in the late 1970s and 1980s and they remain the cornerstones of her collections today. It is one thing to feel the associations of fabrics, it is another to bring them so consistently to life. “I don’t think I was consciously reacting to any of this,” she says, looking back on the five decades she is somewhat reluctantly (“it’s not really my thing”) celebrating. “I just had a sense of what I liked: clothes that were soft and casual and slightly oversized. I was always out of doors growing up and you needed clothes that you could move in easily.”Howell was born immediately after the war, in 1946, a fact that seems crucial to her aesthetic. She is a dozen years younger than Mary Quant, for example, and felt a different sense of liberation to the hedonism of the 1960s. She made her own clothes in her teens, but, she insists, putting the side of her hand to her jeans, her hemlines were never shorter than just above the knee. She was drawn rather to the understatement of Jean Muir. To the trouser suits of Yves Saint Laurent. “I loved the way that Katharine Hepburn wore men’s trousers,” she says, “or what seemed to be men’s trousers.” At school she remembers looking long and hard at the brown pin-striped suit of another female teacher, “which was deeply unfashionable, but which I knew I might be able to do something with”.Howell’s mother had worked in a dress shop in Reigate and had a style of her own. “She never went to the hairdresser’s like the other mums – my sister and I used to cut her hair – and she let it go grey.” They did not have much money, but at Christmas her mother would take her girls up to Selfridges, not only to look in the windows, but to buy them something that might last, like a Braemar wool cardigan. Or they would take trips up to Dickins \u0026amp Jones to choose some cotton for a dress.Her older sister, Jean, was a maker, too: silk scarves and Fair Isle sweaters. Howell helped with the silk printing before she came across her jumble sale shirts. She had a sense that she was going against the grain of the high street. “Everything that was going out of fashion, I wanted it back in,” she says. “All the traditional elements but done with more looseness, a different feel.” She was always grateful that her mother had never fallen for nylon sheets like everyone else. In terms of the 60s, you might think of it as her hankering for the simplicity of The Long and Winding Road and Mull of Kintyre after the extravagances of Sgt Pepper and the Maharishi.She has stayed true to her tactile inspirations. In her Wigmore Street shop, you have to resist running your fingers over everything. Her design studio is at the back of the store and she is here most days, except Wednesday, when she looks after her youngest, two-year-old granddaughter. She tries to focus on the clothes and leaves running the business to her managing director, Richard Craig. Two mornings a week, through the winter, she swims in the outdoor lido at Charlton, south-east London. She has a cottage near Woodbridge in Suffolk and she swims in the North Sea in the summer.The Suffolk house is the last of a terrace of six designed by the Swiss architect Rudy Mock in 1965: “a very end-of-the-road place”, she says, “and the coast is very raw there, with the North Sea bashing in and eroding it like mad.” She used to come to this coast with her children when they were small. Since her son Edward died in 2011, aged 30, it seems to have become more important to her as a place of refuge. She loves the flatness and the skies and the colours of marsh and lagoon and shingle inform the palette of her clothes.The original label was a collaborative effort with Paul Renshaw, later her husband. They set up the first workshop in their one-bed flat in Blackheath. “We had the bed raised up near the ceiling so we could have the sewing machines underneath,” she says. The kitchen was the office. “It prompted us to get married because the machinists came early and it stopped us having to be embarrassed scrambling around.”When her South Molton Street shop did open in 1977, women came in wanting to look like Annie Hall, and her style found a unisex moment that it has never lost. She used to take her two children, as babies, into the new workshop as the business expanded, but her marriage and her partnership with Renshaw eventually failed, and they orced in 1987. “He got too caught up in the glamour of it, I suppose you might say,” she says.The business had outstretched itself, too, and she saved it by agreeing a partnership with a Japanese businessman, Sam Segure, who wanted to sell her label under licence in Japan. Segure has allowed Howell to keep full control of design, as that business has grown steadily over three decades – even though Howell eventually sold her majority stake to a publicly listed Japanese company.The Japanese operation in particular has made Howell a wealthy woman, but her habits have not changed too much. She lives alone, in London and in Suffolk – she has “a friend” but “we could never live in the same house: he collects a lot of things”, she says with a shudder. Howell was sustainable decades before sustainability became a catwalk mantra. “We were a family that always darned socks,” she says. “As a rule I keep things I like until they wear out. I have had a cotton-linen towel, which is lovely after an open-air swim – and which they don’t really make any more. It is totally worn out, but I still use it. I don’t like having too many things.”That less-is-more philosophy seems woven into her clothes as well as her life. She has three principal designers now, but she insists on going with them to look at fabrics, which is where the magic often happens. She is drawn to things that are made on old looms. “It makes it slightly more irregular and raw,” she says, though she was surprised recently to like a soft white plastic fabric in Japan. “It reminded me of those clear plastic macs we used to have as kids from Woolworths,” she says. “Slightly sticky that lovely smell.”Does she still need to have the last say on everything?“Well it has my name on it, so yes. And I still want to try everything on myself. It is only then that I can feel it, and I can see the proportions more clearly. I still do that with everything we sell.”Her abiding satisfaction comes not from newness, she insists, but from the things that have always sold, and still sell consistently: the corduroys and the linens and the shirts and the tweeds. “That is when you know that everything works about it,” she says. “And that there is nothing at all unnecessary.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

A year on, he maintains the same plans and dreams, and talks of drawing inspiration from historic Blackpool greats such as Sir Stanley Matthews, but like everybody he could never have imagined the Covid-19 nightmare that has beset the country and football.This interview on the anniversary of his £10m takeover takes place in the shadow of Britain’s 63,000 excess deaths because of coronavirus and the alarming economic crisis.Blackpool, Sadler confirms, voted with the majority of League One clubs last week – thought to be 18 to 4 – for the unprecedented decision to curtail the season. He understood the minority of clubs pushing for promotion who wanted to play on but, with Blackpool anyway not in contention, he says they considered the huge cost – hundreds of thousands of pounds – of staging matches with no supporters present and no major TV income. Crucially, he also fears the virus spreading, with specific concerns for Blackpool.“I’d love to watch football but I really didn’t want to play on,” Sadler reflects. “I think it made sense to finish the season with as few matches as possible. Among the other issues, I thought that having 91 teams going up and down motorways was not necessarily a smart thing to do. There are clearly still new cases in the UK, and lockdown is being eased fast.”Sadler has experienced the virus being suppressed very effectively by rapid, strict measures in Hong Kong, where he lives and runs a hedge fund, Segantii. He worries about the different approach in Britain and particularly about his own parents, now in their 70s and with health problems that make them vulnerable. Blackpool, the famous, creaking seaside resort, may entertain a boom in visitors this summer as people face restrictions on overseas travel. “On the one hand that could be good for the town economically, but I’m really concerned about transmission of the virus increasing, really concerned about my parents, about how many lives could be lost because of people flocking to the town.”For the club he bought from the receivers after Oyston was found by a high court judge to have “illegitimately stripped” it of £26.77m, the rebuilding, including advanced plans for a new academy, has skidded into these awful uncertainties. There remain serious questions about whether next season will start at all if, as seems certain, supporters will not be allowed into grounds for months. Sadler believes football has not quite woken up yet to the scale of the crisis, and that money has to be shared by the Premier League.He supports the proposed introduction of a salary cap, having himself been drawn last season into signing some players on relatively high wages, including the midfielders Sullay Kaikai (from the Dutchtop-flight club Breda) and Grant Ward (previously at Ipswich), and the striker Gary Madine (from Cardiff). The hope to propel the club to immediate promotion under Simon Grayson, the manager he appointed soon after taking over, foundered in a losing streak that culminated in Grayson’s sacking in February. Sadler and his new chief executive, Ben Mansford, applied a more considered recruitment process, and in March gave the job to Neil Critchley, then the Liverpool Under-23s coach working with Jürgen Klopp. Sadler considers Critchley a progressive, expert coach, who shares the desire for entertaining as well as winning football. He is supported by Tommy Johnson, as head of recruitment, and two data analysts working on identifying players the modern way.He agrees with the EFL chairman, Rick Parry, who described parachute payments as “an evil that must be eradicated”, that these payments to relegated Premier League clubs seriously distort clubs’ finances throughout the isions. “Football needs to change or else we’re going to lose it,” he says. “Having seen how the community of Blackpool responded to getting its club back, I’m well placed to talk about it. I don’t want any more people to lose their clubs – they’re too important, to the social fabric of the country.”Nevertheless he remains emotional, awed, at having taken over his boyhood club, and hungry with ambition to restore it. He resists pouring much criticism on the Oystons, although Blackpool have taken legal action to evict the family and one of its companies from club offices and a penthouse apartment. He talks much more about having become “quite teary” watching the excellent Amazon Prime documentary about Matthews, marvelling at his achievements, that legendary performance in Blackpool’s 1953 FA Cup victory, and the maestro’s ethos of hard work and integrity. In the effort to forge success now, he says he prefers to draw from that example, as well as Alan Ball, a Blackpool player when he won the 1966 World Cup with England, and the universally respected Jimmy Armfield, a member of that squad who played 627 times for the club and 43 matches for England.“There is no inspiration to be drawn from the Oyston era,” Sadler says. “I want to dwell on the more positive aspects of our past, celebrate that history more – revisit those eras for inspiration.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b2e9c79e8796dad0a73dd256f7a5acd1322ed38/0_56_4678_2807/master/4678.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=978ed551804525c3c7f899d457c806f2","title":"premier league restart preview no 15 sheffield united","story":"European qualification is a glorious possibility and Chris Wilder’s side have a FA Cup quarter-final to look forward toWhat\u0026nbspwas the situation like when the league was suspended on 13 March? Supposed certainties for relegation, Chris Wilder’s team were the most heartening story of the season until the pause, seventh in the table with the knowledge that winning their game in hand would lift them to fifth. European qualification is a distinct and glorious possibility and they also have a FA Cup quarter-final at home against Arsenal, whom they have already beaten at Bramall Lane in the league this season.The Blades have a whole armoury of players who are thriving to an extent not seen at their previous clubs and their collective power within Wilder’s inventive system is reflected in the fact that they have the second meanest defence in the league, an extraordinary achievement for a team contesting their first season after promotion. They have sustained their strong form throughout the campaign, with their only defeats in their last 13 matches before the lockdown being to Liverpool and Manchester City.What about now? The squad is injury-free and Wilder may have welcomed the unexpected mid-season break insofar as it enabled him to rest a team that seldom changes (four of the back five have played every match of the season, while John Egan has missed only one). There were more good news at the weekend as the club reached a deal in principle with Manchester United for the goalkeeper Dean Henderson to stay beyond 30 June.What needs to be done to have a successful end to the season? Although the Blades’ tightness is due to much more than a fine goalkeeper, keeping Henderson is important. United could do with more sharpness up front. They are certainly not a negative team – no side can be sensibly called that when their centre-backs regularly raid\u0026nbspdown the wings – but they have mustered fewer shots than anyone else in the league, so there is a heavy onus to take the few chances they forge. That is not just down to their forwards, whose contributions to the team dynamic involve much more than\u0026nbspscoring. But with canny midfielder Robert Fleck their joint-leading scorer in the league with five goals, an increased strike rate from Lys Mousset (also on five goals), Oli McBurnie (four) or David McGoldrick (tantalisingly close to above zero) would be a boost.Have the players and staff behaved during lockdown? Yes.Any unsungcommunity heroes? In addition to joining his teammates in contributing to the Players Together fundraising scheme, Enda Stevens, formerly of Shamrock Rovers, donated to a fund set up in his home country for League of Ireland players left in financial hardship by the lockdown. Stoke’s James McClean and Burnley’s Kevin Long, both of whom also started their careers in the League of Ireland, did likewise.Key player in the run-in? Ollie Norwood. Sheffield United being the Premier League’s best example of the power of a perfectly calibrated and populated system, it is difficult to identify one player who is more important than the others. Henderson obviously performs a unique role but plenty of others also have critical specialities. Norwood is a vital cog in the heart of midfield, an ever-present whose ability to knit play together explains why he has completed more passes than any other player in the side this season while also winning more tackles than any of his midfield teammates.End-of-season-prediction\u0026nbspSeventh in the league and a Wembley appearance in the FA Cup.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c0c2239ec31ab5d2a803872a3fc71183e4bd600/0_380_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f62d7373173c739db43fe9fbee2955d5","title":"brands fans and influencers why social media for small business is about more than sales","story":"Standing out online can transform a business, but it takes focus and strategy. Here, three stars of social share what they’ve learnedMost businesses these days will have some form of social media presence, but many may not be making the most of the opportunities it provides. Not only does it open up a huge potential customer base – half the world’s population is now on social media – it also gives companies the perfect opportunity to build and retain loyalty among existing customers.Like all aspects of technology, social media is constantly evolving. So while a small business may have set up a Facebook or a Twitter account a few years back and thought that was a case of “job done”, new social media platforms such as TiKTok have been developed since then, while Instagram and YouTube have become vital parts of a holistic social media ecosystem.\u0026nbspBeyond the platforms themselves, trends have also changed in terms of what users want, how they interact with brands and what’s important to them. Customers have now become fans, emotional ties to brands are a thing and thought-leadership can make you an influencer. Content is still king, and shareability is vital.\u0026nbspBut as well as all this modern stuff – the basics are still important too.\u0026nbsp“On the high street you wouldn’t have a shopfront with a broken window, peeling paint, rubbish everywhere and goods randomly thrown on displays, and expect to thrive,” says PR and social media expert Mike Crutchley.As someone who helps businesses improve and overhaul their social media strategies, he says first impressions count.\u0026nbsp“Social media channels must be up to date with everything from posts to contact details and opening hours,” he says. “High-quality images and videos, as well as good grammar and spelling are as vital as creating engaging posts.”The tools that allow businesses to make this happen have never been more accessible, and there is now an opportunity to try some of them out free of charge. Customers of the website builder GoDaddy are currently receiving a complimentary 90-day premium subscription to the mobile app Over, which gives them access to simple templates for creating sleek and effective social media content.Sometimes the things that work best on social media are the simplest. You can have all the metrics and dashboards in the world, but if people don’t engage and share your original posts then you’re missing a huge potential source of customers.\u0026nbspWhen Dutch-born Londoner Annemarie Plas saw people in countries throughout Europe clapping for their healthcare workers she was inspired to help set up something similar in her adopted home, and so created clapforourcarers with GoDaddy.Scaling up quickly could well have proved a challenge, but with the astute use of social media things have gone from strength to strength.\u0026nbsp“I just put together a small image and posted it on my socials such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter, and sent it to all my UK friends by WhatsApp, I also made a small website and an Insta page,” says Plas.\u0026nbspHer efforts to spread the word were given a huge boost when her campaign was picked up by influencers such as the Beckhams and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who shared it to their followers.\u0026nbspThe first clap happened on Thursday 26 March at 8pm and became a weekly event, being covered by the national media and circulated widely on social media too, right up to the final clap on 28 May.Although Plas has a background working for media agencies, she had neither the time nor staff support that other organisations might be able to draw upon. So she decided to keep things simple and made shareability a big part of her strategy.\u0026nbsp“I understood the importance of having simple and engaging messaging. I used a hashtag and made the image easy to share on any social channels.”Her simple and consistent messaging has resulted in the #clapforourcarers hashtag being shared more than 139,000 times on Instagram alone.\u0026nbsp“Some influencers get a bad reputation,” says Masha Zvereva, founder of Coding Blonde. She set up her blog back in 2015, when she was trying to learn some coding skills to make her more employable. She originally registered it with GoDaddy, which she then also used as a hosting provider.Through that blog, as well as Instagram and YouTube, Zvereva has amassed a loyal following and is now regarded as an influencer in the field of women in tech, entrepreneurship and personal growth.\u0026nbsp“Influencers can be perceived as fake, superficial, salesy etc, but what people don’t see is the hard work that goes behind being able to make a living off of this business model and growing your business,” she says.Quality content is paramount according to Zvereva. Whether you’re filming a video for YouTube or writing a thought leadership piece, it has to add value beyond simply advertising your skills to the wider world.\u0026nbsp“Anyone can become an influencer if they want to, but I’d recommend approaching it from the standpoint of adding value to an audience,” she says.\u0026nbsp“What’s the purpose behind your blog? How will you be impacting people’s lives and who is your target audience? And finally, why should it be you?”Many people might still associate social media in a business context purely with selling, but its importance when it comes to building a brand can’t be overstated.\u0026nbspThis is something Zaffrin and Brian O’Sullivan, co-founders of the vegan skincare company Five Dot Botanics set out to do well before their company launched.Establishing it on Instagram even before they had products to sell, they were able to develop a loyal audience.\u0026nbsp“Social media has allowed small brands like mine to build a brand. Historically it would not have been possible to launch a beauty brand without millions of pounds to acquire customers through marketing,” says Zaffrin.\u0026nbspBefore setting up those social channels though, their first move was to register a domain name and get a URL through GoDaddy. Then it was time to get the ball rolling with social media.\u0026nbspThe stories the O’Sullivans shared weren’t all about success, but about the challenges they were facing. This honesty helped create a situation where people were rooting for them. The couple were also able to get 600 people signed up to their newsletter email list so there was already an eager customer base waiting for when the products were ready.Once the social channels were up and running, the O’Sullivans set up an internet landing page using GoDaddy’s services – and they were in business.Social continues to be at the heart of their marketing. As well as using Instagram for brand-building, Zaffrin posts to Pinterest and Facebook, although she says the latter works best for business if you’re willing to put money behind it – paying for targeted ads, for example. Otherwise the other platforms can be effective without budget, simply by skilful use. Zaffrin uses LinkedIn to raise her business profile and publish articles, and is curious about TikTok, saying it is “one to watch”.\u0026nbsp“Our audience are our fans,” she says. “They root for our success, and our customers on social tell us every day what they think and what they want. We are constantly listening to them, whether they’re letting us know how they are using our products or coming up with ideas for new ones.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

But lockdown has lent them a surprising new twist…Since the beginning of lockdown, a new path has sprung up in my local park – it snakes underneath a tree and up (and then down) a small hill, marking the way to the local Sainsbury’s. It is not an official path paved by keen construction workers in the dead of the night, but a “desire path” – a walkway made by hundreds of shuffling feet damaging the grass and eroding the ground beneath them. If “real” paths show us where we should go and how we should get there, then desire paths expose the complicated messiness of humanity. They are visible markers of our autonomy or, at the very least, our undeniable love of shortcuts.Desire paths aren’t anything new – the term has been traced back to the French philosopher Gaston Bachelard, who wrote of “lignes de désir” in his 1958 book The Poetics of Space. Nature author Robert Macfarlane has written more recently about the inherent poetry of the paths. In his 2012 book The Old Ways: A Journey on Foot, Macfarlane calls them “elective easements” and says: “Paths are human they are traces of our relationships.” Desire paths have been created by enthusiastic dogs in back gardens, by superstitious humans avoiding scaffolding and by students seeking shortcuts to class. Yet while illicit trails may have marked the easier (ie shorter) route for centuries, the pandemic has turned them into physical markers of our distance. Desire paths are no longer about making life easier for ourselves, but about preserving life for everyone.Michael Mayhew, a 56-year-old artist from Northampton who runs a library of books dedicated to food, has spotted three new desire paths in his local park, The Racecourse. “Because the grass isn’t being cut, you start seeing them. It doesn’t take long for a path to develop,” he says. “There are three all running in the same direction as the functional path – I just found it fascinating.” Mayhew believes the paths demonstrate how considerate people are being about keeping each other safe.But what do desire paths really tell us about ourselves, if anything? Are they poetic – or simply a pain for those who maintain public spaces? And what is the ultimate desire path success story: a path that is officially paved over – demonstrating the democratic power of thousands of feet – or a path that is allowed to remain as a messy marker of our messy lives?Elena Dorato and Gianni Lobosco are academics in the department of architecture at the University of Ferrara in Italy. In 2017, they co-wrote a paper called “Designing Desire”, in which they explored how predictive models could be used to visualise (and possibly pave) desire paths before they emerge. The academics explain that it is not always common for urban planners to base their development decisions on desire paths, and they wanted to explore how behavioural modelling could better inform design decisions. Yet at the same time, the pair don’t necessarily believe paved-over dirt paths are always the most desirable solution.“We believe the appearance of a desire line is not necessarily the marker of a wrong design choice,” they tell me by email. “We believe that a good project implementation should not perfectly retrace desire lines, but rather allow and accommodate a vast range of different behaviours and uses.” Dorato and Lobosco argue that the most important thing to consider when designing public space is “looseness” – our spaces must remain changeable so we can collectively alter our behaviours in unpredictable circumstances, such as the current pandemic. “What we’re learning from this situation is that public and collective spaces need to be as adaptable, loose and resilient as possible,” they say.The academics also have a semi-poetic attitude to desire lines: they argue that our cities still bear the physical traces of history such as wars, earthquakes and floods, and illicit trails leave similar legacies. “In a near future, some of the Covid-19 effects on the urbanscapes will be part of this narrative, reminding us of the importance of human behaviour in shaping the city space.”But if desire paths are so revealing, should we not dedicate more time to chronicling them? So far the phenomenon remains mostly documented by amateur photographers and bloggers – the anonymous writer “the gentle author” has shared illicit trails on his popular blog, Spitalfields Life, arguing that “each desire path tells a story. While our modern monolith, Google, ignores desire paths with its Maps service, others are attempting more official documentation. OpenStreetMap (OSM) is an international, crowd-sourced project to create a free map of the world – since 2004, thousands of volunteers have input data about roads, railways, rivers and yes, desire paths.According to OSM, most of the UK’s desire paths are in Nottingham and Leeds. It’s unclear if this is because there are actually more desire paths in these areas, or if these locations are simply home to avid OSM users. Kazazi puts me in touch with a Nottingham man who has documented a large number of desire paths, but unfortunately he declines to explain his motivations.Still, other people have easy explanations: they are paid to notice desire paths. Tom Ritzer is a landcare director at the University of Minnesota who anticipates and monitors what he calls “cow paths” as part of his job. Around 2012, a new physics and nanotechnology building was constructed at the university, and a new desire path quickly emerged on a slope between the building and the main road. “It was pretty unsightly and the soil was washing away,” Ritzer explains, so around 2015, his team paved the path with decomposed granite (a more stable form of gravel good for heavily used paths).Yet Ritzer’s paved path isn’t a direct copy of the desire path made by students’ feet. While planning the path, Ritzer added a small curve to comply with local accessibility laws that determine how steep a sloped path can be. But Ritzer also couldn’t make the curve too large for fear of students creating an extra desire path as they cut corners. “I think it turned out pretty well,” he laugh. “It does accommodate a lot of foot traffic and it’s a nice way to experience that particular part of the landscape.”Closer to home we’ve seen similar initiatives. Councillor Damian White of Havering says a Tarmac path and crossing was paved on a grassy verge in his London borough between 2017 and 2019 for “safety reasons”. “The damage to the public green is thought to have been created by increased footfall as a cut-through from the shops and bus stops,” he explains, adding that the uneven surface was unsafe and he was “very pleased” when the official path was paved. “It has now improved the look of the area and better reflects what our residents expect.”But not every desire path can be paved. Ritzer has been a landscape architect for 30 years and says there’s “no middle ground” between choosing to accommodate foot traffic or choosing to prevent it. He has used granite to pave over desire lines and planted bushes or constructed barriers to stop would-be desire paths in their tracks. “It’s driven by safety, or sometimes we’re trying to protect a particular tree and we don’t want compaction around the roots,” he explains. “Other times it’s just aesthetic.” In rare circumstances, Ritzer has simply left dirt paths alone – he says one that runs through a wooded area on campus is “charming” and a “nice experience” for students.When it comes to desire paths, it’s apparent that we can’t always get what we want. Some paths will always remain illicit, while others demonstrate the power we have to change our own environments for the collective good. “We are living through a moment where we’re all being asked to consider where we go, who we go near, what our distance is,” says Mayhew, the Northampton man who discovered three new paths in his local park. “I think desire paths are very beautiful, poetic marks of democracy.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2ab21d8eafc252b42868706f128197a011b0b14/0_355_2973_1784/master/2973.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9493e9f83621e8ee5b261b6ebbf81dd","title":"entering a convent led me to the love of my life another nun my soulmate","story":"Monica and Peg’s relationship was ‘strictly taboo and vehemently condemned’, but that did not prevent them from building a life togetherSixty years ago, as an idealistic 21-year-old seeking to do good, I made the unusual decision to enter the convent. Twenty years later, on the other side of the world, that decision would play a major part in meeting the love of my life, another nun – my soulmate.I came from a typical Catholic family of that time. We accepted without question all the church teachings, a slow-drip indoctrination.\u0026nbspI happily embarked on this path, becoming a “bride of Christ” (a peculiar, inexplicable ritual) and donning the veil and habit to signify I was set apart from the enticements of the world.I loved teaching, but after some years I became disenchanted with the path I was on, and requested leave of absence from religious life.\u0026nbspI travelled to South America.\u0026nbspIt was the first step towards meeting Peg. I still can’t explain why I chose to return to the convent, but that choice, at the fork in the road, took me on the path to her.\u0026nbspBack in Australia, I obtained a social work degree and proceeded to work in a community health centre, serving the needs of high-rise flat residents in Melbourne’s North Richmond. They were predominantly newly settled migrants and refugees. The work was challenging but rewarding and the team of health workers an inspiration.During those years I was corresponding with an American Mercy nun working in Nicaragua, a country racked with political turmoil and violence. She invited me to join her small group working among the poor.At the time I was an active member of Amnesty International and very involved in the struggles of people across the globe. I was drawn to take up her offer and approached our governing board to ask permission. My request to go to Nicaragua was refused because of the dangerous situation, but I was offered the opportunity to go to Chile instead. Two Australian Mercies were already working there with American Mercies.And so it came to pass, eight years after first setting foot on Latin American soil I was on my way to meeting the love of my life.I met this beautiful woman in Santiago, Chile, in 1983.\u0026nbspShe was an American, a Franciscan nun who had been living and working in Chile some 17 years.\u0026nbspIt wasn’t love at first sight, but only months later I fell for her deeply.\u0026nbspLove is a wonderful thing! When it happens, you want to shout if from the rooftops – you want the world to know about this extraordinary experience. But the world didn’t want to know about us, the homosexuals. In fact there were many who preached that hate, discrimination and even death were only fitting for the likes of us.We moved in together.\u0026nbspWhile we wanted to continue our work with disadvantaged women, we could not remain members of our respective religious groups. Our relationship was strictly taboo and vehemently condemned by the church hierarchy.\u0026nbspIn order to request dispensation from our vows, we had to write to the Catholic hierarchy in Rome. By return mail we were promptly set free.We continued our life together in Chile for another nine years, an experience difficult to encapsulate in just a few words.\u0026nbspWe lived under a brutal military dictatorship but found our work with the shanty town women, and the friendships of other professional women inspired us, carrying us through the dark times.\u0026nbspAnd above all we had each other.Then we moved back to my home country Australia. It was here that an unexpected challenge arose.\u0026nbspIn 2003 the Vatican issued an edict to all the Catholic bishops in every diocese across the globe.In this many-paged document, the Roman cardinals described homosexuals as “seriously depraved” and “evil”.\u0026nbspThey particularly directed their\u0026nbspinstructions to the Catholic politicians of the world, telling them they were “morally obligated” to oppose any legislation that would grant us equal rights, and if such laws already existed, they were to do all in their power to repeal them.Peg and I had long since left the church and pronouncements from the Vatican did not concern us but this blistering attack on a global scale did. It meant that their dictates aimed to impose their beliefs on our secular society and to deprive us of basic human rights. I immediately wrote a letter to the then Archbishop George Pell, my second cousin.I challenged him to look me in the eye and describe me as seriously depraved. I asked him to consider what he was doing to people like us, the harm his church was inflicting, and much more.\u0026nbspHe ignored me.\u0026nbspAfter several attempts to contact him, I asked the Age to publish it as an open letter.\u0026nbspThe response from the public was widespread: affirmative, grateful and appreciative.In the intervening years the damaging condemnations from the Vatican have thankfully been ignored by most Australians and we have equal rights in almost every aspect of our lives.Over the years my beloved Peg and I had often discussed the societal barriers to our relationship as the campaigners for equality determinedly pursued their goal. I will always be grateful to these brave warriors. It was a long and arduous and at times very painful and humiliating battle to achieve the same rights as heterosexuals: to eliminate our second-class citizenship status.We decided should the marriage equality law ever eventuate we would declare our commitment to each other in a public ceremony –with a big party! It would be one small contribution to the elimination of “otherness” that so many still experience.Those same years have revealed the horrors, the pain and anguish the prelates of this church have inflicted on innocent, vulnerable children by the millions across the globe. They have lost all credibility, especially in claiming the moral high ground on any issue.I would hope that the good and decent Catholic believers may one day soon decide they no longer need this clerical caste to serve their God and return to meeting in small groups like the early Christians, sharing eucharist, striving to be humane and compassionate people.When the memorable day we achieved marriage equality – 7 December 2017 – finally came the parliament erupted in jubilation.As I sat alone watching history unfolding, I wept.My beautiful Peg had died six years before of gall bladder cancer – it was 12 weeks from diagnosis to death. My tears flowed on one hand for joy, for all those who would benefit from this huge shift in society, and on the other in deep sadness because we would not step out together in a public ritual and declare to all and sundry: “Look at how we love one another!” Peg with her joy of living and her fun-filled nature would have made it the most memorable wedding ever. I cannot put into words how I miss her touch and her tenderness every single day.You can hear more about Monica and Peg’s story on SBS\u0026nbspInsight\u0026nbsptomorrow at 8.30pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb778bbbfee8c30797a1808c8d5eb5c3ceb468bb/0_85_6007_3597/master/6007.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c60129166a78777315b32e8425b47636","title":"phoebe bridgers aged 12 or 13 i was just like im the next bob dylan","story":"As she prepares to release a second album, the Californian indie rocker reflects on provocative lyrics, recent collaborations and what she now thinks of Ryan AdamsYou are a talented young musician whose career has taken off in the past couple of years. Artists you greatly admire want to collaborate with you, declaring themselves “floored” by your music, and excitable comparisons are made to the work of Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen. Now you’re touring the world, jetting off to faraway places that you could only dream about while growing up in west-coast suburbia. But when you get there – to Japan, say – you find yourself strangely unmoved by your surroundings. Worse, you end up longing for the everyday comforts you’ve left behind. You would rather skip the visit to the temple or the ride on the bullet train with your bandmates and sneak home.This is the predicament in which Phoebe Bridgers finds herself on her new album, Punisher, a collection of beautifully wrought songs that cast a razor-sharp eye on the absurdities of modern life. In Bridgers’s lyrical universe, dreams that appear beguiling from a distance are liable to fall flat in the space of a chorus. “I wanted to see the world,” she sings rousingly on Kyoto. “Then I flew over the ocean And I changed my mind.”This was meant to be a particularly busy time for Bridgers, whose album, her second, comes out on Friday. “Before all this started,” she says, “my publicist told me I didn’t have one day off for three months.” When we speak, Bridgers should be somewhere in the American heartlands on tour with the 1975, on whose new album she features. She looks it up on her calendar. “We’re supposed to be between Colorado and Omaha. Damn it!”But maybe it’s about time she had a rest. Three years ago, Bridgers released her debut album, Stranger in the Alps, to admiring reviews. The NME called it “luscious but deeply sad”, while Pitchfork declared the single Motion Sickness, written after Bridgers’s separation from disgraced rocker Ryan Adams (more on him later), “one of the year’s most exquisite breakup anthems”.Taking three years to deliver a follow-up may seem pretty laidback, until you consider that Bridgers has released two more records in the interim: an EP with Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus as Boygenius and the album Better Oblivion Community Center with Conor Oberst, who described her easy falsetto as “an old friend you didn’t know you had”.All three records testify to Bridgers’s flair as a songwriter, spiking her emo-tinged folk-rock with Technicolor vignettes about murder, doomed love and lolling around in low-lit bedrooms. Her songs capture the moods and rhythms of a generation hardwired to social media – Bridgers is a wry, surreal presence on Twitter – that views the world and their future in it with a mix of humour, detachment and dread.Her writing gets better still on the new album, from the eerily dreamlike opener Garden Song, with its vision of a childhood home going up in flames, “except the notches in the doorframe”, to the stormbound climax of I Know the End, where impending apocalypse is soundtracked by “some America First rap country song”. (She’s no fan of Trump: “Our president,” she says, “is posing as anti-authority but he’s not, he’s a fucking dictator.”)Bridgers’s lyrics are often described as dark and brooding, but they can be funny too, often jarringly so. (“I hate your mom,” she announces, without warning, to a love interest on I See You). The jarring effect is important, she says, because she writes best when testing limits. “It’s very easy to write kind of just whatever lyrics,” she says, “but all my favourite lyrics are just like truthful, weird shit that you have to dare yourself into actually writing down.”Right now, with no one else around to speak weird truths to, Bridgers finds that she is becoming her own target. “A punisher,” she says, referring to the album title, “is someone who doesn’t know when to stop talking. And I was thinking the other day: this is my house of punishment. I am stuck here with my intrusive thoughts … It’s forcing me to deal with a lot of shit.”Bridgers found an outlet for her creative energies early on – “too early”, she says. Growing up in Pasadena, just inland from LA, with music a constant presence at home, she found it easy to imagine future stardom. “I felt like I had a God-given gift,” she laughs. “Aged 12 or 13 I was just like, ‘Wow, I’m the next Bob Dylan.’”Her parents were supportive of her ambitions and at 13 Bridgers was accepted at a high school that specialised in performing arts. She started gigging soon afterwards and in 2014 was offered a part in an iPhone ad. Bridgers accepted, viewing this and subsequent commercial work, for brands such as Taco Bell, as a way to bankroll her musical ambitions or, as she puts it now: “Work for five days a year and make your own trust fund.”Later that year, after turning 20, she came to the attention of the singer-songwriter Ryan Adams, who was nearly twice her age. Inviting Bridgers to perform at his studio, he fed her compliments and talked about releasing her songs on his label. They started dating but soon afterwards Adams “turned obsessive and emotionally abusive”, as Bridgers put it in a 2019 New York Times exposé. The article, which drew on testimony from several women, alleged that Adams had a history of promising to help female artists with their career while pursuing them for sex, then withdrawing offers of support if they spurned him and in some cases subjecting them to emotional and verbal abuse. (Adams has denied the accusations.)When she met Adams for the first time, she tells me, “I thought he was really cool”. “In retrospect, hearing about everybody else’s experience, it put mine really starkly in contrast. And I remember feeling sad and hurt and sick about all of it, but I didn’t really have the words to describe it until later, when I started connecting with everybody else and our timelines matched up so creepily… But no, I was totally enamoured with him and was like, ‘Oh, shit, that’s like my adult life starting.’ He was so championing me. He was wanting to record all the time. And I never really had that before.”When Bridgers broke off the relationship, Adams rowed back on his promises of support, though he did eventually release three songs on his Pax-Am label. Unlike some of the other women who later spoke out against Adams, Bridgers was able to keep her career on track – Motion Sickness, which took aim at their relationship, has had nearly 35m plays on Spotify – but the experience left its mark. When I ask Bridgers whether she thinks there are many other untold stories like that in the music industry, she says: “I know for a fact there are.”Her recent collaborations have been far more positive. Working with Baker, Dacus and Oberst were “fucking incredible experiences – like summer camp as an adult”, she says. “It helped me relax my weird, tight little world of wanting to control everything. Being able to say, ‘What do you guys think about this?’ has totally changed the way I write and for the better. I used to think of it as way more solitary. And now I’ve learned how to bring people into it.”How would she describe her lifestyle as a musician, pre-pandemic? If there was a barometer for rock’n’roll excess, would she register high on it? She splutters. “No, very low! Boygenius and I were all in our pyjamas by 11.45pm after getting off stage at 11.30.” Getting up at 8am to practise yoga was a higher priority. “Very, very square,” she says.So perhaps being stuck at home is not a major disruption? “I’m being more domestic than I’ve ever been,” she says. “I learned how to clean for the first time. I just folded in all my boxes and recycled them and it was orgasmic.” She also found time to appear on Jimmy Kimmel (performing Kyoto from her bath with a toy microphone) and interview the Normal People actor Paul Mescal on Instagram.The world may be in a perilous state and Bridgers has no idea when she’ll next step on to a tour bus, let alone leave her apartment, but, she says, only half-joking: “I think there are major gaps in my adulthood that I’m filling right now.”Punisher is out on Dead Oceans on 19 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/385aaa64b0d6febbdedc7d28699fd30e29798cc7/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=919ff778fb0a2c4b993b7ecc9db0046e","title":"rose city band summerlong review a gorgeous record","story":"As frontman of San Francisco psyche-rockers Wooden Shjips\u0026nbspand one half of the more Krautrock-influenced Moon Duo\u0026nbsp(with partner Sanae Yamada), Ripley Johnson has been responsible for some of the past decade’s most mesmeric and beguiling albums. Yet his second LP as Rose City Band (he plays everything except drums, where John Jeffrey helps out) might be the best of the bunch. Owing much to 1970s country rock, RCB’s signature sound is essentially the same as Wooden Shjips’s, only with their defining fuzzed-up guitars stripped away to reveal warm, lazily blissed-out songs underpinned by relentless motorik rhythms.There are echoes of the Byrds’ I Wasn’t Born to Follow (Only Lonely) and the restless momentum of Dylan circa Highway 61 Revisited (Real Long Gone). But for the most part these eight songs stand on their own merits, unfurling unhurriedly with Johnson’s understated vocals offset by gently spiralling guitar lines that are as hypnotic as they are breezy – never more so than on the closing sprawl of Wee Hours seguing seamlessly into Wildflowers.

Stonewall and Amnesty International described the reports as “disappointing” and “extremely worrying”.Meanwhile, the Scottish government – which is further ahead on legal reform than its UK counterparts, having carried out two consultations on the fraught issue – said on Sunday afternoon that it “remains committed to reform of the Gender Recognition Act 2004. Trans people continue to suffer poorer outcomes relative to the wider population and this needs to change. We know that we must do so in a way that ensures women’s rights are preserved and protected”.But the spokesperson added that work on the bill had been halted in the light of the coronavirus pandemic, so the bill would not be brought forward before next May’s Holyrood elections.Thanks to all those getting in touch with tips and pointers.

Hundreds of people arrived at George Square in Glasgow to call for the statue of politan Police founder Robert Peel to stay in place. The event was organised by a group called the Loyalist Defence League, after a protest was organised to call for its removal. However, the protest in favour of the statue’s removal, organised by Glasgow Youth Art Collective, was postponed due to what organisers say was a lack of access to the square and “police targeting activists”. Sturgeon welcomed the cancellation.At the daily coronavirus press briefing, the Nicola Sturgeon said that violent protest was “never acceptable”, particularly not during the coronavirus pandemic.“I say to anyone that has found themselves on the streets of Glasgow in an altercation with other groups or with the police, that they should really take a long hard look at themselves,” she said. “That is not acceptable behaviour at any time, but at this time of crisis that the country faces, I think it’s particularly shameful behaviour.”Despite the cancellation, police were forced to step between protesters calling for the statue to stay, and those in favour of its removal, who were from an unknown group, with objects thrown between the groups.The UK’s daily coronavirus death toll is today at 36 - its lowest since lockdown began. A total of 41,698 people have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Saturday, The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has said.This is an increase of 36 from 41,662 the day before. On March 21, the day the UK went into lockdown, the death toll rose by 35, making today’s figures the lowest since lockdown began.The DHSC also said in the 24-hour period up to 9am on Sunday, 144,865 tests were carried out or dispatched, with 1,514 positive results.This brings the total number of tests to 6,772,602, with 295,889 cases confirmed to have been positive.The figure for the number of people tested has been “temporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting” across all methods of testing.It is worth noting that figures provided on a Sunday are often lower due to under-reporting over the weekend.Greater Manchester’s deputy mayor has described the 6,000 people who attended illegal raves in the city last night as “reckless”, saying the events were a “flagrant breach of the coronavirus legislation”. Bev Hughes, Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime, said attendees risked public health and put a “strain on our police at what is still a very difficult time”.She also revealed that the city’s events industry have agreed to ban anyone involved with the raves in light of the events, and praised the mass clean-up which has happened in communities across Greater Manchester this morning. Hughes also said that Greater Manchester Police have seen a “noticeable reduction in Covid related incidents over recent weeks”.“Greater Manchester will not allow a small minority to put us the sacrifices we have made over recent months at risk,” she added.

The consistent testing of patients leaving hospital and entering into care homes did not begin until late April, leading to concerns that those discharged before that date could have been carrying the virus. “It should always have been the case that anyone who was symptomatic should have been tested and that was our understanding of the science and the evidence at the time when all of the choices were made,” Gething said. “We of course developed further understanding and further knowledge, so if I had the knowledge I have today, I’d have probably made different choices at a number of points in the coronavirus pandemic.”“We certainly haven’t taken a cavalier approach,” he added.“The safety of the people in Wales has always been the driving force in the choices we’ve made, right from the choice to stop large areas of NHS activity in the middle of March, to the way we’ve done the testing strategy, to where we are now.”Nicola Sturgeon has warned that, while she hopes to lift further lockdown restrictions in Scotland this Thursday at her three-weekly review, the pace of change will remain cautious.The expected announcements in Phase 2 include more social interaction, the re-mobilisation of the NHS, as well as a date for the retailer sector to begin to reopen.Sturgeon told reporters at her daily briefing: “We should also realise the prize for going a bit more cautiously now could be a return to greater normality in the medium term.”She reiterated that the Scottish government would continue to keep evidence for reducing the 2 metre rule under review."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/489b6a8e92bdd5fa12f43135d3ce9361196da717/0_269_8083_4850/master/8083.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcf1ac60e683f1f05a663b79ae2a2d59","title":"scientists report flaws in who study on two metre distancing","story":"Mistakes mean findings should not be used as evidence for relaxing rule, say professorsSenior scientists have reported flaws in an influential World Health Organization-commissioned study into the risks of coronavirus infection and say it should not be used as evidence for relaxing the UK’s 2-metre physical distancing rule.But scientists who delved into the work found mistakes they believe undermine the findings to the point they cannot be relied upon when scientists and ministers are forming judgments about what constitutes safe physical distancing.“The analysis of infection risk at 1 metre versus 2 metre should be treated with great caution,” said Prof David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at Cambridge University, who has participated in the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies . “I’m very suspicious of it.”Prof Kevin McConway, an applied statistician at the Open University, went further and called the analysis inappropriate. He said the work “should not be used in arguments about how much greater the infection risk is at 1-metre minimum distance as opposed to 2 metres”.Doubts about the study emerged as Boris Johnson announced a formal review of the 2-metre physical distancing rule, which is expected to report by 4 July, the earliest date pubs and restaurants may reopen in England. In recent weeks, Johnson has come under intense pressure from Conservative MPs to relax the advice to help businesses, particularly in the hospitality sector.Led by researchers at McMaster University in Ontario, the report pooled data from previously published studies to estimate the risk of becoming infected with coronavirus at different distances. It also considered how face masks and eye protection might help prevent the spread of disease.But in the analysis the authors assume the proportional impact on risk of moving from 2 metres to 1 metre is the same as moving from 1 metre to zero. “They are forcing the proportional fit to be the same,” Spiegelhalter told the .McConway believes there is a more fundamental problem in the way the risks of infection at different distances are compared in the study. He said: “The method of comparing the different distances in the paper is inappropriate for telling you exactly how the risk at 2-metre minimum distance compares to a 1 metre minimum distance. It does not support, and should not be used in, arguments about how much greater the risk is with a 1 metre limit versus a 2-metre limit.”Another scientist, Prof Ben Cowling at the WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control at the University of Hong Kong, flagged further issues with the work. He tweeted that he was “not taking the whole paper very seriously” because it looked only at distance and not how long a person was exposed for.McConway said he had raised questions about the analysis with the authors and was waiting to hear back. He believed peer review by the Lancet and the WHO should have spotted the problems. “I think they did it in such a rush – the authors, possibly the WHO, and the Lancet peer reviewers – that important things were missed,” he said.“Everyone believes that the risk of infection at 1-metre is higher than at 2-metre and we need to know how much higher because there’s a trade-off between the increased risk and the gains from moving to 1-metre. But if you don’t know how the risks at 1 metre and 2 metres compare, how do you know how to trade it off? It’s finger in the air stuff,” McConway said.The most recent public Sage document on physical distancing, updated on 2 May, makes clear that multiple streams of evidence are used to advise on safe distancing, including how long people are together, ventilation and room size, and that the 2-metre advice is no more than a ballpark guide for face-to-face meetings.In a statement, the WHO said it recommends keeping a distance of 1 metre or more.“The evidence used to inform this guidance was based on a systematic review of all available, relevant observational studies concerning protective measures to prevent transmission of the coronaviruses that cause Sars, Mers and Covid-19. After checking for relevance, 44 comparative studies done in health-care and non-health-care settings were included.“The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis support physical distancing of 1 metre or more, which is in line with the existing WHO recommendation that people should physically distance at least 1 metre,” the statement said.The Lancet and the authors of the study have been contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36ed5d82a27fae799531fce53ec624ee86ccfecf/0_43_3250_1950/master/3250.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=52a0106d13f4a6eee608f4c92e67f4fc","title":"alice dearing i dont want to always be referred to as the black swimmer from britain","story":"Britain’s best in the open water shares her experiences of racism in swimming and how she is breaking barriers for black people to take up the sportIt sounds scarcely believable in modern, multiracial Britain but nearly a century after the sprinter Jack London became the first black athlete to win an Olympic medal for Britain in 1928, and more than 40 years since Viv Anderson became the first black footballer to start for England, Team GB has never sent a black swimmer to an Olympic Games. Not one.But next summer Alice Dearing, a 23-year-old from Birmingham who is Britain’s best open-water swimmer, intends to flip 125 years of history on its head in Tokyo – the small matter of a global pandemic permitting. And, as becomes clear over a thought-provoking and nuanced conversation, that is only the start of her ambitions.“Being a poster girl for black swimming is exciting, because genuinely I love the sport and I want to see as many people doing it as possible,” Dearing says. “But it’s also terrifying because there’s a lot of pressure. I have rationalised it – if not me, then who? And I want this to happen as soon as possible, to break that barrier.”Part of the problem, she explains, is also cultural. “A lot of black people think they never learned how to swim and turned out fine so they don’t need to teach their children. Obviously there are a lot of flaws with that argument, but if that’s being repeated to a whole generation – that swimming is not for you – then obviously it’s going to trickle down.”Dearing has also recently partnered with the specialist swimming brand Soul Cap, which makes swimming hats designed especially for afro hair. As she explains, swimming can be more damaging to afro hair because of the sodium hypochlorite in pools, which can discourage those from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds.Meanwhile Dearing’s skin colour meant that when she started swimming aged seven or eight she stood out – not that she always realised. “My mum’s the black parent. She’d be the one taking me training and to competitions, and she would literally be one of two black people at the pool along with me – people would see us together and just stare. My mum was like: ‘It must be because you are so small and then you swim so well.’ But maybe we were being naive.”While most in the sport have been encouraging, Dearing says there have been exceptions – including the time she found out from a friend that a coach used the N-word regarding her when she was 17. “If that’s the way someone sees me then it’s their issue and they need to learn to deal with it. I’m tired of educating people around these issues. That said, it is really exciting to see how many people in the last few weeks genuinely want to change things.“Typically I have been sceptical about these movements because they happen maybe once every two years and then fizzle out. But the more the days have gone on, and I’ve seen how determined everyone is to make change happen, the more I have become hopeful.”Dearing’s mum, who is from Accra in Ghana, is the keen swimmer of her parents. Her dad, who is white and from Hull, cannot swim at all. And it was her mum who encouraged her to stick at the sport until, because of a combination of a growth spurt and a switch to long distances, she suddenly moved into elite class.“When I was 16 I made my first GB team in the 400m freestyle – that made me realise I could achieve something because I was quite small and had always doubted myself. That same year I was invited for an open-water trial for the European juniors. I didn’t realise that it was over 10km. And to make matters worse it was only 14C, tipping down, and I didn’t have a wetsuit. But despite it being my first time in open water I somehow managed to finish in 2hr 20m. Off the back of that I went to European juniors and ended up winning. After that I just kind of rolled with it.” And then some. At 19 Dearing was crowned world junior open-water champion. Before the lockdown she was in the best phase of training in her career, having finished in the top 10 at a World Cup event in Doha in February, and was relishing a shot at the Olympic podium.Dearing could only train on her boyfriend’s parents’ exercise bike during the early stages of the pandemic but is now back in the swing of getting up at 4.30am to train in the pool. Somehow she combines this with studying for a Masters at Loughborough University and being on the Women’s Sport Trust’s Unlocked programme, which seeks to help women sports stars become voices for their generation.How does she fit it in? “I like to think about everything I do as influencing my younger self. Would it be enough to inspire somebody to be a woman of colour swimming for the national team – or could I take it a step further by reaching out to the community?”It’s working, too. “I am seeing way more black swimmers poolside than I used to. I watch them swim – and I am always their biggest fan in my head. To be honest I don’t want to always be referred to as the black swimmer from Britain. I want to be known for my achievements.

Still keen to resume playing at 38, the arch survivor, who has played at a record 72 grand slams in a row, is also the Madrid Open’s director and offers a unique perspective on what might happen next.“I’m talking as a player now – but I’m also a tournament director and I am able to see the reality, to see how tough it is to survive in this crisis. It is hitting everyone. It’s tough to break even. This is what the players need to understand. It is really urgent that everybody plays. But, if we don’t have tournaments, it’s possible the ATP is not going to survive either. We need to stay together. It is the only way to survive.”Bringing players together in a global sport during a pandemic is a problem, he agrees, but he said: “I think in two weeks or so, the borders and the airports are going to start opening up, and we’re going to be able to travel freely – I hope. We have to consider that there are different restrictions in Europe. For example, it is not the same in Austria as in Germany. We’re working on that.”The bigger problem is in South America and the US, where there have been fresh outbreaks of coronavirus, as well as strong reservations by leading players including the world No 1, Novak Djokovic – who broke down in tears after beating Alexander Zverev 4-0, 1-4, 4-2, in front of a crowd of 4,000 people at his own tournament in Belgrade on Sunday – Rafael Nadal, and the world No 2 on the WTA Tour, Simona Halep.López respects Djokovic’s reluctance to travel to the US Open with only one member of his entourage, but said: “Is it a sacrifice? Yes. But you will have the physios on site and you will have maybe your team waiting for you at the hotel. It is a small sacrifice.”López thinks the US Open, still pencilled in for 24 August, will get a green light when officials confer in New York on Monday. If not the Tour is more likely to resume on clay in Europe – beginning with Madrid in September, then Rome and leading on to Roland Garros.One player keen to go to New York is Andy Murray, with whom López won the doubles at Queen’s Club last year but who has not played since November. “We are in touch every two weeks or so,” said López.“We text each other. Two days ago I was talking to him, and he was really pumped about the US Open. He was starting to practise again. I asked about the hip, how it was feeling, and he was positive. He might be able to compete again. I’m crossing my fingers to see Andy playing again, of course. It would be great for everybody, especially for him.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc12e7a46443c55fc473e53d91e5ee184771167e/0_28_800_480/master/800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=012adcb439c56d9bfefc4a6de7cfa9db","title":"karen hauer strictly dancer","story":"When her tour was axed by coronavirus, the dancer set up an online festival with karaoke aerobics. She talks about her Bronx childhood, the pressure of Strictly and life beyond lockdown ‘They always say the show must go on,” says Karen Hauer, speaking by video call, sitting on her bed, bleached hair slicked back with lockdown roots on show. “But not this time.” Hauer and fellow Strictly dancer Gorka Marquez were six dates into touring their new show, Firedance, when theatres shut down due to coronavirus.The pair had just filmed Firedance: Latin Fever, a BBC documentary about the making of the show, when everything came to a halt. “Our hearts dropped,” she says. The documentary is now on iPlayer and the dates have been rescheduled for next spring but the memory still hurts. Being self-employed, all the dancers were suddenly out of work, living off savings. “I’m a saver, luckily,” she says, and as a freelancer she knows that in downtime “things can really go down a rabbit hole” so she set about putting some structure into her days.Hauer and fellow Strictly star Oti Mabuse set up an online community, Home Festival, streaming dance classes, baking events, a Jenga night, Boris Becker talking tennis – and Hauer and her opera singer partner David Webb laughing and singing their way through “CardioKe” aerobics, with their dogs joining in. The dancers’ warmth proved a major part of the appeal.Hauer has always turned to dance in challenging times. Born in Venezuela, she moved to the Bronx in New York with her family aged eight, but her dad left soon after they arrived. “So it was just my mom and three kids in a foreign country. It was really hard to understand how someone could leave their family, and to see my mom suffering.”At nine, Hauer won a scholarship to the Martha Graham school of contemporary dance, where she studied for 10 years. Dancing became an escape, especially when her mother was working and Hauer didn’t want to be home alone (she still goes to sleep with the TV on for company if she’s on her own). “It was hard, as a kid, to know what I was feeling. Dancing gave me a way to express myself and release energy. I didn’t want to let my mom down so I always tried to be the good girl, but I could be emotional through my dancing.”Discovering salsa dance in New York clubs connected Hauer to her roots and she switched dance styles, competing on the ballroom and Latin circuit for 10 years, but the foundations of her Graham training stayed. “It’s about motive,” she says. “There’s a reason for every movement. You’re not just twirling your arms around. It’s about the truth behind what you’re doing.”There may be limited time for such truth in a two-minute Strictly tango, but in a theatre show, “it’s deeper than just dance. It’s not just teeth and tits. You’re taking your experiences, your past relationships – that’s what I took from Martha Graham. And all your emotions come from your centre, from your pelvis. You know, when you cry, the first thing you do is you contract, because that’s where you feel the pain.”Storytelling is what drives Hauer’s dancing, which explains why she’s a huge fan of choreographers Matthew Bourne and Kate Prince. And Firedance is unlike other chat-heavy Strictly spin-offs in that it’s a pure dance show, a story about two rival Latin dancers with – surprise, surprise – a passionate connection, a mashup of Latin styles and modern pop sensibility.Hauer joined Strictly in 2012. She first came to the UK two years earlier, with the Latin stage show Burn the Floor. “I remember falling in love with London and wanting to live here,” she says. On Burn the Floor, she also fell in love with Kevin Clifton, who joined Strictly as a dancer the year after Hauer. They married in 2015 and split three years later (he’s now with his 2018 Strictly partner, the presenter Stacey Dooley).Despite the tabloid glare Strictly stars endure, the pair seem to have remained great friends. The pressure of the TV show, she says, contributed to their breakup. “When we were on a tour together the whole time, that was different. It was the beginning of the relationship. Then when you get into a major show, it’s really intense. You never know how you’re going to grow together. It just happened that things didn’t work out. We’re still very close and we have each other’s backs.”For Hauer, the attention that comes with being a celebrity has been overwhelmingly positive. “There’s incredible support from the fans. I’ve always been welcomed with arms wide open. I feel like I’ve always been a part of this country.” I ask if she knows whether filming for this year’s Strictly is going ahead, but she has only heard the same rumours as the rest of us. Still, she’s getting her body in peak condition so will be ready when the call comes.“These past weeks have been tough but fitness and dancing have always been my saviour,” says Hauer. “Releasing endorphins, mentally and physically, changes your perspective. It gives you positive energy. And, you know, I’m just trying to stay positive”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5398e1f4b0ae1d75c84ef43e55d137ea4044bca/0_380_5012_3005/master/5012.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=143d4b3646d7f07a390998959a18ab0e","title":"locking down leopoldstadt what happened when the west end closed overnight","story":"Tom Stoppard’s new play was enjoying a sold-out run when venues closed. Its producer, Sonia Friedman, recalls how the crisis unfoldedTom Stoppard’s Leopoldstadt was just beginning its eighth sold-out week at Wyndham’s theatre in London’s West End when the order came through that it was shutting down. Greeted as a late-period masterpiece – and possibly the final play – of a leading playwright who had waited until his 80s to investigate his Jewish background, it was a huge production to match the scale of the history it charted, following a prosperous Viennese family from 1899 to 1955, with opening and closing tableaux that revealed just how annihilating the intervening years had been.\u0026nbspThough it was not intended to offer a topical reflection on the antisemitism that has been tearing the left apart in the UK over the past few years, its debates about the limits of assimilation hit a nerve, and audiences poured in. “I thought this was the tail end of interest in the Holocaust, but as a matter of fact it had become a sort of hotspot. I didn’t write about more recent events, but it was part of the consciousness that the audience brought to the play,” reflects Stoppard.\u0026nbspThis consciousness that, for all that it was set in the past, the play was telling an important and topical story, was passionately shared by the 43-strong cast, more than two-thirds of whom were themselves Jewish, who were determined to carry on for as long as they could as the closure of public spaces swept across the globe. Though the West End was emptying, Leopoldstadt’s audiences kept turning up – increasing numbers of them in face masks. When the decision to shut down was finally taken, the company went off to a local pub to await further instructions, recalls producer Sonia Friedman, “and all we could say to them was: ‘You have to go home’”.If you want to understand just how devastating the Covid-19 crisis has been to the world of entertainment, you need look no further than the week that Friedman will never forget. On the afternoon of Wednesday 11 March, her production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was midway through a performance at San Francisco’s Curran theatre when the city’s mayor announced a ban on all events involving more than 1,000 people. “For better or worse we made the decision to keep going but shut down in the evening after part two. There had been a state of emergency in California from early March and we’d been watching sales haemorrhage,” says the producer, whose 11 productions running around the world at the time included five of the hit JK Rowling play – in Germany, Australia, the US and London.\u0026nbspThe following afternoon New York closed all its Broadway theatres, taking down a further three of Friedman’s shows. On Friday, the German production of Harry Potter was shut down on the final day of previews in Hamburg. On Sunday, Melbourne theatres closed, taking the Australian production with it, and on Monday 16 March – “by this point in acute crisis mode” – Friedman took the preemptive step of heeding Boris Johnson’s “advice” that all UK entertainment outlets should close, and shut down her five remaining productions.Nearly three months on, the shock has transformed into the passionate determination that has made Friedman one of the world’s most successful theatre producers. She abandoned her London home before official lockdown to stay with her writer partner, Joe Murphy, and their two dogs in a Hampshire cottage rented to them by Tom Stoppard’s wife, Sabrina Guinness. For the first eight or nine weeks, given the number of shows she had suspended and “the absolute tumult of chaos and uncertainty” it had created in so many time zones, Friedman only managed three or four hours sleep a night. “I’ve been trying to do what I can to save my industry and my people, talking constantly with my staff, theatre owners, producers and investors, but no one has any answers.”The figures are startling: the UK has some 1,300 theatres around the country employing some 290,000 workers, from actors to administrators, stage technicians to front-of-house staff. A paper sent to the DCMS last month by the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre points out that in 2018, their members sold tickets worth £1.28bn. The theatre’s value to the London economy, where nearly half of all UK performances take place and tourists make up a quarter of audiences, is estimated to be £5bn a year. And Friedman’s portfolio of closed shows is testament to the export value of this dynamic British industry.Theatre is such a people-centred industry that its resumption poses particular problems, and return plans will have to be carefully tailored to the profile of each show. The first of Friedman’s shows to reopen will probably be Harry Potter in Australia, where measures to contain the pandemic have been considerably more successful than in Europe and the US. “We’re aiming for September, and I think it’ll be a test case for the world,” says the producer.\u0026nbspSince audiences for Leopoldstadt are generally older than those for other West End shows such as Harry Potter or The Book of Mormon, it will probably make a later return – but so long as the company still wants to do it, and the audience still wants to see it, return it will, she promises. And from London, all being well, it will go on to New York.\u0026nbspKeeping faith with a vision for a post-Covid world is hard but crucial, Friedman insists. While her days are spent lobbying and problem-solving with the half of her 40-strong core staff who have not been furloughed, the hours between 11pm and 2 or 3am are devoted to “what I call my future: every day I do something positive to imagine there’s something on the other side of this, other than resuming the shows at hand.”The potential of the crisis as a source of future themes and plotlines is not lost on her. “We exist in a world of stories in our theatre and this story isn’t credible yet we’re living it,” she says.\u0026nbsp“I keep telling people, ‘this is history, guys’, it’s going to be discussed for centuries. We’re dealing with something so monumentally complex that the biggest brains in the world are only just beginning to come to terms with what needs to be done.”\u0026nbspAs a theatre producer it pays to be Teflon-coated. “I’ve always been quite good in a crisis,” she says, “I’m not going to give up until I’m done, and if I’m done the rest of the industry is going to be done too, because until then I’m sure as hell going to be still standing.” Meanwhile the venerable Wyndham’s theatre slumbers on, its grand Viennese apartment set swathed in ghostly plastic sheeting, waiting for the great awakening."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43d97a0a725b676c14f126b062828022b2e5dc46/0_0_5242_3146/master/5242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7ea2c3a39015e9d77145e525fb1f398","title":"uk children reliable broadband coronavirus lockdown education","story":"Coronavirus lockdown has ‘exposed digital ide’ with 700,000 unable to complete schoolwork The government must urgently ensure that more than 1 million children have reliable internet access at home or risk irreparable harm to their education, a cross-party group of MPs and former ministers has said.Tony Blair is among a number of prominent figures, including a Tory grandee, to back calls to equip 1.3 million children eligible for free school meals with a broadband connection and devices.A bill that will be presented to parliament this week says the coronavirus lockdown had “exposed the digital ide”, with about 700,000 children unable to complete any schoolwork because of a lack of internet at home.Siobhain McDonagh, the Labour MP behind the bill, said: “Those children who can’t access the same resources as their classmates will find themselves even further behind when they finally return. Some may never catch up.“This policy isn’t a silver bullet and can’t replace months of missed education. But it would make an immediate, tangible difference to families right across our country.”The proposal has won the support of more than 40 leading voices on education including Sir Michael Wilshaw, the former head of Ofsted, Robert Halfon, the Conservative chair of the Commons education select committee, and Philip Harris, a multimillionaire Tory grandee and sponsor of 13 academies.Voluntary groups in some of Britain’s most deprived areas have said that households without regular internet access were struggling to carry out essential tasks like pay bills, submit job applications and make universal credit inquiries since community centres and libraries closed in March.Among those hardest hit, the charities said, were about 700,000 children unable to complete schoolwork, and scores of elderly and disabled people who had been self-isolating – sometimes without any social contact – for more than three months.More than 5 million adults in the UK have either never used the internet or not used it in the past three months, equivalent to one in 10 of all adults in the country. While most non-internet users are of retirement age, 773,000 adults – equivalent to the population of Leeds – are under the age of 65.Polly Neate, chief executive of the homeless charity Shelter, has described the digital ide as “fast becoming a defining social justice issue of this crisis”.On Monday, Jangala, a charity that specialises in providing the internet to humanitarian disaster zones, is shifting its focus to the UK with a trial to connect about 60 people at a homeless shelter in Brighton.The charity, which was founded five years ago to work in the so-called Calais “Jungle” camp, said it was shifting its attention to Britain after being alerted to a huge need since the lockdown began in March.Rich Thanki, Jangala’s founder, said its UK trial would expand to other homeless shelters, schools and community centres around the country if successful. Its technology has been used in refugee camps across Europe and Africa, including in Calais where it was reputedly used by about 4,000 refugees a week, and the huge Kakuma camp in north-west Kenya, as well as in schools in Afghanistan and health clinics in Tanzania.Thanki said it was depressing that charities were having to step in to connect people in Britain, the world’s sixth-biggest economy. Nick Gardham, the chief executive of the Community Organisers charity, said some single-parent families were having to “choose between data and food” so their children could complete schoolwork online. He welcomed the lifting of broadband data caps, in a deal struck by the government and telecoms firms, but said that would only help people “in the club” and not those who could not afford a monthly tariff.His charity is urging the government to open up the broadband infrastructure provided by BT Openzone and Virgin so hotspots can be used free of charge during the pandemic. Its Operation Wifi campaign has been backed by several charities including Shelter and AgeUK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f34dc2c38c0b88044a27e657902ee77a4d73d38e/0_36_1440_864/master/1440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de8011fe7bdd92049c3151a4f632b2e4","title":"wetting yourself as an adult is the stuff of nightmares jenny eclair on bladder weakness","story":"The author and comedian lets loose on a wee problem many women are still too shy to talk about: accidental leakageThere are many reasons why you might wet yourself, but the best is laughter. I remember laughing so much at school that I frequently had to clutch my front bottom to stop the wee coming out. This was once triggered by the girl standing next to me farting very loudly during assembly – seriously, she let off as loudly as a trumpet at the precise moment we’d all finished singing a hymn. I still call this state of helpless incontinent hilarity “school assembly” laughter, and when I’m gigging, this is the Richter-scale level of laughter I’m after. I want to see every woman in the audience crossing her legs and clutching her front bottom.In real life, of course, wetting yourself as an adult is the stuff of nightmares, immediately you are the primary school pant wetter, the girl who had to borrow a pair of knickers from the lost property box, oh the shame of it.The fact is, losing control of your bladder can happen for all kinds of reasons, from simple timing issues, ie finding yourself locked out of the house and not being able to find your front door key, to suffering from various medical conditions that affect bladder control.For some reason, adult female incontinence still tends to be a taboo subject, although there probably isn’t a female comic who hasn’t gone through motherhood without making an “every time I cough, I wet my pants” stress-incontinence gag. A few years ago, during a Grumpy Old Women Live show, I performed some menopausal material about having a go on a kids’ trampoline: “Thirty seconds later, I’d pissed myself, broken both my ankles and one tit had escaped its moorings,” I joshed. And judging by the reaction of the audience, a great many of them had been there, done that and had to go home to change their underwear.In my experience, as long as we women are in control of the joke then we can laugh about it. It’s when other people (often younger and frequently male) take ownership of our physical frailties that it becomes embarrassing and somehow more shameful.For many women over 50, a little bit of leaking now and then is a fact of life – many of us haven’t got the toned pelvic floors we once had, thanks mostly to having big headed babies, and while some of us will never need to use pads, others feel safer with some protection, “just in case”.As a woman who has spent more than her fair share of time on the motorway sharing cars with other female performers, it has always surprised me how some women need to stop at a service station to use the loo every 20 minutes, while others manage a good five hundred miles without needing a wee.The fact is that all bladders are different, some resemble oversized leather footballs, while others, like my friend Nina’s (I’ve changed her name) are thimble sized and made from gossamer. Nina has never managed to make it to the interval of any show without climbing over everyone’s laps to get to the ladies.For a number of women, bladder training can be incredibly useful. A friend of mine swears blind that Princess Anne once informed her that “when one urinates, one must always sit for another 30 seconds after you think you’ve finished, as you inevitably haven’t, there’s usually a few drops more”. This is singly the best tip for anyone suffering from post-micturition dribble. Basically, slow down and give yourself time to do the job properly. Then “give your lettuce a good shake” as the old saying goes and remember to wipe from front to back, because we don’t want a yeast infection on top of everything else.Lord knows, women are born with complicated plumbing and as we get older some of our pipework can start to drip now and then, but you know what? Unless you’re wearing a gusset of galvanised steel, there’s no reason why anyone should know.Of course in the olden days women would rather die of shame than talk to anyone about bladder weakness, but one of the great things about being a 21st-century woman is that we know this kind of thing is common.So remember girls, incontinence is not a moral weakness, it’s not laziness, it’s a fact of life for millions, so whatever you do, keep laughing and don’t let a little bit of wee spoil your fun.As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

Perhaps they imagined it theoretically – that some kind of virus might come along,” said the 77-year-old oncologist, author and broadcaster. “But even when this virus did show up, we didn’t think it would cause a tragedy of such proportions.”The precise magnitude of Brazil’s Covid-19 tragedy remains unclear – but the story told by official statistics grows more wretched by the day.On Friday, Brazil overtook Britain as the country with the world’s second-highest death toll: 41,901 deaths since the first fatality was confirmed in São Paulo on 17 March.A University of Washington projection indicated another 100,000 Brazilians could die before August, possibly placing Brazil ahead of the US as the country with the most deaths.As the catastrophe deepens there is growing anger at the conduct of president Jair Bolsonaro, whose jumbled and dysfunctional handling of a pandemic he has called a “fantasy” has made Boris Johnson’s widely panned response look sober and efficient.“This is the worst public health crisis\u0026nbspwe’ve faced – and it has come at a time when we have the worst government in the world,” said Daniel Dourado, a public health expert and lawyer from the University of São Paulo who believes thousands of lives could have been saved by a swifter and less erratic response. “The country is adrift.”There are uncanny and painful parallels between the impact of the Spanish flu – which historians say killed between 35,000 and 100,000 Brazilians – and the harm coronavirus is now inflicting.Then, too, authorities tried to hide the true scale of the disaster – just as Bolsonaro’s health ministry has been accused of doing – until, like now, the determination of Brazilian journalists made that impossible.Then, like now, doctors pushed untested and potentially dangerous remedies, just as Brazil’s populist leader has promoted the use of hydroxychloroquine despite limited scientific evidence of its effectiveness. Bertolli Filho said one São Paulo quack was famed for injecting Spanish flu patients with mercury. “He killed lots of people – and yet despite this many believed.”As the Spanish flu ripped through cities, from Recife to Rio, religious leaders also touted miracle cures just as powerful televangelists today promise followers Covid-19 salvation with holy water and supernatural seeds.And in 1918, as now, the mysterious malady prompted an explosion of rumour and conspiracy, including claims German submarines had secretly spread the infirmity along the Brazilian coast. (In fact, it arrived on an English merchant ship called the Demerara).But perhaps no parallel is more cruel than the way in which both catastrophes obliterated the idea pandemics chose victims indiscriminately.Bertolli Filho said the 1919 death of Brazil’s president-elect, Rodrigues Alves, from the Spanish flu was widely cited as proof epidemics were equal opportunity.In fact, cemetery records showed most of São Paulo’s 5,000 dead hailed from working class, industrial districts such as Mooca, Ipiranga, and Brás, where Varella’s grandmother watched the corpse collectors at work. Today, the areas suffering most are blue collar communities such as Brasilândia, Freguesia do Ó and Capão Redondo where many do not have the luxury of social distancing or working from home.In Rio, deprived western neighbourhoods such as Campo Grande, Realengo and Bangu have recorded some of the highest death tolls while densely populated favelas like Rocinha and the Complexo da Maré are also being punished.“The truth is, not even a pandemic is truly democratic,” Bertolli Filho said.“Brazil’s situation is so worrying and so unique because if you look at the path the epidemic took – from China, through Asia, and then Europe and on to the US – Brazil was its first encounter with a country suffering from the kind of severe social inequality ours does.”“It will hit other unequal countries, like India and Pakistan, but here was the first – and we are seeing this play out now in a country where 13 or 14 million people live in precarious conditions and great poverty.”The omens were not good. “Ever since the epidemic began, I’ve woken up every day feeling afflicted, thinking about what will happen and how,” Varella said.“The biggest problem we are seeing across Brazil right now is the epidemic spreading through the outskirts of cities and their rundown centres where you have tenements and the homeless live.“Where this will end we have no clue – no clue at all,” he admitted. “Because we are now right in the middle of the dissemination.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9747e578bcc5212c9eed2d7066063f120ecac44a/0_1_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3276b23d349af84dcb1d07ae2ec4f922","title":"canada systemic racism history","story":"Amid the anger over brutality and injustice, a number of prominent Canadians have cast doubt on the idea that racism is entrenchedAfter a string of violent incidents involving police officers, activists and ordinary people across Canada have joined the global chorus calling for a reckoning with racism, policing, inequality and the long reach of history.In recent weeks, a black woman fell to her death after police were called to her flat in Toronto an Indigenous woman suffering a mental health crisis was shot dead by an officer in New Brunswick and footage emerged showing Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers in Alberta forcing a First Nations chief to the ground and punching him in the head. On Friday evening, an Indigenous man was shot dead by the RCMP in New Brunswick.But amid the growing anger, a number of prominent Canadians – premiers, columnists and the head of the RCMP – have cast doubt on the idea that racism is entrenched in the country’s institutions.“Thank God we’re different than the United States and we don’t have the systemic, deep roots they’ve had for years,” said the Ontario premier, Doug Ford, a view echoed by neighbouring the Quebec premier, François Legault.The RCMP commissioner, Brenda Lucki, told the Globe and Mail on Wednesday: “I think that if systemic racism is meaning that racism is entrenched in our policies and procedures, I would say that we don’t have systemic racism.” On Friday, Lucki clarified her position in a statement. “I did acknowledge that we, like others, have racism in our organization, but I did not say definitively that systemic racism exists in the RCMP. I should have.” Hours later, Rodney Levi of the Metepenagiag Mi’kmaq Nation was shot dead by RCMP officers.Activists and historians argue that before change can come, Canadians must first accept a tarnished history and the persistent structural inequities that it has bequeathed the nation.The numbers are clear: black and Indigenous peoples in Canada are disproportionately overrepresented in prisons and jails across the country. As students, they face harsher discipline in schools and are suspended at a higher rate than white students. In Toronto, the country’s largest city, black residents are 20 times more likely to be shot by police.On Thursday, Justin Trudeau contradicted the RCMP chief’s comments, saying it was clear systemic racism was present in the country’s federal police force.“As much as we admire and support the RCMP, we know we need to do better. It is not just the inidual examples we have seen, it’s the issues faced by Canadians of erse backgrounds over years, decades and generations,” the prime minister said.On Friday, Lucki clarified her position, saying: “I did acknowledge that we, like others, have racism in our organization, but I did not say definitively that systemic racism exists in the RCMP. I should have.”Some argue that Canada’s national police force is itself emblematic of racism.“The RCMP was not created to protect Indigenous people. It was created to protect white settlers from Indigenous folks – while suppressing our ceremonies and implementing laws that sought to decimate us,” said Brooks Arcand-Paul, a Cree lawyer and executive on the Indigenous Bar Association.“Even today, the police will always look at Indigenous people and Black folks in our territories as potentially requiring some kind of suppression.”Protesters have highlighted the case of Chantel Moore, 26, who was fatally shot last month by officers during a mental health “wellness check” and Regis Korchinski-Paquet, who fell to her death after police responded to a mental health emergency. But Arcand-Paul said her death was only the latest in a litany of cases where Indigenous lives are lost and families denied justice. He points to the case of Gerald Stanley, a white farmer who shot Colten Boushie, an indigenous man, in the head – but was acquitted by an all-white jury.“When we talk about systemic racism, we’re not just trying to lay the blame on the RCMP. It’s the entire structure that is causing continued violence against black and Indigenous bodies in this country,” said Arcand-Paul.Some police forces, including in Canada’s largest city, have acknowledged systemic racism exists and pledged to make change. Last week, Toronto’s police chief, Mark Saunders, knelt with protesters.But such actions have also raised skepticism among activists.“Police in Canada are trying to escape this moment of criticism by casting themselves compassionate forces that care about these issues. However, once you actually dig into the data, it shows this is not necessarily the case,” said Bashir Mohamed, a researcher and amateur historian whose work has highlighted the often-forgotten racist history of western Canada.“I think it’s by design that police forces want this information hidden, because then it makes them less responsible for actually acknowledging this is a problem.”Mohamed points to the practice of “carding” – Canada’s version of stop-and-frisk – in which police conduct street checks of residents with little or no cause. While agencies have defended the practice in the past, the limited available data shows the policy disproportionately affects racialized communities.Ford, the Ontario premier, quickly walked back his remarks, suggesting his comments had been taken out of context. “Of course there’s systemic racism in Ontario, there’s systemic racism across this country,” Ford said the next day.Quebec’s Legault also suggested there was “no system in place that discriminates” in the province – and said the province had not experienced slavery.But political leaders’ resistance to the idea that systemic racism exists within state institutions often comes from a poor understanding of the country’s past, says educator and historian Natasha Henry, president of the Ontario Black History Society.“It’s part of the Canadian national narrative of positioning ourselves in juxtaposition to the United States. That’s how we get this ‘exceptional Canada’ of being welcoming and warm – and not paying attention to our own parallel history of racial exclusion and the dispossession.”In addition to being factually inaccurate, this popular view speaks to a “refusal to take responsibility” for two centuries of slavery within the country’s history, says Henry.For generations, Canadian history has concentrated on the country’s position as the last stop on the Underground Railroad – a place which meant freedom for those who escaped slavery in the US. But the same narrative omits the experiences of thousands of enslaved people within Canada, says Henry.According to Henry’s research, the earliest record of African enslavement in colonial Canada was the sale of a young boy, named Olivier LeJeune in 1629.Slavery was formally ended in the British empire in 1834, including British North America, but legislation was repeatedly passed that would weaken anti-slavery laws in the years leading up to abolition.After emancipation, black people in Canada still faced segregation, and the looming threat of hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan.“You have to decide – are you going to accept all of Canada or none of Canada?” said Henry. “Because you can’t parcel out what you want. That’s not how history works.”Indigenous peoples were also enslaved by colonial powers – a reality often forgotten in the country’s school textbooks. And by the end of the 1700s, as many as 2,000 black people were enslaved in the Maritimes region. About 300 more people were enslaved in the area known as Lower Canada (what is now the province of Quebec) and as many as 700 in Upper Canada (Ontario).Others argue that Canada needs a more comprehensive history.“It’s important to incorporate anti-black racism into curricula, but also black history. Not just civil rights heroes, but also black artists,” said Mohamed. “This shows that my people existed in Canada. It shows that we have a long history of slavery over 200 years, but also have a long history of black arts and black culture.”Only in recent years has Canada grappled with the legacy of its residential schools – where many Indigenous students were sent against their will and experienced verbal, physical and sexual abuse – a period which schools have now started to teach.“At the end of the day, there’s going to be some difficult conversations. Because it’s important to acknowledge that our experiences aren’t just a fabricated story. They are lived realities,” said Arcand-Paul, who has been pulled over and questioned on multiple occasions by police.“And we’re not going to be able to achieve true understanding until, at last, we’re able to share our stories – frankly and candidly – to a receptive audience.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e21f1a9138d2f0830f1e241b78df7eb5b843f0c/0_401_7775_4663/master/7775.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c7235fc4381308bb248baf34677e68c","title":"global report china detects highest daily case rise in months greece welcomes tourists","story":"Partial quarantine remains in Beijing European countries continue to open borders to neighboursChina detected its highest number of daily coronavirus cases in months on Sunday, locking down parts of Beijing in a warning of the difficulties of avoiding a resurgence of the pandemic as Europe prepared to open more borders and loosen restrictions this week.A wholesale food market in the Chinese capital, where traces of the virus were detected, was closed at the weekend. Nearby housing estates were also placed under quarantine after authorities detected 36 new coronavirus cases in the city and another 19 across the country.The discovery sparked fears of a possible second wave of a virus that was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December but which appeared to be declining in the country by March as most of the world entered lockdowns. With many countries loosening restrictions, the Chinese flareup illustrated the difficulty in keeping the virus suppressed.“The meat sellers have had to close. This disease is really scary,” a fruit and vegetable trader told Agence France-Presse at another central Beijing market.“As long as you wear a face mask, it should be fine,” said a shopper, Song Weiming. “Anyway, I have to buy food, right?”The total number of coronavirus cases around the world passed 7.8m on Sunday, with more than 430,000 recorded deaths. Infections were still rising in Latin America, Afghanistan warned it was running out of testing capacity, and cases rebounded in Israel a few weeks after it started relaxing its quarantine.France detected fewer than 30 cases for the fourth day in a row as the virus appeared to continue to ebb across Europe. Member states continued opening borders to each other, with Spain the next to welcome visitors from across the continent starting on Monday.The EU has recommended that states fully reopen their borders from 15 June but some, such as Poland and Greece, have already done so. The Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, travelled to picturesque Santorini island on Saturday to open his country’s tourism season. “Greece is ready to welcome tourists this summer by putting safety and health as our number one priority,” he said in English.After appearing to be spared in the early months of the outbreak, south Asia is struggling to stem new cases, with Pakistan’s planning minister warning on Sunday that the country’s cases could double by the end of the month and peak at 1.2m by late July.He said the country needed to stop “taking the problem lightly”, although figures including the prime minister, Imran Khan, have said physical distancing and closing businesses are impossible in the developing country and could be more life-threatening than the virus. Pakistan has recorded 140,000 Covid-19 cases and 2,700 deaths.Iran’s daily death toll exceeded 100 for the first time since 13 April, taking the overall number of deaths to more than 8,800. “It was very painful for us to announce the triple-digit figure,” the health ministry spokeswoman, Sima Sadat Lari, said. “This is an unpredictable and wild virus and may surprise us at any time.”Russia, the third-worst affected country with more than 500,000 confirmed cases, was emerging from its first wave “with minimal losses”, the president, Vladimir Putin, said on Sunday. He drew a comparison between his country’s performance and the US.Russia has recorded nearly 7,000 deaths, a figure that some have questioned, while the US has the worst outbreak in the world with more than 2m cases and 115,000 recorded deaths.A sharp increase in cases in Chile plunged the government into crisis and prompted the resignation of the health minister, Jaime Mañalich, on Saturday, shortly after 234 deaths in 24 hours had been confirmed, the highest daily toll to date.The Afghan health ministry said it was unable to increase testing for coronavirus due to a lack of laboratories and an overload of suspected patients. Ahmad Jawad Osmani, the acting health minister, said on Saturday medical workers would determine new coronavirus patients through their symptoms, rather than through tests, as the number of confirmed infections in the capital Kabul exceeded 10,000.Israel has reported a spike in coronavirus cases as schools, businesses, restaurants, bars, tourist attractions and other establishments reopen, leading to 177 educational institutions throughout the country closing again after nearly 500 students and teachers tested positive for the virus.The World Health Organization said this week the pandemic was accelerating in Africa. Botswana’s capital, Gaborone, was locked down on Saturday after new cases were detected.And in the US, which has reported the most Covid-19 deaths with more than 115,000, more than a dozen states, including populous Texas and Florida, reported their highest daily case totals in recent days.Agencies contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fe7393b4c8e6b51169a898e6cc03f14cee48aea/0_327_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26855730ab144074d41b881ffe9d1e72","title":"hong kong activists urge uk to spell out extended visa offer","story":"NGO demands more details on Boris Johnson’s ‘vague and imprecise’ commitmentHong Kong democracy campaigners are pressing the Foreign Office to spell out how Boris Johnson’s “vague and imprecise commitment” will give a path to British citizenship to millions of residents.It came as Johnson wrote to seven former UK foreign secretaries saying he is trying to build a global groundswell of opposition to Chinese plans to impose a new security law in Hong Kong. Johnson said he is “working with a host of international grouping from the G7 and beyond to impress on them the gravity of the situation”. However, he said Britain could provide a lead without needing to form an international contact group, similar to that established during the Balkans crisis in the 1990s, as the seven former foreign secretaries had suggested.A fortnight ago Johnson responded to China’s plans by saying he was prepared to give extendable visas to millions of Hong Kong citizens entitled to hold a British national (overseas) passport. It is thought there are 350,000 BNO passport holders but a further 2 million are eligible to apply. BNO status is not available to those born after 1 July 1997, the point of Hong Kong’s handover to China. In the most explicit aspect of the offer, the government said those eligible for BNO status will have their visa-free entry period for the UK extended from six to 12 months. This might provide a pathway to citizenship, it added. They will have the ability to apply to work and study.But some Hong Kong campaigners are becoming alarmed at the lack of detail, fearing Johnson may be willing to give only the impression of a generous offer partly to deter China from pressing ahead with its security crackdown. China has angrily objected to the offer, seeing it as interference in another country’s internal affairs.A briefing for Hong Kong Watch, a UK NGO that promotes human rights in the territory, prepared by immigration lawyers, expressed concern the UK offer may be severely circumscribed, and what has been offered so far is “vague and imprecise”.The briefing said: “It is important now that proper attention is paid to the details so that the proposed changes to the immigration rules provide the lifeline that BNOs, and Hongkongers, need.”The briefing expressed concerns the Home Office could severely limit the offer by placing stringent financial requirements on those seeking entrance, or by limiting BNO passport holders access to public funds. There is also doubt as to whether BNO passport holders seeking to continue in higher education will have to pay international student fees, rather than the much lower home students fee.The briefing also points out that the government has not been clear on the rights of dependants. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has simply told the shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, in a written answer that he will consider the issue of BNO passport holders’ dependants.Alistair Carmichael, the Liberal Democrats foreign affairs spokesperson and chair of the all-party parliamentary group on Hong Kong, said: “We need to hear in detail, and with urgency, exactly what the government mean when they say that they will provide a ‘pathway to citizenship’ for British national (overseas) passport holders.“Will the government guarantee swift, easy passage for Hongkongers in need of a lifeline? What will the measures mean for young people born after 1997, vulnerable to a crackdown from Beijing? Clarity is urgently needed.”The report also asks how long BNO status holders will have to be continuously resident in the UK before being eligible to apply for indefinite leave to remain. Currently, for example, if a BNO status holder is in the UK as a student under tier 4, there is no direct route to ILR, and the BNO status holder student would require 10 years’ continuous residence before one might be eligible for ILR.There is also concern that the proposals exclude young people, specifically those born after 1997, even though they are more likely than any group to be the target of Chinese government repression since they have been most active in the demonstrations against Chinese rule.Carmichael said: “We need to hear in detail, and with urgency, exactly what the Government mean when they say that they will provide a “pathway to citizenship” for British national (overseas) passport holders.“Will the government guarantee swift, easy passage for Hongkongers in need of a lifeline? What will the measures mean for young people born after 1997, vulnerable to a crackdown from Beijing? Clarity is urgently needed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e53e5e8f28aabf4c35d8fa17d8586a3ab4da87b1/0_162_4550_2730/master/4550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c924a5011eb4b151a199367acf3e150","title":"trial of journalists rappler philippines","story":"Editor of news website Rappler could face prison if convicted under ‘cyber libel’ lawA verdict will be issued on Monday following the controversial trial of one of the Philippines’ most prominent journalists, in a case widely condemned as an attack on press freedom under Rodrigo Duterte.A court in Manila will issue a verdict on Rappler, one of the country’s most influential news websites, its editor, Maria Ressa, and former researcher and writer Reynaldo Santos Jr on Monday. Ressa, who was arrested last year on charges of “cyber libel” for a story published by Rappler in 2012, has described the allegations as baseless.Both Ressa and Rappler – which has exposed corruption, extrajudicial killings and online troll armies – have faced a series of charges over the past year. Most of the claims relate to allegations over the news site’s finances.The arrest of Ressa prompted the United Nations high commissioner for human rights to warn in February 2019 that there appeared to be “a pattern of intimidation” of independent media in the Philippines. Duterte has dismissed Rappler as fake news.The site has closely scrutinised his administration, including the brutal anti-drugs campaign that the UN recently warned had led to “widespread and systematic” extrajudicial killings. Government figures indicate at least 8,663 people have been killed in the crackdown other estimates put the toll at triple that number.Ressa has described the approaching verdict as “an existential moment” for democracy in the country, where there are major concerns about shrinking democratic rights.Just last month, the country’s biggest broadcaster, ABS-CBN, was forced off air by a cease-and-desist order that was condemned as a brazen attempt to muzzle the media. Meanwhile a new anti-terrorism act has been recently passed by lawmakers, allowing warrantless arrests, weeks of detention without charge and other powers that rights groups fear could be used against government critics.Media freedom in the Philippines has deteriorated under Duterte, and the country now ranks 136th out of 180 countries on the Reporters Without Borders (RSF) World Press Freedom Index. On top of the use of trumped-up legal charges against journalists, its analysis cited threats of violence against reporters and online harassment campaigns waged by pro-Duterte troll armies.If found guilty on Monday, Ressa and Santos could face up to 12 years in prison. Another of the most prominent critics of Duterte’s narco war, Senator Leila de Lima, has been in jail for three years over drug allegations that she says are politically motivated.The cyber-libel charge against Rappler relates to a story published on the website in May 2012 that alleged ties between a Philippine businessman, Wilfredo D Keng, and a high court judge.The case was first brought in 2017, and initially dismissed by the National Bureau of Investigation because it was outside the statute of limitations. But in 2018 the justice department allowed the case to proceed to trial, extending the liability period for such cases from one to 12 years.Ressa and her legal counsel point out that the controversial cyber-libel law did not exist at the time of publication, and was in fact only enacted four months after the story was written. However, the justice department allowed the case to go ahead because the online article had been updated in February 2014 to correct a spelling error.In total, Rappler and its officers and staff have faced at least 11 government investigations and court cases. Ressa has won international plaudits for her journalism and refusal to be cowed by what rights groups have described as judicial harassment. She was among those named Time person of the year in 2018, and won the 2018 Knight International Journalism award as well as a press freedom award given by the Committee to Protect Journalists.Monday’s verdict will be issued at a court in Manila where a limited number of people will be present as part of ongoing measures to reduce coronavirus transmission.Judge Rainelda Estacio-Montesa finished the trial in just eight months, far more quickly than other recent libel cases. The verdict can be appealed against in the supreme court."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2f992d8b6c28b4a945117323b005ae4b645c7d6/0_5_6048_3630/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18b71752fc1133d96c55aee9d9cd3009","title":"who cautions against further lifting lockdown england","story":"Exclusive: senior official says contact tracing should be more effective before measures easedEngland’s coronavirus lockdown should not be further lifted until the government’s contact-tracing system has proven to be “robust and effective”, the World Health Organization has said after widespread criticism of the first results of the new tracking operation.As shops across England prepared to reopen, and people were encouraged by the government to come out of their homes and on to the high street, Dr Hans Kluge, the WHO’s director for Europe, cautioned that the UK remained in a “very active phase of the pandemic”.His remarks came as ministers confirmed a review of the 2-metre distancing rule, with the government coming under pressure from business leaders, Tory backbenchers and rightwing media to further ease the lockdown. Boris Johnson said on Sunday that the falling numbers of coronavirus cases has given the government “more margin for manoeuvre” in easing the 2-metre physical distancing rule.In response to data showing the government had failed to trace the contacts of a third of those testing positive in the first week of the new system, Kluge warned in an interview with the  against rushing into reopening the economy.The WHO official said the tracking in England of about 31,000 contacts of 8,000 infected people was encouraging and a cause for congratulations. But he added that Downing Street needed to be convinced it could “aggressively” track infections as the prime minister looks to reopen the economy.As of Saturday there were 41,662 deaths in the UK – a daily increase of 1,425 confirmed cases and 181 deaths.Governments who locked down early in the pandemic, in the face of public criticism, had recorded fewer deaths during the pandemic, Kluge said, but European leaders would now be judged on their management of their exit from the restrictions.“We know that early lockdowns saved lives and bought some time for the health system to be ready,” Kluge said when asked about the British government’s record. “But I would rather than instead of looking to the past, jump to the future and say that the question of lifting the lockdown is as important as going to the lockdown. The key words here are to do it gradually. Do it carefully.On Thursday, Dido Harding, the chair of the NHS test-and-trace service, admitted that the UK’s scheme – billed as “world-beating” by Boris Johnson – would need to improve.Of the 8,117 positive cases referred to contact tracers, 5,407 had been willing to hand over the names and phone numbers of people they had met in the previous two days. Despite the stumbling start and the lack of a promised coronavirus app slated for launch by the end of May, Johnson is under growing pressure from Conservative backbenchers to push on with lifting the lockdown amid grim forecasts of mass unemployment.“We know that the situation in the UK is still being taken very seriously,” Kluge said. “But we also know that it is a balance between three factors: population health, economic and social, and the third is the wellbeing of the people. So whatever the country decides: be ready. It is not over. And whatever decision you make, please make sure it is based on public health and epidemiological observations.”Kluge said international comparisons were difficult but that the pandemic had shown the importance of governments being able to communicate effectively with the public to convince them of the necessity of respecting the unprecedented nature of the requests being made.Noting that Downing Street had delayed going into lockdown in early March for fear that the population would fail to follow the rules with rigour as the restrictions dragged on, Kluge said: “What is the lesson there? Keep people engaged.”Kluge said he could understand the government’s caution despite calls from senior Conservatives, including the former leader, Iain Duncan Smith, for a rethink on the 2-metre guidance. Johnson has ordered a review of the policy to be completed by July.“Every country has their own context, based on a risk assessment. In the UK I would say this is a very active phase in the pandemic so, more let’s say, careful,” he said. “There is no right or wrong. Of course, ideally, it would be everywhere the same but countries are doing this based on their own risk assessment …“Whether it’s one or two metre is less important than the fact that people will adhere to the measures, to the physical distancing, to the handwashing, to the respiratory hygiene, and that they understand that it’s not over. This is the key issue.”With Europeans eyeing up the potential of summer holidays, Kluge said Europe as a whole could not be complacent, with infection rates increasing in the past fortnight in Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and North Macedonia. The Europe region within Kluge’s remit is made up of 53 countries: the UK, the member states of the EU, and the countries of central and eastern Europe including Turkey and Russia.The reopening of schools had led to some local flare-ups in Europe that were swiftly contained, Kluge said, and the continent could face a deadly combination of a second wave of coronavirus and an influenza pandemic in the autumn.“We call it when ‘Covid will meet the flu’,” Kluge said. “The issue is that several epidemics can go together and how do you have policies in place? We put an expert group together to look at that because no one has the ideal answer.”Kluge said it would be crucial for governments to distribute the influenza vaccine among the groups most vulnerable to Covid-19: older people, men, and generally people with underlying conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and renal disease.There are 135 potential vaccine candidates for Covid-19, of which 10 are in clinical trial. Kluge said it “may well take a year, a year and a half now” before a vaccine could be ready. “My understanding is that it’s still a bit early in the day. Of course one thing is efficacy, but then the other one is safety … We are hopeful and there’s a lot of effort. But, until that moment, let’s implement what we know works.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4275395.1591779019!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"holidays at home embrace our weather eat chipper chips and buy wetsuits","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Do a bit of research and find the best chipper wherever you are going\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Don’t waste your holiday and the run-up praying for good weather. Don’t even think about it and just accept that it will be mixed. Photograph: Frank MillerThe  In the weeks ahead, Irish people will be holidaying at home in greater numbers than at any point since the 1970s when shorts were short and hair was permed. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and the shutting of borders and the grounding of virtually all flights in and out of Ireland, people with plans to travel overseas have had to look closer to home. With that in mind we thought it might be useful to try and conjure up some useful tips for holidaying at home for those people who might not have done it in decades.1. Why does it always rain on me?: Irish people tend to be just a little obsessed by the weather. We talk about it with enthusiasm and flair and worry about it endlessly. Who amongst us hasn’t spent hours on a grey summer’s day staring at impenetrable clouds wondering if that is a break in the gloom we can see and a sliver of blue sky far, far away. Bad weather and the fear of it is one of the main reasons we started leaving this country in our droves in the 1980s and 1990s when overseas travel became the norm rather than the exception. But we need to recalibrate our national psyche and change our mindset this year if we are to get the best out of whatever the gods throw at us. We need to be more like the Germans and the French and the Americans who come here and love the weather.So, don’t waste your holiday and the run-up praying for good weather. Don’t even think about it and just accept that it will be mixed. It won’t be horrendous, there are not that that many days in the summer when it rains non-stop, but nor will it be amazing. Whatever it is you will still be able to make the best of it.2. Appy talk: Staying with the weather, the days of staring at the sky wondering if the end is nigh for the rain have long since been confined to the dustbin of history. The weather app on your phone will be your friend this summer. It will give you real-time hour by hour information on the weather wherever you are in the country. Treat it like your bible. If it tells you that between 2pm and 4pm, the sun will shine or at least the clouds will part briefly, plan your time at the beach or in the great outdoors around that. If your phone tells you it will be nicer in the morning than in the evening, get up earlier and if it is due to be nicer in the evening than in the morning allowing yourself a lie in. And yes, we do appreciate that this makes it sound very much like we are obsessing about the weather. Old habits and all that.3. Wet, wet wet: When Pricewatch were a lad, beach days were all about weirdly tight and uncomfortable nylon action mad speedos and luridly coloured windbreakers to shield our sandwiches from the savage bite of the swirling sands. It doesn’t have to be like that and you can have a day of fun at the beach and in the water without wishing you were far away. Will the water be lovely and warm? Probably not. Will you spend hours playing in the sea? Not without getting hypothermia. Is a bracing dip in the wild Atlantic waves a wonderfully invigorating way to spend a bitesize portions of your summer? It absolutely is. And Ireland has come a long way since the 70s. Today we have wet suits. You can pick up cheap ones in supermarkets – we understand that Aldi will be selling them in the weeks ahead – and in dedicated outdoorsy shops. While spending €300 on four for an average sized family may seem like a lot, if they allow you to defy the weather gods and frolic in the waves for hours over the course of a fortnight’s holiday it will be money well spent.4. Indoor amusements: Before you leave do all the research you need into the indoor fun you can have wherever you are going. While the indoor options are somewhat limited this year for obvious reasons, there are things you will be able to do if you have to deal with a miserable day. There will be museums, libraries and heritage centres to visit. There might even be the odd play centre open too. The trick is to work out your options before you leave home so you can have a few things to hand when you wake up to sheets of rain hammering the roof of your caravan or hotel room. By being a bit organised in the days before you leave you will help you to avoid the “Jaysus, what on earth are we going to do now,” moment.5. Play schools: Don’t just pack the car with clothes and beachy stuff. Bring board games, jig saws and playing cards. If you were on holidays overseas you would most likely not be watching the telly of an evening so there is absolutely no reason to do so while on holidays at home. If you have children over eight and have yet to teach them the joys of poker, Blackjack or 25, then now is the time. They will thank you for it when they are older and winning money off their friends at late night poker schools or taking the bank to the cleaners in Vegas.6. Streams of gold: Okay, so, we know we said that a summer holiday was no time to be watching the television, but that does not mean you have to spend your staycation living like an Amish. Decide on maybe 10 movies that you would be happy to watch over the course of your holiday. Bring a laptop or tablet, hook it up to the TV wherever you are staying and then watch them at your leisure. You might want to download them if you are concerned that the quality of the broadband wherever you end up is not up to scratch. Carefully chosen movies are better than mindlessly watching repeats of Reeling in the Years. And we love Reeling in the years.7. Make rules: There is absolutely no point in banning children from using their devices while they are on their holiday, particularly if you are not prepared to live under the same rules. But do set limits on how and when devices can be used. And then stick to them. This is good for both adults and for children. Just because you are on holiday at home does not mean that you have to be checking your phone every five minutes or answering work emails. There will be times while you are on leave that you might not feel like you are on leave given the familiarity of the surroundings but your are, so take the time off.8. Drive: There was nothing that would fill the child Pricewatch’s heart with dread more than an adult uttering the phrase “Let’s go for a drive”. In this scenario, the adults would sit in the front of the car – usually chain smoking with the window’s rolled up against the rain – while the children would rattle around the back with not so much as a single seat belt between them. It was as foul smelling as it was boring. However, we have it on very good account from a colleague who routinely goes on summer holidays in Ireland that drives are fun things to do with children. “Just never describe it to them as a ‘drive’,” this colleague warned us. “It’s a trip to some alluring destination, a mysterious beach, the best ice cream parlour in the west.” That sounds like a fine idea to us.9. Eat: Take advantage of where you are by exploring all the best food the region has to offer. It might be something simple like new potatoes or strawberries bought off the side of the road in Wexford or lobster pushed straight from the coastal waters off the coast of Sligo. The key thing is to treat yourself this year and, if you can, spend more than you might while at home. You are on holiday at home but that does not mean you have to shop in Aldi or Lidl. By eating the nicest of food you can find from local suppliers you will not only be rewarding yourself, you will be making life a little bit easier for local retailers and food producers who have been absolutely hammered by the pandemic. And while we are on the topic of food, make picnics and include crisps in every sandwich. It is cheap and it is fun.10. Wear sunblock: The routine for a sun holiday tends to involve lathering everyone in sun cream before the day gets going. But we tend to be a bit more relaxed about it when holidaying at home for obvious reasons. But the sun that burns us when we are on a beach on the Costa Brave is the same sun that can burn us while we are on a beach in Connemara. And we have said this before and we will say it again, there is no need to get hung up on fancy brands of sun cream either. Most supermarkets stock their own creams and oils for a fraction of the price you’ll pay elsewhere and according to consumer magazine Which? – they’re just as good as all the rest.11. Crosstown traffic: When the sun shines in Ireland many of us will decide to take a spontaneous trip to the beach. That is all fine and dandy until you find yourself watching the day pass you by while you are stuck in traffic. So, no matter what part of the country you find yourself in the weeks ahead, before you race off to the beach, take a moment to look at Google Maps. You won’t be looking for directions – you will probably be able to make your way to the local beaches unaided – but what you are looking for is traffic congestion. The software uses some class of sorcery to establish how bad the traffic is on whatever route you fancy in real time. A 90 second look may save you spending two hours of a rare sunny day stuck in traffic jams swearing at fellow drivers and shouting at your children.12. The tide is high, or is it?: Oh, and in case you forget – like Pricewatch has done far too often – unlike the Mediterranean, the waters around Ireland are tidal and can be dramatically so. So before you race off to the beach for a bracing dip, check where the water’s edge is likely to be. The Irish Tides and Tidal Ireland apps will be able to help you out.13. Keep it fun: “Are we there yet?” “I’m thirsty.” “I need to go to the toilet.” “Juliette scratched me.” “I can’t find my Elsa doll.” Kids are brilliant but cross-country journeys can be long and trying. If you’re taking a road trip with smallies plan some games in advance so you’re not left thinking up things on the fly. Here are three that might work. There is I Spy (obvs) - top tip: ban things that were outside the car for half a second as you sped along a motorway. Road Trip Bingo is always a winner but it takes prep. Print out bespoke bingo cards and give each player a pencil. When they see something on their card, they scratch it out. The more items you have on the card the less time they have to fight. With I’m Going on a Picnic, the first player says, “I’m going on a picnic and I’m bringing . . . an apple” or something else that begins with A. The second player repeats what the first person said, but adds something that begins with B. And on it goes. Make the prizes substantial to keep interest levels high.14. Book smarts: If you can’t think of any games to play or if the level of interest is low, download some audio books and everything will be golden. A David Walliams book read by the author himself or a Harry Potter read by Stephen Fry will see many journeys fly by. If you have older people in a car and want something hilarious to listen to, we couldn’t recommend the books of David Sedaris highly enough.15. Chipper chips: Do a bit of research and find the best chipper wherever you are going. Chipper chips, bread, butter and a cup of tea is a summer meal sorted. If you are really fancy you can throw in some mushy peas some battered cod and maybe even a pint of stout. You won’t get the like of it anywhere but home."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Homeowners want to radically improve their homes, says Tipperary Energy AgencyStudents would only be able to attend one or two days a week if rule not changed, says Minister"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Avian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Laura Hutton Dr Caroline Robins says since her dental surgery in Carlow town reopened last month there have been “a lot of patients coming in with broken fillings”. “You could probably say it’s down to the Covid diet, the sweets and crisps and things like that, we’ve seen a lot of broken fillings,” she says. Ms Robins’ surgery, Kiwi Dental, remained open during lockdown for emergency treatments and phone consultations, and reopened for routine services on May 18th. There has also been an increase in patients mentioning teeth grinding, she says.“A lot of people have said themselves ‘I think I was clenching’ or ‘I think I broke the tooth because I was grinding in my sleep’. “I know myself I’m waking up in the morning and I’m absolutely clenching,” she says. “It’s been a very worrying time, it’s very stressful. You worry for your staff, patients, the business. It’s not been a healthy time but I just have to be positive that we are allowed to be back.” Ms Robins says her surgery has been very busy since reopening for routine services but due to social distancing guidelines she hasn’t been able to see as many patients per day. “The number of patients who I would see in a day has decreased. I would have probably seen about an average of 15 a day,” she says. “When I first went back I was probably managing to see seven or eight. We’re nearly three weeks into it now, it’s fine tuning itself but you don’t see as many in a day. We can’t facilitate drop-ins, people can’t just drop in to the surgery like they used to.“Everything is through front of house, we triage very well on the phone, we have very specific questions that the patients are asked. They obviously have to pass that before we make an appointment.”Childcare problemsBut she notes that while dentists and dental hygienists are used to wearing PPE and cross-contamination controls, childcare remains a problem for staff. “We’re caught, like lots of places, some of my staff have childcare issues and they can’t come back to work yet. I am back full-time and working an extra day,” she says. “I’d say that’s the reality for a lot of places and we’re just trying to work around it as best we can.” Ms Robins says despite the uncertainty the pandemic has brought, it has resulted in some positives for her business. “It’s been good in terms of sitting down and looking at your business model and how the place is run and fine tuning things,” she says. “There are some good things I think have come from it. I never had a moment to sit down and think before, you would race from one patient to the next to the next. It’s very pressurised. You’re constantly against the clock. “Looking at other bits of the business during the downtime has been helpful and seeing where changes can be made.” Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4279032.1592165771!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new visitor rules for nursing homes as restrictions lifted","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tResidents will be limited to two named visitors, who must undergo temperature checks beforehand.

Visits will be staggered and limited to less than 30 minutes, with each visitor allowed one visit per week. Children under 16 will not be allowed to make visits.Residents will be limited to two named visitors, who must undergo temperature checks beforehand.Retail units in shopping centres are also due to reopen on Monday, provided they have put in place measures to prevent the spread of infection. The measure was brought forward from August under the Government’s decision to speed up the roadmap for easing restrictions.Blood samplesMeanwhile, more than 5,000 people in Dublin and Sligo are to be invited to give blood samples from Monday as part of the first study aiming to determine the prevalence of Covid-19 in the population.The seroprevalence study, which will measure exposure to the virus using an antibody blood test, involves a representative sample of people from areas with higher and lower levels of infection.So far, the only testing that has been done in Ireland has been to determine if a person is infected with the virus.While the presence of antibodies afford some protection, it does not guarantee immunity.Face coveringsThe Irish College of General Practitioners has called on the public to use face coverings when shopping and on public transport.“While full scientific evidence is not yet available on the efficacy of face coverings, we are encouraging people to use them when possible, as they are another barrier against transmission of the virus,” said Dr Nuala O’Connor of the ICGP. “They do not replace the measures we know with greater certainty stop the virus spreading – 2m social distancing, practicing good hand hygiene and cough etiquette.”People should take immediate action if they have even mild symptoms of Covid-19, such as cough, mild fever or dry throat, she also advised. One more person has died in the Republic from coronavirus, the Department of Health said on Sunday. The daily update by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) reported eight new cases, bringing the total number of cases to 25,303.There have now been a total 1,706 Covid-19 related deaths in the Republic of Ireland.The team meets later this week to review progress towards easing restrictions, and in countering the spread of the disease. Based on its recommendations, the Government will decide whether to bring forward any further easing of restrictions to the third phase of the plan on June 29th.Meanwhile, a wholesale food market in the Chinese capital Beijing where traces of the virus were detected, was closed at the weekend. Nearby housing estates were also placed under quarantine after authorities detected 36 new coronavirus cases in the city and another 19 across the country.

Photograph: Getty ImagesA “large increase” in rats leaving the sewers and infesting city streets and suburbs has emerged during the coronavirus pandemic as pest control teams have been curtailed, Dublin City Council has said.Rats, described by one councillor as big enough to “put a saddle on”, are eating through brickwork and circumventing traps to infest homes, gardens and even cars.Recent warm weather, fewer people on the streets and increased illegal dumping had encouraged more rats into the open, the council said. However its ability to tackle infestations had been reduced as the Health Service Executive (HSE)pest control services were restricted during the pandemic.Sinn Féin councillor Daniel Céitinn said south inner city residential areas around York Street, Montague Court and Bishop Street were becoming overrun with rats.“They are nesting in broken drains and seem to be becoming more aggressive in their search for food. They’re also getting into cars and ruining the engines,” he said. “I understand resources are scare at the moment , but not dealing with this is creating another health emergency.”SuburbsInfestations were multiplying in the suburbs too. Fianna Fáil’s Racheal Batten said there were particular problems in estates around Beaumont. Reduced activity during Covid-19 restrictions “seems to have given them a better chance to breed”, she said.Independent councillor Noeleen Reilly said there were similar problems in Ballymun. “I’ve never seen illegal dumping as bad, and that is definitely leading to an increase in rats.”The council said there had been “a large increase in the number of rats coming up from the pipe networks and onto the streets” and “we had instances where rats had eaten through brickwork in manholes and somehow managed to get by trap gullies on the roadways”.PoisonsControlling the rat populations was becoming increasingly problematic because of stricter regulation of poisons and because rat “enforcement action” was a matter for the HSE.“During the Covid-19 crisis, the HSE did not carry out pest control in our flat complexes, as they did prior to the pandemic. In the absence of the HSE, Dublin City Council continued to provide this service, which placed additional strain on our resources.”The HSE said it had been restricted on entering homes during the pandemic, but had continued to provide external “rodent control”.

Photograph:     Pavel GolovkinAPThe wife of a Dublin businessman barred from leaving China for 15 months has made a direct appeal to the Irish Government to intervene and push for his release.Tara O’Halloran said her husband Richard has been largely confined to a hotel since an exit ban was imposed on him, the first of its kind in China against an Irish citizen.Speaking publicly about her husband’s detention for the first time, Ms O’Halloran said he has been caught up in complicated events that pre-date his time in the aviation leasing company he works for. She fears for his physical and mental health, and the risks he faces during the coronavirus pandemic given that he suffers from a lung condition.AccusedMr O’Halloran has been blocked from leaving the country over an investigation into Chinese businessman Min Jiedong, owner of Dublin-based China International Aviation Leasing Service (CIALS), the firm the Irish man works for, concerning peer-to-peer lending and crowd-funding.The authorities have accused Mr Min of illegally collecting money from the Chinese public in a crowd-funding scheme and using it to buy an aircraft, currently leased to an airline in Europe.Mr O’Halloran, who joined the company a year after the events under investigation, travelled to China in February 2019 to meet investors and assess the problems facing the firm. After a week of meetings in Shanghai, he was detained at passport control at the airport as he tried to board his flight back to Dublin. He was later issued with an exit ban.The businessman, a relative of former Fine Gael taoiseach Garret FitzGerald, has testified as a witness four times in the prosecution of Mr Min. However, he has not been permitted to leave China despite both the prosecutor and Mr Min telling the court he should be.The Chinese authorities argue that Mr O’Halloran promised to transfer the aircraft and leasing revenues connected to the plane back to the Irish company’s Chinese parent but has not done so.“Under this circumstance, Mr O’Halloran is restricted from leaving China by law,” the Chinese embassy in Dublin said in a statement.The embassy said the Chinese police and court are “actively investigating and handling the case of CIALS in order to protect the property rights and interests of the victims involved in the case.“It is hoped that Mr O’Halloran co-operates positively with the local authorities in Shanghai to bring this case to a successful conclusion at an early date,” it said.Ms O’Halloran says her husband is being asked to do something he cannot do under Irish law. “It is not possible . . . it is entirely out of his hands.”Ms O’Halloran says he has co-operated with the authorities in China and that it was “a matter for the authorities to bring matters to a speedy conclusion and to allow Richard to return home to his family”.FrustratedAfter an initial meeting with Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and contacts with his department, Ms O’Halloran says the family have had no further feedback.“So far they have just paid lip service. My children want their dad back,” she says.She has been frustrated seeing the department helping bring others home.“With the Covid-19 pandemic, I see them repatriating everybody else from all over the world to come back to Ireland to be safe, yet they can’t get Richard home. He needs their help.”A spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs said: “We are aware of the case and are providing consular assistance. We do not comment on the details of inidual consular cases.”Ms O’Halloran said her husband missed the death of her mother in January, “nearly two lots of birthdays” and other important family occasions.His long absence has badly affected their four children, Ben (13), Amber (11), Isabella (eight) and Scarlett (six) who sleeps with a framed photo of her father.“It is very difficult for them to understand because we don’t know when he is coming home or even if, at this stage,” she says.Ms O’Halloran says her husband is permitted to leave his hotel but she fears the virus would “kill him” if he contracted it. He largely confines himself to his hotel room.“It has definitely taken a huge toll mentally and emotionally. It is horrific.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4278837.1592141739!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"passport office staff redeployed to covid 19 roles","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCatherine Bannon,  head of the passport office on Mount Street. Photograph: Alan BetsonAt the start of March hundreds of staff in the Passport Office were gearing themselves up for another busy season processing applications from tens of thousands of Irish people keen to travel off the island when – overnight – everything was turned on its head.Panicked Irish citizens suddenly desperate to return home from overseas before the world went into an unprecedented lockdown started making frantic calls to the office on Dublin’s Mount Street while applications from holiday makers just stopped. Within days the entire operation was reconfigured. Some staff were erted to work with the Department of Social Protection to provide information to the public on emergency welfare payments others switched focus towards the provision of emergency passports and getting people home while dozens were reassigned to complex contact tracing and charged with finding the connections of people too sick with Covid-19 to provide much by way of detail of their next of kin. “There has been a huge reduction in the number of passports being processed so we are supporting other aspects of government,” says director of the Irish Passport Office, Fiona Penollar. At the height of the crisis 250 staff were redeployed to work with the Department of Social Protection answering queries and helping people to process applications for Covid-19 benefits while 150 others did crisis consular work, helping people who need to get home and helping people who need supports while overseas. There were also 35 people working in the contact tracing area.“The way we have adapted has made me very proud, we have jumped from passport processing to something completely different and everyone did that without question or complaint because they knew it was for the greater good,” Penollar says. She suggests that some elements of the jobs done now are “very different” while in other respects they are similar to what was done before. She cites the example of complex contact tracing: “We have had the experience of following threads,” she says. “Sometimes when we are processing a passport application, we have to work out a story and link people to somebody whose grandmother may have been born in Ireland at the turn of the 20th century. Today some of the cases come to us if people have been too ill to provide details of next of kin and we use our skills to try to find out who they are and who needs to be contacted next.”Elevated stress levelsShe says that when it came to dealing with social welfare queries, the skills passport office staff have in managing people with elevated stress levels has helped. “Sometimes what you need to do is calm somebody down so they can hear what you’re saying and understand it.”And, in terms of providing consular assistance, in the early stages of the crisis it was all about repatriation with passport office staff working 18 hours a day, seven days a week. However, in more recent times, the focus has shifted towards the welfare of Irish people overseas people who have lost their jobs or can’t pay the rent and need to find out where the supports are or those who are in a foreign country and need medical intervention and don’t know how to contact a doctor. “For people on the front line it can be very stressful and this sounds twee but knowing you are doing something that is helping other people really makes a difference. We know we don’t go into the civil service for favour or for fortune but you know getting a child out of this country so she can have cancer treatment in a European country during this crisis, well, that’s something to be proud of and that’s something that will change somebody’s life.”Catherine Bannon looks after the Covid crisis line in the passport office and, in the early stages, her team was dealing with about 1,000 queries. It handles about 200 a day now. “In the beginning most calls were from overseas from citizens who needed to come home before borders shut,” Bannon says. “We had to work out ways to get them back. There is also medical emergencies and deaths and while they are always a challenge, they are much more because of the restricted travel so finding people a route home became quite complex.” The calls now are from people wondering when they can travel for work “and then there are people who are calling us to see if they will be able to go on holidays in Lanzarote during the summer we call those the crystal ball calls”.Emergency passportsSiobhán Byrne is responsible for managing the emergency passports with the most important category those who need a passport for medical treatment in another country and those who have suffered a bereavement and need to travel. There have also been “lots of newborns born overseas to Irish parents and sometimes they’re living in countries that require them to have a passport we have seen about 20 of those. Who knew so many Irish births were happening around the world?”Her team also pulled out all the stops to get an emergency passport to a pilot flying PPE equipment back from China. “He only had three months left on his passport and the Chinese authorities require that there is it least six months left on the passport before they will allow a person to travel,” she says. “There has to be a very genuine reason and if there is we will bend over backwards to help people in those situations.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4278798.1592133156!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the old lady was glaring about when dublin s queen victoria statue was removed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe statue of Queen Victoria in Dublin, dated after 1908. Photograph: National Library of IrelandFlickr CommonsThe end, for Victoria, wasn’t particularly dignified.“As I watched, another workman appeared, clambering over her head, gripping her sometimes by the nose and occasionally sticking a finger into her disdainful eye. Perhaps it was just the effect of the glistening rain on the bright, green copper, but it seemed to me that the old lady - never exactly pleasant-looking at the best of times - was glaring about with loathing and disgust.”So reads an account in The  of the removal of the controversial statue of Britain’s Queen Victoria that stood for more than 40 years at Leinster House.The scenes are described in the Irishman’s Diary of the following day, July 23rd, 1948. She’s depicted on the front page, too - suspended by machinery as people look on. “Ministers, ex-Ministers and Dáil deputies stood around in the rain, waiting. There were crowds on the steps of the Museum and the Library and there were cameras everywhere. Meanwhile the workmen worked away with that maddeningly measured, deliberate air of men who know that they hold stage.“Several times we thought the big moment had come - once she did lurch from her pedestal for a second or two and creak back again - but just as everything was adjusted it would start to pour and everyone would have to rush for shelter.”In the end, Quidnunc missed the finale. “For a while longer I watched the men adjust and readjust the girths around Victoria’s middle then I had to go up to the Leinster Bowling Club to see the South African match. When I returned, Victoria was missing from her pedestal.” The statue was later moved to Kilmainham.The piece - comical, yet dry and straightforward - unflatteringly describes an audience and spectacle much different to that on the day the statue was erected.‘Mutilated’Searching for references to Dublin’s statue of Queen Victoria throws up a couple of parallels in the archive of The . There’s the statue of Victoria erected in 1939 in Menton, France pushed into the sea when the Italians came during the second World War and later replaced. Further back, in November 1908, there was the “outrage” at the public gardens in the Indian city of Nagpur, where a statue of the queen was “mutilated the face daubed with tar and the nose and fingers broken.”In the years between Victoria’s visit to Ireland in 1900 and the unveiling of John Hughes’s statue in 1908, mentions of a public fund set up for its commission are plentiful. In the days before the unveiling, tickets for the ceremony were advertised - the price of admittance was one shilling, payable at the front hall of Leinster House. The aim, said one report, was to thin the anticipated crowd.The day she was unveiled - February 15th, 1908 - was, like the day she came down, punctuated by rain. “The ceremony was made the occasion of an imposing military display, but the lustre of the pageant was to some extent marred by a somewhat heavy shower which fell shortly before the formal part of the proceedings commenced,” reported The .Detachments of soldiers began to arrive from 2pm, for the unveiling at 3pm. “About 1,000 troops were on parade and as the various battalions, dressed in review order, with their bands, arrived on the scene they took up their allotted positions with bayonets fixed, forming a wide circle round the greensward, in the centre of which stood the memorial, with the beauty of its magnificently formed bronze figures as yet unrevealed.”‘A noble addition’The string would be pulled, the Lord Lieutenant’s speech made and the applause would ring out - as far as the report goes. The  hailed the statue as “a noble addition” to Dublin’s monuments, praising the sculptor John Hughes.As the years wore on, the lauded aesthetics of the piece would be repeatedly called into question. As Randolph Churchill wrote in an article published on the front page in November, 1945: “The largest and ugliest statue in Dublin is outside the Dáil, and is of Queen Victoria - denounced throughout Ireland in the last century as the famine queen.”The statue and the merit of keeping it in situ quickly became a topic of debate. In line with the struggle for Irish independence and rejection of imperialist Britain, the controversy crept into news coverage - particularly following the conclusion of the War of Independence and signing of the Anglo Irish Treaty in 1921. The arguments for and against removing the statue will be familiar.On the latter point, a letter writer in 1933 - when the statue was 25 years old - said: “At one time a new dynasty arose in Egypt, and, defacing all the monuments of an earlier age, earned the universal condemnation of all historians. It is to be hoped that we are more enlightened.” Another - a decade later - pondered whether it would be better to keep it in place, owing to its potential as a tourist attraction.In the latter part of 1943, the issue again hit the pages of The  when the Dublin Corporation passed a resolution requesting the government to remove the statue. The story was carried on the front page the next morning, on September 7th.Proposing the resolution, Councillor Micheál Ó Maoláin said it was odd that “the effigy of a lady whose name stank in the nostrils of past generations of Irishmen” should stand in front of Ireland’s Parliament House, while Lord Edward Fitzgerald had been forgotten. Every generation, he warned, would rise and revolt at the sight of it.On the same day, the leader in The  took a more moderate view compared to “the heat of Mr Ó Maoláin’s feelings”, yet gave the councillor credit on two counts. “Firstly the city would not be any poorer for a monument to Lord Edward, who was a patriot in a sense which is hardly understood nowadays. Secondly, if the Old Queen must be removed, Mr Ó Maoláin will have it done by law and not by dynamite.” The piece mentioned the explosion at Stephen’s Green in 1937 that brought a large statue of George II and his horse to the ground.NeglectThe article also suggested it would be better to remove the statue than allow it to endure further neglect. “If it is true that the statue has never been cleaned since the signing of the Treaty - and certainly its musty green hue gives credit to the story - the joke is rather a poor one and reflects more discredit upon the House of Windsor.”The same “green hue” would catch the eye of Myles na gCopaleen (Brian O’NolanFlann O’Brien) the following month - albeit, he had a much different take. Over all, the writer was not overly bothered with its removal - her statutes were more harmful than her statues, as he put it. “Besides, look at it this way,” he wrote on October 2nd. “Time has given the mere Irish their revenge. The fact is that Victoria has turned green. Of hue she approaches our decent Irish letterbox. And it is the price of her.”In the days after the resolution was passed, cold water was thrown over the project. A story on the front page on September 8th reported that Victoria would be removed, just not yet. Costs were blamed.On November 1st, members of Ailtirí na hAiséirghe - a minor fascist party described then as a Gaelic revival organisation - crashed a Dublin Corporation meeting and shouted from the public galleries: “Get rid of all the symbols of slavery in the streets.” The episode made the front page of the paper and was reported in the British press.It would take until July 22nd, 1948, before the statue came down. Reports about the monument soon died off, bar one or two concerning potential Canadian buyers - the cities of London and Peterborough sought to purchase the statue in 1949, by which point it had “lain on its back in a field in Kilmainham”. But that fell through.In the end, it would be sent to Australia. The  reported the move ahead of time in a report on October 2nd, 1986, headlined: “Statue of Victoria given to Sydney.” Not quite the ending predicted by The  in 1943, when it said the structure would be removed “possibly to some new and friendly site, more probably to the scrapheap”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4279056.1592172331!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"strong green influence on draft coalition deal agreed by parties","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSeveral Green TDs were enthusiastic about the deal, pointing to a range of policy wins for the party in the document. Photograph: The But the three party leaders remained locked in tense negotiations on Sunday night on the final details of the coalition deal, with differences remaining on tax cuts, the pension age and legislation banning the import of Israeli goods produced in the occupied Palestinian Territories.A potential solution to the pensions issue mentioned by sources would be a deferral in the increase in eligibility age to 67 pending a report from a special commission. Leaving Government Buildings late on Sunday night, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said talks would continue on Monday. It is believed Fine Gael was holding out for a commitment in the document to tax cuts in the future if resources allow. Earlier, the negotiating teams signed off on a draft programme for government after almost six weeks of protracted and often difficult negotiations, leaving the final issues for the party leaders to resolve. The document, which was widely leaked on Sunday night, is expected to be approved by the three parliamentary parties on Monday if the leaders can reach agreement, and will then be put to the members of the three parties for ratification.Internal debatesThere will be particular focus on the Green Party, in which there is expected to be significant opposition to the deal, and where a two-thirds majority is required if the party is to join the coalition. The position of deputy leader Catherine Martin, who was previously opposed to negotiations but led the Green Party team in the talks process, is expected to be pivotal in the party’s internal debates. But several Green TDs were enthusiastic about the deal, pointing to a range of policy wins for the party in the document.Crucially, the programme for government commits the next government to reducing Ireland’s emissions of greenhouse gases by an average of 7 per cent annually.The Greens’ priorities are also reflected in the increase in spending on transport infrastructure. All future capital spending on transport infrastructure will be split 2:1, favouring public transport over roads, and €360 million will be spent every year on cycling and walking infrastructure.There will be a ban on the further exploration for gas in the waters off Ireland and a ban on the importation of fracked gas, which will halt the construction of the Shannon LNG project and other facilities.The Direct Provision system will be abolished within the government’s term and replaced “with a new international protection accommodation policy centred on a not-for-profit approach”.A number of referendums are also promised within the lifetime of the next government, including one on the right to housing.There will be commissions on housing, tax and social welfare and on the future of the Defence Forces, and a permanent pay review body for the Defence Forces will also be established. Carbon tax will rise to €100 per tonne by 2030 rather than €80 per tonne as is planned now, with the resources being re-invested in increased social welfare payments and investment in climate change policies.A new economic stimulus plan for the retail and tourism sectors is expected in July, with a wider national recovery plan following in October.The Land Development Agency will develop cost rental housing, as well as affordable purchase homes, affordable rental homes and social housing on State-owned land.The document also commits that 50,000 social homes will be provided over the next five years, with an emphasis on new builds.If agreed by the leaders and approved by the respective parliamentary parties on Monday, the coalition deal will then be put to the memberships of the three parties for ratification, with postal ballots due to conclude by the end of next week. If the deal is approved by the three parties, a new government will be in place by the end of this month.

Video: RTE News Now\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA woman wearing a home-made protective face mask in Leipzig, Germany. When masks were made compulsory in the German city of Jena, ‘the number of new infections fell almost to zero’, noted the report. Photograph: Sean GallupGetty ImagesThree new studies from Germany, Britain and the United States have indicated face masks are highly effective in stopping the spread of coronavirus from person to person.The first study examined the city of Jena in Germany, which made it compulsory for residents to wear face masks in public places, such as on public transport and while shopping, on April 6th.Scarves and improvised cloth coverings were allowed where purpose-made masks were not available, and medical-grade masks were reserved for health workers.\u0026nbspAfter the introduction of the mandatory masks, “the number of new infections fell almost to zero”, noted the report, which was written by four academics working in Germany and Denmark and published by an independent research body, the Institute of Labor Economics (IZA).“We believe that the reduction in the growth rates of infections by 40 per cent to 60 per cent is our best estimate of the effects of face masks . . . We should also stress that 40 to 60 per cent might still be a lower bound,” they write.“The daily growth rates in the number of infections when face masks were introduced was around 2 to 3 per cent. These are very low growth rates compared to the early days of the epidemic in Germany, where daily growth rates also lay above 50 per cent. One might therefore conjecture that the effects might have been even greater if masks had been introduced earlier.”By the end of April, all of Germany’s federal states had made the wearing of face masks mandatory, following normal practice in several Asian countries that successfully contained the disease early on.Most effective measureA second study was conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and examined a coronavirus outbreak on the USS Theodore Roosevelt.It surveyed 382 people on the ship about what measures they had taken to protect themselves against the disease.\u0026nbspThe results indicated that wearing a face covering was the most effective measure against the virus, followed by distancing, and avoiding common areas. Of those who did not wear a face covering, 81 per cent became infected, while among those who did wear a face covering, 56 per cent became infected.Most studies stress that further research is needed to identify what kind of face covering is most effective, and note that a combination of hand-washing, distancing and other measures contribute to an overall reduction in spread alongside the wearing of face masks.The British study was conducted by scientists at Cambridge and Greenwich universities, and found that even home-made masks can dramatically reduce transmission rates if enough people wear them in public.According to the results, routine wearing of masks by more than 50 per cent of the public means that people who are infected with Covid-19 pass it on to only one person or less.\u0026nbspThis means that the number of infections will drop over time rather than rising exponentially, as happens when no preventative measures are taken.The researchers found that if people wear face masks whether they have symptoms or not, it is twice as effective at curbing the spread of the disease than if people wear face coverings only after they begin experiencing symptoms.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4278912.1592148617!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nil all at half time in tortuous brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA timetable for the second half of Brexit talks has been set out with six rounds of negotiations to take place between June 29th and August 21st. Photograph: EPAOlivier HosletLife seemed to pause in February, and this seems to have affected the perception of time. Incredibly, half of 2020 is gone: and that means just six months remain before goods sold into Britain will be subject to border checks, customs declarations, and possibly tariffs.These onerous changes will come into force no matter what deal is agreed between London and Brussels, and indeed if no deal is agreed at all. They are expected to have a heavy impact on companies in the Republic, and any businesses across the EU dependent on exports to Britain. Firms have been asked to prepare as a matter of urgency.The British government has said, definitively, that it will not extend the transition period. Instead, it proposes to introduce the border requirements in stages. Checks on live animals will come into force right away in January. Pre-notification and health certification for meat, dairy, and other animal products will come into force from April. Full checks and declarations will be in place from July. For the first half of the year, companies will have a grace period to make customs declarations for their goods and pay whatever tariffs are required.Since February, talks between Britain and the European Union have continued over video calls to try to hash out a deal that avoids the harshest outcome of an automatic shift to World Trade Organisation trade terms on January 1st. The state of the talks now could be described as nil-all at half time. Both teams have played defensively and sat deep on the pitch neither has conceded, no one has scored.The second half British prime minister Boris Johnson will join a video conference on Monday with the presidents of the three European institutions of the commission, council, and parliament: Ursula von der Leyen, Charles Michel, and David Sassoli. Earlier this year, Britain was warning that it could use this moment to dramatically walk away from talks and declare it would spend all its energy on preparing for World Trade Organisation terms. It has shifted away from this approach, instead pushing the EU to enter intensive talks next month.A timetable for the second half has been set out: six rounds of negotiations are to take place between June 29th and August 21st. Negotiators will alternate between physical meetings in Brussels and London as long as national health guidance allows it, but talks could shift online again.What the EU is seeking in the talks was decided by the 27 remaining members of the EU and given to chief negotiator Michel Barnier in a 46-page mandate in February.He has updated the member states and the European institutions throughout the talks, as any shift or concession by the EU side can only be given with consensus agreement.No change to the mandate is needed to get an agreement, he told the European Parliament last week. “We can find the necessary compromises, on the condition that the UK changes its approach,” the Frenchman said.Areas of disagreementThere are four stubborn areas of disagreement. One is the so-called level playing field: the EU’s ambition to ensure fair competition between British and EU countries. Brussels will not grant British companies free access to EU markets if they can undercut local businesses it will only do so if they are required to follow equivalent standards on, for example, labour and the environment. This is anathema to Britain, as it sounds like signing back up to the kind of regulatory restrictions it left the EU to escape.Too bad, Brussels responds: no free access for your businesses to the single market then.Another issue is fisheries. In a nutshell: Britain wants to take back exclusive rights over its territorial waters. These would give it far more fish than the British could eat. Want to sell fish to the EU? Fine, says Brussels, but only if EU fishing boats can have access to British waters. The EU side wants to stick to the existing quota system for this Britain wants to introduce yearly access talks.On policing and judicial cooperation, Britain does not want to continue to follow EU data protection standards, and shies away from an agreement with the EU on human rights, which it says has no place in a trade deal. The final issue is governance: ie, how disputes could be mediated. Britain does not want the ultimate authority to be the European Court of Justice the EU insists this is the only body that can rule on matters of EU law.British negotiators can sound somewhat indignant at the EU’s insistence on written and legal guarantees on matters such as standards and human rights, insisting that Britain has high standards, and should be trusted, rather than treated as a potential violator.No compromiseThe EU accuses Britain of continuing to not accept that negative consequences are inevitable from Brexit, and of demanding privileges that are only available to member states. The British negotiators accuse the EU of failing to accept its sovereignty, and of asking for things that go far beyond previous trade deals with countries like Japan or Canada. Brussels rejects this comparison,\u0026nbsp explaining that Japan and Canada are far away, so don’t have the ability to undercut the EU that Britain could have.Brussels believes it has the upper hand, because if Britain chooses not to compromise and to go for World Trade Organization terms, the same EU negotiating mandate will await them if they return for talks to ease the tariffs. There is some flexibility on details, but the principles will not shift. “The United Kingdom chose to become a third country. It cannot have the best of both worlds!” Barnier put it to parliament. “We want a very ambitious economic partnership, but it must reflect the long-term economic and political interests of the EU. This is not a dogmatic or technocratic position,” he added. “Simply: we will never compromise on our European values or on our economic and trade interests, to the benefit of the British economy.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

In November 1871 he found the sick explorer and greeted him with the words : Dr Livingstone, I presume?But Bishop Gregory Cameron, bishop of St Asaph, has written to the city council asking for the removal of the monument to Stanley from its place near the River Elwy and signed a petition calling for the removal of a statue from nearby Denbigh town centre.He said: Exactly what do we commemorate in the life of Henry Morton Stanley, born John Rowlands? He was an adventurer, who had little respect for the natives of Africa, and who shared in management of one of the most atrocious and exploitative colonial endeavours ever in that vast continent, the enslaving of an entire population to service the wealth creation of King Leopold II of the Belgians through the production of rubber.He repudiated his Welsh upbringing and paid scant regard to the communities of St Asaph and Denbigh which had nurtured him. So why exactly is there a statue of him in Denbigh\u0027s main square, and another monument at the bottom of St Asaph\u0027s High Street?Henry Morton Stanley was born in 1841 as John Rowlands in Denbigh. He was abandoned by his mother as a young baby and his father died a few weeks after his birth. He spent some time in the St Asaph Workhouse before emigrating to America and subsequently travelling to Africa.Dispatched by the New York Herald to find David Livingstone, a Scottish missionary who had gone missing in Africa, Stanley set off in 1871 on an eight-month, 7,000-mile trip accompanied by 200 porters. The goal was accomplished, but not without cost – deserters were flogged and a contemporary, Sir Richard Francis Burton, claimed: “Stanley shoots Africans as if they were monkeys.”On a second trip in 1874, Stanley, in partnership with The Daily , traced the course of the River Congo to the sea. In 1876 he made a deal with King Leopold II to travel back to the Congo, and as a result became associated with the Belgium king’s brutal regime, a link he spent years defending.In 2011, Bishop Gregory expressed dismay that St Asaph city council had elected to commemorate a man well known for his imperialist career, his brutality towards the indigenous African population, and for his collaboration with King Leopold in the subjugation, exploitation and maltreatment of the Congolese people.In a new letter to the city council, the bishop said : Current affairs amply demonstrate the anger and distress caused by the celebration of racist and colonialist pioneers, I would like to suggest to you that the time has come to remove the offence of this monument.I would like to feel that St Asaph city council would be willing to identify with the Black Lives Matter campaign by making the highly symbolic gesture of putting this monument out of sight, and taking a stand for equality and ersity.St Asaph Cathedral contains a small plaque to Stanley and discussions are taking place as to whether it should be removed or a further panel added to provide interpretation. The Dean of St Asaph Cathedral, the Very Revd Nigel Williams said: The plaque is not prominent and does not draw attention to itself. It does not honour Stanley as a statue. Additional information alongside could provide the opportunity for visitors to properly consider the issues but it\u0027s right that we think carefully about its place here in the cathedral.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 turning us nation irrational panic merchants","story":"When the lockdown was announced back in March, it prompted a slew of slightly supercilious articles about risk-aversion. If we were going to shut down the entire economy because of coronavirus, wrote contrarian columnists, perhaps we should shut it down every winter because of seasonal flu. Perhaps we should cut the speed limit to 20 miles per hour to make our roads safe. Perhaps we should ban fatty foods to reduce heart attacks.Reader, I was one of those contrarian columnists. And when I look back at what I wrote, I wince. Not, let me stress, because the coronavirus has been worse than expected. If anything, the health impact has been lighter than was feared and the economic impact heavier. Twelve weeks on, our Nightingale hospitals stand empty and unused and so do our shops.No, the reason I now feel uneasy is that I can imagine some of those sarcastic suggestions being taken up in earnest. We seem, as a country, to have lost any notion of qualified risks, opportunity costs, least bad options. We demand that our leaders deliver something unattainable, namely total security.Consider, for example, our resistance to letting children return to the classroom. Schools are now functioning in at least 21 other European countries. In several of them, including Austria, Germany and Denmark, they had reopened by mid-April. In Iceland, Sweden and Estonia, they never closed at all. Not one of those countries has seen any resurgence of infections, and for the most obvious of reasons: children, as far as anyone can tell, are extremely unlikely either to suffer symptoms or to pass them on.The problem, of course, lies with the words “extremely unlikely”. We can’t definitively prove that there is no risk, because no one can prove a negative. We can point to surveys from Australia, the Netherands, Iceland and Switzerland that all suggest the same thing, namely that children are unaffected by the disease and seem unable to infect others. But no scientist is ever going to offer a 100 per cent guarantee that Covid-19 cannot hurt young people.And so, inevitably, our parental instinct kicks in. We don’t like the sound of “extremely unlikely”. Why not wait until we can be certain?The answer, of course, is that we can never be certain. Nothing in this imperfect world is wholly without risk: not driving nor having a bath nor drinking coffee. When we drop our children off at school, there is a minuscule chance that they will choke while gobbling crisps or break their necks while playing tag. We know this, but we also know that keeping them at home would inflict serious and quantifiable harm while making them barely any safer – if any safer at all.When it comes to Covid-19, though, such calculations go out of the window. We revert, as people do during epidemics, to our basic hunter-gatherer algorithms: hunker down, avoid strangers, keep an eye on your young. It may be, as this newspaper recently reported, that children are more likely to be struck by lightning than to die of Covid-19. It is certainly true that they are more at risk from traffic accidents, childhood cancers, suicide or even seasonal flu. But I worry that, in pointing this out, I won’t so much reassure people about coronavirus as terrify them about those other things.Our brains struggle with big numbers. So far in England and Wales, three children under the age of 15 have died with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 symptoms. That’s three out of 10.7 million. To a first approximation, then, there is no risk. But we can picture three children much more easily than we can picture 10.7 million and, being human, we dwell on the prospect of one of our kids becoming the fourth. Yes, it is irrational but it is probably also inevitable.An illness, unlike a recession, is not an abstract concept. We can imagine falling sick, or losing an elderly relative, much more easily than we can imagine mass unemployment or a drop in spending power. So, naturally enough, we demand that the government do “whatever it takes” to contain the disease, not stopping to ponder the implication of those three words.Because we are reacting viscerally rather than cerebrally, our attitude is largely impervious to data. The closures have wiped out 15 years of economic growth? Too bad. We are worse hit than any other major economy? Meh. The countries that ended their prohibitions two months ago have seen their infections plummet? That’s nice for them. Sweden, which imposed no lockdown, has seen the disease follow the same trajectory as here? You can’t compare us to Sweden. (I especially enjoy this last assertion, often made by people who have spent their lives comparing us to Sweden.)If the recent gatherings of hundreds of thousands of demonstrators cause no noticeable uptick in cases next week, don’t expect people to draw the obvious conclusion and demand the end of all restrictions. We are, I fear, past reason.Indeed, to the bafflement of foreign observers, we are losing all the traits that used to mark us out as a people. To be British meant being bloody-minded, calm in a crisis, distrustful of authority, uncomplaining in adversity, attached to freedom.Yet here we are not just accepting but demanding a longer lockdown than almost every other country. Having given the world the principle of habeas corpus, we have willingly acquiesced in collective house arrest. Having trusted our common-law model, assuming residual freedoms and legislating sparingly, we now applaud government regulations telling us what constitutes a necessary journey and how to define a single person.Can you be confident that, when this disease fades, we will recover our old character? Might we not clamour for similar measures every time there is an unusually severe flu? Are we not likely to see more bans of every kind, starting with foods deemed unhealthy? Could we, in short, be turning into an altogether more authoritarian people?

There is concern that there should only be one public message about the science. But there isn’t such a thing as ‘the science’. There are lots of different sciences.”The Government has denied it was an official edict. A spokesperson said: “There is no ban on scientists who provide advice to the government speaking to anyone about their own areas of expertise and academic work.“We are committed to thorough and transparent debate of all the evidence presented to SAGE and its sub-committees.”The Official’s apparent attempt to curb what scientists say in public comes as the Government faces mounting pressure to revise the two metre rule, amid concerns that businesses and schools will not be able to fully reopen whilst it is in place.The Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on May 27th that he had asked SAGE to look again at the guidance, but Downing Street said later that it believed the rule should stay in place and that it would remain under review. It is expected to be scrapped in time for the new school year to start in September.However, there is growing dissent amongst experts on SAGE sub-committees over whether the research which led to the guidance in the first place is good enough.A mathematical modelling paper produced by Sage in April, and based on past experiments carried out in other countries, concluded that the risk of exposure to the coronavirus “could be 10-30 times higher at one metre compared to two metres.Several members have raised objections to the two-metre rule, amid concerns that modelling done by SAGE was based on inadequate data.Last week, an analysis published in the Lancet found the risk of catching the coronavirus whilst standing one metre apart was only around twice that of standing two metres apart - a 2.6 per cent chance compared to 1.3 per cent.But the new SAGE research, prepared by its environmental and modelling group and published last week, says that this does not consider the positioning of the person – meaning the way they are facing – or how the virus is likely to be transmitted. The group said that sitting within one metre of a person side by side or back to back is as safe as facing a person at two metres when indoors. Sir Patrick Vallance, the Government’s chief scientific adviser, has previously made it clear that it was up to politicians, not scientists, to make a decision on relaxing the 2 metre rule.“It’s not a scientific rule, it is a risk-based assessment.”The apparent move to muzzle advisers is likely to reignite anger over the Government’s lack of transparency around SAGE at the start of the coronavirus crisis, including its initial refusal to say who sits on the committee.It also follows claims that England’s chief nurse, Ruth May, was dropped from one of Downing Street’s daily briefings after she refused to publicly back the Prime Minister’s most senior aide, Dominic Cummings, in the row over his trip to Durham during lockdown. Number 10 has disputed the claim.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"macron claims first victory against coronavirus france","story":"French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday gave Paris restaurants and cafés the green light to reopen fully and serve customers indoors, saying France has won “a first victory against the coronavirus.”In his first televised address to the nation in two months, the centrist president delivered a message that the worst was over and it was time to get back to work. “If we can reopen the country it is because everyone has played their part,” Mr Macron said. “The prime minister and the government worked tirelessly. People stayed home and and showed a great sense of responsibility.”Mr Macron also sought to reassure an anxious public that his administration can steer France out of economic crisis without raising the country’s already high income tax rates.France has spent some £44 billion on bailing out companies and a job retention scheme under which the state has paid about 80 per cent of the wages of furloughed workers.Paris was the last part of mainland France still classified as a higher risk “orange zone”, but has now joined the rest of the country in being considered a “green zone” where the spread of the coronavirus is under control.Mr Macron said all children can return to primary schools, nurseries and day-care centres from June 22, ending formal social distancing but avoiding close contact where possible. Limitations will remain on the number of pupils in the upper three years of secondary school.Many schools had already reopened, but had to halve class sizes because of France’s one-metre social distancing rule. Its relaxation will come as a relief for exhausted parents. Many have been working from home while struggling with child care since France began a strict lockdown on March 17 that lasted two-and-half months before the country began lifting restrictions.Restaurants and cafés were allowed to reopen from June 2,  but the government had been under pressure to lift an additional restriction on Paris, where they could only serve customers outdoors. Elsewhere in mainland France, they are operating as normal, except that tables must be kept one-metre apart and staff must wear face-masks.France has reported 29,398 coronavirus deaths in hospitals and care homes since the pandemic began, with a daily toll of 24 announced on Saturday.Mr Macron’s relative success in combatting Covid-19 has not improved his popularity. His approval ratings rose at the start of the crisis, but have now fallen back below 40 per cent, according to opinion polls.He is under fire from the Left for his business-friendly economic reforms, while the Right says he has failed to back the police over accusations of brutality and racism, and has allowed law and order to degenerate.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"open air services should held summer says cardinal nichols","story":"Open-air church services should be held this summer, England\u0027s most senior Catholic has suggested in an interview with the Daily , as churches reopen for the first time today since lockdown began.Cardinal Vincent Nichols said that he would celebrate the reopening of churches for private prayer only by visiting Westminster Cathedral and Westminster Abbey with “others, a few friends” – understood to be the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. The two churches are just a few minutes walk away from each other in Westminster.Clergy across the country have been sent guidelines about making their churches safe for socially distant prayer. According to the cardinal – the leader of England and Wales’ Roman Catholics – the opening for private prayer is vital for Catholics and other Christians and their mental well-being.“People have been put into a world where their horizons have been shortened. Inner pressures have built up. Some people are focusing on the past and their failings and they need to step into a church where horizons will widen out again”, he said.“This is a first step, a first toe in the water, so we are all a bit tentative and a bit anxious”.The decision by the Government to allow churches reopen for inidual prayer came after the cardinal had forcefully spoken out about churches staying shut while shops could re-open. His remark that churches were “at the back of the queue” hit home with the Government’s faith task force and last week Lord Greenhalgh, the faith minister and co-chair of the faith task force, paid tribute to the cardinal’s lobbying which had changed the task force’s mind.It then agreed to the limited opening today (Monday). But with church services still not allowed until July 4, with Cardinal Nichols saying they will be minimalist with no singing, he is now looking at open-air services as well.“They would also have restrictions on the number of people who should gather,” he said, “but outdoor celebrations should be explored in the summer months”.Among those keenest to organize open-air Masses is Bishop Mark O’Toole of the Diocese of Plymouth which has many rural churches.“There are problems even if you have social distancing in small churches”, said Bishop O’Toole.“We are looking at places where we could use a large space, have parking, plenty of social distancing, and accessibility”.Some options might be schools’ playgrounds, he said, but he is also considering in Devon Buckfast Abbey and a retreat centre in the Teignmouth Valley, and an amphitheatre in Cornwall. “It is an awful thing to have to consider about Mass but if we go down this route, we might have to have ticketing so that we can control numbers for health reasons”, he said.Cardinal Nichols, who is also Archbishop of Westminster, expects livestreaming of church services to continue for many months to come with churches unable to accommodate the usual congregations because of social distance rules.“We have many things to learn about what we can offer. Clergy have taken to the internet for all kinds of things such as scripture study as well as Mass and we should not lose that”.But he warned that there would also be difficulties ahead because many churches have been hard hit financially during lockdown and dioceses would also have to reconsider their spending, although education and safeguarding must be protected.He also predicted that churches will have to play a major role helping people who have been left in financial dire straits by the impact of lockdown on the economy.Last week the Catholic Church in England and Wales distributed £1 million it was given by the Albert Gubay Charitable Foundation to help alleviate poverty caused by Covid-19. Much of the money is being spent via food banks and food vouchers.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"slashing vat delivering better broadband fix economy","story":"The next few months will demonstrate whether Downing Street is on top of the macro-economic agenda. If they’re not, then the country is in for a rough ride. What is needed now is a pro-growth economic policy, with a focus on jobs, living wages, increased investment and incentives for the private sector.The first steps are clear-cut. Continue with the unlocking, keeping the virus at bay while allowing the economy to escape recession.Policy own-goals can change. Relax social distancing from two metres to one. End the 14-day quarantine too.Until we have a vaccine however, some sectors – from restaurants to jobs across the creative sector – will not return to full health. Many firms will need financial support until a vaccine is available and social distancing ends.While unlocking may unleash some pent-up demand, many people will be reluctant to shop, have little to spend or will want to add to their savings as they face an uncertain future. So VAT should be cut to help boost demand and stamp duty reduced to help kick-start the housing market.The global trends in place before the crisis will continue, and the post-pandemic economic vision needs to recognise that. This includes the digital and data revolution, driven by new technology and artificial intelligence. The geography of global growth will also continue to move to the Indo Pacific and a G2 world, dominated by the US and China. This means that Britain needs to focus on innovation and investment, and to think globally.However, the soft underbelly of our imbalanced economy has been exposed by this crisis. Many are in low-paid work, in firms where investment has been weak. We have not shared success from our high-productive areas.Thus, the coronavirus crisis should strengthen, rather than derail, the government’s pre-crisis agenda of levelling up, delivering Brexit and aiming for a net-zero carbon economy.Levelling up is not just about rewarding those northern constituencies that voted Conservative through more infrastructure spending.Infrastructure, while needed, will not provide quick wins. There are few shovel-ready projects for a start. Devolving power to urban and local authorities as well as easing planning restrictions may speed things up, but levelling up should be more widespread and creative, allowing firms to flourish through low-tax zones and addressing other issues, from housing to skills.While the crisis has weakened the British economy, the same is true on the Continent. There is no case to delay Brexit – doing so would only heighten uncertainty. Being in a transition leaves the UK vulnerable to new EU legislation over which we have no voice, vote or veto. Also, we would be liable to pay more. As the clock ticks down, political pressure for a deal will grow.As important as this pre-crisis agenda is, recent months highlight the need for vision and a pro-growth ambition that serves all of society.Such a policy needs to be based on three arrows. The PM needs to aim for a bullseye on each.One is credible fiscal activism. There is no magic money tree. Instead, low inflation, interest rates and yields allow the government to borrow, and to then reduce debt to GDP gradually over time. This would avoid both tax increases and austerity.Second is monetary and financial stability, including a new remit for the Bank of England based on money GDP. This would help guard against inflation in an upturn and weaker demand in a downturn. Also, while the City needs to be globally competitive it must help finance British companies better. Last year, the funding gap faced by the UK’s small and medium sized firms was a hefty £22 billion.The third economic arrow is a supply-side agenda aimed at incentivising the private sector and helping it grow. The focus should be on lowering inequality, getting incentives right and boosting innovation, investment and infrastructure.This crisis could herald a sea-change in how welive, work and travel. This merits delivering widespread broadband at a faster pace. It warrants a rethink of transport plans after all the rail system has effectively been nationalised. Also, during the lockdown, almost unnoticed, Gatwick was given permission to turn its unused emergency runway into a second runway. Why?A credible economic vision has yet to be outlined by this government.

This could be due to the delay between people experiencing symptoms and people being tested for Covid-19.Google has previously attempted to predict such trends through its nowcast function, which launched in 2008. A paper published in the scientific journal Nature at the time explained how people\u0027s search patterns could estimate flu prevalence two weeks before it was registered by official bodies like the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).As the world\u0027s most popular online search engine, the data from people\u0027s digital footprints offered potentially life-saving insights and it was the poster child of so-called \u0027Big Data\u0027. But by 2015 it was shut down after it failed to foresee a massive flu outbreak in 2013.UK now has more daily Covid-19 deaths than the rest of Europe combinedIt was described by some publications as an epic failure and a note on its landing page now states: Google Flu Trends and Google Dengue Trends are no longer publishing current estimates of Flu and Dengue fever based on search patterns...  It is still early days for nowcasting and similar tools for understanding the spread of diseases like flu and dengue – we\u0027re excited to see what comes next.A blog post explaining the decision said that Google would work directly with academic institutions to make sense of the search data. More than 265 peer-reviewed papers have since drawn on aggregated data taken from Google searches, used to track epidemics like Ebola in 2014, Zika in 2016 and West Nile fever over several years in Italy.

Twitter, like Facebook and other major social media sites, is currently banned in China.“We should expect continued evolution and improvement, given the enormous resourcing the Chinese party‑state can bring to bear in aligning state messaging across its diplomacy, state media and covert influence operations.” the ASPI wrote.The research pointed out a number of tactics from the Chinese government to attempt to shape the information environment to its advantage,” including:The coordination of diplomatic and state media messagingThe use of Western social media platforms to seed disinformation into international media coverageThe immediate mirroring and rebuttal of Western media coverage by Chinese state mediaThe co‑option of fringe conspiracy media to target networks vulnerable to manipulationThe use of coordinated inauthentic networks and undeclared political ads to actively manipulate social media audiencesAdditional reporting by ReutersBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

I’ve been a delivery driver for Tesco for the last 16 years. Though I also worked for Tesco for four years before that. I knew that I’d have to continue till 63 but was never informed about the rise to 66.”Carolyn’s life was initially turned upside down by the controversial state pension age rise from 60 to 66 for women born after March 1950, which affected nearly 4 million women. The move was accelerated in 2010 and saw them reach parity with men, at 65, in 2018.Many of these women have been forced to carry on working through the Covid-19 emergency despite being at risk of severe complications from the virus due to their age.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesCarolyn said working at Tesco throughout the lockdown has been immensely stressful due to other staff members refusing to respect her need to socially distance and even poking fun at her for wanting to do so.“There is no possibility of social distancing in our back room and I’m mocked by male, macho, much younger drivers for even trying to social distance,” the 64-year-old adds. “I’m so stressed with the whole situation and so upset by a government who’s throwing money here, there and everywhere but doing nothing to protect me. I’ve lived on my own since my orce 14 years ago, and all I want is to kiss and cuddle my kids, three granddaughters and my 94-year-old dad again.”Campaigners argue changes to the state pension age unlawfully discriminate against women born in the 1950s. The United Nations has previously said women hit by the state pension age change are at increased risk of “poverty, homelessness and financial hardship” as a result.Pensioner backs do not resuscitate legal action after ‘brutal’ GP callBackTo60, a campaign group calling for full restitution for women affected by the changes, lost its landmark High Court battle after taking the government to court over the state pension rise, but will be appealing the ruling in July.Joanne Welch, the group’s founder, told The Independent they were confident about the appeal.“When they were robbed of the state pension with virtually no notice from the government, some of the women’s lives were annihilated and that is no exaggeration,” she adds. “But when the pandemic hit, 1950s women were forced out on to the frontline. Many work in retail, hospitality, cleaning and care homes. We know women are facing homelessness and destitution. They have no choice not to work because they are not entitled to sufficient benefits. There are some workplaces where risk assessment not in place.“Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organisation, said people over 60 were at higher risk of developing severe coronavirus. There is a higher death rate for us. But the government is saying over 70s need to shield, not over 60s.“1950s women feel abandoned. They tell us they were robbed and now they are abandoned amid a pandemic. I would have never got involved in this if I didn’t believe it was an injustice. I’ve never done anything like this in my life.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I have always worked – going back to work after having each of my three children. Over the last two years I have struggled with ill health which has impacted on my job as a community nurse.Coronavirus and food banks: The stories behind the statistics“Due to this I had to reduce the hours that I work, but I am still struggling as I need a new hip, and I am in constant pain with this and back pain. I am also struggling with my memory and cannot retain a lot of the information required to do my job safely, which has caused me to suffer with depression. I have been off sick for the last eight weeks. The thought of going back to work makes me feel physically sick as I am terrified that I will make a mistake. I cannot afford to stop working as my husband only revives a state pension. I feel trapped.” A major report by King’s College London which came out last month found the rise in the state pension age has triggered a 30 per cent rise in the likelihood of experiencing depressive symptoms for women doing physically and psychosocially onerous jobs.Researchers said these roles were defined by the mixture of high demands and low levels of control – explaining around a third of women work in these sorts of positions, which involve toiling away in restaurants, sales, personal care, housekeeping, machine operation and cleaning.Debbie de Spon, of Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi), said women have been penalised by the government due to the “maladministration” of state pension age changes.She added: “Coupled with inequalities in life expectancy across the country and a substantial pensions gap, Waspi women continue to suffer huge financial losses. Currently many have fallen through the gap of Covid-19 support arrangements, and fear for their future.”Jane, another woman hit by the pension change, said the public health crisis had also wreaked havoc on her working life.“I was 65 last weekend,” she says. “The day before I got told I possibly have heart failure. I am still working and feel like I can’t work any longer. I work for £400 a month less than I was in 2010 due to government pay cuts. I feel so angry and stressed that I might not live to see my pension that I have worked since I was 15 for. Even having four children I worked with only six weeks off when they were born. I feel totally robbed. I am trying to pay for my funeral. It’s a pity when I got so close to it, to lose it. Hopefully, there will be something they can do to keep me going long enough to enjoy my retirement in September. But there’s a possibility I will not. Furthermore, I couldn’t afford to keep my house in 2010 so that had to go. I’ve been part-time for six months. My money has run out.”*Names have been changed to protect identities Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Families that lost their homes in the Grenfell Tower blaze are still waiting for permanent housing three years after the tragedy.More than 200 homes were lost in the blaze on 14 June 2017 that killed 72 in the West London tower and the walk beneath it.In the aftermath, hundreds of people who were left homeless due to the inferno, including many children, were placed in bed and breakfast hotels and temporary flats while they waited for permanent housing.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNow figures from Kensington and Chelsea Council show that there are still seven households living in temporary accommodation. There are also said to be around 10 households who used to live in the tower who have since requested to be moved again as they were placed into permanent that was unsuitable.Around half of these requests have been successful, with the others either unsuccessful or still pending, according to the North Kensington Law Centres (NKLC).Set date for removing cladding, Grenfell campaigners tell governmentGovernment backs away from June oath to remove Grenfell-style claddingGrenfell inquiry witnesses ‘must be given immunity from prosecution’Spike Western, housing paralegal at North Kensington Law Centre, told The Independent the delays stemmed from a failure by successive governments to provide adequate social housing.“The households who have still to be rehoused permanently following Grenfell are the most vulnerable survivors. They represent either those with particular housing needs, such as those arising from a disability, or those on whom moving permanently is something that cannot be rushed and must only be done when the survivor is ready,” he said.“The damage has been done, and that is severe lack of investment in social and affordable housing over a long period, meaning there aren’t a whole lot of suitable options.Mr Western added: “We must remember that those affected by Grenfell are still awaiting justice, which has only been further delayed by the postponement of the inquiry due to Covid-19.”A spokesperson for Kensington and Chelsea Council said five of the seven households still waiting to be permanently re-housed had accepted a permanent home but not yet moved in, and that the council was continuing to support the remaining two households to find a home to settle in.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All the famous faces, including a picture of Sir Peter, are “fans” of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group.Each fragment will be signed by the artist and auctioned on Bidsquare, with bids starting at £325. The auction will be live until midnight on 26 June.The idea originated when London Advertising approached Sir Peter about the project as it wanted to use the mural to raise money for organisations helping people during the pandemic.Sir Peter, who also designed artwork for Paul Weller, Ian Dury and The Who, said: “I’m very happy that the Mandarin Oriental mural can be used a second time to raise money for such a wonderful purpose.

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Everyone is very grateful,’ says a volunteer who also uses service when his own illness means he is unable to pitch inFormer music manager John McIntyre was unsure how he would cope when lockdown began.“I was very scared,” said the 75-year-old who has a respiratory condition and lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Dalston. “If I caught Covid, I wouldn’t be able to get enough oxygen to the heart. I just had to follow the advice and be safe.” Mr McIntyre, who used to manage the jazz reggae band The Beatroots, has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema.He has relied for his daily meal from local charity Made In Hackney which is supplied by our Help the Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project. Mr McIntyre is one of more than two million people who are classified as “extremely vulnerable” because they have compromised immune systems. For the last 10 weeks, many of them have struggled to get access to food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince March, volunteers from the River House Trust charity have been dropping off Felix produce to people living with HIV. One such volunteer is former actor Stephen Hart who was diagnosed in 2006. When he is too ill to leave the house, he also uses the food delivery service.Despite being high-risk and a life-long diabetic, Mr Hart has been helping to get food to those more vulnerable than him. He has been unable to work since his health deteriorated two years ago, but Mr Hart, who lives alone in south London, said he wanted to help others.How to support our campaign“When I feel well enough, I pick up boxes from River House and drop them off for people who need them,” he said. “I do it when I can but some days are bad days.”Mr Hart said his condition means sometimes he can’t get out of bed. He occasionally receives a Felix box for himself so he knows he has food when he is too sick to move. “It is reassuring to have food in the house,” he said. “Felix has been a lifeline.”Although the British HIV Association said there “remains no evidence” that people with HIV are at greater risk of Covid-19 infection, those with a low CD4 count – the white blood cells affected by HIV – have been advised to shield.Mr Hart said members of the HIV community have been “nervous” since the outbreak. “There isn’t much specific advice so the community has been trying to look after each other.”A 62-year-old living with HIV for 37 years, who asked not to be named, described how his parcels have helped him. He said: “I pick up the boxes as I don’t have energy to go shopping. They’ve been great.”Mr Hart said it was extremely moving to see the response to his deliveries: “It is amazing.

This follows the business secretary Alok Sharma’s announcement earlier this week that all non-essential shops could return to business from 15 June, three months after they were closed to stem the spread of the virus. The measures are part of the second phase of the government’s plan to ease lockdown restrictions, the roadmap for which was first announced on 10 May. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHere is a summary of what will change from Monday.What type of shops are reopening? All non-essential shops such as high street retailers and department stores can open their doors from Monday. Book shops, electronic retailers, clothes shops, photography studios and auction houses are among the businesses that will be allowed to reopen as long as they follow the government’s Covid-19 guidelines.

The government has issued 14 strict measures that all shops and branches must adhere to before they reopen.One of the measures is for retailers to define the number of customers that can reasonably follow social distancing within their stories. Zoos in England can reopen next week as Boris Johnson eases lockdownOthers include limiting the number of customers in a particular shop, encouraging customers to use hand sanitiser as they enter and implementing queue management and one-way systems.

Mr Johnson has told the public to “shop with confidence” once stores reopen on Monday.What are the UK lockdown rules now?However, people may be worried about the safety of going shopping, especially as there have been growing concerns in recent weeks about a possible second wave of the virus.The prime has stressed that the most important thing is “public safety and the health of our country” and has urged the public “to observe the rules on social and do it safely” while shopping.Referring to the sacrifice everyone has made since the start of lockdown, Mr Johnson said “we can’t throw it away”.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Wearing face coverings is to be compulsory on public transport in England from 15 June, with fines for those who refuse, transport secretary Grant Shapps has announced.Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Mr Shapps said the move was designed to prevent an upsurge in coronavirus infections as the country moves to the next stage of lockdown relaxation, with non-essential shops allowed to reopen.Mr Shapps said wearing a face covering would be made a “condition of travel” on public transport, allowing passengers to be refused carriage if they do not comply, with the British Transport Police called in to deal with those resisting the rule where necessary. Face coverings are not currently included in the Health Protection Regulations which give the police legal power to take action over lockdown breaches. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Shapps said: “As of Monday 15 June face coverings will become mandatory on public transport.“That doesn’t mean surgical masks, which we must keep for clinical settings. It means the kind of face covering you can easily make at home. There will be exemptions to these rules for very young children, for disabled people and those with breathing difficulties.”He added: “We need to ensure every precaution is taken on buses, trains, aircraft, and on ferries.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“With more people using transport, the evidence suggests wearing face coverings offers some – albeit limited – protection against the spread for the virus.”Frontline staff such as bus drivers will also be required to wear face coverings, and Mr Shapps said the government will work with devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to try to make the change nationwide.The announcement was welcomed by London mayor Sadiq Khan, who has long lobbied for mandatory face coverings on the capital’s Underground system.“I’m pleased that our lobbying has paid off and the government has finally seen sense and made it mandatory for people to wear face coverings on public transport,” said Mr Khan.Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers’ union Aslef, agreed: “This is a sensible step. We have been working closely with the government to ensure that agreed increases in services on Britain’s train and Tube network is done in a safe and controlled manner, to help spread the loading, and maintain social distancing for the safety of passengers and staff.“The instruction to wear face coverings to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus will ease the concerns of people travelling, and working, on the transport network.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailHowever, scientists are ided over the value of homemade face coverings.Dr Antonio Lazzarino, of the department of epidemiology and public health at University College London, warned that their use might encourage people to wash hands less and to make more use of buses and trains, where face coverings will offer no protection against them being infected by touching handrails contaminated with the virus.“It is now commonly accepted that face coverings provide very little protection, if any. But one clear, logical, widely accepted side effect is that face coverings may give an excuse to easing other more important measures,” said Dr Lazzarino.“Will more people use the Tube or buses because they will feel more secure given that everybody wears a face covering? This will increase the risk of transmission.“Will people be able not to contaminate their hands and the handrails by not touching their face coverings and not touching the handrails while standing inside buses and trains? This seems to be impossible to me. Face coverings can therefore be a vehicle of infection, rather than a barrier.”But health care professor Prof Trish Greenhalgh of the University of Oxford said: “Face coverings aren’t 100 per cent effective, but they’re not zero per cent effective either.“I’ve seen evidence that a double layer of cloth is between 60 and 90 per cent effective in stopping the spread of viral-laden droplets coming from the wearer, and also that the same mask is also 30-50 per cent effective at stopping virus particles getting to the wearer. You can argue about the exact percentages, but overall, if everyone wears a face covering when they’re at close quarters, transmission is going to go down dramatically.”Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said: “This policy will add more burden on the general public to prevent the spread of Covid-19. This is much more complicated than ‘wash your hands for 20 seconds’ or ‘stay at home’. We are asking the whole population of Britain, with no prior experience of mask-wearing, to overnight become competent makers, wearers, and maintainers of PPE.“I have seen no new evidence to suggest why the government is reversing its previous policy, and ignoring its previous scientific guidance and the guidance of the WHO. I’m left wondering if this is a political decision, rather than one based on science.”Labour’s shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: “This is just another example of the government being slow to act. Two months ago, Labour immediately backed the Mayor of London’s call for face coverings on public transport to be compulsory. Yet only now Tory ministers are acting.“Two months after first raising this with government we are still yet to hear whether drivers will be issued with gloves, masks, and other PPE items as standard, what specification this PPE should be and, if there isn’t sufficient PPE, whether buses should still run.“We can’t go on like this. We need a comprehensive transport plan to get our public transport moving, to protect staff and to protect passengers.”Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy said he expected most passengers to comply with the requirement to wear face coverings.“I am not expecting a huge upsurge in railway staff having to police this,” he told the No 10 briefing. “I am expecting sensible passengers to do their duty and look after themselves and others.”Mr Shapps said that if people refused to comply they could be fined under new provisions in the national rail conditions of travel and the public service vehicle regulations for buses.“It is a condition of travel. You cannot travel unless you are wearing a face covering,” he said. “There will also be other powers so it could ultimately lead to fines. I very much hope we won’t be in that situation.”He said he did not expect enforcement action to be required on a regular basis, saying: “I expect the vast majority of people won’t need to be forced into this, because wearing a face covering helps protect others and most people simply want to help defeat this disease.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The US also continues to have more confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths – which have passed 112,000 – than any other nation.The National Center for Disaster Preparedness (NCDP), issued a warning this week that the US case count was “multiples more” than the confirmed two million.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?US authorities have otherwise claimed that high testing levels were contributing to the confirmed case count, in comparison to other states and international data.Whilst new coronavirus cases have declined in some parts of the US, including New York, there are now 20 states with rising infection rates as states ease some restrictions.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis week health authorities omitted pangolin scales from China’s latest Pharmacopoeia, an approved list of traditional drugs and remedies due to “wild resources exhaustion”, according to a report in the Health Times.WildAid CEO Peter Knights said the move was “the greatest single action that could have been taken to save pangolins from extinction.”“The increased protection coupled with the swift and comprehensive closure of live wildlife markets and removal of many wild species from the list of what can be consumed as food in China were already very positive steps to saving the pangolin worldwide and reducing the possibility of them ever being a vector for disease.“And now this announcement, effectively the closure of legal sales of pangolin scales, shutting the last major loophole in pangolin protection efforts,” he added.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) welcomed China’s decision, but urged action to stop the sale of pangolins on the black market. “PETA gives a nod to China for taking an important step to combat the demand for pangolin scales,” director Elisa Allen told The Independent.“However, as long as it remains desirable and profitable for endangered animals’ body parts to be sold for medicine, wildlife will continue to be killed on the black market.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some scientists believe they may incubate the Covid-19 virus that is thought to have emerged in Wuhan last year and has since swept the globe.Scientists find virus similar to Covid-19 in pangolinsFollowing the outbreak of coronavirus at the end of last year, China banned the consumption of all wild animals in a bid to prevent further outbreaks but many wet markets have since reopened.Earlier this year, The Independent renewed its call for the banning of trade in wild animals to help protect endangered species and avoid future pandemics.“These actions of China will have a real impact, these are steps that were critical, that needed to be taken if real conservation was going to happen for these animals,” said David Olson, director of Conservation at WWF Hong Kong.“Most of the demand for pangolin is coming from traditional Chinese medicine and consumption. That’s what is driving this large scale illegal trade.”With additional reporting by Louise Boyle Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The “misunderstanding” occurred when Polish soldiers accidentally crossed into the Czech Republic while guarding parts of the border amid lockdowns imposed due to the coronavirus pandemic.The soldiers then began turning away Czech citizens from a church they were trying to visit in their own country, CNN reported. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Czech foreign ministry said Poland has not formally explained the error but had “unofficially assured us that this incident was merely a misunderstanding caused by the Polish military with no hostile intention”.“The Polish soldiers are no longer present and our citizens can again visit the site freely,” CNN was told by a spokesperson, who did not reveal how long the occupation lasted. Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Poland’s ministry of defence said in a statement: “The placement of the border post was a result of misunderstanding, not a deliberate act. It was corrected immediately and the case was resolved – also by the Czech side.”The accidental invasion was launched from a small border village in southern Poland called Pielgrzymow, which sits opposite Czech countryside. A road there serves as a boundary between the two countries. On Saturday, Poland reopened its borders with the Czech Republic, Germany and Slovakia for the first time in three months after initially closing them in mid-March in an attempt to slow down the spread of Covid-19. Tight controls on entry remain at its borders with Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.In the Czech Republic, the government has implemented a colour-coded system for entry based on the severity of coronavirus outbreaks in relevant countries. Sweden is currently the only European Union state on the list of riskiest “red” countries, a category the UK has also been placed in.

So it is extremely confusing why Prince Andrew is resisting demands to meet US officials probing convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his associates.Department of Justice investigators want to speak to Andrew as a witness. Jeffrey Epstein killed himself in August last year, taking many of his depraved secrets to the grave.Despite this, Andrew has, according to US prosecutors, “repeatedly declined” a request to be interviewed and had “unequivocally” stated he would not come in for one.Instead, his lawyers say he has offered to provide a witness statement, which is not quite the same.Although I guess he knows that already, having submitted to the car crash Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis, during which he kept digging the hole he was in.If Andrew has got nothing to hide about his relationship with Jeffery Epstein, why did he request to communicate with the FBI through a written statement Friends of the duke this week claimed he was “utterly bewildered” by accusations that he was refusing to help US investigators.But it all just feels a bit . . . murky, doesn’t it He should jump at the chance of properly explaining his relationship with Epstein and his close friend Ghislaine Maxwell.She has been accused of acting as a pimp for Epstein — which her lawyers have denied — and has vanished.No doubt the duke has spent the past few months hoping this story will just go away, or be eclipsed by other, bigger news events. But clearly, this story is going nowhere.The bottom line is thatthe authorities in the US want to interview him, he must speak to them.Then he can repair his reputation and that of the wider Royal Family.He needs to restore the public’s trust in him. In his Newsnight interview he referred to himself, repeatedly, as “honourable”.Well, now is the time to prove it. Just step up, do the FBI interview and get it over and done with.And in all of this furore, let’s not forget Epstein’s victims. If Prince Andrew can shed any light on Epstein, who killed himself before he could go to trial for new sex trafficking charges, then why won’t he Perhaps he feels that, as a member of the Royal Family, he should not be subject to the same kind of scrutiny as “ordinary” people.But that line of thinking won’t cut the mustard in light of the seriousness of the allegations about Epstein — and those who benefitted from spending time with him.Anyone who watched the documentary about victim Virginia Roberts, Epstein and Prince Andrew will agree that it seems unlikely that anyone who knew Epstein would have known something was not right.I knowI had seen what is alleged, I would have walked straight out and to the first police station.But perhaps he can persuade prosecutors otherwise. And anyway, what is plain to see is that Andrew will only get his le back once he has answered some questions and cleared his name.In the meantime, though, I have another, possibly more pressing question that I would like answered: Where the hell has Ghislaine Maxwell disappeared to, and why is she not being interviewed about her role in all of this A good education closes the gap between the advantaged and the disadvantaged. The better your education, the more career choices you have.So when schools closed in March and we were all told to stay at home, a plan for how to reopen them should have been an absolute priority from day one.But schools are still closed to most children – indefinitely and with no firm or credible plan for them to reopen, even in September.We can go to Thorpe Park. We can go to Ikea. But our children cannot go to school.In the meantime, an estimated , kids are currently doing no school-work at all.No one disagrees that lockdown should have included schools. But they need to reopen as soon as it is safe to do so.That might mean cutting class sizes from  to . It might mean half-days for children or twice as many classrooms and teachers, plus proper arrangements for social-distancing.These things all need managing and organising. So why don’t schools ask local business leaders to help with the logistics This is a national crisis and it is turning into a national emergency, as the gulf between the haves and have-nots widens.Of course, some families will not be comfortable sending their children to school. If that is the case, it should be their choice not to send them.But we need to get schools open again, fast.I had a little chuckle while reading the interview with Oscar-winning actress Cate Blanchett.With her four children and long-standing marriage, she seemingly has it all.But I loved her honesty about the reality of home-schooling her kids while also trying to work during lockdown.Cate said: “I know, as a working mother who identies as a feminist . . . it’s a very rare partnership where the men also accept that responsibility in making things work.”She added that her husband, Andrew Upton, bought her a vacuum cleaner for their first anniversary and has also given her a mixer and an ironing board.It could have been me talking, except I wasn’t given a vacuum cleaner.I was given a frying pan.A hospital costs about £million but without doctors and nurses there is no point.So perhaps I would suggest the money goes towards emergency funding to train hospital staff.What would NOT be on my list, though, is a new royal yacht. Yet that is exactly what former trade minister Lord Digby Jones has called for, to lt the nation’s spirits in the wake of the Covid- lockdown.Somehow, I doubt the Queen – who famously uses Tupperware to keep her breakfast cereal fresh – would agree that a new yacht is what is needed in these tough economic times.She might deserve it but wouldn’t want it.There are so many reasons to love the flute-playing American rapper Lizzo.This week she gave us another, with a tweet showing footage of her working out in many dferent guises.A voiceover said: “I’ve been working out consistently for the past five years – and it may come as a surprise to some of y’all that I’m not working out to have your ideal body type.“I’m working out to have MY ideal body type.“And you know what that is  None of your fing business. Because I am beautul. I am strong. I do my job.”I love this message, which is true in so many ways. I really hope women, young and old, take note. Love yourself and, seriously, don’t give a rat’s a what anyone  thinks.Litter – and worse.One green space near me has a sign up saying: “This is a park, not a toilet.”What happened to us during lockdown that we think it is OK to behave like this  Come on, people. We can do better.Having said that, maybe the council needs to put out some more bins.In the Nineties, it seemed barely a day went by without front-page shots of Kate Moss looking worse for wear after a night on the tiles.But those days are gone and there is something strangely comforting about Kate, who is now teetotal, needing to be in bed by pm so she gets her eight hours.Maybe that’s why she still looks so good. She spent years being there and doing that – now it’s time to get her beauty sleep.Not drinking has many benefits. I feel so much better at the end of Dry January than I do end after boozy December. Good for her.It was heartwarming to see Prince Philip in such fine fettle as he turned  last week.I love how dapper he still is. And he has good health, a strong marriage and great wit – le goals for all of us.I do hope he will be celebrating his th birthday – and beyond.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was so excited for them to hatch but I still had in the back of my mind that these are supermarket eggs.They have been collected, bashed around on a delivery truck, then rattled around on a trolley onto a shelf, picked up and put down by who knows how many people, so they still might not go all the way.Charli was shocked when the ducklings did hatch - and said the experience with the cutest little balls of fluff had been amazing.The only reason I could try was because Im currently furloughed and have the time to raise them to an age where they wont need me all day, she said.Under normal circumstances it wouldnt have been possible or fair on them.A spokeswoman for Clarence Court Farms said: It is a feat of remarkably slim odds that a duckling has been hatched.

It means the kind of face covering you can easily make at home.”If you’re found not wearing a face covering, you might be refused travel and could face a fine of up to £ - or £paid in  days.There will be exceptions for young kids and disabled people.All hospital visitors will also be required to wear face coverings from Monday.Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas in England are allowed to reopen too.The announcement came amid fears that some zoos would be bankruptedforced to stay closed over summer.Edward Perry, managing director of Knowsley Safari, in Merseyside, said while it was “very good news”, he wanted the park to have reopened sooner.He commented: “Knowsley Safari has been ready for the past week to safely open to the public and we still can’t understand why it’s been OK for people to jump in their cars to go and get Big Macs but not to come and see our big cats.”However, the Prime Minister has said that some areas will still be off limits – in particular indoor areas like reptile houses.Places of worship across England will open their doors again from June .But large gatherings will still not be allowed, meaning people will can only pray while following social distancing rules.The Government has said that all churches will need to be cleaned regularly, and books cannot be shared.Places of worship havent been open since March , when lockdown began.There are also set to be some big changes in the classroom, with Year  and Year  pupils allowed back in waves.The Government has announced that only a quarter of kids will be allowed in school at a time – meaning that for some kids, they could get just one full day of teaching each week.Classrooms will have undergone some huge changes since March, with less desks, more frequent cleaning, and only minimal contact between pupils.When they’re not at school, children will still be required to complete remote learning, with the Government saying it should remain “the predominant mode of education”.Plans for other years toto the classroom have been delayed, with the Education Secretary last week saying that not all primary school kids will go back before summer.“We are not able to welcome all primary children back for a full month before the summer,” Gavin Williamson admitted on Tuesday.Some of the biggest changes are still to come, with bars and pubs still shut and the two-metre rule still being enforced.The Government has said that most other shops will be allowed to reopen from July  at the earliest – meaning Brits can get a proper haircut for the first time in months.Meanwhile, social distancing rules are currently under review, with the Government’s scientic advisers looking into whether it can be reduced.This would mean that shops, boozers and restaurants could let more customers in.Air bridges between the UK and other countries – which could see Brits allowed on summer holidays – are also yet to be agreed.Under today’s rules, Brits who go abroad must self-isolate for two weeks when theythe country.However, air bridges could be agreed by June , with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps saying last week that the Government is “actively working” on them.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So it is important that we look at it. “Now that we have made good progress in suppressing the virus we are at a dferent stage in the epidemic than we were at the beginning. That enables us to take a fresh look at this.“Obviously many other countries around the world use a dferent rule and indeed we have seen a couple of countries recently - I think Norway and Denmark - have moved from two metres to something less as well.“But is it important we look at it comprehensively in the round and that is what we will do urgently.”Mr Sunak yesterday urged bargain-hunters to go on a spending spree — to help Britain bounce back from the Covid crisis.He has now insisted slashing the two metre limit could help companies get back on their feet.Mr Sunak added: I can very much understand the positive impact it will have on businesses ability to open and thereby maintain the jobs that they have and make sure the people who work for them can come back to those jobs and remain employed.Yesterday, Labour called for clarity on the Government’s plan to reopen the hospitality sector as well as demanding additional help for businesses forced to stay shut while the two-metre rule is in place.Labour’s Shadow Minister for Business and Consumers Lucy Powell said: “That means no more backroom briefings to Tory MPs and more public advice and guidance to companies.”Britain has kept the two-metre rule when the World Health Organisation says one metre is a safe distance.The WHO advice is followed in Spain, Italy, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway.In Germany, Poland and the Netherlands the distance is . metres, with just the UK, Switzerland and US staying two metres apart.The risk of catching the virus at one metre is . per cent, compared with . per cent at two metres. But this can be cut dramatically by other measures such as wearing face masks or taking regular breaks.Scientists have drawn up a list of imaginative new ways to make it safer for people to work or socialise within one metre of each other.Mr Johnson is expected to make the cut conditional on a continued fall in the infection rate and bosses agreeing to alternative regulations.Tory MPs and ministers have warned only a third of pubs, restaurants and cafes will open for businessthe two-metre rule stays in place.Last month former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith claimed Britain needed to slash the distance people must be apart to get the nation back in work.The prominent backbencher warned unemployment depends on how quickly the economy starts back up again.He said: “We need to get that moving as quick as possible and Ive certainly been arguing that for some weeks now.The move could be timed for when the hospitality trade reopens in July. To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the new book, serialised in the \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Mail on Sunday, it is revealed that some lions are deboned while they are still ALIVE because it gives the skeleton a lucrative pink colour – caused by blood being left in the bones. Unfair Game details a covert operation by security services, including ex-British soldiers, to expose the vile industry by using a dealer as an undercover “double agent.” One of the most serious claims by ex-Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft is that the lions which are born into captivity are raised in such disgusting conditions that they could spread fatal diseases such as tuberculosis and botulism. Dr Peter Caldwell, a wildle vet in Pretoria, said botulism – an infection which attacks the nervous system – could spread to people through infected bones and skin. He said: “If that lion dies from botulism, the people who bred it won’t waste that animal by burying it or burning it. Instead, they will put it into the lion bone and skin trade. “And the toxin remains in the body, so the people who utilise that lion can die a miserable, painful death.”Other diseases spread by lion bones include brucellosis - an infection that causes arthritis and inflammation of the heart - and tuberculosis, which killed . million people globally in .Another shocking claim in the book is that a rich Russian paid one of the farms to let his bloodthirsty pack of hunting dogs savage one of the caged lions to death. When Lord Ashcroft’s lead investigator, who carried out an eight-month probe, presented his evidence to a South African police chief it was rejected and he was told he was “lucky” he was not in jail. The book estimates there are at least , lions, bred in captivity in South Africa, compared to just , in the wild. Sick farm bosses let wealthy hunters into the enclosures to kill the big cats for sport in so-called “canned hunts” which result in , lion deaths every year. Investigators also found that poachers hunt and kill wild lions in neighbouring Botswana by poisoning or shooting them in the stomachs to protect the precious bones. A lion skeleton is worth up to £,. And in sick markets in Johannesburg, lion bones and skins are sold alongside exotic animals such as pangolins – a creature which has been linked to Covid-.Lord Ashcroft writes: So are we sleep-walking straight into a new major public health crisis with the lion bone industry at its core  I fear we are.

The prince has long faced questions about his friendship with financier Epstein, who killed himself in August while awaiting trial on federal charges for the sex trafficking of minors. He was widely criticised for a November interview with the BBCs Emily Maitlis for, among other things, saying he didnt regret the association because it had helped him make contacts that proved useful for his work as a royal. Speaking to the Sunday Times, a source close to the duke said: “I don’t think he regrets the intention behind the interview, which was to clear the air for his family, the royal family and the institution. But the fact he was unable to appropriately or sufficiently convey his sympathy for the victims of Epstein, is of course a source of regret.”Virgina Roberts, who claims she had sex with Andrew aged  after being trafficked by Epstein, took to twitter to respond to the reports. Oh the gull of this toad - he regrets the BBC interview but not his friendship with Epstein because it gave him great contacts and much more, she wrote. This man is not a prince but a facet of insidiousness who has proven to get away with it all.Prince Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing. Recent weeks have also seen the princes legal team engage in a war of words with FBI prosecutors leading the probe into Epsteins crimes. Each side has publicly blamed the other for the fact Andrew is yet to be questioned at part of the investigation. It was reported last week that the US Department of Justice had submitted a formal request to the Home Office for assistance in speaking with Andrew as a witness. The dukes team responded by claiming he had offered his assistance as a witness to the DoJ on at least three occasions since the start of this year, and that the DoJ had breached its own confidentiality rules.Lead federal prosecutor Geoffrey Berman said in response that the prince ly [seeking to] portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate. The prince has... repeatedly declined our request to schedule... an interview and nearly four months ago informed us unequivocally... that he would not come in for such an interview, Berman said.The duke is now reported to be unwilling to help with the probe unless US officials begin to work more honourably.

My focus, however, has been on exposing those who raise captive-bred lions, either for their bones or as so-called “trophies” in “canned” hunts, where the lion — sometimes semi-tame and drugged — is shot in an enclosed area with no chance of escape.In an exclusive interview to mark the publication of my new book Unfair Game: An Exposé Of South Africa’s Captive-Bred Lion Industry, which is out tomorrow, Kevin, , spoke about his determination to make a dference.He said he is now prouder of his off-the-pitch exploits relating to wildle than of his cricketing achievements.“I am pleased that I found something that I am keen to do but also I think it is so much greater than any achievement I had on the cricket field,” he said.Sitting in a private room at the Wentworth Club in Surrey, close to his family home, Kevin told me that his love of wild animals stems from his childhood.He was born in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, in  to an Afrikaner father and an English mother .He said: “A lot of people talk about ‘you are not born in Africa, Africa is born in you’, and that’s so true.“As an African kid, as a boy of the soil, I appreciated what was in the country. And wildle was right up there.”As a youngster, Kevin and his three brothers were taken on safari by his parents to the Kruger National Park in South Africa.“We saw some pretty amazing sights,” he said. His passion for wildle continued during his cricket career, when he often went on safari with family and friends to enjoy watching the “big five”  —  lion, leopard, rhino, elephant and African buffalo.However, his attitude to wildle underwent a major change when he travelled with two friends to South Africa in .Kevin said: “I had just finished with England. After playing a charity game, we went to a couple of safari lodges and went on a rhino micro-chipping experience, where you chip the horn for tracking purposes andthe rhino is poached. Only then did I appreciate what was happening to this beautul, iconic species.“So from  my focus and drive shted away from the international sporting buzz to a much-needed and much more necessary conservation plan. I realised quite what an issue rhino-poaching was, and I realised that I could make a dference by raising awareness, by raising money and by being a voice for an animal that has no voice.“So since  I have been banging the drum about what’s happening in Africa. I can’t tell you how many people now approach me to talk about conservation and not about cricket. The change has been fabulous. To sht from being identied as a familiar face through sport to going into a dferent world where people love animals is something I am incredibly proud of.”As well as establishing a luxury lodge on the edge of the Kruger National Park, Kevin has founded campaign group Save Our Rhino Africa India .It works to help prevent poaching for rhino horn, care for injured and orphaned rhino and to educate people about the fact that the five species of rhino face extinction, with fewer than , left in Africa and Asia.In Africa alone, there are fewer than , white rhinos and for black rhinos the number is below ,. Father-of-two Kevin, who is married to former Liberty X singer Jessica Taylor, spoke emotionally about his love for rhinos: “What is Africa without one of the ‘big five’  What is the world without one of the ‘big five’  That is why the rhino, which is crucially endangered, means so much to me. I just have this love affair with this animal that we are desperate to save.”Kevin is realistic when it comes to the occasional need to kill wild animals.While he strongly opposes trophy-hunting and the hunting of endangered species, he considers that hunting for food and culling wildle can both be legitimate in certain circumstances.“I am just a vocal campaigner on things I don’t think are right, whether it be bullying or plastics in the ocean or protecting wildle,” he said.Many of his strong views, including his anger towards trophy hunters, are aired on his Twitter feed, where he has .million followers.On Twitter, Kevin has highlighted my own wildle work.Last year, I revealed the full horrors of “lion farming” in South Africa, where some , captive lions are bred either for their bones — largely to serve an Asian market — or as “trophies”, most killed in the pretence of a “hunt”.In Africa, captive-bred lions now outnumber wild lions by around four to one. I asked Kevin whether he is ashamed of how some people in the country of his birth abuse lions, the so-called “King Of The Jungle.”He replied: “Absolutely right. I do not understand the end game, the end user, the person that pulls the trigger. I do not understand how you would want to take money out of your pocket to shoot an animal that has been born and raised to be shot.“I don’t understand the brain inside the head that says ‘Look at me in this photo’ [next to a dead wild animal — known as the ‘kill shot’]. It’s just not a space that I live in. It’s just not a world that I live in.“It’s pretty disgusting really to do such a thing. In this trophy photo, you see they [the so-called hunters] are smiling or laughing next to this majestic animal. For me it’s an absolute no-go.”Kevin said that he has long been aware that lion farming and canned hunting exist in South Africa. “It is something that can be stopped and should be stopped.“The human race doesn’t surprise me any more and that’s such a sad thing to say. There are some filthy people out there that don’t have any feeling for animals.”Like me, Kevin wants the UK Government to change the law so that body parts of endangered species can no longer be imported into the country.“I am  per cent against this importation,” he said.Kevin is disappointed the South African government and police have so far refused to act on information I supplied from two undercover investigations which I commissioned.These resulted in my team secretly filming, and eventually identying, many of those guilty of criminal offences. Yet Kevin is not that surprised by the inaction.“In all honestly, South Africa has such big issues — lack of electricity, blood-shedding, corruption within the government who have been looting the country for so many years, that I don’t think this wildle issue is high on their agendaI can be brutally honest,” he said, speaking shortly before the coronavirus pandemic.My respect for Kevin and his work is immense. Unlike many talented sportsman whose careers end because of age or injury, he has a real purpose to his le since retiring as a professional cricketer two years ago.“I did almost everything in the game of cricket, but being able to be a huge voice and a campaigner to try to keep a species alive is . . . something that I love,” he said. Kevin believes his work as a conservationist will be ongoing.“I don’t think it will ever be complete. Unfortunately these horrible people are seeing so much financial gain from killing these animals that it is going to take a lot of amazing people to constantly keep banging the drum to save our animals.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This month has seen children in certain age groups beginning toto school after months away during the lockdown. The government had previously said it wanted all primary school children tofor a month before the summer holidays, but the plans have now been dropped. Almost ten million children aged from reception to year ten will now be off school for at least six months between March and September.Russell Viner is the head of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and also serves on the Government’s Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies.“We need to get kids back to school as soon as we can for their health, he told the Mail. “Everybody in the nutritional world is concerned.“We talk endlessly about the risks of transmission of Covid, and that’s incredibly important, but it’s not the only thing.“The risk-balance equation for children is about the risks of not being in school and poor mental health, poor sleep and potentially lack of exercise and obesity.”Any impact on childrens weight will also be dficult to measure because the NHSs National Child Measurement programme, which monitors the height and weight of children in reception and year six, has been put on hold. Experts have previously found some evidence that childrens average weight tends to increase each year over the summer break, which is just six weeks long. Speaking on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that plans for schools tobefore the summer break had been dropped because the viruss infection rate “is not quite down far enough to change the social distancing measures in schools”.Head teachers association had previously said the plans would not be practicably possible, while teaching unions had raised concerns about the safety of pupils and staff. Running schools safely could mean reducing class sizes by up to a half, and the government is now under pressure to lay out a comprehensive plan for how it intends to see all pupils back by September.

But most schools donapost have the staff or the space and the new guidance comes with no extra money or support.The Labour Party has said the short notice of the announcement will contribute to widespread confusion for schools, pupils and parents.Currently Reception, Year One and Year Six have been brought back in some schools - although others have decided to wait longer. But last week the government was forced to shelve plans for all primary school children toto the classroom before the long summer holiday. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs last week: While we are not able to welcome all primary children back for a full month before the summer, we continue to work with the sector on the next steps, where we would like schools that have the capacity to bring back more children - in those smaller class sizes - to do sothey are able to before the summer holidays.  It comes amid concerns that the absence from schools is doing lasting damage to children and their le chances - with the most disadvantaged most at risk. Anne Longfield, the childrenaposs commissioner for England, warned there was a very dangerous threat to the historic right to guaranteed education. She warned that reduced access to education was being allowed to become the default in some schools. The right to education is enshrined in the UNaposs convention on the rights of the child. It has taken  years of campaigning to get children out of the workplace and into the classroom, ensuring that education was a basic right for all children, she told the Observer. We seem for the first time to be prepared to let that start to go into reverse. And I think that is a very, very dangerous place to be. Leading psychologists describe the delay as a national disaster that is putting childrenaposs mental health at risk. Last week, the prime minister promised a massive catch-up operation to help school children who have missed out on education with the details announced this week.  Today Amanda Spielman, Ofsted chief inspector, told Sky Newsapos Sophy Ridge many schools were being creative to help manage their class sizes. Ms Spielman said schools had been told there is a hierarchy of infection control, with handwashing placed higher than social distancing. She said: Social distancing within the bubbles of the half-size classes is, according to the guidance, an aspiration, not an absolute requirement. Whataposs really important is that everybody works to the guidance as it stands, plans for the relaxations that are likely to come along in future. But, yes, obviously, a reduced distance expectation will flow through into greater capacity in schools but what we need to get to is that plan for how we build capacity over time. Use relaxations as they come through but concentrate on the main objective which should surely be to get as many children back into school as possible and as soon as possible.Labouraposs shadow education secretary Rebecca Long Bailey told Sky News the announcement of new guidelines without clear advance warning could create further uncertainty for schools, pupils and parents.Thereaposs widespread confusion across the sector, and the government so far has failed to build a consensus between school leaders, trade unions, leading experts within the sector around the safety principles that need to be put in place within schools for a safer wider reopening, she told Sky News.Thereaposs a feeling that schools and local authorities have been left to navigate this by themselves, and that should never have been the case.What the government should have done from the start is create a task force to reach a consensus, not only to ensure safety principles were put in place, but also to provide reassurance that it was safe to go back into the classroom, and that didnapost happen. The government has to work very quickly to rebuild trust. Meanwhile leading psychologists describe the delay as a national disaster.that is putting their mental health at risk.

For the first time in three months youaposll be able to go clothes shopping and see the lemurs. But there will be strict social distancing rules in place and firms will be ordered to carry out more hygiene measures than usual. Expect queues outside shops and high demand for tickets for attractions allowed to reopen. Meanwhile, people who live alone or single parents are allowed to form a bubble with one other household in England. This means breaking the two-metre rule for the first time to hug and kiss, share childcare, stay the night and have sexthataposs your thing. Hereaposs everything you need to know about the lockdown changes this week. Two separate households in England can now join together in a “support bubble” under certain conditions. They won’t need to follow the two-metre rule - meaning they can hug, kiss, share childcare and meals, hang out indoors, stay the night and even have sex for the first time since March . One of the two households in each bubble must be a “single-adult household”. This means either a person who lives alone, or a single parent who lives with children under . The other household they are joining with can be of any size, and can have more than one adult in it. However, in total each bubble must only consist of two households - and each household must keep the arrangement “exclusive”. That means a person living alone cannot form multiple bubbles with multiple households. Likewise, a family cannot form multiple bubbles with more than one lonely relative.

What changes in England from June  Non-essential shops reopen  Non-essential shops will be allowed to reopen for the first time for almost three months in England. Stories will need strict social distancing measures, much like those weaposve already seen in supermarkets and other essential stores. Brands vowing to reopen bang on time from June  include Primark, GAME, Debenhams, O, EE and BT, HM, Lush, GAME, H Samuel and Argos. John Lewis is set to open most stores from June , while Next will open a handful followed by others in the coming weeks. Types of shop allowed to reopen include:Fashion shops Charity shops Betting shops and arcades Tailors, dress fitters and fashion designers Auction houses Antique stores Retail art galleries Photography studios Gt shops and retail spaces in theatres, museums, libraries, heritage sites and tourism sites Mobile phone stores Craft fairsFace coverings will be mandatory on public transport  Everyone travelling on public transport in England will be required to wear a face covering from June . Wearing a face covering - not a surgical mask - will be part of the conditions of carriage for travelling on public transport. That means travellers could be refused permission to board buses or trainsthey refuse to comply with the order. Serious offenders could be fined, but ministers have claimed people will largely comply and this wonapost be needed.  Hospital visitors and staff will need to wear face coverings and masks All hospital visitors and outpatients in England will be required to wear face coverings - while all hospital staff will be required to wear higher-grade, type  or  surgical masks. Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemasstart to re-open  Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas are set to reopen in England from Monday. Boris Johnson has said they can reopen as long as they follow social distancing rules. That means their on-site cafes and restaurants are expected to operate as take-away only. Only outdoor attractions are allowed to reopen, so reptile houses and indoor aquariums will remain closed. Sites will be operating at reduced capacity, and there may be one-way systems in place. And of course, because very few things are likely to be open it will be busy, you should book your ticket online in advance to ensure youaposre not disappointed when you turn up. Churches reopen but only for private prayer  Places of worship reopen in England from June , but only for private prayer and not for services. Iniduals are expected to be able to reflect and pray while adhering to social-distancing rules - but worship groups, weddings and other services will still not be permitted. In line with government guidance churches will be expected to be deep-cleaned regularly and should remove shared books from public areas. Churches have been closed since  March, following instructions from the Government. School pupils in Years  and a quarter at a time  Secondary schools in England can reopen for Years  and  from June , but not all students will be allowed toat the same time. Only a quarter of eligible pupils will be allowed in school at any one time - meaning schools have had to instigate special timetables and classes to make the system work. Secondary schools are not likely to fully reopen until September at the earliest. Students who dowill be encouraged to travel separately and avoid public transport. The teaching of vulnerable children and those of critical workers in all year groups will continue until the start of the summer holidays. Some primary schools will open a bit further than they are now While around half of the UKaposs primary schools have been open to more pupils from June , some have remained closed to all but key workersapos kids. This meant nursery, reception, year one and year six pupils in some parts of the country havenapost yet got back into the classroom. Some places, like Doncaster and Liverpool, stopped schools reopening on June , but will see them reopening their doors on Monday. Donapost expect more big changes to primary school attendance before September though. Plans for all pupils in Years , ,  and  tofor a month before the summer break in England have been dropped by Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. Instead schools are just being asked to bring back whoever they can, depending on capacity. He told MPs he is now aiming to get all children back to school in September,possible. What has already changed in recent weeks in EnglandJune : Primary schools were asked to reopen to years R,  and  in England - though only about half of them actually did June : People allowed to meet in socially-distanced groups of up to  outdoors, including in private gardens June : Car showrooms and outdoor markets allowed to reopen June : Dentists begin to reopen with extra hygiene measures in place June : -day quarantine comes into forced for those arriving in the UK June : Some parking charges that were suspended . What weaposll still need to wait until July for - or longer Pubs, restaurants and bars Pubs, restaurants, bars and cafes are not expected to reopen in England until July  at the earliest. They can already operate as takeaways - good news for pubs next to parks or beaches - but they canapost have people drinking on the premises, even in the beer garden. Pubs arenapost guaranteed to reopen on July  - thataposs just the starting date for the hospitality and leisure industry so boozers might come later. When they do open itaposll have to be with social distancing rules in place. Hairdressers and nail bars  Hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons are also only opening from July  at the earliest. And like pubs, the date could end up being later because itaposs hard to avoid being in close contact with someone cutting your hair. The two-metre rule Boris Johnson is under pressure to drop the two-metre social distancing rule down to one metre or one and a half. This would increase the risk of catching the virus from someone but allow the economy to restart. The government has made clear that the two-metre rule is still in all its guidance, including draft rules for pubs and cafes to reopen. But that could change in future. Boris Johnson has said he wants to cut the distance but only when itaposs supported by the science. In basic terms, that means waiting until your overall risk from catching the virus in wider society is so low, some extra risk from the person youaposre next to is acceptable. Scientists say youaposre  to  times more at risk from one metre away than two metres away.

As well as scientic advisers, the Prime Minister is seeking advice from behavioural scientists and economists, the Mail on Sunday reports. Mr Johnson faces mounting pressure from Tory MPs and the pub trade, who say theyaposll go bustthe social distancing rule isnapost cut to .m or m by the time pubs start reopening on July . Thataposs despite warnings from scientists that cutting the distance signicantly increases the risk of spreading the deadly disease. Your risk of catching coronavirus is  to  times higher at one metre away from someone, the governmentaposs chief scientic advisor said last month. Sir Patrick Vallance said standing one metre from someone gives the same risk in six seconds as a full minute at the recommended two metres. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here A Government source told the MoS the move to reduce the distance would provide a road map to unlock the economy before the hospitality industry re-opens for business on July . It comes amid fears thatit remains in place, the hospitality sector will be hit by millions of job losses when the governmentaposs furlough payment scheme comes to an end. Emma McClarkin, the chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, has previously said thatguidelines are not changed, an estimated , pubs and bars will not be able to re-open. It is understood that the review will be run by Downing Street’s newly appointed Permanent Secretary Simon Case. At the moment, Britain and Spain are the only countries in Europe which maintain that people should remain two metres apart to prevent the spread of Covid-. The World Health Organisationrecommends a distance of three feet, or one metre. Until now, Downing Street has emphasised people should still stay two metres from people from outside their household, despite lockdown easing. A Downing Street spokesman said: Our progress in fighting coronavirus depends on everyone following the rules we have set out. This comprehensive review will examine how the two-metre rule works in practice, the scientic evidence and international comparisons, among other factors. It comes after the PM declared earlier this week to put the rule under constant review.  Mr Johnson said: I’ve read many papers actually on the social distancing rule and it’s a very interesting point. I believe that those measures, the two-metre rule, need now to be kept under review. As we drive this disease down, as we get the incidence down, working together, I want to ensure we keep that two metre rule under constant review.

But nurses were the backbone of the NHS long before this pandemic. And not all of these medical angels work in hospitals. Health visitors – those who serve in our communities – are often the unsung heroes of the nursing world. Rachael Hearson, , has been an NHS nurse, midwe and health visitor for over  years – and has experienced all the heartbreaking, hilarious and downright hairy moments that career entails. ‘It’s one of those professions that most people think is a bit of a non-job,’ she explains. ‘People often say, “You just sit on sofas and drink tea, don’t you ” or “It’s not like you’re a real nurse, in the hospital.” Well, let me assure you, we are real nurses! And unlike our amazing colleagues who continue to take the strain in the hospital fraternity, we are out there, on our own.’ It was in July , when Rachael – who came from a poor background – left behind her mum, dad and older sister in Devon, moving to London for £ a month to train as a nurse. ‘Nursing immediately felt right. I had the inclination and aptitude and it provided a salary, which for a working class girl like me was crucial.’ After three years at St Bart’s teaching hospital, Rachael then focused on midwery, learning about breech deliveries, pre-eclampsia and episiotomies .‘I loved the joy of delivering babies. Once you had acclimatised to the blood, heat and the potential drama, it was incredibly rewarding,’ says Rachael. But witnessing a traumatic stillbirth, and having to deliver a grey, leless baby, made Rachael rethink midwery. ‘It was an event that could not be unremembered, it was overwhelmingly sad.’ There was also a very personal reason for deciding to walk away from the maternity wards. Shortly before her training began, Rachael had fallen accidentally pregnant by her boyfriend J. Together they’d made the heartbreaking decision they were too young and too poor to start a family. ‘To be blunt, I’d had a termination and found myself in a surreal world surrounded by babies while tormented by ending my own pregnancy,’ she reveals. ‘It was the right decision at that time, yet there were moments I felt wracked with guilt.’ More happily, Rachael later went on to wed J – an IT project manager – in , and they were blessed with two planned-for and much-loved babies down the line.  In , Rachael honed her nursing skills to specialise in health visitor training at Plymouth Polytechnic. Today, having worked in inner cities as well as more rural locations, she lives in Dorset, where she still thrives as a health visitor. ‘We deal in the full human experience. Our work is mostly behind closed doors yet no less profound,’ insists Rachael, who has privileged access to all families with children under five. ‘Sat on your sofa, we might look as though we’ve never had a real experience in our lives,’ she smiles, wryly. ‘But believe me, we’ve secured more refuge places for those fleeing violence – even helped them pack their bags – and seen more drug-addicted parents with their newborns than you can shake a stick at.’ From asking breast-feeding mums how their nipples are, to sorting emergency contraception and looking for tell-tale signs of postnatal depression or domestic abuse, Rachael’s role is to sensitively see where there is need – and offer her help. Incredibly, one married couple she assisted early on in her career – before the internet came along – needed the facts of le explaining to them. ‘They had been married for some years but children “hadn’t come along”. The GP deduced they didn’t know how to make babies, and it was my job to ensure they did!’ laughs Rachael. ‘They genuinely thought babies arrived as a result of simply ‘being married’ and had no clue. Teaching someone about sex is quite a responsibility. But within a couple of visits, the pair couldn’t keep their hands off each other.’ Sex is an all-prevailing theme in Rachael’s job though, as she points out, ‘babies are the natural consequence after all, so it’s blindingly obvious that sex is going to crop up!’ She’s learned to take all sorts of absurd and surreal scenarios in her stride. Once, she bizarrely endured witnessing a -something dad masturbating on a sofa while she discussed with his girlfriend the sex offenders’ course they were both undertaking.  ‘Her boyfriend was an offender, and she was doing the partners’ course,’ explains Rachael. ‘I was in a conversation with his girlfriend, and there was a new baby to examine, when I noticed some movement out of the corner of my eye. aposThere it was – dear Lord! – the unmistakable rhythmic wrist action, so I turned my back to him. His girlfriend, puzzlingly, did not acknowledge the situation. He carried on as though we weren’t there she carried on as though he wasn’t there I kept calm and just... carried on.’ Rachael even unwittingly visited a brothel once, on a routine assessment of an -month-old child’s development, along with his mother at their home. ‘I was carrying the obligatory scales and assorted toys when I knocked at the door. I was ushered through to the kitchen, where I passed by the parlour room on the left, generally used as a dining room in the other terraced houses on the street. This one, however, was clearly “the boudoir” occupied by a double bed and a couple “at it”.’ Rachael assessed the toddler – who despite clutching a copy of a gentleman’s magazine in his snotty hands – seemed healthy and well developed. ‘We would definitely be viewing things through a dferent lens in today’s climate,’ admits Rachael. ‘But Anthony appeared loved and happy. And I have visited much worse, believe me.’ However, a health visitor’s input is not always welcome. Rachael endured a terrying experience when undertaking a new birth visit to Jean and her new baby Chloe, who were living in a homeless shelter. ‘A huge – and I mean huge – bloke holding a very long kne strode in. I have no idea whether it was a bread kne or a machete – as I was later quizzed about it by the police – but it had a bloody long blade. And he was now holding it up in the air shouting swear words and calling me a b***h.’ Gathering all her wits about her, and mustering a more authoritative voice than she was feeling, Rachael ordered, ‘Right Jean, we’re leaving now. Bring Chloe.’ Mum and baby were moved to safety and the police were called. It’s not all high drama, of course. Much of Rachael’s job is simply fighting for families in poverty – those experiencing problems with claiming benefits, orce, unemployment, eviction, mental health, debt or any combination of these.  ‘The level of real deprivation is staggering,’ she says. ‘For many, it’s not just the lack of a place to call home, it’s the lack of dignity and instability families must endure – imagine you and your family having to share the same kitchen and loo with strangers.’ Handing out vouchers for food banks, making charity applications for white goods, emailing housing departments and lobbying MPs, and sometimes, digging into her own purse is all par for the course. ‘We don’t make a habit of it, butsomeone is in dire need, maybe the cupboards are bare and it’s Christmas, you’d have to be a hard b*****d to walk away.’ In , Rachael undertook a master’s in health policy, planning and financing, believing her future lay in management. But with all her natural warmth, compassion and chalked-up le experience, she soon realised it was too dry for her. ‘After six months I was back, full throttle, to the front line – and it is where I am still privileged to be today.

A Reddit post containing the video has been upvoted more than , times since it was shared last month with many viewers commenting on how disturbing the behaviour is. The cat owner, from Varmland, Sweden, said the longer she watched the clip, the more distressing it became, despite initially thinking it was cute.  “We thought it was pretty cute at first but when we noticed that he didnapost stop it just felt sad, Ida told the Daily Star.“He talks a lot with that ‘whiny’ and sad voice and tone so itaposs hard to tell [ he’s crying]. “But he also hates being alone tho, so maybe he is crying.” She added that Isola “seemed so lonely and restless”.  “It felt like we never could leave him alone again,” Ida - editor of newspaper Nya Wemlands-Tidningen - added.

The Government has made it law to wear them on all trains, buses, trams, ferries and aircraft in a bid to reduce the spread of coronavirus. Covering the mouth and nose like this cuts the risk of asymptomatic carriers - people who are infected but showing no symptoms - from passing on the virus. DIY face coverings can be used, even scarves or thin cloth masks. Railway staff will also have to follow the new rule. British Transport Police can fine those not wearing masks £ on the spot. Where is it compulsory to wear face masks From Monday, we must wear face masks on trains, buses, trams, ferries and aircrafts. This includes the London Underground system for those in the capital. Private hire taxis and minicabs are also included in the ­measures, but the rules do not cover bus stops, railway stations and other terminals. In addition to the fines, youaposll be asked to leave the public transportcaught not wearing a mask. The most common symptoms of the coronavirus are: a dry, persistent cougha feverIf you experience these symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate yourself for seven days. It is not necessary to call NHS  unless your symptoms get more severe. Some patients have reported fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath and aches and pains. Sneezing is not a symptom of the coronavirus. The disabled, young children and those with breathing dficulties are exempt.While it is not compulsory to wear one at the shops, many shoppers choose to wear one. Face masks are, though, compulsory in hospitals. Staff, visitors and outpatients must wear them.But businesses arenapost legally obliged to provide personal protective equipmentto employees. Most stores have said they will be available though.  How severe are the punishments for not wearing face masks  Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, said Brits can be fined up to £ on the spotthey donapost wear face masks on public transport. However, it is most likely police forces will continue the same approach theyaposve used to enforce lockdown itself.

Adults living alone or single parents living with children under the age of  can form a bubble with one other household which means they will effectively be treated as a single household for the purpose of the lockdown rules. That means they can visit each other indoors in their homes - staying overnightthey wish - and they will not have to observe the two-metre social-distancing rule. These bubbles are strictly exclusive - neither household can form a bubble with anyone . It means elderly people living alone could form a bubble with the household of an adult son or daughter enabling them to visit and even hug their grandchildren for the first time since lockdown. Single parents could pair up with their own parents allowing them to share childcare duties and reuniting grandparents and grandchildren. And couples who do not live together will be able to visit and to stay with each other.  But some scientists have advised against social bubbles. A SAGE report of its meeting on May  said: Sage advised that social bubbles have the potential to create signicant unwanted effects and advised against their introduction in the short term, when other distancing measures have only just been lted or in conjunction with release of other measures. Sage advised strong caution concerning the introduction of social bubbling - particularly in the short term, when other distancing measures have only just been lted or in conjunction with release of other measures.

One woman, who was cycling alone when she was targeted by the ten-strong gang, has spoken out about her ordeal in order to raise awareness of the aposcanal pusherapos gang. Sophie Watson, , said she was attacked by a teenage gang as she rode home to the Jewellery Quarter on the Worcester and Birmingham Canal on Friday evening, June . As she was left bruised and soaking, she came across another woman who appeared to have suffered the same attack.Speaking to BirminghamLive, Sophie said at least five women had been targeted along the canal on the same night.While only one incident has been reported to the police, officers have increased their foot patrols along the canal route. Sophie reported what happened to her, but said there were no witnesses to her attack as the stretch of canal had been quiet at the time. I was coming from the university towards the city centre, along the canal, when I saw around ten boys on bikes shouting between them, she said. I squeezed past - I was right next to the canal - and one of them nudged me in. They just cycled on towards Stirchley, laughing. There was no-one around to call for help so I climbed out and headed on home. But a little further down the canal I saw another woman - roughly the same age as me - being helped out of the water. Two men had stopped to help her. Sheaposd been pushed in too. Sophie later tweeted about her experience and has since heard about other women being pushed in to the canal near Bournville, also on Friday night. I cycle this route most days and had just been out for a bit of exercise. Iaposd travelled down cycle route five to Stichley, then back along the canal, she said. I always wondered when Iaposd end up falling in, I never expected Iaposd be pushed in. People have since contacted me to say they knew of others who had been pushed in around Bournville last night. It was a shock but my biggest worry is that it will deter women from cycling, she added. Iaposll continue to cycle but will steer clear of the canal for a while. The yobs who targeted Ms Watson as she was cycling were said to have been aged between  and . A statement from West Midlands Police read: We were called to reports of a woman cyclist being pushed into a canal near Carver Street, Birmingham just after .pm on Friday evening.

Scott Gavin, , has built five outdoor enclosures for his animals while three Burmese pythons share a room with son Robert, . The dad-of-six insists it is “totally safe” to let the snakes – up to ft long – slither around the backyard as his young ­children Chloe, , Ellie-Mai, eight, Emily, three, and -month-old Megan play. Scott, married to Leanne, said his love for animals has been passed on to the kids – especially autistic Robert, , who finds comfort in pet skunk, Rosie. His barn owl, meerkats, hedgehogs, Burmese pythons, giant cockroaches and others are registered for therapy visits to elderly homes. Scott, also dad to Jake, said: “My youngest Megan, who has Down’s syndrome, loves the snakes but she is too heavy handed. “If it is a sunny day, I allow the snakes to roam free in the garden and bask in the paddling pool whilst the children play.“But I’d never leave them unattended as they could constrict any of them at any time. We have got cute fluffy guinea pigs, rabbits, meerkats, ducks and reptiles including geckos, lizards and snakes. Robert and Rosie the skunk are inseparable. We have  snakes including pythons, corn snakes, a  water cobra, Baron’s racer and western hognose – they are harmless.  “The pythons could constrict you at any moment but I look after them and I don’t think it would happen.” The family live in a five-bedroom house in Kirkby, Merseyside, with the animals – which cost £ a month to care for. Scott, who runs Party Central Entertainments, said the animals become a good talking point for the elderly, and at prisons where they are used as a way to bring fathers and sons together on visits.

Heads are expected to be told they can bring back one extra year groupthey have the capacity to maintain classes of just  pupils. But there will be no extra funding for more teachers or alternative ­premises, such as Portakabins or local community halls. And the Government was accused of failing to back hundreds of ­thousands of disadvantaged kids who do not have proper access to computers or the internet and who may struggle with schoolwork. In the most deprived schools, % of teachers report more than a third of students would not have had use of a device for home learning over the  weeks of lockdown so far. The Government promised , free laptops as part of a £million scheme to help narrow the digital ide – but last week Education Secretary Gavin Williamson admitted just half of those have arrived. The UK coronavirus death toll yesterday rose by  to , – and some experts have warned against children going back to school. But there were growing calls on ministers to address the growing fears for disadvantaged children kept home as research revealed their learning is most likely to suffer. Former PM Tony Blair, ex-chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw, four former education ­secretaries, cross-party MPs, teaching unions and charities are among ­signatories to a letter to ministers warning of the risk to education.  The letter says: “This leline has not been available for all, with schools across the country reporting ­struggling families who do not have internet access at home. “Those children who can’t access the same resources as their ­classmates will find themselves even further behind when theyto school. “There is a risk that some may never catch up.” With growing frustration among teachers, MPs and unions over the chaoticof schools, Children’s Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, warned the right to ­a ­guaranteed education was under threat. She said: “It has taken  years of campaigning to get children into the classroom, ensuring that education was a basic right for all.  “We seem for the first time to be prepared to let that start to go into reverse. And I think that is a very, very dangerous place to be. “We heard from the Prime Minister back in April that education was one of the top three priorities for easing lockdown, but it seems to have been given up on quite easily.” The Government will today come under pressure to provide laptops and internet access to the homes of the most vulnerable children to help them catch up. Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh is presenting a Bill in Parliament calling for all ­children eligible for free school meals to have a broadband ­connection and internet at home. Ministers have also been stung by ­accusations they have put retail ahead of education – especially that of the most deprived – as ­non-essential shops start to reopen today. There are at least , ­disadvantaged children who do not have access to devices Primaries have reopened to Reception classes, Year One and Year Six. Under the push to get more back, it is thought schools may be able to take Year Five pupils,schools can limit the numbers to . Although secondary years  and  will start to go back from today, millions more will not be back before September at the earliest."},{"url":null,"title":"post office union members accuse","story":"NewsPost Office union members accuse bosses of not letting them into talks after court winEXCLUSIVE: The Communication Workers Union say they are being denied representation during discussions, and fear new CEO Nick Read is planning changes that could see small branches closeShareCommentsByAlan Selby:,  JUN NewsNew Post Office CEO Nick Read\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Dodgy IT systems saw some bankrupted, wrongly jailed and led to one suicide before damages were awarded to subpostmasters accused of theft. But nearly six months after a judge slammed Post Office bosses who covered up the problem leaders say talks aimed at re-setting relations are being evaded. The Communication Workers Union say they are being denied representation during discussions, and fear new CEO Nick Read is planning changes that could see small branches close. Postmasters branch secretary Mark Baker said a rival union, the National Federation of Subpostmasters, continued to be the only recognised body in talks. He said: Weaposve been totally excluded from any negotiations. Weaposve been challenging the CEO on how this fits with the commitment to reset relations with subpostmasters. We, as subpostmasters, have not been able to choose our representative body. They donapost want to speak to anybody who will answer back. Mr Baker said issues with the Horizon IT system still continued, but postmasters were being kept in the dark over what was being done to address these. And he said union members feared improvements were not being made to Horizon because the Post Office was planning to scrap the system and roll out PayZone systems like those found in convenience stores. He said this could herald the closure of branches, with more complicated services related to passports and driving licence applications centralised in cities and large towns.  Convenience stores would be able to offer simple services like postage, meaning increased competition could see small branches close. He said: Nick Read has created the environment for us to speculate. What does he mean when he says he wants to simply the offer for retailers  That sets hares running.

The Duke of York, , is hoping he will be able to resume his senior royal duties, according to the Sunday Times. But the Queenaposs patience with her embattled son is aposwearing thinapos after he got himself into yet another public scrap over the FBIaposs investigation into Epstein, a source told the newspaper. Buckingham Palace is aposfuriousapos with the Duke of York after he rowed with US investigators probing the American billionaire, who died in jail awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Courtiers are accusing the dukeaposs statement to investigators who have requested to quiz him of overshadowing his fatheraposs birthday celebrations.  Prince Philipaposs th birthday was hoped to be a positive moment for the troubled monarchy, but it came in the same week Andrew dominated headlines once again as he slammed US investigators. A source close to the duke told the newspaper the duke regretted the fallout over his disastrous interview with the BBCaposs Emily Maitlis. He had described the widely-mocked interview as a apossuccessapos - but is now said to have expressed regret he failed to apologise to Epsteinaposs victims. The Duke has faced humiliation over his response to questions about his links to disgraced Epstein. The Sunday Times reports today he will refuse to co-operate with the request of US investigators that he travel to the States to help with their inquiries until he gets an aposolive branchapos. In the Newsnight interview he denied having sex with Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre, now Roberts, on three occasions. Giuffre has claimed in US court she was flown across the world by Epstein, including once, in March , to have sex in London with the prince, who has denied her allegation.  The source told the Sunday Times: I donapost think he regrets the intention behind the interview, which was to clear the air for his family, the royal family and the institution. But the fact he was unable to appropriately or sufficiently convey his sympathy for the victims of Epstein, is of course a source of regret. Prince Andrewaposs handling of the saga was said to have dismayed senior Palace courtiers. They claimed the duke still intended to resume a public role, and viewed his step back from senior duties as a apossabbaticalapos rather than a permanent move. They also claimed the duke is conscious of the effect of the scrutiny on him has had on the royal family, also still reeling from Meghan Markle and Prince Harryaposs bombshell exit.  But palace officials were said to be fuming anew after he publicly locked horns with the US Department of Justicein a fresh row last week. The DOJ has filed a Mutual Legal Assistance request to the British government in a bid to force the prince to supply a statement. He issued a scathing statement through his lawyers claiming he had offered at least three times to speak to US investigators and that they had used his status to gain publicity for their inquiry.

It came as the latest easing of the social distancing rules in England meant grandparents who live alone can be reunited with their families as they form support bubbles with one other household. That means they can visit each other indoors in their homes - even staying overnightthey wish - and they will not have to observe the previous two-metre social-distancing rule. Five-year-old Heidi, from Worthing, West Sussex, was able to embrace her grandmother who lives alone and can now pair with one other household. Heidi couldnapost contain her excitement as she was finally allowed to cuddle her nan after three months apart.  Her dad Gareth Snow, , filmed the touching moment as the best friends could touch once again after spending months in lockdown due to coronavirus.The sweet video shows Heidi knocking on her grandmother Pamaposs door before backing away to keep her distance. Her dad then asksshe wants to give her nan a hug and she races to the door for a long-awaited embrace. Today we have been able to reunite Nana Pam with her granddaughter and best friend Heidi, Gareth told the PA news agency. It has been a long three months of FaceTime and doorstep hellos at a distance, which has been hard on both of them as they are usually so close. “For those living alone this will make le so much easier – a little bit of ‘normal’. “They can now go for a walk along the seafront, picnic in the park together… Simple things that have sadly not been possible during lockdown.” In Ashtead, Surrey, another grandparent was reunited with her family, including Emily, , Daisy, seven, and Benjamin, four, who had travelled from Bromley to see their grandmother. Gorgeous pictures show the children racing into Susanaposs arms after months apart. Susan, who did not wish to give her second name, is retired and has been knitting jumpers for the trio during lockdown but it was the first time she had seen her grandchildren since March. The new rule, which commenced on Saturday, means adults living alone or a single parent with children under the age of  can be treated as a single household for the purposes of following lockdown rules. There were also squeals of delight in Telford, Shropshire, as another family were finally reunited. Hayley Matthews, , had been separated from her mother Rita Kenyon and said the reunion was like being let out of jail.They had spent a lot of time together before lockdown as both Hayley and her husband Rob work and Rita was the main source of childcare for their children Maddison, nine, Jude, seven and five-year-old Rowan. We have really missed her, especially my youngest, Hayley told the BBC. Rowan spends lot of time with Nanny, so it has been really dficult, the other two understand a bit more. At the first part of lockdown, I wouldnapost go to see her because I couldnapost deal with it. Hayley described the moment they heard the news they were finally allowed to reunite.She said: I rang her because she didnapost watch the news, and she was crying down the phone, it is like being let out of jail were mumaposs words.Announcing the plan for support bubbles earlier this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was a targeted intervention designed to help those most isolated by the lockdown.However, the latest batch of papers released by the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesrevealed misgivings among the experts at the prospect of social bubbling. A report of its meeting on May  urged strong caution, warning it could create signicant unwanted effects - particularlyit was introduced alongside other easing of the rules.

Rayshard Brooks died in hospital on Friday night after a scuffle with officers outside a Wendyaposs in Georgia, having allegedly failed a sobriety test and resisting arrest after falling asleep in his car. The -year-old was a father to three girls and also had a stepson, WSB-TV reports. Investigators tonight released footage of the struggle with Atlanta Police that preceded him being shot and killed, which comes only weeks after the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. It has sparked fresh demonstrations in the streets of Atlanta, which saw the Wendyaposs where Mr Brooks died lit on fire by protesters on Saturday night.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email  Images on local television showed the restaurant in flames while an anti-racist march has also completely shut down the Interstate  Highway. Mr Floydaposs death has sparked three weeks of widespread protests against racial discrimination, and in some cases violent clashes with police and right-wing counter-protesters, across the US and around the world.The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has now launched a probe into Mr Brooksapos death. In a statement given to CNN, it says police were called to the restaurant at around .pm on Friday after a man was found to be asleep in his vehicle, blocking the drive-through lane and forcing other customers to drive around him. The GBI says police then gave Mr Brooks a sobriety test, which he failed, leading to the scuffle.  Attorneys L. Chris Stewart and Justin Miller, who are now representing Mr Brooksapos family, released the images on Saturday night. According to broadcaster CBS, he had spent the evening of his death celebrating his eldest daughteraposs birthday. The fatal shooting led to Atlantaaposs police chief, Erika Shields, resigning on Saturday. Shieldsapos statement said: For more than two decades, I have served alongside some of the finest women and men in the Atlanta Police Department. Out of a deep and abiding love for this City and this department, I offered to step aside as police chief. APD has my full support, and Mayor Bottoms has my support on the future direction of this department. I have faith in the Mayor, and it is time for the city to move forward and build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. The Atlanta police involved in the shooting have been criticised for the use of firearms, given that Mr Brooks appears to have only had a Taser. The cityaposs mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, said: I do not believe that this was a justied use of deadly force and have called for the immediate termination of the officer. US politician Stacey Abrams, a former Georgia political candidate, is among those who have called for restrictions on police use of deadly force.Commenting on Twitter, she said: A Taser is not a deadly weapon. A gun is. Adrenaline and irritation are not the same as mortal fear. Running away should not be punishable by death. Public safety must mean the public is safe. All of us. And Jen Jordan, a Democratic State Senator for Georgiaaposs th District, wrote: Asleep in his car. Thataposs why police were called. Now he is dead after being shot three times in the back as he was running away. #RayshardBrooksshould not be dead. Authorities have not yet released the names of the two officers, who were both white. A video taken from a nearby car, and released by the GBI, shows Mr Brooks on the ground outside his car, struggling with two officers.

Before lockdown Jake went in search of the Crewe property after spotting it on Google Maps.Hidden behind an array of trees and overgrown bushes was the abandoned property - and it did not disappoint. He said: I never reveal the exact location of the places I find but this one was near Crewe. The sort of places I find are all old and abandoned so I never know what I am going to find. This house was as though someone just left and never came back. There was a pair of shoes and a sewing machine, and beds still in the house - plus an enormous Quality Street tin which was much bigger than the ones we get now!  The exterior of the property, albeit run-down, shows so much potential with its grand structure and columns surrounding the front door. Upon entering the property, the wallpaper in the hallway was peeling and the pretty geometric design of the floor was barely noticeable beneath the dirt.  Among the dirt and rubble were a number of books and magazines lying open - including a page from the Daily Star dated August ,  - as well as a sewing machine, a pair of menaposs smart shoes and a large tin of Quality Street. Upstairs, you can expect to see one of the bedrooms filled with broken furniture as well as branches pushing their way through the window. In the garden, other than the caravan, Jake spotted an array of car parts strewn around, and a mattress. This is a hobby for me, says Jake.

Among the photos were the faces of doctors, police officers, firefighters, street cleaners and children.Broadcasting the service live, the cleric criticised the South American countryaposs health system, which he said was based on egotism and on business and not on mercy and solidarity with the people, reports the .  Mr Castillo called for Peru to come together, warning an even harder moment is coming with the economy expected to contract by  per cent. It would be terriblein the times to come we have thousands of these photos – but dead of hunger, he said.

However, Mr Vizcarraaposs pandemic response has been ultimately slammed as corrupt and consisting of deep-rooted inequality. Hugo Ñopo, who works for a Peruvian research group, Grade told NYT: They asked us to stay at home, but a lot of people have no savings so that was impossible. They asked us to wash our hands, but one in three poor households has access to running water.

It will be a massive plus that we have something to work to.“Every manager will probably tell you the same – we need a date for when we are going to go back.“But as I said, I am cautious because there is an awful lot going on at the moment, from where you can take your kids to when you can go and meet other people.“Everything is changing and I don’t think football will be any dferent.”Reconstruction plans have now been run up the flagpole and ripped back down again more than once.Consensus, as is so often the case in Scottish football, has proved impossible to reach.Meanwhile clubs like Dundee, whose business model means they sit uncomfortably in the Championship, have been left in limbo.It has affected everyone at the club – and their manager is growing tired of the uncertainty.However, McPake is conscious of the wider issues in today’s world, and his annoyance is tempered by realism.He said: “There is frustration but for me that can’t be put on anyone.“There is a frustration in every industry about where we find ourselves.“We have never been in a situation like this before and what that brings is a real level of uncertainty.“We are looking for answers every day. I would be very reluctant to blame that on a single person or organisation as you can see it right across the world at the minute. But yes, it is frustrating.“If you are looking at it purely from a footballing point of view it is really dficult for the players, for the backroom staff and for the fans.“But again there is a bigger picture here in terms of a health crisis.“We have to be guided by the government and the governing bodies in football but it has not been easy.“Everybody is in the same boat really and there are no real answers to what is happening and when we can get back to what is perceived as normal.“It is dficult – there is no other way of putting it.”For as long as the Championship remains without a definitive restart date, many elements of Dundee’s normal business operations will remain on hold. On the football side, that means recruitment and day-to-day work with players.They are crucial to any club’s success.But McPake insists he – and everybody  at Dens Park who is not furloughed – is doing everything he can to ensure as seamless ato action as possible.“I speak to Johna couple of times a week or maybe more but nothing has really changed,” he said. “We are where we are and there is no definitive date to when we can start back. It is not like a normal summer or break in the season like a winter one or international break.“There is always a structure to football and when you are back. The players, staff, everybody knows that but at the moment that has completely gone.“It is everyone’s longest lay-off – we are now getting to the stage where the players have been off the same amount of timethey had a serious injury so that brings its problems physically and mentally.“It is just about trying to get everything right so that when we do get the green light to start back we are in as good a position as possible.”EXCLUSIVE: Ex-Dundee striker Peter MacDonald confirms he’s hanging up his boots and says best day of his career came as a Dark Blues player\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-fc-peter-macdonald-retirement-st-johnstone-rangers embed # secretWJcMNsFIpT\" data-secret\"WJcMNsFIpT\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

We knew we needed to improve his fitness.“Once we got him fit – we needed to get him up to scratch and keep him playing at the same time – and got into his head in terms of how we played, he was great for us.“He was brilliant at taking the ball, getting us up the park and running past defenders, his pace was a major asset.“I didn’t have a lot of hair at the time but I still lost a bit because he would drive you bananas at times with some of the silly things he’d do in good positions.“It goes without saying that he’s matured well beyond that now. He might have lost a bit of pace in recent years but he is a seasoned campaigner.“Back then he was desperate to come up to Scotland and play games.“The big thing we sold him on was the area, the lestyle – the tranquillity up here compared to the hurly-burly down south.“We told him he could get himself on the TV, sell himself in the big games and we were the type of club thatsomeone came in for you with a decent offer, you’d have the option to go.”Hayes – who started out at Reading – eventually left for Aberdeen in  after three years with Inverness.Over  games in five seasons and a League Cup winners’ medal in the Granite City followed before he clinched a £ million move to Celtic.The winger struggled to establish himself as a Hoops regular but he started several crucial games for the Scottish champions, including the  Scottish Cup final triumph over Hearts and the stunning Europa League victory over Lazio in Rome last November.Two months earlier he grabbed the second goal in the Old Firm derby as Neil Lennon’s side beat Rangers - at Ibrox.Hayes’ Parkhead exit – which has also led to interest from his former employers at Pittodrie – came less than two weeks after he picked up his third title medal in three campaigns with the club.Malpas said: “I thought Jonny would’ve got another contract at Celtic and that he would happily have stayed.“But maybe they’re trimming their squad a bit to get players in and maybe there wasn’t going to be the chance to play as many games next season.“He certainly didn’t let Celtic down when he was called upon.“For United, though, good on them for trying to sign Jonny. They’re clearly thinking about the right players and I think that’s the type of player they need.“He’s experienced and he’s played at a very good level. He’s still got pace, he can play in more than one position and he’s good in a dressing room.“I thinkyou were struggling in the middle of the pitch he could do a job there as well.“You’d never say he was the best defender, but he never seems to get a doing from the wide players he plays against.“Sometimes you think he isn’t the best at beating people yet he always seems to get crosses in.“For us at Inverness he was great at getting the ball in the box and created a lot of goals for guys like Adam Rooney.”The former United captain saw a transformation in Hayes during his time with the Dons.He added: “I’ve followed Jonny’s career for years and hoped he would do well.“He was great for us and did everything we asked. He’s one of the many guys you like to think you’ve helped a bit.“Jonny’s really matured and looked after his fitness. At Aberdeen he was playing under a bit more pressure in front of a more demanding crowd and that helped him make the move to Celtic.“He was a cheeky chappie when we had him –he got a bit of stick, he’d give a bit back. Some things used to affect him but I could see a dference at Aberdeen, he’d outgrown that and he could handle that.“We had a great group at Inverness. When we went in, we only kept three or four players and started again.“Graeme Shinnie was one of the kids that was there and he has developed into a right good player as well.“These guys would run through a wall for you and they were a joy to work with.“We didn’t have great facilities but these guys wanted to learn, they wanted to work and they had a great attitude.”Dundee United appoint senior club representative to liaise with Terrors fan groups\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-fan-groups-liaison embed # secretNdKFhlJe\" data-secret\"NdKFhlJe\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

More details of the competition and the prizes on offer at the bottom of this page.To be clear, features we#ll run on the contenders for Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal, followed by a closing poll to determine the winner, won#t necessarily focus on goals of signicance which have secured silverware or qualication, like John Hewitt#s header in Gothenburg or Darren Mackie#s finish in Dnipro.What we are talking about is goals of technical brilliance, made either inidually or as a team, some of which could be meaningless in terms of competitions and silverware.This pearler from left winger GMS in the fourth round of the Scottish Cup came when the Dons were already - up and cruising against the then-Championship Buddies. The strike also arrived so soon after the start of the second half, some of the ,-strong crowd inside Pittodrie weren#t back in their seats to witness it.However, none of that takes away from a strike which couldn#t have been hit cleaner, nor placed more perfectly into the far postage stamp # despite the fact Mackay-Steven was moving at pace towards the byeline.So good was this hit, it was declared the goal of the round, and this clip to mark the award shows the lasered shot from every glorious angle:After the Scottish Cup win, GMS said: “That was probably the best goal I have scored. I got in front of the defender and just hit it.“From the moment it left my foot I thought it had a chance and it was nice to see it go in the top corner.“It was an important goal as well because - is never a safe result. Going - up made it hard for St Mirren to come back.“That goal was very pleasing as I have not scored many like that.#Win a   Aberdeen kids kit and £ Smyths voucher in our Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal competition\" title\"#Win a   Aberdeen kids kit and £ Smyths voucher in our Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal competition# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp sport football aberdeen-fc donsnews help-us-find-the-best-strike-ever-from-a-dandy-don embed # secretngfcQjpJ\" data-secret\"ngfcQjpJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"We want youngsters to have a go at imitating our Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal contenders, with the club agreeing to give away a kids# home kit and kids# away kit for the two best efforts as chosen by our  of judges.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this. It has been good to share some of the memories of Argyll with you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSend us a photograph of your family member or friend enjoying their special day and we will publish it and wish them a happy birthday.Remember to include their full name, age, where they are from and a bit about what you did to make the day at home special.Send your photographs to editor@argyllshireadvertiser"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe featured image this week was submitted by Aileen Gillies of Lochgilphead, who caught this stunning sunset on May  at Bellanoch bridge on the Crinan Canal."},{"url":null,"title":"plans in place for 2021 camanachd cup final","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFollowing the expected cancellation of shinty’s  cup competitions, the Camanachd Association has confirmed with title sponsor Tulloch Homes and Kingussie Camanachd Club that the plan to host the final in Kingussie will be postponed for a year and will now take place on September  .The Tulloch Homes Camanachd Cup Final willto the Highland venue for the first time since  and for its th anniversary.First contested in , the final of shinty’s national knock-out cup competition promises to be a brilliant day out for all the family and a  chance to watch two of the country’s elite shinty teams.Hundreds of tickets have already been sold and to be part of this historic moment you can secure your tickets, including some exclusive offers, on shinty.The  final takes place at The Dell and will be one of the biggest stagings of the event in its -year history with live traditional music, entertainment and a dedicated Kids Zone adding to the festival feel.The first final of the Camanachd Cup took place at Inverness on April  .

This is a challenging operational environment for our aircrew and an extremely dficult period for our fundraising teams as the restrictions are preventing all the events, talks and activities taking place which are so essential to help support the country#s only charity-funded helicopter air ambulance service.It costs around £ million each year to fund our Perth and Aberdeen-based helicopter air ambulances.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

and Macmerry.East Lothian Council is petitioning the Scottish Government to extend the National Development status given to the former Cockenzie Power Station site in its National Planning Frameworkdocument to a wider area in its planned revised framework which is under review.This could pave the way for the creation of the ClimatEvolution Zone which could transform the area over the next  years through innovative approaches to development.A public consultation on the vision has been launched by the council and breaks the plans down into dferent themes from environment to travel.It asks people to give their views on its approach to a wide range of issues including access and movement the water environment culture, heritage and leisure greenspace and bioersity strong communities and regeneration and enterprise.However, the vision has already come under fire from Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council which branded it ldquocomplex and unclear.The community council warned that the launch of a new vision for the area three years after the local authority produced its Cockenzie Masterplan document ndash which it has never adopted ndash would leave the public with no confidence in the planning system.East Lothian Council paid consultants to produce the Cockenzie Masterplan for the former Cockenzie Power Station site, which it owns, after a series of public consultations in  but the report remains an informal ldquovisionary document.Now the former power station site could be merged into the new ClimatEvolution Zone with no reference to the original masterplan.Bryan Hickman, community council chairman, said: ldquoThe community council are very concerned by the documents recently published by the council.\"We understood that the changes required for NPF related to the former power station site.\"The y report now extends to Tranent, Prestonpans, Cockenzie and Port Seton, Longniddry and Blindwells as well as the power station site.\"Whilst some of the objectives are to be welcomed, the overall content is complex and unclear and includes such a large area as to be unmanageable in its detail.ldquoThe existing communities have been consulted on the power station site and the result was a masterplan commissioned by the council but not adopted by them.\"We have submitted this masterplan to be included in NPF.\"A number of consultations have taken place in our area and they have come to nothing.\"The feeling is the residents have lost confidence in the system.Neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council also raised concerns about the consultation.Brian Weddell, chairman, questioned whether the proposed train station in the new plan would ever happen, saying: ldquoThere has been no meaningful consultation with local communities who all have concerns about the impact of this development on their communities.The new consultation is based around a study, drawn up in partnership with East Lothian Council, the Scottish Government, The Lothian Drainage Partnership, SEPA, Scottish Water and Scottish Natural Heritage.It considers how the council can take the opportunity of creating a new town at Blindwells and harness the latest technologies to reduce the arearsquos carbon footprint.Among the ideas up for discussion is using groundwater at Blindwells to create waterways and using natural geothermic energy to heat the outdoor water features.Douglas Proudfoot, project leader, said the idea behind the new water features was to avoid putting pipes underground to remove groundwater and utilise it instead as

ambitious strategy.He said: ldquoThe Cockenzie and Blindwells sites are adjacent to one another and it has always been inevitable that their development will be closely linked, so it makes sense to seek to extend National Development status to Blindwells.ldquoThe whole area offers unique potential to transform these former industrial sites into places where people can live and work in a sustainable way.Kenny MacAskill, East Lothian MP, also welcomed the project which will lsquointeractrsquo with neighbouring communities.He said: ldquoThe area is a far wider community and cannot be

Hotels require one space per room.I understand that the parking standards have only recently come into effect and all other licensed premises have the benefit of being historical licensed premises and therefore protected. However, I fully believe that a common sense approach should have been taken in this instance, particularly as I submitted a very detailed travel plan which included not only promoting nearby parking options, bus timetables and taxis but actually incentivised travel to and from The Catrsquos Pyjamas by bus, taxi or on foot. When coming up with the concept of The Catrsquos Pyjamas in late summer early autumn  the first thing I did, being a total novice to owning a bar, was to engage with the licensing department.The licensing standards officer advised me I could operate with occasional licences whilst working toward the full premises licence so after submitting the occasional licence applications I was surprised to be told by planning I needed to submit a change of use application for the occasional licences.Bewildered by the conflicting information but just wishing to do what was required, I immediately submitted the application and paid the associated fee.It is frustrating that I was erroneously informed that a change of use was required for occasional licences which stopped me operating and establishing precedent.It is also frustrating I find myself in this situation because I accepted the advice and guidance of East Lothian Council. I am not seeking to apportion all the blame on the council as I have made mistakes, the biggest of which is being naive enough to believe that those who should have and give you the correct information actually do have and give you the correct information. What we have created at The Catrsquos Pyjamas is truly special. Those who have enjoyed an evening with us will validate that.I have had such incredible support from people across Dunbar and beyond that it continues to blow my mind. There is a real desire for The Catrsquos Pyjamas to work and given the chance it could become something truly amazing which is beneficial not only to the town but the county. But this journey has been very painful and costly.There has been a clear campaign against The Catrsquos Pyjamas to the point of it being a vendetta.Objectors have ly contacted the police to report noise when there was none ndash veried by Police Scotland ndash just to get it on the record ahead of the licensing board hearing.

School pupils, too, have been subject to major disruption and face an uncertain future as jobs and employment prospects disappear.Some workers and pupils, especially those without access to digital technology and skills, will be particularly hard hit and this is why CGI is keen to reach the most vulnerable to help them stay afloat in a post-Covid world.Through their community engagement programme, the company already has a focus on disadvantaged groups and this will continue and be strengthened further over the next year, according to CGIrsquos Director of Corporate Responsibility,Philippa Green.The company has almost , UK staffand she said they were keen to become involved and do what they could to help society recover.Before the pandemic hit, part of CGIrsquos community programme which focuses on supporting the next generation, was working in schools to interest pupils in careers in science, technology, engineering and maths.This work involved hosting STEM camps which engaged students across the UK in fun STEM related activities. The physical camps were cancelled when schools shut their doors but the organisation quickly pivoted and put a version online to help children, parents and schools through the lockdown.ldquoWe started doing it as an immediate response to the situation, said Green.ldquoLike many other people we thought it was going to be a short term project and children would be going back to school fairly quickly but it is now apparent that it is going to be longer than first expected so we are trying to pivot to the next stage.The content will remain online but unfortunately may not be of much use to pupils without a good digital connection or devices at home.Educationalists have already raised fears that this group of already disadvantaged children will suffer most because of the lockdown and CGI is keen to see how it can help reach them.ldquoMany children will not have been in school for six months which is a very long time. For youngsters thatrsquos a letime! said Green.CGI supports many organisations working with vulnerable and disadvantaged children and is working with them to reach those who do not have access to technology.The physical camps had often been targeted at the most vulnerable children in society and one of the companyrsquos last events in Glasgow was in a special educational needs school.One of the other aspects of the companyrsquos community programme is mentoring, when members go into an event in school to give older children career advice and an idea of what working le is like.ldquoTheir parents and their grandparents may not have worked and so the children may not have any idea about working le, said Green. ldquoEvents have been successful but we would normally do that in a school setting in a hall where our members can have one to one chats with pupils and that is obviously tricky to do at the moment.The company has started to record career mentoring videos to support some community groups.In the meantime there are still some new STEM from Home themes to come online before July and these will be released weekly until the end of June.Another group at the front of minds at CGI are those currently working through CGIrsquos graduate apprenticeships at Glasgow Caledonian and Edinburgh Napier Universities. ldquoWe are clear that these iniduals are key to the future of our business says Green.ldquoMark East and Maria Whittingham in our student recruitment team are working hard to ensure they have practical support whilst also thinking about the solutions for future student recruitment at this very important stage in their careers.Elsewhere, CGI, which supports The Glasgow Timesrsquo Streets Ahead initiative, continues to encourage its members to fundraise, with efforts being moved online. Members are asked to nominate regional charities for the companyrsquos charities fund whilst in recent weeks they have been at work fundraising for a foodbank to help those people hardest hit.Members also still have the opportunity to nominate local community sports teams for kit sponsorship.It is hoped this will come into its own as group physical exercise is increasingly encouraged and people get the chance to re-establish important bonds.RETRAINING WILL ENSURE NO-ONE IF LEFT BEHINDCGI has been in a better position than many companies to weather the pandemic lockdown and, as a result, is keen to help society recover post-Covid.ldquoIn February the world changed but some communities and industries are more impacted than others so it feels a bit remiss not to refocus our efforts for these areas in particular, said the companyrsquos Vice President Lindsay McGranaghan for Scotland.An important part of CGIrsquos work is its community programme and the company is now looking at how it can help communities and schools post-Covid.ldquoWe do a number of things around community benefit but we may have to rethink what we have been doing historically and tailor some of that to meet the impact of Covid, said McGranaghan.ldquoWe need to think about who is going to be most hard hit by the pandemic from an education perspective and whether we tailor our work to be more focused on the vulnerable children, as well as the industries impacted such as those where there have been quite heavy redundancies.Technology and technological skills have proved to be an immense boon during the pandemic lockdown and it is quickly becoming apparent that those who do not have access to technology, or know how to use it properly, are at a distinct disadvantage in the st century.McGranaghan feels that as a technology company, CGI is well placed to help both children and workers without these skills and could help retrain those in danger of being left behind.The company has already been working with the Wise Group in Glasgow to help retrain long term unemployed people in IT skills and is now wonderingthis could be extended to impacted industries and newly unemployed people.ldquoWe are looking at things like retraining opportunities, she said.ldquoWe have been reasonably resilient in the technology industry during Covid just because of the nature of the work we do and the question is whether we could put out a hand to dferent industries during what is going to be a dficult time ldquoWe want to look at how we can do this through our community programme.ldquoI think there is something there not only in terms of supporting the local authorities that we already work with, but also how we help with the recovery process.ldquoGiving back to the local community is very importantto us."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-hippos-lawyers-best-avoided","story":"GRUMPY chef and professional shoutyman Gordon Ramsay is bringing his TV show Hellrsquos Kitchen back to the UK.

There is a real danger that,the process of reopening areas of the economy is botched, the long-term impact of the restrictions could prove as damaging as the disease itself.It is welcome, then, that the Scottish Government should have announced its provisional intent to lt restrictions on aspects of the tourist industry from July , as long as progress has been made to phase three of the route map for exit. It is not only a crucial part of our economy, but tourism and other industries which augment or are a component of it, including the transport, hospitality, sport and cultural sectors, are those that have suffered the harshest effects during the period of containment.It is cheering, too, that a move to phase two begins next week and, of course, that the death toll and rates of infection outside hospitals and care homes have fallen signicantly.There remain, however, major doubts about the handling and timetable of both the UK and Scottish Governments in moving towards lockdown in the pandemicrsquos early stages the grim toll in Scottish care homes, which has been characterised as the greatest disaster of the devolution era, must be counted as an abject failure of government. The likelihood that the UK may be already one of the worst,not the worst, affected countries in both fatalities and economic impact, ought to be a warning of the terrible dangers of mishandling the moves towards recovery.The considerable problems not yet resolved in testing are further grounds for caution.

Itrsquos hoped that Lugi ndash The Brodgar Boy could eventually become a major cinema release, helping to spotlight Orkney and, indeed, Scotlandrsquos often overlooked Neolithic history, echoing the impact of Pixarrsquos  animation Brave, and boosting tourism across the islands. The feature- film will tell the story of a disabled boy who must unite his peoplethey are to defeat evil forces, and is expected to take viewers on an animated tour of the Orkney Islandsrsquo most precious heritage sites. The idea originated from Orcadian illustrator and cartoonist Alex Leonard who has been developing the film with Belfast-based animation company ALT Animation. It recently beat competition from almost  filmmakers in  countries to secure major development funding from Creative Europe. ALT Animation has also received support from Northern Ireland Screen. Intended as a family-friendly movie, the story will use the boy herorsquos adventures to explore some of the mysteries surrounding Orkneyrsquos most ancient monuments, such as the famous settlement of Skara Brae and the Ring Of Brodgar. The sites predate Stonehenge and the Pyramids of Egypt, prompting suggestions that the islands were the epicentre of human existence , years ago. Although strictly fiction, it will be woven around real archaeological evidence and understanding gleaned during excavation of the sites. Some early illustrations have been based on Structure Ten at the Ness, thought to be one of the largest stone-built Neolithic structures in Britain and built around BC.Measuring ft by ft, archaeologists believe it was abandoned around BC, when hundreds of cattle were slaughtered and consumed during a huge feast. Leonard, who lives in Sandwick, was inspired to create the character and dramatic backdrop to the story after visiting the Ness of Brodgar settlement in  and being astounded by its size and history. ldquoI couldnrsquot really grasp fully the scale of what they are finding in terms of the number of buildings and the size of them. I was captivated and couldnrsquot understand why more people didnrsquot know about it, he said. ldquoI kept wondering what it looked like when Ness was in its prime. I went home and started to draw and sketch ideas. ldquoIt was a labour of love that at first I thought could make a little kidsrsquo book.The idea attracted the attention of Tim Bryans, writer and producer from Belfast-based ALT Animation, which has now secured interest from a number of award-winning studios around Europe keen to work collectively on the project.Leonard said the focus is now oncreating a screenplay and a trailer that showcases the story, and looking for a partner to take the film to full production. ldquoWe would love to think that it would eventually go on general release, added Leonard. ldquoWe donrsquot know who will come on board and donrsquot know yetit will be computer generation, D, an arthouse project or have much wider appeal. We are just happy for it to have found its feet.ldquoOur inspiration is Pixarrsquos Brave which did so well for tourism in Scotland.Brave, which told the story of an adventurous princess and featured the voice of Billy Connolly and Kelly Macdonald, was a global hit and resulted in tourism agency VisitScotland spending pound million on the joint marketing campaign with Disney. The associated television campaign was said to have reached around  million people in the UK, North America and Europe, while written material reached  million people worldwide.The film was estimated to have generated more than poundm in business for Scotland over  years.

Edinburgh City Council is to consider a plan to rededicate the statue to those who continued to suffer enslavement during this period.Across the world other statues have been targeted in the wake of international protests about the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis two weeks ago. In Bristol last Sunday, a statue of the th-century slave trader, Edward Colston, was felled by protesters and flung into the harbour.Devine insisted that focusing merely on statues and other artefacts from the past was misplaced. ldquoIf people want to talk about Scottish involvement in slavery they need to be aware of the full picture. In the th and early-th centuries the Scottish nation as a whole was lsquocomplicitrsquo in slavery. The markets and financial s from lsquothe nefarious businessrsquo helped to lay the foundation for modern Scotland and shaped the economy from which we now benefit.In , Devine edited a collection of essays about Scotlandrsquos historic involvement in the slave plantations. Recovering Scotlandrsquos Slavery Past demonstrated how all levels of Scottish society, from the early-th century to the end of slavery in the British Empire, were directly or indirectly affected.:Without slavery Glasgow wouldnt exist: The brutal truth about Scotlands slaving pastldquoThe new research showed that merely concentrating on prominent mercantile figures fails to take account of the fact that Scottish society as a whole benefited from chattel slavery: weavers of lsquoslave clothrsquo for the West Indies fishermen who exported dried fish to feed the slaves workers in the mills who processed the raw cotton harvested by slave labour the crews of the vessels who sailed across the Atlantic and the officials, lawyers and clergymen who administered the slave colonies and the spiritual needs of their owners.ldquoOnly by acknowledging the full extent of this nationrsquos role in slavery can we begin to construct a meaningful programme of response today to that dark period of history.lsquorsquoI am convinced that the evidence we now have suggests Scottish modernisation was even more dependent on the slavery factor than England. This was not because of involvement in the slave trade itself. Ships from Scottish ports rarely took part in that horrible commerce in human beings after . Rather it was based on the overwhelming place of tobacco, sugar and then cotton in Scottish external trade. The remarkable boom in these commodities depended entirely on armies of black slave labourers.In , Glasgow University published a report, based on more than two years of research, that revealed it benefited directly from the slave trade in Africa and the Caribbean in the th and th centuries. Its audit put the figure at pound million in todayrsquos money. Following this the university launched a wide-ranging ldquoreparative justice programme to include the creation of a centre for the study of slavery and to establish ties with the University of the West Indies.The study also raised questions about how the wealth of Glasgow and other parts of Scotland was accumulated. Devine praised the universityrsquos research and openness. ldquoThe research confirms that manmore Scots gained from the colonial trades based on slave labour than the tobacco lords and sugar princes who are now attracting such virulent media and political condemnation, he said.:Hundreds turn out lsquoto protectrsquo Glasgow war memorialldquoTherefore, it follows that today there must be institutions and families with links to those times and who prospered from the profits of chattel slavery. But so far, in Scotland, only the University of Glasgow has admitted how it benefited and how it intends to proceed by way of some form of recompense to the people of the West Indies. Why are others silent ldquoOne positive consequence of the current furore has been the triggering of a deeper awareness of the inequalities that black people in Britain and the US continue to encounter to this day and which have undeniable connections to slavery. ldquoYet in order to begin to heal that wound in Scotland, a soundly-based and open knowledge of the nationrsquos central part in slave history is an essential precondition."},{"url":null,"title":"jatin-haria-assume-infected-racism---vaccine-available","story":"The Parliamentrsquos official position now includes the statement ldquothat there is a responsibility on us all to identy and dismantle barriers of structural racism that exist in our society and institutions.It might not seem it, but itrsquos a huge milestone for Scotland.Until recentlythe general line was that Scotland was exceptional, and ldquoitrsquos not all bad here.Wersquore really all Jock Tamsonrsquos bairns, we donrsquot have a class system, we only played a bit part in the Empire, we were ardent abolitionists, ordinary Scots didnrsquot see a single shilling of the money earned from the backsof enslaved Africans, we awarded Nelson Mandela the freedom of the city, we welcome immigrants.Exceptional, exceptional, exceptional.One or two of these points are indeed true.

And never forget that it was Scottish emigrants who set up the Ku Klux Klan.Closer to home, the Scottish Government can state that ldquoScotland has a wonderfully erse society and we are all, each and every one of us, equal citizens and stakeholders of Scotland.At the same time, a charge of racial hate crime is levied against someone on average every three hours, every single day,  days every year. It comes as no surprise then that a third of all black minority ethnic people in Scotland report having experienced discrimination in the past two years.BME people are twice as likely to live in poverty as their white counterparts and, not coincidentally, inequality and discrimination persist in the labour market.Research shows someone with a non-British sounding name has to send nine times more applications in order to receive an interview. Public bodies try to get around this using ldquoname blind application processes, yet the Scottish Governmentrsquos own workforce data shows ethnic disparities of Ben Nevis proportions.Even more worrying was the data showing that between  and ,  murders with a known or suspected racist element were recorded, with many having littleany media interest.All too often these were seen as ldquoone-off incidents rather than any broader reflection on Scottish society. Yet during this period, these  cases gave Scotland a higher per-capita rate of murder associated with racism than England or Wales.In the last Social Attitudes Survey to look at discrimination, % of people in Scotland felt that there was sometimes a good reason to be prejudiced against certain groups.Thatrsquos more than one in every five of us.

We knew wersquod got into oil but we didnrsquot quite realise how big it was.But while BP had pinpointed the UKrsquos largest oilfield ndash quickly followed by Shellrsquos Brent ndash it would be Denver-based Hamilton Brothers, working on Argyll, km southeast of Aberdeen, that would win the race to bring oil ashore.Using a floating, semi-submersible drilling rig, the Transworld , modied to operate as a production , oil was pumped onto the ,-ton tanker Theogennitor.Within a week, on June , , the then energy minister Tony Benn was on board a hydrofoil at Tower Pier in London, heading down river to BPrsquos Isle of Grain refinery in the Medway Estuary to greet the tanker and its valuable cargo.ldquoI hold the future of Britain in my hand, he declared, clutching a bottle of the tankerrsquos crude oil aloft, adding that Britain was set to be one of the worldrsquos  great oil-producing nations.Before long, BP would be bringing its own oil ashore.In November , the Queen pressed a gold button to mark the opening of a pipeline at Cruden Bay which could whisk up to , barrels of BP oil on a -mile journey to the refinery at Grangemouth.Soon the black river was in full flow. By , Forties fieldrsquos four pound million BP rigs had produced . million tons of oil andhelped ensure Britain was no longer at the mercy of Opec oil prices.Within a decade, . million barrels of oil per day were being extracted from  North Sea fields across more than  installations.As more companies raced to take out leases to extract oil, terminals were built in Orkney and Shetland. Sullom Voe alone brought work for  people while Aberdeen shted attention from fishing to became Europersquos Klondike.Family businesses built on cod and herring switched to oil. The most successful, run by Sir Ian Wood, would become a multinational oil services company helping him towards an estimated net worth today of . billion.Aberdeen, meanwhile, boomed and losses felt by drting tourism and cod wars were offset by rich oilmen with very deep pockets.All of which couldnrsquot have come at a better time, as traditional industries across the UK collapsed, coal mines and shipyards closed, and car production ground to a halt.By the mid-s, the North Sea was providing % of the Treasuryrsquos revenues, enabling Conservative government tax cuts, covering the costs of unemployment, and paying off a historic balance of payments problem.And it provided a cushion for Margaret Thatcher to carry out sweeping industrial reforms while funding a consumer boom when, some argue, the income should instead have been invested in a Norwegian-style oil fund.While the SNP continued to declare it was Scotlandrsquos oil, the North Sea was, according to Tony Blair in , ldquoutterly essential to Mrs Thatcherrsquos electoral success.Few working offshore would have complained too much. Their  days on, five days off routine brought extremely good pay: the average salary within the oil and gas sector in  was pound, a year.But there was also constant danger. In the early days, workers were transported in helicopters without wearing harnesses, puffing on fags as they went. If weather grounded flights, some would be ferried from boats to rigs, clinging on to ropes high above crashing waves.Concerns that safety was not a high priority seemed validated in  by the Piper Alpha disaster which claimed the lives of  men and prompted improved health and safety measures. Helicopter crashes also brought tragedy to the sector.But still the black gold flowed. By the early s, the Forties field alone had delivered over two billion barrels of oil, while oil gushed from the North Sea at the equivalent of . million barrels every day, supporting , jobs across the UK.No-one can really know what would have happenedwe hadnrsquot found oil on our doorstep whether we would have been forced to innovate and find new, cleaner methods of providing energy earlier, embraced windfarms and electric vehicles sooner, or limped into economic catastrophe.However, itrsquos clear that a sector that is worth around poundbn to the economy, which supports around , jobs across the UK ndash % of them in Scotland ndash and has paid poundbn in production tax since the s, is changing.Ross Dornan, OGUKrsquos market intelligence manager, said: ldquoThe opening of the UKrsquos first oil pipeline serving the iconic Forties field was a major milestone in our industryrsquos history and a testament to the importance of North Sea oil to the UK economy which remains the case today.ldquoThe industry has gone on to make a hugely positive impact across the UK ndash producing more than  billion barrels of oil and gas, contributing hundreds of billions of pounds to the UK economy and supporting hundreds of thousands of high value jobs.ldquoToday, although the industry is facing some of its most dficult challenges, there is still signicant potential to be realised from the UK Continental Shelf.ldquoOur focus is on driving the recovery of our industry so we can make the most of future opportunities including our contribution to delivering energy security and playing a key role in the transition to a low carbon economy."},{"url":null,"title":"shops-call-re-opening-date-announced","story":"The Scottish Retail Consortium wants a provisional reopening date so shops can prepare to open their doors to customers again.Non-essential shops have been shut since lockdown began on March  and many are facing a battle to survive the longer their doors remain closed.In England, clothes stores and bookshops are starting to open again from tomorrow but there is no date yet when this might happen in Scotland.Ewan MacDonald-Russell of the Scottish Retail Consortium said: ldquoWe really need an indicative timetable so we can put the right measures in place so wersquore ready to trade and customers can have a bit of confidence when they can come back to shops and get the products wersquore all hoping theyrsquoll want to buy.The Scottish Government has produced a route map out of lockdown with dferent measures occurring at dferent stages but no dates are attached to the phases.A spokesman said: ldquoWe have a review point on Thursday at which time we will consider further, safe progression through the route map.ldquoOur total package for businesses during this unprecedented economic crisis now exceeds pound. billion.

Yoursquod scarcely know that there has been any lting of lockdown. One neighbour says her grandmother scoffs at the idea that the coronavirus crisis is like the last war, when she was a child in a nearby town. Although they were often hungry, they had complete freedom. Even when the air raid siren went, and they had to e into shelters, they did not feel the all-pervasive threat of today.Nor, unless they were extremely remote or unlucky, were people shut off from each other. We talk a lot about the power of modern technology to keep us connected, but in those times, whether you were in a village or a city, there was daily contact with other folk, evenyou lived alone. People wouldnrsquot have felt the need for video calls when they could nip out of theirdoor and visit whoever they liked nearby. The Blitz spirit is not entirely a myth, but the circumstances in which it thrived were very dferent from this pandemic.My mother lived in London and, in , like countless city children, was evacuated to the country. She was luckier than many, being sent not to strangers but to an aunt, who lived in Herefordshire, near the Welsh border. There was no running water, light was by paraffin lamp, her uncle was an irascible war veteran, and her aunt would often retreat to bed for days, finding the extra responsibility rather too much. But for an -year-old, collecting eggs from under hens, sauntering up the lane for still-warm jugs of milk from the farm, and seeing a night-time sky lit by stars was a revelation. From then on, she counted the days until she could leave London forever.Not all evacuees felt the same way. Encountering beetles and bugs for the first time was hard enough, but herds of cows with a bull among them must have been pretty alarming. One boy, who had never previously left the Gallowgate, ran to tell the farmer that ldquothey coos are eating arsquo your grass. Another Glaswegian, taken into a Perthshire home, escaped onto the roof when they ran him a bath. He thought they were trying to drown him.Recalling that period, my mother spoke of country folksrsquo shock at the poverty of inner city children, who had come from slums. Those who organised the mass evacuation were appalled to discover that, when asked to provide each child with a change of clothing, a toothbrush and enough food for a dayrsquos journey, a lot of families were unable to do so. It was a sobering eye-opener. Rural hardship was re, but it did not compare to the scale of urban deprivation: barefoot youngsters with rickets, scurvy, ringworm, or so underfed they were the colour of lard.Itrsquos hard to imagine what it must have felt like to be dropped into a world of fields and trees and pitch black nights, when you were used to well-lit canyons of concrete and stone or to find yourself alone in a bed, when usually therersquod be siblings on all sides, keeping you warm, and your parents only a step away. Some children were so miserable, they had to be sent home. For others, like my mother, it sparked a lelong love of the countryside.Not that she idealised her auntrsquos way of le. Some aspects of it were, for a Londoner, like stepping back in time. Nor, in the s, was there any glamorising of country le. It was often equated with backward attitudes and ignorance. If anything, most villagers dreamed of escaping to the city, or at least the suburbs, and a clean, warm house with all mod-cons.Irsquove been reading Dirk Bogardersquos memoir, Great Meadow, in which he recalls his childhood in the Sussex Downs, from the age of six. Between  and , he spent weekends and long spells of holiday in what his affluent parents called a cottage, but photos show as a substantial house. Later he was packed off to Glasgow, which he loathed, but thatrsquos another story. In Great Meadow, he and his little sister were looked after by a nanny, while his actress mother swanned around in a kimono, and his father raced up and down to London where he was on The Timesrsquos picture desk. Bogarde often mentions the healthiness of the country, compared to London, where public transport was frowned on, because of the risk of germs. This was a legacy, perhaps, of the Spanish flu.Bogarde loved everything about the cottage, but the most noteworthy feature was the outside lavatory. Every Friday he had to dig a hole in the garden and, under cover of dusk, empty the privy bucket into it. His great fear was of tripping, because sanitation was basic. Theyrsquod have a weekly bath, filled by their nanny, but his parents preferred going to the nearest pub for their ablutions.Years ago I visited friends in rural Perthshire who had an outside toilet. I rather liked it: it was made of wood, and smelled of sawdust. Unlike the shed at the bottom of many cottage gardens, one wall was open, so the view was lovely, even in the snow. You didnrsquot have to crunch over snails in the dark to reach it ndash bedrooms came with chamberpots ndash and as a guest there was no fear of ever being asked to empty it. To watch him on screen, yoursquod never think Bogarde was the man to cope with such a noisome task.

The outbreak has devastated the economy with unemployment rising by over  million in a matter of weeks.Add to this the growing racial turmoil, civil unrest and an incumbent authoritarian president willing to deploy whatever nefarious means necessary to avoid electoral defeat, and all the components exist for a US election facing unparalleled risks to its conduct and integrity.:Rayshard Brooks: Atlanta police officer sacked after fatal shooting of black manHow telling it is about the mood in America right now that just a few days ago, Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, warned that he could foresee a scenario whereby the military would intervene should President Donald Trump refuse to relinquish power following a defeat in Novemberrsquos election.ldquoI am absolutely convinced they will escort him from the White House with great dispatch, Biden warned, speaking on the US talk-news programme The Daily Show, adding that his single greatest concern is that the president will ldquotry to steal this election.How telling it is too of the prevailing polarised political mood that Trump has decided to hold his first re-election campaign rally for several months on the date that African-Americans celebrate the end of slavery.Just as that date, June , traditionally known as ldquoJuneteenth is especially signicant, so too is Trumprsquos choice of the city ndash Tulsa in Oklahoma. For it was there, in May and June , that a white mob attacked the prosperous black neighbourhood of Greenwood, known as the ldquoBlack Wall Street, with guns and explosives, killing up to  people and destroying about , businesses and homes.Unsurprisingly, given recent protests against racist violence in the country triggered by the police killing of George Floyd, Trumprsquos move is recognised by many Americans as being the provocation it undoubtedly is.ldquoThis isnrsquot just a wink to white supremacists ndash hersquos throwing them a welcome party, tweeted former Democratic presidential candidate senator Kamala Harris of Calornia in response to the rally.Two of Americarsquos leading newspapers echoed Harrisrsquos reaction, with both The New York Times and The Washington Post calling Trumprsquos decision ldquoracially motivated trolling and timing akin to ldquoblasphemy.If recent opinion polls are anything to go by then many more ordinary Americans too appear exasperated and angry over the presidentrsquos recent conduct. As Trumprsquos campaign team are well aware the latest polling figures are not good.According to the polling data aggregator RealClearPolitics , Trumprsquos job approval rating is down now to %, as low as itrsquos been since last year. And matched against Biden, Trump trails by an average of eight points.In the case of one poll in the aggregator, Gallup, his support was down a staggering  points to % over the last month with Biden leading him by an average of  points among registered voters nationally.In the key battleground states itrsquos the same story, with the RCP average showing Biden tied with Trump in North Carolina, up by three points in Wisconsin, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Arizona, and up by seven in Michigan.Even Georgia appears to be a dead heat. Last weekrsquos primary election chaos there, hampered by ballot shortages and mechanical mals that saw voters waiting for hours in largely minority areas, also served as warning for the perils states face come November. Itrsquos precisely that kind of chaos that Trumprsquos campaign will doubtless use to its advantage.Right now, however, it is only in Texas that Trump has a very narrow lead, a state that has not voted for a Democrat since Jimmy Carter won the White House in . Inidual polls also provide little comfort to the president, showing that Biden has signicantly bigger swing state margins.Even traditional on-message Republican pundits see the writing on the wall, while doing their best to sweeten what is a very bitter polling pill.ldquoItrsquos not that Joe Biden is doing great. He isnrsquot ndash itrsquos that swing voters have been watching and listening to the president, and a lot of them donrsquot like what theyrsquore hearing, insisted Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, speaking to the Financial Times last week.:Donald Trump tweets bizarre edited clip of himself giving Independence Day speechThat Trump is unhappy with current polls goes without saying, but especially so when it comes to the result of one conducted by CNN, the media broadcaster he has long despised.CNNrsquos results showed the president trailing Biden by a scarcely believable  points. It so incensed Trump that he ordered his campaign team to fire off a near farcical cease-and-desist letter to the broadcaster demanding that it retract and apologise for the poll.Itrsquos all a far cry from earlier this year when Trump was riding higher on a strong economy and soaring stock market following his impeachment trial acquittal.ldquoThis is what can happen when one is in the bunker, Doug Heye, a Republican strategist told the Financial Times, adding that it was a ldquoclassic example of staff impressing a boss by ldquofighting for him despite no chance of success.While the polls now suggest the president is in a perilous position, Donald Trump, of course, is no stranger to political crisis, and he did famously win the  election in the face of it.Certainly,the election were to be held tomorrow, Trump would most likely not survive. But itrsquos not being held tomorrow. November  is still five months away, and  has been nothingnot a complete political roller-coaster in the US so far, with who knows what political surprises potentially still in the offing.Polls, as we all know, are only snapshots of current moods and trends, and not predictions of election results. Despite everything seemingly railed against him, events may somehow benefit Trump. It could be that his handling of the next five months wins people back and even some over to his side, or that the disproportionate Electoral College and voter suppression, or some combination of the two, puts him back in the White House for four more years.If Trump is good at one thing, itrsquos turning a situation on its head to his advantage. The country might be in chaos ndash in great part of Trumprsquos own making ndash but the president will undoubtedly harness this. The obvious place for him to start is by using the recent violence and unrest to campaign on a law-and-order ticket.Exploring the current situation in an article for Al Jazeera last week, the American journalist Scott Norvell highlighted a historical parallel from  when Republican Richard Nixon summoned his ldquosilent majority to the polls and ended up winning the US presidency, despite being challenged from the right by segregationist George Wallace.As Norvell pointed out, academic research published in the aftermath of the  election ldquofound convincing evidence that the widespread violent unrest that year ndash arguably the most tumultuous year of the past five decades before  came along ndash steered US voters into the Republican camp and tipped the election in Nixonrsquos favour.Other America watchers, including the Economist last week, have also made the case that history suggests ldquoRepublicans benefit from street violence, whereas Democrats gain from peaceful protests.But in the wake of the latest protests a Washington Post-Schar School poll has also provided evidence suggesting the contrary, with most US voters supporting the protests and believing the police are in need of reform.Such findings, of course, will not stop Trump in his struggle to regain the campaigning initiative, by reverting to the ldquolaw and order line he used in  and the  midterm elections.This time, however, instead of exaggerated dire warnings about Mexican ldquorapists and migrant ldquocaravans he is rallying his core supporters. some of whom are from the far right, using largely baseless claims about violent, anti-fascist protesters destroying America. That much was evident in a tweet he made last week saying that ldquothese ugly Anarchists must be stooped .Given Trumprsquos record of ignoring or dismissing the restraints built into the American political system, there are a number of options at his disposal should he decide to upend the election. He could, for example, declare a national emergency on the grounds of national security.He has, after all, more than  statutory emergency powers in his political arsenal, according to the law and public policy institute the Brennan Centre for Justice in New York. In practice, there are few restrictions in place to prevent him using them.Speaking to Vanity Fair magazine this month, Cornell Belcher, a strategist and pollster on both of Obamarsquos successful White House runs, warned of the role fear could play in helping Trump with his election campaign over the next five months.ldquoThere is perhaps nothing as powerful, historically, in American politics as fear, Belcher said.ldquoClearly Trump is trying to make Middle American white people terried of the black and brown hordes. If hersquos winning , % of the white vote he can pull the exact same inside straight as he did in , Belcher added, before positing the crucial question.ldquoWill Americans be more fearful of these young people in the streets demanding justice, or of four more years of Donald Trump Should the latter prove to be the case, then the biggest concern of many political observers is that the battle iding America might still not be over as far as the president is concerned.\"Herersquos the real DangerDonald Trump loses the  election\", ran the headline of an article on the CNN website last Thursday. Picking up on Trumprsquos long history of refusing to ever acknowledge defeat, and instead claiming he was cheated out of victory by shadowy forces, the writer presented an alarming but perfectly plausible scenario.ldquoWhat the lack of any sort of formal concession from Trump would do is clear: for his legions of adoring supporters, they would also never believe that Biden had won ndash or that he was the recognised president, whether or not the electoral map or the popular vote proved it,\" observed the author Chris Cillizza, CNNrsquos editor-at large.As Cillizza explained further, the implications of this are obvious, meaning that for many Americans, Biden would be viewed as an illegitimate president and, therefore, not someone who needed to be listened to.ldquoThe result isnrsquot hard to imagine: an even deeper ide within the country between the Trumpists and everyone . A ide that would make Bidenrsquos pledge to create One America again an absolute pipe dream, Cillizza concluded.As America undergoes this traumatic period of soul searching, Trump is now facing multiple crises that cannot be solved by a single tweet. This will not stop him trying, of course, just as negative poll results will not deter him from pulling out all the stops in seeking another term in office.As he turns  today, any number of things could change Donald Trumprsquos political fortunes in the next five months before the election. Who knows, perhaps the US economy will make a leap forward or he can ride on the back of America creating a vaccine for Covid- More likely, though,he wins it will be because of his usual disregard for political norms and a willingness to sacrice the great good of the United States for his own opportunist benefit.Then again, perhaps the ongoing national trauma has at last finally done enough to show Americans the true face of Trump.He will not go easilyat all. The only certain thing now is that a perfect storm is coming in the shape of Novemberrsquos election."},{"url":null,"title":"spotlight-strange-colourful-life-scotsman-invented-paper-money","story":"John Law wasnrsquot just a man of ideas, flawed as his principal one turned out to be in practice. He was also a gambler, a playboy, a killer and a flamboyant and utterly credible serial chancer.He was born in  into a wealthy family of bankers and goldsmiths. His father William had bought Lauriston Castle, an estate at Cramond on the Firth of Forth. Young Law studied at the High School of Edinburgh and at the age of  went into the familyrsquos banking business.When he was , Law Senior died and he inherited the family estate and wealth but instead of settling down to be Law of Lauriston, the family title, he upped for London where he managed to gamble away not just the family silver but the bricks and mortar, mortgaging the estate to pay his debts..However, the losses at the tables, coupled with his quick and analytical mind, had introduced him to the science of probability, mentally calculating the odds of a card turning up based on what he had memorised in the previous hands.In , when he was , a flirtation with young Elizabeth Villiers, later to become Countess of Orkney, inflamed a rival for her hand, Edward \"Beau\" Wilson, who challenged him to a duel. Law killed Wilson with a single pass of his sword.He was arrested, charged with murder, sentenced to death at the Old Bailey but managed to escape to Europe and, again, the gambling tables.Just how he did it isnrsquot clear, but Law managed to make enemies of the sherfs of Venice, Genoa and Paris, and was expelled from each of them. But before he was thrown out of the French capital he had made friends with a young royal, the Duke of Orleans, who would become the key to his future ndash and demise.Law, obsessed with mathematics and monetary theory, had written a series of books and pamphlets, and in  had ed to Scotland and published his book, Money And Trade Considered. His proposal for establishing a national bank was vetoed by the Scottish Parliament which, two years later, voted itself out of office with the Act of Union. Law, again at risk of arrest for his killing of Wilson, fled once more to Europe.He spent the next decade in France and the Netherlands making himself rich with a series of dodgy financial schemes. In , Louis XIV, the \"Sun King\", died leaving the country on the cusp of bankruptcy. The Duke of Orleans became regent and took over the reins of government, summoning his old friend Law to Paris to sort the economy.Law convinced him that trading in coinage was restrictive and that a paper currency would stimulate trade and boost employment. The regent allowed him to mount a small-scale test. He and his brother established the Banque General, issuing bank notes, rather than coins. Lawrsquos currency became sought after and was soon trading at % over face value. The bank opened branches across France and it, and the use of paper money boomed, trade and employment picked up, and the duke was convinced.The young manrsquos influence was not to stop there and he proposed a far more ambitious scheme. France then owned the Mississippi River territories ndash the present-day states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota ndash and he convinced the regent to allow him to set up a company which had a monopoly on trade there. The Compagnie du Mississippi was born.The duke also appointed him controller general of ginance, the second most powerful man in the country, and by  he had merged all of the French trading companies ndash from tobacco farms, the mint, even the national debt ndash into the massive conglomerate which was the Mississippi company.Law issued shares in the company which were over-subscribed. The share price flew, leading to one of the wildest speculative manias in history. Fortunes were made overnight, millions in a day. People from all classes rushed to the small street where Law lived, Rue Quincampoix, bidding for shares.Lawrsquos paper money scheme had, it seemed, overturned the normal economic rules.In June,  years ago almost to the day, Sir Isaac Newton, who knew much about gravity,not the rise and fall of stocks, ed to his Westminster townhouse and wrote in his diary about a meeting he had had that day at the Mint with two men who had persuaded him to invest in the South Sea Company. That company had been formed in  by an act of parliament to conduct all of Englandrsquos trade with Spanish colonies in the West Indies and South America, although there was little trade and even less profit.Newton had been an early investor but had sold out at a substantial profit. But now there was a far more adventurous scheme, one which would challenge the traditional enemies, the French and Lawrsquos Mississippi Company, by privatising all pound million of Englandrsquos debt into the South Sea Company, infor which the government was to receive a pound.m cash sum.The company was involved in the slave trade with the Spanish colonies and in whaling but was, in fact, just an elaborate and early Ponzi scheme. In order to pay the pound.m to the government the company needed to find the cash, which it did, issuing more and more new stock at higher and higher prices, meanwhile bribing friends and allies to buy shares, even providing them with loans to do so. The historian John Carswell likened the process to a financial pump, ldquoeach spurt of stock being accompanied by a draught of cash to suck it up again, leaving the level higher than before. The price of stock went up from pound to pound, in a year. There was a frenzy to invest.In France, however, the idea which inspired the South Sea bubble, the Mississippi company, was in trouble. What Law hadnrsquot calculated was the effect that the issuing of millions of shares would have on the money supply and on inflation. Prices were rising by over % a month. The public was also twigging that the Mississippi delta wasnrsquot a Garden of Eden, rather a mosquito-plagued swamp.There was a run on the shares, the banks and paper money. There were riots on the streets of Paris with people crushed to death in the rush to withdraw what coins there were from the banks.In England the South Sea shares were also collapsing, triggering bankruptcies in companies and people who had bought on credit. Banks and goldsmiths went under as they could not collect loans made on the stock, and thousands of iniduals were ruined, including many members of the aristocracy.An inquiry was set up in England which reported in , revealing widespread fraud in government.

Exams were also cancelled for the first time ever.The Scottish Government has announced plans to reopen schools on August  with a \"blended\" learning model, which will see pupils spend up to half of their time learning from home.Union leaders have warned this model could last the entire school year.Mr Swinney said it will be a legal requirement for parents to send their children to school, regardless of anxiety about the virus, but the homeschooling portion of the curriculum will not be legally enforced.He told the BBCs Sunday Politics Scotland: \"I dont want it to go on for a minute longer than its necessary, because I accept that the blended learning model is not as good a model as the one that we had before coronavirus had the effect that it had, resulting in lockdown.\"But he said it was \"unlikely\" things wouldto normal before the end of the school year, adding: \"Well have to maintain the social distancing approaches for some considerable time to come.\"There will be changes and dferences in the way we deliver education as a consequence of the requirements of physical distancing.\"There will be, on an ongoing basis, factors that we have to bear in mind in how schools operate but, obviously, the more we can try to expand the capacity and the involvement of young people in their education in face-to-face schooling, well be taking those opportunities when it is safe to do so.\"Mr Swinney said it is possible exams could start later in the year to give pupils more learning time.However they would need to take place early enough to fit in with university and college timetables.Ms Sturgeon was later asked about the issue during her daily coronavirus update.The First Minister said: \"We continue to be cautious in our assessments, because to do anything other than that risks giving people a misleading picture of what the future might look like.\"She added: \"We are being cautious now about theof time that some kind of blended model may be required for.\"But on the other hand, we shouldnt get to a point where we are accepting now that for a certain period of time schooling will not be normal.\"I want to get young people not just back to school, but back to normal schooling as quickly as it is deemed safe to do that, so we will be working hard to do that.\"And I hope it is the case that over the next academic year we do see schools ing to normal, but it is not possible right now for us, at this vantage point, to give dates and say that with certainty.\"Askedparents should prepare for part-time home learning to continue until potentially next summer, Ms Sturgeon said ministers are trying to be as open with people as they can.She said: \"Part of that involves just being open about the uncertainties.\"What John [Swinney] was doing earlier on is what Ive done today, which is to say we have to be frank with people that we dont yet have complete certainty over what the next few months will look like, so we cant rule out some continued change to the model of education that young people will be following, at this stage, over the course of the next academic year.\"Ms Sturgeon said ministers want schools toto normal as quickly as possible.She added: \"These are all really dficult issues to be absolutely certain about right now, which is why sometimes, I suppose, we err on the side of the worst case scenario.\"Were doing everything we can right now to avoid having a second wave of this virus come the autumn [and] winter, but none of us can rule that out right now.\"The First Minister signalled more money could be made available to councils to help schools cope with social distancing measures.She said: \"Local authorities are making plans and putting plans in place for the blended model of learning we will see from August  onwards.\"The Scottish Government will then look at that and we will make judgments around what additional support is going to be necessary.\"Earlier, Mr Swinney said he was supportive of local authorities seeking to use public buildings to hold classes, such as town halls and libraries, as well as hiring more teachers to increase the number of classes and reduce the size of the cohorts, and was willing to enter talks with councils on funding needs.He said: \"What Ive said to local authorities is come forward with those proposals and well look at those proposals.\"Councils are beginning to set out the approaches that theyre taking, they will be considered and assessed by Her Majestys Inspectorate of Education and will be tested to see whether or not these ideas can be utilised.\"A total of , patients have now died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, up by one from , on Saturday.Statistics show that , people have tested positive

Big name retailers moved in and, as time wore on, the ldquoto let signs began to appear.Now, however, that same community spirit that raised pound.s d from local people to pay for their th century fountain is helping to revive Dumfries High Street, in a project that, it is hoped, will provide inspiration forother towns up and down the country.Rather than wait for someone  to step in to breathe new le into the empty shops and buildings, local people are pushing ahead with plans to take back control of their neglected high street.Work is expected to start within weeks on the first High Street building to be reclaimed from lying empty.While its Victorian frontage with all its unique character will remain in place, a pound. million redevelopment will see the former Bakerrsquos Oven shop reborn as seven new affordable rent flats, with space for start-up businesses, art exhibitions and socialand community enterprise projects.Named ldquoThe Oven, it is one of eight retail units included in community-run Midsteeple Quarterrsquos innovative plans to rejuvenate the heart of the town as a place to live, visit, shop, dine and be entertained.The innovative project is being eyed up by towns and organisations across theUK, anxious to seeits community buy-out model might be a viable option to help transform other places hit by a sht towards internet shopping and out of town retail parks.ldquoFor a long time the town centre was bookies, charity shops and empty units. Dumfries has just said lsquoenough is enoughrsquo, says Evie Copland, chairwoman of the community benefit society, Dumfries High Street Ltd, which is behind the Midsteeple Quarter project.ldquoPeople had been buying buildings in the High Street for too long and not givingus something we could be proud of.ldquoAs people began to use their collective voices, we have been able to get a special development off the ground.ldquoThe Oven is the flagship, and a blueprint to showwhat the people of Dumfries can do.The plans have been brewing since  when the townrsquos artist-led development trust, The Stove Network, carried out research to find out what the future of High Street might be and to ask local people what they wanted.ldquoThere were a number of issues, says Scott Mackay, manager of The Midsteeple Quarter.ldquoOne was ownership of High Street buildings. We discovereda lot are owned by absentee landlords who lived where, people notwith a vested interest in the town.ldquoFunds and investment companies had been buying up the buildings and renting out ground floors to national retail chains. Sometimes these buildings have two more floors, but they just lie empty.ldquoIt is the same at high streets up and down the country ndash every one had the same shops and streets had lost their local character.ldquoAs high streets contracted, there was out of town retail and internet shopping, so a lot of shop units were lying empty and the values of buildings dropped.With buildings which once carried a poundm price tag now valued at around half that, and vacant units with sky-high rents but no sign of new occupants, hopes grew that the townspeople could use community buy-out legislation to help them take over empty properties.Inspired by rural land community buy-outs in places such as Eigg, Assynt and Gigha, and driven by the townrsquos creative and artistic community, the Dumfries plan was designed to be Scotlandrsquos first ldquourban buy-out.Within weeks of its launch and a mock high street protest aimed at highlighting empty shops, the community benefit company had attracted hundreds ofpound shareholders eager tohave their say in forging a new-look town centre.Their plans were boosted two years ago, when Dumfries  Galloway Council agreed to hand over the former Bakersrsquo Oven building in an asset transfer deal that cost the group just pound.Itrsquos meant the group has not yet had to draw on community ownership legislation, while funds for The Ovenrsquos redevelopment have come from a iety of sources including the Regeneration Capital Grant Fund which is delivered in partnership between the Scottish Government and COSLA, and South Scotland Enterprise Fund.Planning approval forThe Oven is expected next month. Demolition work to the rear will begin later this year, with hopes it will be finished within  months.The organisation is also in the process of raising funds to buy two other units and has approached the owners of two others.Mr Mackay said the intention is to create a vibrant blend of retail, affordable housing, exhibition and arts space, with entertainment and food and drink outlets helping to transform the area into a bustling hub.ldquoAn obstacle for high streets for a long time has been a lsquoretail onlyrsquo or lsquoretail firstrsquo planning requirement, he added. ldquoIt meant that by pm everything in the High Street would be dead.

Unsurprisingly, as time passes so businesses from across the region are increasingly seeking clarity on a wide range of issues vital to their survival.With Phase  of the unlocking process due shortly, the FSB believes that this is the perfect time for smaller businesses to question Mr Ewing on what the Scottish Government is doing to support businesses over the next year.The FSB’s Highlands  Islands Area Leader and director of the Kylesku Hotel, Tanja Lister, said: “We know how anxious businesses are becoming about their abilities to survive in this new world and, given that the virus is unpredictable, they clearly want as much clarity as possible so that they can plan their survival strategies once unlocking takes place.“In particular, they want to know when and how unlocking will take place, what they must do to comply with distancing protocols, how local communities will be persuaded that the time is right to unlock, and the nature of the Government-backed business support that will be put in place to carry the regional economy though to next Easter and beyond.“Nobody should think that businesses can go from nought to  in a few days – it will take a long time for them to recover, and many will need ongoing support from governments, public agencies, other businesses and, very importantly, the general public, for many months to come.“We know how heavily engaged Mr Ewing is in his vital role and we are delighted that he is giving up his time to take questions on Monday. This is the perfect time for him to meet Highlands  Islands businesses and we are looking forward to a very productive hour with him.”Questions must be submitted in advance and we will ask as many as we can in the allotted time, say the organisers.

Hundreds were accused after the Horizon system showed cash shortfalls at their branches.Speaking in the House, Mr Carmichael said: “I hope that when he s to the department today he will tell his officials and tell also the Post Office senior management that this review just isn’t going to cut it.#This is a complex case and that is why it requires a judge-led inquiry, and that is what will happen eventually, so why not just cut to the quick and do it now ”Responding for the Government, Paul Scully MP said: “The point is the terms of reference within this review are the same as a judge-led inquiry.#I do not want an inquiry that lasts  years and that sub-postmasters are going to come back time and time again with no justice. This is something that I have been pushing on from the moment that I found out the detail about it, and that is why I am going to drive this through to make sure that the answers are heard and that independent chair gets to the bottom of this and gets some answers.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said: “The minister’s response was inadequate. Postmasters are vital parts of our communities, especially in the outer isles where they sit at the heart of island le. This scandal and the Post Office’s woeful reaction to it have undermined confidence in the treatment of our postmasters. The government must do more to repair that trust, starting with a proper judicial inquiry.“It bears repeating that local post offices have proven their essential role once again during the Covid- crisis.

Not wearing a face covering may mean passengers will not be able to travel.Due to social distancing requirements, the numbers of passengers within the terminal building will be limited and only travelling passengers will be allowed in the terminal. Special assistance support is still available for those who require it.All passengers will be welcomed by a member of the HIAL team on arrival who will help guide them through the new procedures.Based on the latest advice from the Scottish Government and Health Protection Scotland temperature checks are not currently required.Managing director Inglis Lyon, said: “My colleagues have worked extremely hard to offer a safer environment for passengers at our airports and we will continue to rely on the understanding and cooperation of travellers to follow our new procedures to make their experience as smooth as possible, given the current restrictions.“We are pleased that we are now able to focus on a safe and gradual resumption of air travel, however it is vital that everyone plays their part in helping ensure we avoid risking transmission of COVID-, by ensuring that you turn up at the airport wearing your face mask, maintaining social distancing and personal hygiene. We will continue to move in lockstep with Transport Scotland and adhere to Health Protection Scotland advice.“We do not know , or when, we will be able to travel as we did pre-coronavirus and given that all of us must adapt to these new habits and procedures in order to go about this part of our lives.“As we implement our procedures, we are doing our utmost to get everything right for our passengers.

People are going to lose their jobs, he said.Ministers are under intense pressure from Conservative MPs to go further by the easing the two-metre social-distancing so the hard pressed hospitality sector can also reopen.Mr Johnson confirmed at the weekend that he had ordered a ldquocomprehensive Downing Street review of the regulation. vw,vw,px, px\"A woman wears a face mask as she exits the ticket barriers at Brixton Underground station in south London The Prime Minister said the falling numbers of Covid- cases meant there was a greater ldquomargin for manoeuvre as the chances of coming into contact with someone with the disease diminished.Mr Sunak said it would be an ldquoall round survey of the issue drawing on advice from economists as well as the scientic and medical experts who have been advising ministers on the pandemic.He said it would be ministers, not the scientists, who would make the decisions on any easing, fuelling the belief at Westminster that the relationship between ministers and the advisers is becoming increasingly strained.The review is reported to be scheduled to be completed by July , the date slated by the Government for the hospitality sector to start welcoming back customers.Many pubs and restaurants have warned however that it will simply not be viable for them to do so unless the social-distancing rule is cut to no more than one metre. vw,vw,px, px\"Daily coronavirus tests in the UK This comes as the World Health Organisationhas urged the Government to not lt the lockdown until it is proven its widely-criticised coronavirus contact tracing system works.After it was revealed the Government failed to trace the contacts of a third of those testing positive in the first week of the new system, Dr Hans Kluge, the WHOrsquos director for Europe, warned Britain was still in the midst of a ldquovery active phase of the pandemic.Dr Kluge said while the tracking in England of some , contacts of , infected people was ldquoencouraging,the Government needed to be sure it could ldquoaggressively track infectionsit is to reopen the countryrsquos economy.ldquoContact tracing is key especially as the UK starts to relax the social and physical distancing measures, Dr Kluge told .ldquoThere has to be a robust track-and-trace system in place of operation. I would like to hellip say we need an effective tracking system in place, it is one of the measures that we recommend that are in place now.Labour has now joined Tory MPs in urging ministers to set out a clear plan for the hospitality sector to .Shadow business minister Lucy Powell said: ldquoWe urge the government to publish an action plan whichmaximiseseconomic viability, whilstminimisingtherisk to the healthofcustomers and staff.ldquoIf they fail to act, our communities will lose much-loved pubs, bars and restaurants, and wersquoll see a wave of closures and unemployment which will damage villages, towns and cities across the country.Monday will also see secondary schools in England reopening to some pupils with Year  and Year  students ing to get some time with their teachers ahead of their GCSE and A-level examinations next year.The Government has faced criticism that it has not done more to get schools reopened with some children facing the prospect of having been out of the classroom for almost six months by the time theyin September.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson was last week forced to abandon plans for all primary pupils tofor at least a month before the summer break admitting it would not be possible while social-distancing rules remain in place.Currently, primary schools in England are open to pupils in reception, Year one and Year six. vw,vw,px, px\"Children eat lunch in segregated positions at Kempsey Primary School in Worcester However ministers are planning a fresh push to get more children back by reaffirming schools can take pupils from other year groups providing they have the capacity to do so safely.A No  source said Mr Johnson was ldquoacutely aware of the impact the extended closure was having on pupils and was working with Education Secretary Gavin Williamson on a major ldquocatch-up plan.Meanwhile many retailers were simply looking forward to getting back to business again after so long away.Andrew Murphy, executive director of operations at John Lewis, told the PA news agency he expected customers would be surprised by the ldquorelative calmness of the experience.ldquoIrsquom hopeful that, while the overall atmosphere will feel a bit dferent to them, what theyrsquoll actually find is a kind of pleasant surprise that itrsquos calm, itrsquos pleasant, itrsquos well ordered, but itrsquos also still got the real advantage of the physical shopping experience, he said.copy -.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

Many protesters’ actions, in clear breach of social distancing rules, were dangerous.Yet nobody should shed tears when the bronze statue of a brutal th century Bristol slaver is hauled from his distinguished plinth in the city centre and thrown into the harbour.Our main concern should be how and why it was allowed to stay there for so long.As Edward Colston#s effigy toppled towards the watery grave to which he had consigned so many enslaved Africans, a protestor knelt on Colston#s neck.That was a graphic illustration of the incident which precipitated the storm: the throttling by a Minneapolis police officer of the US citizen George Floyd.George Floyd#s last words were #I can#t breathe#, which applied both literally and to his place in society.There is nothing sacrosanct about most secular statues. Before  statues of Adolf Hitler were commonplace in Europe.You would be hard pressed to find one now.The same applies to Josef Stalin in most of the former Soviet territories.Just outside New Delhi there is a lonely and extensive graveyard of hundreds of statues of former eminences of the British colonial Raj. Wild dogs roam among them.Closer to home, Glasgow#s and Edinburgh#s exploitation of slavery is being recognised by the alteration of Glasgow street names and a plaque in Edinburgh#s St Andrew#s Square by the -foot statue of Henry Dundas, which will detail his connections with the slave trade.It#s either that or throw him in the Forth.We were no innocents in this field. In , no fewer than  per cent of Jamaican slave plantations were owned by Scots.Research by University College London has revealed that when slavery in British territory was abolished in , the equivalent of £ billon in compensation was handed out to just over  Scottish proprietors.They were not all in Glasgow and Edinburgh.Donald Martin of Monkstadt in Skye cashed in on his ill-gotten gains. So did Alexander MacLean of North Uist.The Raasay proprietor George Rainy banked his share from human traffic, as did Donald MacLeod of Lewis and Alexander McBarnet of Attadale.There are no statues of those gentlemen to throw in the sea.But the next time somebody suggests a similar fate for the statue of the Duke of Sutherland on Ben Bhraggie # a fate to which we would have little objection # we should remember that black lives also matter.They did then and they do now.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HWRC__Portree_Re_Opening_15th_June_graphic-scaled.jpg","title":"portree recycling centre to re open on","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoineand receive confirmation before travelling to the site.The Portree site is open for essential waste disposal only, and householders are advised that journeys to a HWRC must only be undertakentheir waste cannot be stored at home safely.

Orwe the providers are the birds, desperately hoping for an income, fat and seed to feed us after an extra-long winter.Social media fluttered with posts from businesses stating ‘we hope to be open’, the sensible ones being aware of Fergus Ewing’s proviso: “This date cannot be definitive and is conditional on public health advice and progression to phase three of the route map.”While a lot of work will need to be done, practicalities and protocols worked out, how do we clean rooms, how do we ‘meet and greet’, do we leave rooms fallow for  hours, do we use PPE when cleaning, I think as much work needs to be done in the wider community.How are the visitors going to eat, how are they going to shop I have seen some quite lax adherence to protection in local shops with face covering usage fairly minimal at best.We have probably got away with this behaviour due to the low numbers of cases outwith the care home community.This could change with an influx of people from away. Any vigilantism must be directed at ourselves and the messages we put out when we go about our day to day business as lockdown eases.Protect ourselves and others.Those vulnerable people we have been looking after with prescription runs and message collections, some of them might not be looking forward to an influx of staycationers.What  are they bringing with their much-needed cash None of these problems are insurmountable. Guidelines will be available and in the month ahead, confidence will hopefullyand a dose of common sense will go a long way to making things work.The talk is that furlough is just the precursor to redundancy, and the economy will be struggling in all sectors.The knock on is likely to be fewer visitors with less money, and of course with the quarantine enforcement for overseas visitors, there won’t be many coming from afar.I hope the tourismwill be a trickle, then a stream, in order for us all to get used to how it can work.Despite being involved in the business I actually hope that it never s to the flood, the tsunami of the last two years, where the danger was the destruction of our environment and our community.We were perhaps too busy making money to spend time with our families, friends and neighbours.While loving the quiet roads, the time spent with family, and the time spent re-evaluating prioritiesit couldn’t last for ever.The savings are being eaten into, the government assistance also doesn’t last forever, reality looms.There is an economic model of price and product determination, that everybody is acutely aware of called “supply and demand’.In recent years as the visitor numbers went through the roof, and perhaps became unsustainable, bed provision rose, spare rooms developed, cabins and pods built, garages renovated.Still numbers rose, and so did the prices, a simple correlation.There is likely to now be an oversupply of bed provision, the economists would foresee a reduction in price as people compete for a smaller market.This may at first bring prices down to a realistic level, there was perhaps a danger that Skye was becoming a rich person’s destination.A possible consequence may be what I have heard described as “a race to the bottom”, with what is effectively a price war, and possibly falling too far.This when the product suddenly has become more expensive to manage, rooms costing more to clean, hotels only being able to cope with fewer guests to comply with social distancing.We have a free market economy, there is little or no control, people can charge what they like, and undercutting is a valid entrepreneurial technique do something better cheaper#!I mentioned weeks ago, for many, the tourist dollar is the icing on the pension cake, a second income to a professional wage.Perhaps there is a fine line between need and greed.Some tourist operators have been forced to use food banks and needing help from the Skye Community Response group during lockdown.As business s, and these people can begin rebuilding their livelihoods, perhaps others have to decide what their own needs are.The pension or the wage might be enough.One of the reasons I love starlings is the incredible murmurations they create in autumn, just before roosting in the evenings.These bickering birds who flutter and jostle around the trees, for twenty minutes or so before descending to reeds and branch to sleep, put on a display with no equal in nature.Moving in unison, they create patterns in the sky, shapes, forms, dance. Apparently, each bird affects the six or seven around it but a flock of tens of thousands moves asone, producing something beautul.Community can be like that.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KC-Photo.jpg","title":"delight as kyleakin connections project to take ownership of its","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe project has been successful with its application to the Scottish Land Fund and has been awarded £, to buy the Old School in Kyleakin.Kyleakin Connections, a charity formerly known as Skye and Lochalsh Association for Disability, has been using the building for nearly  years as a day resource for adults with learning disabilities.This funding will allow Kyleakin Connections to buy the premises from Highland Council.The present services will continue to be delivered from the premises, including a range of activities which focus on increasing the independent living skills of the attenders, encouraging health and wellbeing and interacting with the wider community.The Nice Café and Bookshop, operated by the attenders one day per week, has proved to be a popular enterprise.The Old School is currently also being used by a number of local groups as a complement to the larger community hall.The purchase of the building will open up other possibilities and plans are in progress to expand and develop the facilities to meet the present and future needs of groups, especially the more vulnerable, within South Skye and Lochalsh.Dr Audrey Sinclair, Chairperson of Kyleakin Connections Board said: “We are delighted with the news.#Not only will it allow us to carry on our normal services, we shall be able to expand our activities and extend the usage of the building to other groups in the community.#Kyleakin Connections has been fortunate for many years to have a loyal group of members and friends and we are grateful for their support and encouragement with this project.#I would also like to acknowledge the Highland Council, the present owners of the Old School, for their positive response to our request to purchase the premises.#At a time of so much uncertainty and sad news during this Covid- crisis, it is refreshing to be able to bring some good news into the community and give everyone something to look forward to.#We are especially looking forward to when we can hold an event to celebrate the acquisition of the premises.”Local Councillor John Finlayson said: “I am delighted to have been involved in the discussions about the purchase of the building and I also welcome the positive relationships that have been further established between the Highland Council and the Board of Kyleakin Connections, to further develop the exciting future of this important and community-based group who deliver such a key service.#As someone who lives in the village of Kyleakin, I know how important Kyleakin Connections is to both the users and the local community.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3168438.jpg--.jpg?1591781511000\n","title":"local translink staff in grocery donation drive","story":" Translink staff in Ballymena Bus and Rail Station have responded to the COVID- emergency by starting a special grocery donation drive for people in need in their local community.

Less than half of childminders have stayed open in lockdown, and only for families on the original list of key workers.But that#s begun to change this past week, Ms Lewsley Mooney said.She added: We#re at a more positive position than we have been before.I think the Department of Education and the Executive realised that childcare is a linchpin to any process moving forward.In May she told Stormont#s education committee childminders had been brought to their knees by Covid-.Now about  people have registered their interest to become childminders, which she said was promising for a sector hit hard by the pandemic.But families are still calling on Stormont for clarity as more parentsto work.This week more than  people, including SDLP MP Claire Hanna, signed an open letter to the Health and Education Ministers for a roadmap for the sector reopening, and a long-term childcare strategy.Ulster University#s Ciara Fitzpatrick, who drafted the letter along with FactCheck NI founder Orna Young, said some families felt they had no choice but to send their children to grandparents or people who are shielding.She said there also needed to be more information on what the Executive#s new bubble policy meant for childcare, adding: I think parents feel like they have been forgotten about and they haven#t had the space to actually discuss how challenging the current situation has been for them.A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said childcare would be key in future -to-work decisions.She said the number of providers operating was expected to increase with demand. She added: Childcare providers are available to support workers who have been required to go to work to support the response to the Covid- pandemic or who have been permitted toto work by the NI Executive.From June  childminders have been able to extend their care from two families to three at one time. That number is expected to increase to four next month, and five in August.Belfast Most ReadNorthern Ireland town hall funded by slave trader #should be renamed#No regrets: Martina Purdy moves from sister to saint as ex-reporter who trained as nun takes on new roleCoronavirus: Date for NI hairdressers and gyms to reopen could be earlier than July  Belfast barbers# customers could end up half cut in garage salon serving boutique beerHundreds gather to protect war memorials outside Belfast City Hall,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Surgeries were put on hold at the Children#s Hospital in Belfast when the restrictions were first introduced in March.This meant the young patient had to endure further months of an exhausting regime of kidney dialysis seven nights a week, making it uncertain he could even start primary school this year.After carefully studying the risks involved of operating during the pandemic, his medical team asked the family to take a leap of faith and perform the surgery.The operation followed the success of the adult renal and nephrology service, who have performed around  transplants from deceased donors since the start of lockdown.Dr Karl McKeever is the patient#s consultant and clinical director in the Children#s Hospital.He told the Belfastit was a proud day for the team after a frightening period when all bets were off on when surgeries for children could resume.He also spoke of the touching moment the young boy celebrated on the ward after his operation.Everybody was very frightened about what lay ahead, he said.This particular patient was already teed up for a transplant because of high clinical need before the pandemic.That had to be postponed and the clock was ticking because other patients can sadly die on dialysis.That has been the case in other parts of the world that have been harder hit and haven#t been able to start their services.The team faced a dficult decision between protecting the donor and patient from Covid- and the harm of doing nothing.Work started with Dr Mairead Convery, a consultant paediatric nephrologist, networking with management in the Belfast Trust and other experts across the UK to assess the risk.After collecting enough data, the team concluded that with the proper safety measures, the risk of Covid- to the donor and patient was small.It#s been a very exciting time amidst all the bad times, said Dr McKeever. It#s so transforming for the family who have had to take that leap of faith.The impact of dialysis and what families have to go through needs to be seen to be believed and is very humbling for us.He continued: I always remember when the little boy ed to the ward a few days after his surgery and chanted #We did it, we did it!#It was particularly interesting to see the awareness he had at such a young age about what was going on in society around them.He understood why it had been held up, so to see it come off in such a good way with all of the team involved was amazing.Between two and six kidney transplants are usually performed at the Children#s Hospital each year.The numbers are low so it wasn#t a worry we couldn#t catch up, but it was the risk to the patients as the days went by on dialysis waiting for this le-changing surgery, Dr McKeever said.So, it#s just been super for this wee man and his family. After going through so much in recent years, I#d say they#re not entering a new chapter as much as a new book.Dr Convery added she was absolutely delighted to be first paediatric centre in the UK and Ireland to perform a living donor transplant during lockdown and thanked staff for their perseverance in giving a child the most amazing gt.Most importantly, we would like to thank our patient, their family and the donor for their courage and cooperation throughout the process.

Singing is also discouraged, and the passing of an offering plate among worshippers must not be your practice for the foreseeable future.The document says that in relation to the administration of the sacraments, guidance is still being considered by Church leaders and will be communicated in due course.Rev Trevor Gribben, clerk to the General Assembly, said the lockdown restrictions had been a painful experience for worshippers. The past three months of lockdown across the island of Ireland has presented unprecedented challenges, he said. For our ministers and congregations, this has included the enforced closure of our church buildings and an inability to meet together for worship face-to-face. While undoubtedly this has been a painful experience for many, I have been encouraged to see how our people have adapted to share God#s Word creatively online, and keep in contact with members and others in the community through phone calls, emails and old-fashioned letters.He said theto normal church services posed more complex problems than the sudden closure had. As lockdown restrictions gradually ease, our congregations must think carefully and responsibly about the practical preparations necessary to facilitate theof worship services and other aspects of church le, he added. Each congregation#s circumstances will be dferent and they will come to a iety of decisions about what activities to recommence, and how quickly this can happen. However, meeting together with brothers and sisters in Christ is central to Christian le and a primary expression of church as the family of God.And we look forward to having the opportunity to do so once again.Belfast Most ReadNorthern Ireland town hall funded by slave trader #should be renamed#No regrets: Martina Purdy moves from sister to saint as ex-reporter who trained as nun takes on new roleCoronavirus: Date for NI hairdressers and gyms to reopen could be earlier than July  Belfast barbers# customers could end up half cut in garage salon serving boutique beerHundreds gather to protect war memorials outside Belfast City Hall,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

His younger years coincided with a bright spell in the clubs history. He spoke to Michael McMullan about losing championships, winning the John McLaughlin Cup and building for the future. Gutty McGlone is no dferent to any other competitor. Defeat hits him like a sledgehammer. It festers to the very pit of his stomach. Its county final afternoon in  and an emerging Lavey team savour the sweet aroma of victory. Inside, in the corner of the Glen dressing room, McGlone reflects. The remnants of their - to - defeat get tossed through his mind again, something only disappointment can do. googletag.cmd.push The pitter patter of water in the adjoining shower area stops. The noise you only hear above the eerie silence of failure. John McErlain, Liam Devlin and Damian Barton emerge. Their confab draws a common conclusion. They had left three titles behind them. Next year will be dferent. In , -year-old McGlones debut season, the Bridge didnt stand up for themselves in the championship against Ballinderry, before losing the game. Eamonn Coleman was manager and after making him a regular from the mid-point of the league, Hugh wasnt selected for the championship defeat to the Shamrocks, with Coleman later confessing it was about protecting him for a career ahead. He just wasnt ready. googletag.cmd.push Three years earlier, torn ligaments in McGlones right ankle, sustained in school action for St Pius, worked out for the best. “Before that, I couldnt kick with my weak foot,” recalls Hugh, who would later coach at underage and engineer the foundations for the current senior team. He remembers the late Brendan Convery insisting on ato school training once he could walk, before arming him with a bag of balls. “Convery made me stand on the and kick every ball into the goals with my left foot. The next week, he made me go to the ,” McGlone clearly remembers. The man who managed Laveys All-Ireland winning team was developing McGlone without him even knowing. “I gradually got stronger and stronger and thats where I ended up playing at left corner back for the Bridge seniors at , because I had two feet and was able to go up the line...that was all down to Brendan Convery.” St Pius annexed an U Vocational Schools All-Ireland, with McGlone on board. A year later, in , Derry minors, who played most of the game with  men following the first-minute dismissal of Gregory McCloskey, were beaten by a point in Newry by Down, who went on to win the All-Ireland. McGlone lined out at corner back and a year more experienced, had established himself as a regular on the Bridge senior team. Once again, they crossed paths with Ballinderry. After having previously taken two games to beat Magherafelt, they met the Shamrocks in the infamous semi-final replay encounter at Greenlough. Newbridge came through to play Dungiven in a final.  The Newbridge team pictured before the  Derry senior final It wasnt to be. Newbridge were going to stand their ground this time. Familiarity bred contempt and after another tempestuous battle with the Shamrocks, which saw pitch invasions, Newbridge were thrown out leaving Dungiven to be awarded the title in the boardroom. Losing was becoming a habit and in the aftermath of their  defeat, before leaving Glen, they made a pact. “We are going to learn from this,” McGlone relays of the collective dressing room message. “We left one , we didnt get playing in oneand now we have lost one. We are not going to lose another one.” *** You earned your corn at Newbridge training. The championship jersey wasnt handed out willy nilly. Gutty McGlone, the youngest of seven boys in a house of  children, would leave home for the short walk to the hall for a Saturday pre-championship meeting before the  final. He was unnecessarily uneasy. “Im not sure of my position here,” McGlone thought. He was ever-present and never substituted during the year, but Stephen Walls, an All-Ireland minor winner with Derry in , was breathing down McGlones neck. “Thats the class of player we had on the bench. I knew I had played well, but because of the competition at the time in the Newbridge team, I was thinking I could get a gunk here I knew the pressure was on, thats why you had to perform.” It was an era that secured back-to-back senior leagues in  and , as well as three reserve championships inside five years. “This just wasnt about the senior team, those three teams were the pinnacle of us winning thechampionship in ,” McGlone stated, in no uncertain terms. Before emphasising it again. “We played games at training during ...it was a senior team against a reserve team. We struggled to beat them, so that shows you the class of talent we had in Newbridge at that time.” McGlone name-checks Mickey McGrogan and Shane Doherty as some of the forwards who trotted into his left corner back area in training games, players not even listed on the -man match-day  for the final. And they gave him his fill of it. “Then, you had big Hugh McGrogan, Paudis Da, running around at midfield, kicking the shite out of Damian Barton. There was no respect given whatsoever.” It was dog eat dog. And it needed to be. This was to be the year. “Rabbiand Sam , our managers, picked  seniors against  reserves, so we would learn how to play together in games.” The seniors never overran their reserve counterparts. “Not a chance,” Gutty stresses. The seniors never won by any more than four or five points, with the reserves winning the odd game. It worked wonders when it mattered. “Any time we were down by a couple of points , that team didnt know when it was beat. Now it mightnt have been the silkiest team, but boys just never quit,” Hugh admits. After three years of knocking on the door, with the pain of defeat lingering like a dark cloud and with the younger players beginning to mature, it was time to die dog or shite the licence. *** There was another ingredient. Sam Bateson is described by McGlone as the tactician with his managerial partner Thomas Fullerton also knowing his football. The perfect match. Fullerton, a reserve winning captain, was playing with McGlone in a  Graham Cup game. Magherafelt were running them ragged and led by six or seven points at the interval. “It was one of the first times I saw we had steel and other teams didnt have, Thomas went f**king ballistic at half-time,” Gutty remembers. It was a watershed moment. The law was laid down. Like the rest of the team, McGlone imposed himself. They were like men possessed and won the game well. “I was niggling with my man and remember him filling my mouth when we began to get on top,” said McGlone, who walked off the pitch with blood running out of his nose. “Hes not playing football in the next round, but we are,” Rabbi uttered to him, with a laugh. “Thats when I thought, the odd slap in the mouth doesnt matter, as long as you come out on the right side of it.” Another piece of valuable advice was dished out by John McErlain who often played in front of him on the left wing. In his early days, McGlone would often hoof the ball to safety. As a young buck, and under pressure, it was safer than getting caught in possession. “John roared at me one day in a league game,” he remembers. “I was told to either use the ball up the wing or just lay it off. Its those wee things that helps you when you are growing up.” As the  season began to grow, Newbridge beat  champions Bellaghy in the first round, followed by a hard-earned victory over  winners Glenullin and a semi-final encounter win over Banagher. It took them to the decider against neighbours Castledawson. Midway through the first-half, Brian McErlain was sent off. In the reshuffle, Damian Barton dropped back to centre-back. “Damian was that good with the long pass, that we didnt really have to attack and we could keep six at the back,” McGlone said of his captain. “He was able to get the ball to Devand Paddy Barton up there. On that day, I thought the Newbridge defence was outstanding...everybody. It was tight, it was hard hitting and Castledawson didnt get going.” They knew that Eamonn Heaney wasnt going to make Dawsons starting team, but would play a part. He had played at full-back in the  final, but was now threw in at full-forward to help rescue the game. It wasnt long before Rabbi was out over the sideline to instruct McGlone to do a marking job on Colm McKee for the remainder of the game, having blotted out the substituted Mickey Hughes. “Neither me or Colm touched the ball, but the management had trust in us. I was the youngest man on our team and they were happy to leave me on their county man.” Having played in three county finals and losing two of them, McGlone – who has a memory for detail that matches his enthusiasm – always remembers the call for stewards to pick up their end of match positions. “Its one of the worst feelings you could have as a footballer when you are getting beat by two or three points,” he recalls. One year on from hearing it against Lavey in , they led Castledawson when the announcement bellowed out. He remembers dampening Eoin Gribbins joy at the thought of having their clutches on that elusive championship. “One goal and they are back in it,” McGlone warned him. “In the Lavey game, it seemed to last  seconds until the final whistle, but when it was called that year , we were ahead...it seemed like an eternity until the whistle.” Newbridge were not to be caught. They kept their promise from  months earlier and Damian Barton collected the John McLaughlin Cup after a -year gap, for their th and last title. From McGlones recollection, win lose or draw, Wilfie Garvin, Mick McKenna, Jim Gilmore, Seamus and Dermot Doherty, Owen and Willie Gribbin would always be in the Newbridge dressing room after games. They were part of the teams fabric. “I remember those boys being in the day we won it and I was never as glad to see it. Its one of the wee things I will always remember.” Later in the evening the team went for a meal at the ONeill Arms in Toome, before heading back to Newbridge Hall for the celebrations. McGlone wasnt a teetotaller, he enjoyed a drink like most of the others and it was curbed during the championship preparations. “I never touched drink the night we won the championship, not one pint,” Gutty said of his premeditated decision. “I wanted to savour the whole thing and not to be talking to the older men around the club and me maybe half tight.” The next two or three days were dferent. Between the Elk and the Thatch, it was party central. On the Monday night, the squad did a tour of Newbridge on the back of Mick McKennas lorry.   Derry champions Newbridge “Everyone was on the back of er,” Gutty laughs. “We went down to Toome to pick up Stephen McErlain and then did every road in Newbridge. You wouldve thought there were  cars behind us. For the next two or three days, I dont think we sobered.” They were at the top of Everest. But surprisingly, being one of the most consistent teams of the time, it was the only senior championship that crop won. In , they took the foot off the pedal and lost to Ballinascreen in the semi-final who were beaten by eventual All-Ireland champions Lavey. “In  Eugene Young came in to manage us and we got to the final. We missed two goals and theyscored two goals, that was the dference in us winning another one.” While picking up intermediate silverware in the interim, he recalls the disappointment of relegation in  after surviving for three or four seasons in play-offs. “To start your career with a championship medal in your pocket at  or , struggling and relegation was tough. To go from being top of the pile...from walking around behind bands, to relegation, it was tough.” McGlone picked up an intermediate medal in , but when the same title ed five years later, he had stepped away from the seniors, choosing to play with the reserves. Gutty was coaxed out back into the senior ranks by manager Gavin Devlin for an impact role at full-forward, using his guile to pull full-back lines of position. A dead leg suffered in , a niggle that never fully cleared up told McGlone it was time to pull the pin. In retirement, he was never going to step away from the game he loved. The buzz in his voice, with every word dancing, speaks volumes for his fanaticism for football. He stayed on as long as he could, with the club having little youth coming through. It was time to dig new foundations and survey the lie of the land in the local school. “There were big numbers from U down, so we decided wed start with the underage,” states Hugh, who had the help of Neil Young, Martin Gribbin and Gabriel Farren. It was the clubs first U U group, as part of a unofficial South Derry underage initiative. With clubs coaching for three weeks and playing a blitz on the fourth week. “We couldnt believe it, when all  of them turned up at the first session,” he said of a group that supplied seven players to the senior team beaten by Slaughtneil in last years championship. “By U, CKcame in to help. He had taken teams around Newbridge that boysdidnt want, hed step up. Noel McPeake and Sean McKenna came in too and helped.” After winning the U B league and championship, McGlone took a break before ing at minor level and asked for another step up in class. At the pre-season meeting he asked those in the room with two B medals to stand up. “About  percent stood up and when asked who has at least one , and the rest of them stood,” McGlone states. It was time to move up to the A grade. In their first game, they were away to Slaughtneil and unlucky not to beat a team who were U champions two years earlier. After losing heavily to Magherafelt in the Hughes McElwee Cup, the league game between them finished in a draw.  The  Newbridge U U  “If you win a Byou have to step up to A. We were not going to win anything. If we played somebody and there was  points in it and we played them a second day and there was two points in it, we are progressing.” McGlone expressed. He was looking further down the track. His sons are now playing on the senior team, he helped shape. In recent years, they picked up another intermediate title and are back in the top flight. Hopefully to stay. “Now we have a  again that,nurtured right, can dine at the top table again. Hopefully...I am one of the men that is going in around the dressing room in the next five or six years like the older boys did when we won.” Guttys fanaticism has never diluted, nor is it likely to.

I was the youngest man on our team and they were happy to leave me on their county man.” Having played in three county finals and losing two of them, McGlone – who has a memory for detail that matches his enthusiasm – always remembers the call for stewards to pick up their end of match positions. “Its one of the worst feelings you could have as a footballer when you are getting beat by two or three points,” he recalls. One year on from hearing it against Lavey in , they led Castledawson when the announcement bellowed out. He remembers dampening Eoin Gribbins joy at the thought of having their clutches on that elusive championship. “One goal and they are back in it,” McGlone warned him. “In the Lavey game, it seemed to last  seconds until the final whistle, but when it was called that year , we were ahead...it seemed like an eternity until the whistle.” Newbridge were not to be caught. They kept their promise from  months earlier and Damian Barton collected the John McLaughlin Cup after a -year gap, for their th and last title. From McGlones recollection, win lose or draw, Wilfie Garvin, Mick McKenna, Jim Gilmore, Seamus and Dermot Doherty, Owen and Willie Gribbin would always be in the Newbridge dressing room after games. They were part of the teams fabric. “I remember those boys being in the day we won it and I was never as glad to see it. Its one of the wee things I will always remember.” Later in the evening the team went for a meal at the ONeill Arms in Toome, before heading back to Newbridge Hall for the celebrations. McGlone wasnt a teetotaller, he enjoyed a drink like most of the others and it was curbed during the championship preparations. “I never touched drink the night we won the championship, not one pint,” Gutty said of his premeditated decision. “I wanted to savour the whole thing and not to be talking to the older men around the club and me maybe half tight.” The next two or three days were dferent. Between the Elk and the Thatch, it was party central. On the Monday night, the squad did a tour of Newbridge on the back of Mick McKennas lorry.   Derry champions Newbridge “Everyone was on the back of er,” Gutty laughs. “We went down to Toome to pick up Stephen McErlain and then did every road in Newbridge. You wouldve thought there were  cars behind us. For the next two or three days, I dont think we sobered.” They were at the top of Everest. But surprisingly, being one of the most consistent teams of the time, it was the only senior championship that crop won. In , they took the foot off the pedal and lost to Ballinascreen in the semi-final who were beaten by eventual All-Ireland champions Lavey. “In  Eugene Young came in to manage us and we got to the final. We missed two goals and theyscored two goals, that was the dference in us winning another one.” While picking up intermediate silverware in the interim, he recalls the disappointment of relegation in  after surviving for three or four seasons in play-offs. “To start your career with a championship medal in your pocket at  or , struggling and relegation was tough. To go from being top of the pile...from walking around behind bands, to relegation, it was tough.” McGlone picked up an intermediate medal in , but when the same title ed five years later, he had stepped away from the seniors, choosing to play with the reserves. Gutty was coaxed out back into the senior ranks by manager Gavin Devlin for an impact role at full-forward, using his guile to pull full-back lines of position. A dead leg suffered in , a niggle that never fully cleared up told McGlone it was time to pull the pin. In retirement, he was never going to step away from the game he loved. The buzz in his voice, with every word dancing, speaks volumes for his fanaticism for football. He stayed on as long as he could, with the club having little youth coming through. It was time to dig new foundations and survey the lie of the land in the local school. “There were big numbers from U down, so we decided wed start with the underage,” states Hugh, who had the help of Neil Young, Martin Gribbin and Gabriel Farren. It was the clubs first U U group, as part of a unofficial South Derry underage initiative. With clubs coaching for three weeks and playing a blitz on the fourth week. “We couldnt believe it, when all  of them turned up at the first session,” he said of a group that supplied seven players to the senior team beaten by Slaughtneil in last years championship. “By U, CKcame in to help. He had taken teams around Newbridge that boysdidnt want, hed step up. Noel McPeake and Sean McKenna came in too and helped.” After winning the U B league and championship, McGlone took a break before ing at minor level and asked for another step up in class. At the pre-season meeting he asked those in the room with two B medals to stand up. “About  percent stood up and when asked who has at least one , and the rest of them stood,” McGlone states. It was time to move up to the A grade. In their first game, they were away to Slaughtneil and unlucky not to beat a team who were U champions two years earlier. After losing heavily to Magherafelt in the Hughes McElwee Cup, the league game between them finished in a draw.  The  Newbridge U U  “If you win a Byou have to step up to A. We were not going to win anything. If we played somebody and there was  points in it and we played them a second day and there was two points in it, we are progressing.” McGlone expressed. He was looking further down the track. His sons are now playing on the senior team, he helped shape. In recent years, they picked up another intermediate title and are back in the top flight. Hopefully to stay. “Now we have a  again that,nurtured right, can dine at the top table again. Hopefully...I am one of the men that is going in around the dressing room in the next five or six years like the older boys did when we won.” Guttys fanaticism has never diluted, nor is it likely to. One of the games great characters.  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

GAA GOLD, a new archive based series from TG, looks back at the ’s through the prism of the GAA year.  Each programme focuses on one year and we travel through the GAA season with a mixture of all of the classic games, news stories and music hits from that year. The first programme of the series starts with the year and the programmecharts that year’s twists and turns on Gaelic fields throughout the land with league finals, provincial finals, All-Ireland semi-finals and All-Ireland finals. That year end ends with Joe Connolly’s emotional and evocative speech on the steps of the Hogan Stand with the cheeky line of “People of Galway, we love you! googletag.cmd.push In  All Ireland Football Final, there was Seacuteamus Darbys famous goal that shocked Kerry - and the nation - to end their five in-a-row hopes. In the Hurling Final the Cats claimed their nd All-Ireland title captained by a young man named Brian Cody. In  we will see Jimmy Barry-Murphy’s famous rocket goal against Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final. Michael O’Hehir on commentary said“This is one you need to see in slow motion but the slow motion won’t even slow it down!”.  In the Minor hurling final there is a young man named Niall Quinn playing for the Dubs against Galway. He scored a great point on the day and would go on to score  international goals for the Republic of Ireland soccer team. The Football Final that year saw  players sent off in the Dublin v Galway battle. googletag.cmd.push The series will include the  Ulster Football Final - Frank McGuigan was on fire for Tyrone that day and scored  points from play - each one better than the last as Tyrone claimed their first provincial title since  in Clones.  This was also the GAA’s centenary year with the All-Ireland Hurling Final held in Semple Stadium between Cork and Offaly. We hwill see the first ever International Rules tests between Ireland and Australia from that year with plenty of action on and off the ball. In  we have some action from the first ever Ladies Football Final to be played at Croke Park. The Kerry’s Ladies team went one better than the men as they claimed a‘five in-a-row’ with victory over Wexford. There are other more quirkier events in the GAA season too. In  a National Football League Quarter-final between Dublin and Cork ended in a draw. Cork failed to reappear for extra-time so Dublin ran the ball down unopposed and shot into an empty Cork net to claim a very unusual victory. All of these great memories can be seen in this new GAA GOLD series with the soundtrack of the era - a mix of both international and Irish acts such as U, Thin Lizzy, The Pogues, Mamas Boys, The Undertones, Cry Before Dawn, Sineacutead O’Connor, The Dubliners, The Hothouse Flowers, The Stunning and many more.

It was the greatest walk of all and following the opening of Shamrock Park, following the sporting lockdown, they are again thinking of that famous journey to Thurles. On the re-opening of walkways around GAA grounds, this was an opportunity to get people back out again socialising as a club community and using the club grounds with their Trip  Tipp initiative. The idea was to get as many families as possible out walking, running or crawling, each doing a  mile leg of the  mile journey in allocated, socially distanced, safe slots. googletag.cmd.push A pound contribution per family was requested, with all proceeds going to aid football and camogie youth restarting back training, with the expected rules and regulations that will surely be in place. The uptake was fantastic with  families taking partand more families looking to take part every day so they surpassed their  mile journey!. The club wish to place on record their thanks to all those that participated or helped out in any way preparing the grounds, sorting and fitting hand sanitizers, marking the walkways for one way social distance adherence, with special mention to Paul McIver who was the driving force behind this excellent initiative. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

When he came out of the changing room bearing a grey hoodie, with the rest of his team-mates in black and white, you wondered had he even got a jersey. But whatever he dreamt about on the night before, whatever he thought about over dinner, he wouldn’t have believed he would have scored an injury-time goal to win the trophy for his new club and win the man of the match award. googletag.cmd.push That’s exactly how it panned out. The sides level at - apiece, thirty seconds of injury-time played, and a long ball is spilled and flapped at by Ronan Tracey in the Foreglen goal. Poaching on the edge of the small square , as he did time and again in the green and gold jersey, it was a simple task for O’Kane to punch home the winning goal. Some ironies are just written in the stars. This one came in spite of every single ounce of effort Foreglen had to give. Kevin O’Connor was O’Kane’s partner in crime since the two were knee high. They tormented defences in Intermediate football for years. They fought shoulder to shoulder for the green and the gold. googletag.cmd.push O’Connor played like a man possessed. He played like a man who wanted to show the world he didn’t need a partner. The Foreglen forward took Rian Kealey, a superb player, to the cleaners. O’Connor ended up with five points and set up his side’s goal in a magnicent display. That goal, made by O’Connor and finished by James Brolly, looked as though it had swung the balance in the favour of the underdogs with just four minutes to go. Having been behind from the th minute of a rather stagnant first half, Foreglen had worked incredibly hard to stay in touch with the Magpies. A combination of wasteful finishing from Eugene Kelly’s menand superb defending from a young full-back line of Ruairi and Shane Duffy and Cathal O’Hara kept Damien O’Connor’s side in contention. This was no holds barred football. For the young Dungiven side, sprinkled with Kevin Farren, Kevin Johnston, Sean Murray and Donal McGilligan of last year’s minor team, this was probably the toughest game they’ve played, in a physical sense at least. For that, you have to give Foreglen great credit. Brothers John and Oisin Duffy were lost to their defence before the game, having set off travelling on Friday. They’re without Niall McFeely long term. To most teams with as small a pick, those absentees would be terminal against a side that contained six players that played in last year’s senior county final. But when have Foreglen ever laid down  Kevin O’Connor might have kicked the points, but the spadework was done by plenty other. Ciaran McFeely had an excellent game, the best he’s played in some while. He went after everything, especially in the second half. Darren O’Kane’s heart is bigger than his chest. There’s not much of him, but he ploughs into everything. He’s pretty much the Foreglen prototype. They felt the big decisions didn’t go their way. They may have had a point. Directly after Brolly’s goal, Martin Farrell latched on to a great ball from Darren O’Kane. He appeared to be fouled in front of goal but referee Joe Mulholland blew him for over-carrying. Ninety seconds after what turned out to be Darrell O’Kane’s winning goal, Kevin O’Connor was pushed in the chest inside the area as he collected the ball. The referee felt he went down too easily and played on. But for all the feeling of the world being against them, they were lucky to still be in the game at half-time. Having played with a fresh breeze, they were frustrated by constant stoppages over a stop-start  minutes. With  minutes of -a-side football played, the score was just - apiece. It hadn’t caught fire at all. But Dungiven were missing what chances were being made. They kicked ten wides in that half hour. Foreglen had just three points at the break, but just as importantly, they had conceded just five. What the fans were treated to in the second half was night and day from what they had got in the first. It became a rip-roaring game. It effectively became championship. The first seven minutes of the half were scoreless. The stage seemed set. James McNicholl got out well and fed the man coming off his shoulder. That man fired brilliantly past Ronan Tracey from twelve yards. That man had no fear of celebrating his goal. That man was, of course, Darrell O’Kane. Foreglen seemed to react to the identity of the scorer as much as the goal itself. They responded in the most positive manner. Martin Farrell , Ciaran McFeely, Kevin O’Connor and James Brolly hit points in six brilliant minutes to close the gap back to two. Dungiven’s only response in those six minutes came from O’Kane’s right foot. Kevin O’Connor was not letting it go without a fight. His storming run saw Rian Kealey pull him to the ground along the endline. He got up and sprinted out to the ’ and with Dungiven sleeping, took a quick free that left James Brolly with a relatively simple finish from  yards. That levelled it with just four minutes to play. But they couldn’t quite get the score they needed to nose themselves in front. They just didn’t have anything to hold on to. Substitute Fergal McGuigan kicked a  yard free wide and it seemed as though the gods, having rescued Kerry earlier in the day, had dressed themselves in green and gold. But it just had to be Darrell O’Kane’s day. Of all the men in all the world, it just had to be him.

John O’Neill, from Ballinderry, took to the roads around the village to document the lives of local parishioners during the Covid- lockdown. The project is still ongoing, but Fr Peter Donnelly from St Patrick’s Church in the parish, says the donation of pound, is very welcome. “It is very much appreciated by the entire Ballinderry family as this would be additional expenditure, which has become necessary,” he told the County Derry Post. “Because of the health emergency, we’ve had to seriously think about introducing a webcam, and all of these improvements are costly, and this money will go towards that. googletag.cmd.push “It was very generous of him with his time and photography expertise. It was a kind thought indeed and it was well supported.” The project grew momentum after a local man, Charlie Collins, presented John with a list of  people in the parish who were over . “I would touch base, or say I was calling in an area on a certain day and people would get in contact,” said John. “I arranged rough times that I would call so they were watching or had a family member keeping an eye out. “The older folk were asking about how they would buy a photo, so I did a flat rate and said % would go to Fr Donnelly down in Ballinderry chapel.” googletag.cmd.push One of Johns shots from the project. Pic: John ONeill - Sperrins Photography. Fr Donnelly said the thought of a photographer doing the rounds was enough to give the parish’s elderly parishioners a boost. “The older members found it enormously important and looked forward to getting prepared to have their photographs taken,” he said. “John managed to capture their dferent personalities very well. There are many ways of taking a photo but the artistry is in capturing the character of the person themselves. “I thought he got everyone’s personality very well. Rather than people feeling a bit self-conscious or formal, he was able to put them at ease. “It was a wonderful idea and it was very heartening to see it so well supported.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A number of complaints had been raised about the booking system put in place following the easement of coronavirus restrictions. Cllr Kathleen McGurk said some constituents had experienced dficulty when trying to make a same-day booking, but moves have since been made to improve the service. “I asked the Environmental Services Director to improve the current system to ensure there are less issues when trying to book a slot including provision same day booking,” said Cllr McGurk. “I very much welcome the improvements that the council team have now implemented and praise should be given to the quick response to the complaints. googletag.cmd.push “The new online booking systems which is being rolled out should streamline the service for all users.” The online system, which will facilitate same-day booking, will be trialled at sites in Coleraine and Limavady this week, with the council hoping to roll it out to all sites within a fortnight. The number of slots has also been increased to allow for four vehicles every ten minutes, with a view to increasing it to six vehicles this week. In the meantime, the council has increased the number of operators taking bookings to seven at centres that do not yet have the online booking system in place. googletag.cmd.push “I appreciate there have been frustrations caused by the booking system and some have called for its removal entirely,” said Cllr McGurk “However it is essential that we maintain it for the meantime to avoid the long queues and congestion seen in other Council areas. “It is also worth noting that since the introduction of the booking system, most council recycling centres are working to full capacity with slots being entirely filled for the following day. “If this wasn’t managed correctly it would lead to peak usage times which would have the potential to overwhelm staff at the centres and cause traffic issues. “Whilst this may not have been as likely a scenario in smaller recycling centres, it was important that the same approach was taken to all centres across the council area.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Beverly Simpson moved from Guyana in South America to Derry in  to help the ‘failing health system’. She has two sons and a daughter, who was born in Derry. Mrs Simpson was one of the speakers at the Black Lives Matter rally on Saturday in Derrys Guildhall Square. Speaking to the Derry News this week, Beverly said she felt compelled to speak at the event as people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethniccommunities need a ‘safe outlet to express their feelings’. googletag.cmd.push In relation to opposition to the rally taking place, she believes that certain political parties mobilised the PSNI and in doing so ‘aggravated the situation’. Mrs Simpson said she and her daughter Jada were approached by police before reaching the Guildhall and again by three officers while standing there. “The police were intimidating us, she said. It was a safe space, controlled, we had a voice. “I thought, did police officers just see the colour of my skin and approach me. “They weren’t approaching everyone. Like every organisation there’s an element that think they’re superior. “The rally wasn’t even started when we were approached and they didn’t give us the option of going home. googletag.cmd.push “They annoyed us that much it made us more determined to stay.” She added: “They were trying to put a lid on an active volcano, it will still erupt, but instead of erupting in a controlled manner it will erupt all over the place. “Let it be addressed in a controlled environment, in schools or in church. “People should be able to speak about racism, it’s not going away no matter how many lids are put on it.” Since moving to the city, Mrs Simpson claimed that her entire family have been subjected to racism. “All three of my children have experienced racism, including my -year-old,” she said. “In Derry it may be subtle, not open or staring you in the face, but it’s there and unless we actually speak about it, people get away with it and continue to do it. “Don’t get me wrong, you have people everywhere who are good and bad, you have people in Derry who are not racist. “It’s about people’s moral compass, your ethics and what you value. “Children are born innocent and unless you teach them to hate, and teach them racism, they don’t see the person as another colour. “It is something that is learnt and unless we address our own personal prejudices we’ll get nowhere.” From April  to March , there were  racist incidents, resulting in  crimes, in Northern Ireland. Of those,  occurred in the Derry and Strabane policing district, an increase of  on the previous year. It’s understood that many incidents go unreported. For Mrs Simpson’s daughter Jada, race was never an issue until two years ago. Mrs Simpson said her friends at school are all white and ‘she never saw herself as dferent’. However, an incident in  changed her attitude. “She was at the bus station trying to board a bus when the driver shut the door in her face and drove off, leaving her standing there.” Mrs Simpson said that after viewing footage of the incident, the company apologised and the driver was said to have been disciplined. She continued: “It’s there, and unless each company can do like the bus company, address the inidual who is the rotten egg instead of hiding it, and condoning it or trying to cover it up. Address it openly.” Following the incident, the family felt that somebody had listened to them, but Mrs Simpson said a lot of people are afraid to speak out. “Where does that anger go, where does that hurt go, it stays and grows and infiltrates society.” Confirming the incident, a Translink spokesperson stated: “A complaint was received on thSeptember  at Foyle Street bus station. “This was acknowledged, investigated and followed up. “Translink’s Dignity at Work policy, in which all staff are trained on their induction, makes it clear that we are fully committed to creating a harmonious working environment in which all employees are treated with respect and dignity, regardless of race, colour, ethnic or national origins. “This equally applies to how our staff are expected to treat passengers.” In response to criticism that now is not the right time to hold protests, Mrs Simpson said: “Coronavirus is affecting everyone. It’s affecting the Black, Asian and ethnic minority community more. “We’re being marginalised anyway, we’re being segregated anyway, whether by a natural cause or a man-made cause so give us a chance to speak in a safe space.” The level of support on Saturday surprised Mrs Simpson and she said she was ‘proud’ that people ‘challenged themselves’ by turning out.

These exclusive photographs show the special screens which have been erected at Tinneys Bar in Derry. All other pubs are expected to install similar screens between staff and customers as the hospitality sector reopens following the coronavirus lockdown.  A local blinds shop has been assisting Derry bars and businesses as they prepare to reopen safely. Ace Blinds have been operating in the Derry area, serving the community for over five years and employing local people. As businesses adjust to the so-called new normal after lockdown, they have to enforce social distancing and come up with innovative ways to protect their customers. googletag.cmd.push Therefore, Ace Blinds has fitted ‘COVID- roller shields’ in local bars and the orders have been mounting from other businesses in the city. “It has gone a bit crazy at the minute and we have already taken  orders for bars,” says John Kelly of Ace Blinds. It is new territory for Ace Blinds in terms of the material they are using. “The plastic material suits bars great as they can be moved up and down very easily, not like perspex, and they are a lot easier on the eye for customers, so more friendly. They can be attached to suspension ceilings with a special clip so no drillingneeds be. googletag.cmd.push “The material is easily cleaned, you just hold the bottom bar and wipe clean and it can be secured to bars or the groundneeded.” The company has fitted the bathroom at EI Engineering to separate sinks which provides an extra layer of protection for workers. Other businesses in the town have come to them with dferent proposals which they’re working through together. This week, the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds announced that all non-essential goods retailers in Northern Ireland can re-open from tomorrow. Pubs and restaurants are expected to follow suit in July. Confirming the ‘major step forward’, the Minister said: “The pandemic has had a devastating impact on the local economy. The recovery has already begun and it is time now for the pace to accelerate. The re-opening of all goods retail outlets will be a huge part of this. “The safety of staff and customers is of course paramount. All retailers must be able to implement measures that minimise the risk to their staff and to the people who visit their stores. “We will be co-existing with this virus for some time to come so it is vital that we continue to adhere to guidance to work and live safely.” The Minister added: “The re-opening of our local shopping sector is a signicant step forward in the Executive’s pathway to recovery. I and my Executive colleagues remain committed to moving forward in the recovery while at all times keeping the health, wellbeing and safety of people at the centre and being transparent in our approach.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Tucked off the Halfgain road, it is one of Slaughtneils greatest gems. Glenn, who coaches fitness in the wild outdoors with his company Wild Le, was due to celebrate his rd birthday by competing in a half triathlon, before it was cancelled due to the sporting lockdown. “I always try to do something challenging on or around my birthday. I guess it makes me feel alive as my inevitable demise looms ever closer,” Glenn said. It was time to put his creative mind to work and invent a new challenge, something on his doorstep. googletag.cmd.push “I love kettlebells and live in the middle of a nature reserve with loads of footpaths so it meant I could do the challenge without having to travel,” he points out. He has a background in combat sports, primarily Filipino Stick Fighting, is a big lover of tree climbing, cold water wild swimming. “A fellow stick fighter and kettlebell instructor, Dave Hedges, from Dublin completed a mile of swings a few years ago and sowed the seed to do it here.” As part of his challenge he aimed to raise money for local mental health charity, STEPS. After targetting pound as a total, he smashed it and currently has pound, in his Justgiving account. googletag.cmd.push “As someone who has and still does suffer from, at times acute anxiety, raising money for mental health support is a no-brainer,” he explains. “Suicide is the single biggest killer in men under the age of  and the daily number of deaths is going up for both men and women. In Northern Ireland the suicide rate is about double that of England, with almost  percent of our community suffering from mental health issues.” “We are all affected by mental health issues, either directly or indirectly, and its time for it to stop being a taboo subject.” A back injury curtailed Glenns early preparations and he switched rehab mode. His days comprised a series of flexibility routines. “The human body is remarkable at healing and movement is medicine. After a couple of weeks I felt I was good to go, so started doing kettlebell swings daily, building up in volume and then moving onto to the walking swing whereby i take a step forward at the top of each swing.” With over , swings during his iron mile, technique was everything. There was the small matter of managing his hands, such was the wear and tear from the kettlebell. “The kettlebell is constantly moving inside your grip so any hard skin or calluses there tend to rip off,” Glenn outlines. “So I had a weekly routine of filing, shaving and moisturising my hands. They are more rubbery that leathery. “I used a kg kettlebell. This would be fairly light for my average workout but after , swings it felt anything but light. If I do it again i may go up to a kg. The heat was the biggest issue. Within five minutes of his scheduled .am start, he was dripping with sweat. “I was wishing we started two hours earlier, sweat in the eyes and on the palms is less than ideal.” With about  metres to go, Glenn could feel blisters popping on his fingers, but the finish line was in sight. One year older, another challenge met and money raised for a worthwhile cause.

Tucked off the Halfgain road, it is one of Slaughtneils greatest gems. Glenn, who coaches fitness in the wild outdoors with his company Wild Le, was due to celebrate his rd birthday by competing in a half triathlon, before it was cancelled due to the sporting lockdown. “I always try to do something challenging on or around my birthday. I guess it makes me feel alive as my inevitable demise looms ever closer,” Glenn said. It was time to put his creative mind to work and invent a new challenge, something on his doorstep. googletag.cmd.push “I love kettlebells and live in the middle of a nature reserve with loads of footpaths so it meant I could do the challenge without having to travel,” he points out. He has a background in combat sports, primarily Filipino Stick Fighting, is a big lover of tree climbing, cold water wild swimming. “A fellow stick fighter and kettlebell instructor, Dave Hedges, from Dublin completed a mile of swings a few years ago and sowed the seed to do it here.” As part of his challenge he aimed to raise money for local mental health charity, STEPS. After targetting pound as a total, he smashed it and currently has pound, in his Justgiving account. googletag.cmd.push “As someone who has and still does suffer from, at times acute anxiety, raising money for mental health support is a no-brainer,” he explains. “Suicide is the single biggest killer in men under the age of  and the daily number of deaths is going up for both men and women. In Northern Ireland the suicide rate is about double that of England, with almost  percent of our community suffering from mental health issues.” “We are all affected by mental health issues, either directly or indirectly, and its time for it to stop being a taboo subject.” A back injury curtailed Glenns early preparations and he switched rehab mode. His days comprised a series of flexibility routines. “The human body is remarkable at healing and movement is medicine. After a couple of weeks I felt I was good to go, so started doing kettlebell swings daily, building up in volume and then moving onto to the walking swing whereby i take a step forward at the top of each swing.” With over , swings during his iron mile, technique was everything. There was the small matter of managing his hands, such was the wear and tear from the kettlebell. “The kettlebell is constantly moving inside your grip so any hard skin or calluses there tend to rip off,” Glenn outlines. “So I had a weekly routine of filing, shaving and moisturising my hands. They are more rubbery that leathery. “I used a kg kettlebell. This would be fairly light for my average workout but after , swings it felt anything but light. If I do it again i may go up to a kg. The heat was the biggest issue. Within five minutes of his scheduled .am start, he was dripping with sweat. “I was wishing we started two hours earlier, sweat in the eyes and on the palms is less than ideal.” With about  metres to go, Glenn could feel blisters popping on his fingers, but the finish line was in sight. One year older, another challenge met and money raised for a worthwhile cause.

There was substantial damage done to the crop.The farmer continued: ldquoI also had a man who was purposely letting his dog into a field to go to the toilet every morning. This field is used to cut silage for the animals to eat in winter. What these people donrsquot understand is that dog faeces is potentially harmful to cattle.ldquoI appreciate that people like to go for a walk and it is unprecedented times where people are more cautious about meeting people on the roads, but they canrsquot use farmland as recreational ground.ldquoThat is a farmerrsquos work space and every blade of grass is used in farming, eventhere areno cows in the field that they are walking in. The ground is being used for something, be it winter fodder or rotational grazing.ldquoThere are cows calving in my fields and what I am more worried about is that someone is going to get hurt. Cows are extremely volatile around calving season and they will attackthey think their young are in danger.ldquoThe most dangerous animal on a farm is not a bull, itrsquos a newly calved cow. They can and will kill. People think that cows are docile but they can kill.The farmer added: ldquoI am having to look into getting professional CCTV equipment put in place over the land, an expense I could really do without.Mr McGrath said people walking through gated fields, leaving the gates lying open and allowing the livestock to get out placed an ldquounnecessary burden on farmers.ldquoWith some Covid- restrictions being eased itrsquos great to see that people are able to get out and about a bit more whether that be for walking their dogs, going for a longer walk or run or just getting out and about. We need to make full use of our wonderful natural surroundings for our own health and for our own emotional and psychological wellbeing.ldquoHowever, there are issues creeping in regarding walkers and runners using gated fields and pieces of farmland as access points whether for a shortcut or just because they feel they can do this.He continued: ldquoWhen I was growing up in Downpatrick you didnrsquot dare trespass on the land. There was enough respect for the farmer and the great contribution they make to our local communities and as a child probably a healthy level of fear as well.ldquoI want our communities to respect our farmers and to appreciate that they give to the community so much more than they get back.ldquoSoyoursquore out and about and enjoying your walks or runs, please stick to the public roads and public rights of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A walk in the pairc  ","story":"LOCAL GAA clubs are gearing up for ato action.After a three-month lockdown caused by the Covid- pandemic, clubs can look forward to a resumption of gaelic games.Thatrsquos good news for players and spectators, who have been starved of action.The clubs were able to unlock their gates for the first time this week.From Monday they were allowed to open their grounds for small groups of people to use walkways.Non-contact training for club teams will begin on June , initially in groups of no more than ten players with two coaches.Full-contact training can take place from July , with underage games commencing on the same date.

The industry directly employs , people, with thousands more supported in work through the supply chain.The impact of the virus on the sector could be devastating, Baroness Ritchie told peers during a debate on measures needed to repair the UK economy.ldquoProjections indicate that this level of employment could be reduced by  per cent, she said. ldquoThere has been no spend in the tourism industry since March  and it will be late July before tourism outlets open.ldquoMany of those people who will find themselves out of work will have to rely on the benefit system which is already under extreme pressure. It is punitive and needs to be overhauled with the needs of people put at the centre of the debate.She continued: ldquoTo encourage visitors to come to our region to spend money and to invest in our economy, we need to protect our people.ldquoThat means we must ensure our shops are allowed to open subject to social distancing rules and the British Government needs to abolish air passenger duty and reduce VAT on tourism.ldquoThat would assist our hospitality industry and those employed in it as well as the many people who depend on it for their basic source of income. These fiscal measures could indirectly make contributions to reducing inequalities in our society and community.

reinstatement of services and staff continues and that the timeline for doing so is published so that the public is fully aware of all the circumstances, she said.ldquoUndoubtedly, all the staff in

initiative aimed at revitalising Ardglass harbour are expected to be published before the end of the month.Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots is due to unveil the first stage of a report from the Fishing and Seafood Development programme whichwill include a timeline for work that needs to be done at Ardglass and the other Co Down ports of Kilkeel and Portavogie.Earlier this year, Mr Poots met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss the future of the village port.They highlighted the importance of the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy and outlined planned improvement work at the harbour, including deepening it to facilitate larger herring and mackerel vessels.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran emphasised the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure, insisting that the port receives its fair share of funding to help enhance the existing fleet.They said that the harbour was ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed in Ardglass.The politicians said additional investment is critical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand with appropriate slipways provided for larger vessels to dock safely.Several weeks after the meeting with Mr Poots it was revealed that ambitious plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.Cllr Curran, who is keen to hear what Mr Poots has to say in a few weeksrsquo time, said there were plans to deepen the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.He confirmed that consideration is also being given to creating a pontoon with finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.ldquoNew investment in Ardglass harbour can help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities, said Cllr Curran. ldquoThe port plays a ket part in the local economy and is at the heart of village le.ldquoArdglass lands some of the largest quantities of prawns in Ireland and deepening the harbour will mean that larger fishing vessels that currently dock where, will be able to access local facilities.Cllr Curran also fears that not deepening the harbour could potentially lead to an economic collapse for the Ardglass fishing industry.He added: ldquoI look forward to hear what the fisheries minister has to say towards the end of the month and hope that it will be positively good news for Ardglass..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Roadworks causing delays in town centre  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK businesswoman has called on Phoenix Gas to complete pipe laying work in St Patrickrsquos Avenue by next Monday mdash as promised.The company is investing poundm investment across East Down and to date has laid over  miles of natural gas pipeline, with contractors also currently working in Newcastle.Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents, with work in Downpatrick starting several weeks ago.A mains pipeline has already been laid in a number of areas in the town, with contractors recently completing work in the Edward Street area. Contractors then moved to Pound Lane and are now in St Patrickrsquos Avenue.Eleanor Telford, who owns Telrsquos Confectionary with her husband Alan, said that she believed that the pipe-laying would start outside her shop imminently.ldquoI suppose the work has to be done sometime and perhaps itrsquos better done now when things are still quiet, but I hope the work is completed within the time we have been told, she said.Motorists have faced some delays in St Patrickrsquos Avenue which feeds into Market Street, the townrsquos main shopping area.Phoenix hopes that by expediting its multi-million pound investment programme now, it will avoid further disruption later in the year, while also providing consumers with additional access to fuel choice before the winter period.The company insists that the safety of its staff and communities is of paramount importance, with the current pipe-laying work scheduled following ldquorobust risk assessment and the implementation of additional operational procedures, in line with government guidance.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran also appealed to Phoenix to complete the work as quickly as possible and for road users to remain patient during the work in the town centre which he said will result in inconvenience.He said it was always anticipated the work on such a major investment in towns and villages across the district would result in some degree of disruption and inconvenience.Cllr Curran said that the arrival of natural gas provides consumers with an added element of choice when it comes to their heating needs and said the investment in Downpatrick and right across the district opens up new opportunities to thousands of homeowners and the townrsquos business community.ldquoPipe-laying on such a large scale along congested streets and town centres results in disruption and while issues have arisen in the past, Phoenix has always done it best to minimise disruption, he said.ldquoBringing forward the work in Downpatrick, especially as schools across the town are closed as part of the coronavirus lockdown measures, makes sense. However, there will be concern about this project across the business community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Sam helping lift spirits with nursing home gigs  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH musician is lting the spirits of residents at a local nursing home mdash despite the Coronavirus lockdown and heart surgery.For over  years Sam Miskelly has been entertaining the residents of Fishbourne House at Spa, with his accordion.However, his weekly visits were put on hold after he underwent heart surgery several months ago and had stents fitted.He recovered only for the Covid- virus to spread around the globe, which meant he was no longer to go inside the home.Undaunted, the  year-old former lorry driver now sets up his accordion, amplier and microphone in the garden of the nursing home and residents are still able to enjoy his tuneful medleys.Sam is a regular performer at old tyme dances at a number of local venues and it was at one of them where he met Mr William Brown, owner of Fishbourne House.ldquoOne night he asked meI would play music for the residents.

Please try again later.Submitting...Not since the strikes of the early s have our schools closed and this time children will go some four months without schooling and who knows what September holds.Education is either important or it isn’t.Numeracy and literacy levels will not have stayed level during this time, they will have fallen by close on a full year . Catching up will take a huge effort. Where are the resources for this Reading scores for example affect exam results and from there access to higher education and employment.This is serious.I can only imagine the stress and angst some parents are feeling as they struggle with home teaching.As the paper reported it is the disadvantaged who are becoming more disadvantaged. Does anyone seriously believe that children who can’t or won’t work at home at the best of times are doing so now  Many children will be falling further behind.Why aren’t we talking about how to get our children back at school  Naturally parents, children and staff are fearful of ato school, so let’s look at what the science and the scientists say. Either it is safe to go to school or it isn’t.According to the Depart ment Health Northern Ireland Dashboard one person under  has died in NI and not one under  and % of the deaths have been of people over , and the Office of National Statistics reports thatyou are under  you have a one in a million chance of dying ProfessorKarol Sikora, who holds a double first from Cambridge and wasformerly Director of Cancer services at the World Health Organisationsaid with regard to primary school and nurseries “opening schools is absolutely vital” ...“the people who are suffering most are the most disadvantaged” and “the evidence that young children spread this is almost zero”. He goes onto say ,”why wait until September ” The Chief Scientic Officer of the WHO mirrors his views.Prof John Lee, Professor of Clinical Pathology at Hull, sums it up thus “The majority of cases are asymptomatic. The most common symptoms are not fever, cough, headache and respiratory symptoms they are no symptoms at all. Somewhere around . per cent of those who catch the disease recover.”The re-opening of schools in a phased and conditional way places immense stress on principals  School Management Teamswho will have to reassure children, parents and staff whilst at the same time organising staff rotas, part class rotas, year group rotas, curriculum arrangements — say  subjects, staffing, desks ,movements, toilets, canteens, ,break times and so on and in many cases teach. In a post primary school with  in a year group – so  classes – which, with phasing, would mean with, each class ided into ,  sub groups— the school has five year groups then that is  sub groups to rotate across eg  subjects with probably a rotated staff.Similarly in a primary school, complicated by the principal with a substantial teaching commitment.How do you do it, how do you ensure continuity of education The ‘safety measures’ — masks, screens, Personal Protection Equipmentetc give the illusion of safety whilst increasing fear and anxiety and this will hugely increasethechildren do notto school soon. I see groups of children playing and associating naturally – sothey go into school and have to stay two metres apart,how absurd is that  .Mental health issues are on the increase in schools as it is — there aren’t enough resources at the moment, there is a crisis looming when the children–we continue to fill them with fear. Principals are faced with one particularly dficult dilemma. Given that the government is not putting in any extra money, the principal can phasechildren in say one day a week and they miss out on their complete education, GCSE preparation etc orthey can bring in lots of subs and run the budget into chaos, for which they willbe heavily criticised.The obstacles are insurmountable.Our children need educated in an environment conducive to learning, not one filled with fear and anxiety. Feedback from the teacher and social interaction is what makes learning happen, why the need for complicated and impractical phasing  It is either safe or it isn’t.Michael Fullan, the esteemed educationalist said, “scratch a good teacher and you will find a moral purpose” and now is surely the time to demonstrate our moral purpose as public servants. Surely it is up to the UK and Irish governmentsto assuage fears the of the public first, then people willwillingly to the proper learning environment As FD Roosevelt said “there is nothing to fear, but fear itself”.• Hugh McCarthy is a former principal of Killicomaine Junior High School——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Work has been going on for some months digging a trench round the curtilage of the building, preparing foundations for a new structure, removing an important hedge, cutting roots of mature trees and damaging the ‘protected’ pillars of the boundary walls. After many weeks of pressure by residents, the planners served Tree Preservation orders and a stop notice last week, long after damage had been done.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

make face masks compulsory public transport","story":"Mark Drakeford said Englands decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel

decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel alternative.\" article_url   content_id

option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

People are going to lose their jobs, he said.Ministers are under intense pressure from Conservative MPs to go further by the easing the two-metre social-distancing so the hard pressed hospitality sector can also reopen.Mr Johnson confirmed at the weekend that he had ordered a ldquocomprehensive Downing Street review of the regulation. vw,vw,px, px\"A woman wears a face mask as she exits the ticket barriers at Brixton Underground station in south London The Prime Minister said the falling numbers of Covid- cases meant there was a greater ldquomargin for manoeuvre as the chances of coming into contact with someone with the disease diminished.Mr Sunak said it would be an ldquoall round survey of the issue drawing on advice from economists as well as the scientic and medical experts who have been advising ministers on the pandemic.He said it would be ministers, not the scientists, who would make the decisions on any easing, fuelling the belief at Westminster that the relationship between ministers and the advisers is becoming increasingly strained.The review is reported to be scheduled to be completed by July , the date slated by the Government for the hospitality sector to start welcoming back customers.Many pubs and restaurants have warned however that it will simply not be viable for them to do so unless the social-distancing rule is cut to no more than one metre. vw,vw,px, px\"Daily coronavirus tests in the UK This comes as the World Health Organisationhas urged the Government to not lt the lockdown until it is proven its widely-criticised coronavirus contact tracing system works.After it was revealed the Government failed to trace the contacts of a third of those testing positive in the first week of the new system, Dr Hans Kluge, the WHOrsquos director for Europe, warned Britain was still in the midst of a ldquovery active phase of the pandemic.Dr Kluge said while the tracking in England of some , contacts of , infected people was ldquoencouraging,the Government needed to be sure it could ldquoaggressively track infectionsit is to reopen the countryrsquos economy.ldquoContact tracing is key especially as the UK starts to relax the social and physical distancing measures, Dr Kluge told .ldquoThere has to be a robust track-and-trace system in place of operation. I would like to hellip say we need an effective tracking system in place, it is one of the measures that we recommend that are in place now.Labour has now joined Tory MPs in urging ministers to set out a clear plan for the hospitality sector to .Shadow business minister Lucy Powell said: ldquoWe urge the government to publish an action plan whichmaximiseseconomic viability, whilstminimisingtherisk to the healthofcustomers and staff.ldquoIf they fail to act, our communities will lose much-loved pubs, bars and restaurants, and wersquoll see a wave of closures and unemployment which will damage villages, towns and cities across the country.Monday will also see secondary schools in England reopening to some pupils with Year  and Year  students ing to get some time with their teachers ahead of their GCSE and A-level examinations next year.The Government has faced criticism that it has not done more to get schools reopened with some children facing the prospect of having been out of the classroom for almost six months by the time theyin September.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson was last week forced to abandon plans for all primary pupils tofor at least a month before the summer break admitting it would not be possible while social-distancing rules remain in place.Currently, primary schools in England are open to pupils in reception, Year one and Year six. vw,vw,px, px\"Children eat lunch in segregated positions at Kempsey Primary School in Worcester However ministers are planning a fresh push to get more children back by reaffirming schools can take pupils from other year groups providing they have the capacity to do so safely.A No  source said Mr Johnson was ldquoacutely aware of the impact the extended closure was having on pupils and was working with Education Secretary Gavin Williamson on a major ldquocatch-up plan.Meanwhile many retailers were simply looking forward to getting back to business again after so long away.Andrew Murphy, executive director of operations at John Lewis, told the PA news agency he expected customers would be surprised by the ldquorelative calmness of the experience.ldquoIrsquom hopeful that, while the overall atmosphere will feel a bit dferent to them, what theyrsquoll actually find is a kind of pleasant surprise that itrsquos calm, itrsquos pleasant, itrsquos well ordered, but itrsquos also still got the real advantage of the physical shopping experience, he said..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Shops reopen as rule on mandatory face coverings comes into force article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A wide range of services were stood down or scaled back due to the risk of spread of COVID-. New services were introduced to meet the predicted demands of the pandemic. A spokesperson said: With the first peak of the COVID- outbreak in Northern Ireland having passed, the Trust is now focused on planning, with our HSC partners, how to restart services while maintaining sufficient flexibility so that services can respond to future waves of this disease. In working together with our health and social care partners across NI to implement the recovery of non-COVID- HSC Services, the agreed regional approach will be to ensure equity of access to treatment for patients and clients across NI, to minimise transmission of COVID- and to protect the most urgent services. A set of guiding principles in the form of a ‘checklist’ has been established by the Department of Healthto guide service planning. The DoH has asked that service restart plans be assessed against the checklist to ensure that they have been subject to a rigorous risk assessment, take account of new ways of working and can be safely implemented in line with social distancing, use of personal protective equipmentand infection prevention and control requirements.The Western Trust has introduced a Reset Framework to support staff in assessing the impact of scaling up or restarting services and to ensure there is a rigorous and careful approach to planning.A spokesperson continued: The Western Trust Stage  Plan identies the services we have maintained throughout these initial months of the COVID- pandemic across a wide range of areas. It identies those that we will continue and others that we will begin to restart or scale up. It sets out some of the important preparation work needed to provide COVID- safe environments and working practices, to protect our staff, patients and service users. There are a number of constraints which are foremost in the planning process, including availability of PPE availability of drugs and restrictions on the practice of vulnerable staff.Our Stage  plan will focus on:Supporting strong community services for frail or older people. Preparing for the impact of the COVID- pandemic on mental health services. Managing risk, and providing COVID--safe services for staff and our service users. Involving our staff and service users.Speaking about the launch of Stage  of the Trust’s Reset Plan, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Western Trust chief executive, said: “There is no doubt that this has been one of the most dficult periods we have ever had to experience.I would like to thank our community and hospital staff for their hard work and dedication. Members of the public have also been unwavering in their support and this has not gone unnoticed. “There are many challenges which we have faced and will continue to face in the new COVID- environment. Our Stage  plan sets out the steps we are taking to rebuild, reset and make necessary changes to our services into the future.“It is accepted that COVID- remains a public health risk to our population and a phased and flexible approach is needed to restarting services. As a result, the way services are delivered may look and feel dferent. There are opportunities to do things dferently in ways that improve care. Many great initiatives have already begun.” Dr Kilgallen continued: “While there are signicant challenges ahead, the public should be reassured that we are committed to providing the best possible care in environments that reduce the risk of infection for staff and services users alike. We will continue to work diligently to create COVID--safe environments while we rebuild services.” A copy of the rebuilding plan – Stage One can you be found on the Trust website www.westerntrust.hscni.net  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bddcdbb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ecfdaeff   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
