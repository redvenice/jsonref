Eden Sassoon has unveiled her stunning and youthful new look after undergoing a $25,000 AuraLyft  face-lift last month   Before and after: Sassoon, 45, says the $25,000 procedure - dubbed the Ferrari of face-lifts - has left her looking and feeling much younger. The end result, pictured right, is undoubtedly impressive with no visible scars or marks  Sassoon admits she wasn\u0027t happy with her \u0027extra skin\u0027 and neck that she had tried to tighten by doing exercise           DailyMailTV captured the moment Sassoon went under the knife. Above, a surgeon peels back her face and slices chunks of skin away  Our cameras captured the graphic moment a surgeon peeled back the star\u0027s face and sliced chunks of skin away.But while footage of the three-hour procedure may be gruesome, the end result is undoubtedly impressive with no visible scars or marks.Eden says the \u0027incredible\u0027 face-lift, performed earlier this month, has truly boosted her confidence.\u0027I look amazing. I feel 24, I\u0027m 45. It\u0027s been an incredible experience. I see myself in the mirror and that\u0027s me,\u0027 she told DailyMailTV. \u0027I\u0027ve been exercising a lot. I feel like I feel as if this is how I should have always been.\u0027I showed up there 45 minutes early, I was dancing and singing. From the moment we decided to do this I\u0027ve been ready. I\u0027ve wanted to do this for the last four or five years.\u0027The AuraLyft face-lift uses the same technique as facial reconstruction for cancer patients.The procedure was conducted by Dr. Ben Talei, one of the most respected facial plastic surgeons in the country, who was featured in September on CBS show The Doctors.His state of the art Beverly Hills Center for Plastic \u0026amp Laser Surgery specializes in advanced face-lift procedures, rhinoplasty, eyebrow lifts, non-surgical skin rejuvenation, among other things.          Pre-surgery: The procedure was conducted by Dr Ben Talei, one of the most respected facial plastic surgeons in the country, who was featured in September on CBS show The Doctors          The AuraLyft technique requires only a local anesthetic to the patient\u0027s face, meaning Eden was awake during the procedure           Eden admits she was able to experience every moment. \u0027I was lying there and in my own head I\u0027m thinking, Wow, this is really an interesting experience. I really don\u0027t know what he\u0027s doing, but oh it feels tighter there,\u0027 she said The AuraLyft technique requires only a local anesthetic to the patient\u0027s face, which reduces recovery time and cost, but also meant Eden was awake during the procedure as our camera rolled.And the blonde beauty says she experienced every moment.\u0027I was really nervous about that,\u0027 Eden confessed. \u0027But everyone in the room was so incredibly full of love and positive energy that I felt so safe. I could hear them speak and I could feel them turn my neck and pull this way, and I could make noises. If I really tried, I probably could have opened my eyes and spoke.\u0027I was lying there and in my own head I\u0027m thinking, Wow, this is really an interesting experience. I really don\u0027t know what he\u0027s doing, but oh it feels tighter there. I could feel him touch my leg every sort of 30, 45 seconds and it, and it gave me this sense of calm. Not once was I scared or thought I\u0027m not doing this.\u0027Eden says she\u0027s excited to watch the footage of Dr Talei slicing her face.\u0027I cannot wait to watch that video,\u0027 she told DailyMailTV. \u0027I watched somebody else after while I was in bed healing and I\u0027m like, oh my God, and that\u0027s what he just did to my face? He\u0027s so talented, the work that he\u0027s doing is spectacular, I want to sit in on everyone\u0027s surgery and watch.\u0027The former Real Housewives star grew up around beauty, and said the odd \u0027nip and tuck\u0027 here and there was normal in the Sassoon household, adding that she believes as the face of a beauty business, you\u0027ve got to look your best.\u0027I was always complaining about my neck and this loose skin. I have these fitness studios, Pilates studios, and as Vidal Sassoon\u0027s daughter I was raised that this was something that was okay,\u0027 Eden told DailyMailTV. \u0027If I can work out everyday and push my body to a limit to tighten itself, why isn\u0027t this tightening?          DailyMailTV cameras captured the three-hour surgery which Sassoon admits she\u0027s excited to watch           Recovery: Sassoon poses with Dr Ben Talei while giving two thumbs up post surgery           Dr Talei said the procedure on Eden was a \u0027zero-tension lift\u0027, requiring no stitches, but took off a lot of skin\u0027Being raised in the beauty and health business, there\u0027s a certain expectation on you to look good. But I think it\u0027s more of an internal job. I wasn\u0027t happy with this extra skin. I wasn\u0027t happy with my neck.\u0027And thanks to Dr Talei that\u0027s now fixed.\u0027AuraLyft is completely different and the best type to do on anybody,\u0027 Dr Talei said.\u0027Without the need for fat grafting or fillers it gives the maximum that any surgery can give you in terms of rejuvenation of the face and neck while also providing the absolute most natural outcome from the top of the brow to the bottom of the neck.\u0027Dr Talei said the procedure on Eden was a \u0027zero-tension lift\u0027, requiring no stitches, but took off a lot of skin.\u0027She\u0027s only mid-40s and she had a shocking amount of laxity in the skin, and that\u0027s usually the case for someone who\u0027s getting a face-lift a little younger. We took off enough skin to form a wallet, a woman\u0027s purse.\u0027She came back the next day and took the head wrap off, and already she looked great. We\u0027re doing a lot things now in the operation to prevent bruising and make sure they heal as quickly as possible, so she looked good in the first couple of days. Now about three weeks later she\u0027s doing Pilates and already looking great in photos.\u0027Dr Talei claims the results are so refined, \u0027that nobody, no matter how close they are to the patient, knows they\u0027ve had surgery.\u0027Eden said she wanted a more natural-looking face-lift, after getting compliments over her natural look compared to her \u0027glammed-up\u0027 appearance in Real Housewives.\u0027There are eyes on you and everyone\u0027s gonna have their own judgment. I try to not let that in because it\u0027s a lot,\u0027 she said.          Reality star: Sassoon was a recurring guest on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills in Season 7          The mom-of-two has children by her ex-husband Tomer Devito who she orced in 2008. The two remain on friendly terms but Sassoon reveals she\u0027s \u0027back on the market\u0027 \u0027Having done the Housewives season, I see people and they\u0027re like, God you\u0027re so beautiful in person, you wore so much makeup. And I did, I tried to glam it up.\u0027If you\u0027re going to get the real me, you\u0027re not going to get a lot of makeup, you\u0027re going to get hair really natural, you\u0027re going to get my tattoos,\u0027 she added. \u0027I like to be physically fit and I want just a healthy, clean, glowy look. I think there\u0027s a stigma with TV, that you play the part.\u0027Eden says that now she\u0027s back in the dating game and looking and feeling younger, she hopes to bag a younger man.\u0027We still have to play this game and oh my God I\u0027m exhausted. But now that I look 10 to 15 years younger, I can kind of play the game with the youngsters,\u0027 she said.The Real Housewife hinted that she already had a \u0027quarterback\u0027 in her love life, but added that she is still enjoying \u0027a view on the bench\u0027, and is very much looking to score.The health and fitness entrepreneur said she wanted to televise her face-lift to remove the mystery of the process for other women, showing them how it really works.\u0027So many people want to know how and why some women look like this, but everyone doesn\u0027t tell the truth. I\u0027m 100 per cent open and honest about it,\u0027 she said.          New face, new me: Sassoon debuted her youthful new look last weekend at the 2019 Pre-GRAMMY event presented by OK!, Star, In Touch and Life \u0026amp Style magazines in LA  The reality star is so happy with her surgery, that she\u0027s even recommending Dr Talei to her daughter for plastic surgery.\u0027My daughter is someone who is a beautiful young girl and struggles a little bit with a facial feature,\u0027 she revealed. \u0027And because as a kid I did the same thing, I can\u0027t say no.

He did not specify howA lawyer for AMI meanwhile described the source on Sunday by stating: \u0027The story was given to The National Enquirer by a reliable source that had been giving information to the National Enquirer for seven years prior to this story. It was a source that was well known to both Mr. Bezos and Miss Sanchez.\u0027                            They were talking marriage. The three of us had discussed before that, at some point, this was going to be a scandal. My advice was, let’s get to the other side. Our analogy was always that they were landing a 747. I told them, You’re both pilots and you’ve never landed a 747, but that’s what we’re trying to do here.\u0027                        Michael makes an analogy comparing his sister\u0027s affair to a large plan  His sister is actually the second person close to Michael whose texts have shown up in The National Enquirer recently, with the tabloid also running racy exchanges between Fox Business Network host Charles Payne and Scottie Nell Hughes. American Media defended the emails sent by the National Enquirer\u0027s Chief Content Officer and the firm\u0027s legal team threatening to publish nude photos of Bezos and Sanchez if he did not drop an investigation into how editors learned of the billionaire\u0027s affair.  \u0027American Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos. Further, at the time of the recent allegations made by Mr. Bezos, it was in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him,\u0027 the company said in a statement released on Friday. \u0027Nonetheless, in light of the nature of the allegations published by Mr. Bezos, the Board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims. Upon completion of that investigation, the Board will take whatever appropriate action is necessary.\u0027            Cheers: His sister is actually the second person close to Michael whose texts have shown up in The National Enquirer, with Scotty Neal Hughes (above) suffering a similar leakThe American Media board is comprised of four iniduals, including: owner David Pecker Evan Ratner, a partner  at Chatham Asset Management Barry Schwartz, also a partner at at Chatham Asset Management and David R. Hughes, the former executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer of Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc. Chatham Asset Management has an 80 percent stake in American Media according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, it was revealed on Friday that federal prosecutors were reviewing the emails sent by AMI to Bezos in order to determine if the company violated its immunity deal by blackmailing Bezos. Bezos meanwhile said that he believed Saudia Arabia played a role in AMI\u0027s decision last week.\u0027Several days ago, an AMI leader advised us that Mr. Pecker is “apoplectic” about our investigation. For reasons still to be better understood, the Saudi angle seems to hit a particularly sensitive nerve,\u0027 wrote Bezos in a post on Thursday.\u0027A few days after hearing about Mr. Pecker’s apoplexy, we were approached, verbally at first, with an offer.

Since then, there has been serious debate over whether the wreck should be excavated with artifacts kept in a museum, or if it should be allowed to rest undisturbed underwater\u0027It was the wreck that every wreck-finder wanted to find,\u0027 said er Richard Keen who began searching in 1973 for Victory the predecessor of Admiral Lord Nelson\u0027s more famous namesake ship.The professional er from Guernsey grouped together with five others to scour the seabed for two months near Les Casquets, a group of islands eight miles west of Alderney the northernmost Channel Island.The group did manage to locate the wreck of passenger steamer Stella, which sank in 1899 claiming 105 lives but HMS Victory remained elusive.Search efforts initially focused on the infamous Casquets - where the ship was thought to have been wrecked due to the poor navigation of Balchin.How ISIS was brought to its knees: Bloodthirsty army of...A heroes’ welcome, finally: Thousands of brave African...\u0027She\u0027s heavily pregnant... what threat will she be?\u0027: Former...Share this articleBut in 2009,  Odyssey Marine Exploration announced it had discovered Victory, 62 mile away from those rocks.This suggested that a fierce storm rather than a navigational error had been behind the sinking.As with the Mary Rose, the Tudor warship which was raised in 1982, there was great public interest in the find.Built during a period of British naval ascendancy, Victory, and its more famous successor, were two of the most expensive and grandest ships of the period.\u0027It was a time when the Royal Navy\u0027s power was absolutely central to British power, the growth of its maritime empire, and its prosperity,\u0027 said Philip Sheldon, executive director of heritage at the National Museum of the Royal Navy.          Admiral Sir John Balchin was aboard HMS Victory during the ship\u0027s final voyage in October 1744 and he was long thought to be responsible for its sinking, due to poor navigation. However, in 2009,  Odyssey Marine Exploration announced it had discovered Victory, 62 mile away from where it was thought to have sunk. This suggested that a fierce storm rather than a navigational error had been behind the sinking          Bringing Victory\u0027s treasures to the surface would be a costly exercise - one companies like Odyssey would usually fund through the sale of artifacts. This has prompted a tense legal battle over whether the wreck should be allowed to lay undisturbed or should instead be brought to the surface and taken to a museumIn addition to the cannon, rigging, glass bottle fragments and remains of the hull and anchors were discovered.But a massive gold hoard rumoured to be aboard the Victory has not been found.There is still more to be learned from the ship, Mr Sheldon said but the question remains - should that be done through surveying the site underwater, or should Victory be excavated?One man who is convinced Victory\u0027s artefacts are best taken out of harm\u0027s way is Dr Sean Kingsley a marine archaeologist for the Maritime Heritage Foundation (MHF), which was gifted the wreck site in 2012.He would like to see artefacts brought up and displayed in a UK museum.\u0027The government believes this unique wreck can be managed untouched, 80km offshore, in one of the world\u0027s busiest sea lanes.\u0027An irreplaceable piece of British history ends up abandoned, out of sight and mind, with the government\u0027s stamp of approval.\u0027The site is also at risk of damage from fishing trawlers, erosion and illegal salvage, something noted by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in 2014.While the extent of threat to the wreck from fishing and looting is disputed, Dr Kingsley is concerned a 2018 decision to put the foundation\u0027s initial 2014 \u0027research and rescue\u0027 application on hold will mean the site could be further threatened.While there is a consensus on the historical importance of the wreck, not everyone in the archaeological world agrees with the Maritime Heritage Foundation\u0027s plans for the site.\u0027This is basically a grave - this is the last resting place of 1,100 British sailors and it should not be disturbed lightly,\u0027 said Robert Yorke, chairman of the Joint Nautical Archaeology Policy Committee.

The 55-year-old began bombarding Mavis with flowers, letters and poems referring to her as ‘my darling angel’ and ‘my most special friend’The tribunal ruled that the doctor, who admitted accepting the money, had ‘indirectly encouraged’ Mavis, but it cleared McFarlane of being ‘predatory’ and of ‘influencing her’ into parting with her savings. They found that Mavis had the capacity to make her own choices and accepted that a ‘special friendship’ had developed between the two.However, Mavis’s family — who believe the GP should have been struck off — are demanding she returns the money desperately needed to pay for the severely ill pensioner’s care.And the Mail can confirm, as the tribunal noted, that the disgraced doctor is still making visits to see Mavis at the £795-a-week Nottinghamshire care home where she has been receiving round-the-clock care since suffering a debilitating stroke in June 2017.For, despite admitting to the tribunal that she should never have taken the money, McFarlane is adamant that the friendship is genuine and was never motivated by financial gain.Mavis’s relatives have decided not to attempt to stop the brief monthly visits because Mavis, who has no children, is very frail, has suffered from dementia since her stroke and is unaware that her former doctor has been suspended.‘It wouldn’t do any good,’ says John Hemstalk, 67, Mavis’s nephew and her lasting power of attorney. ‘My auntie is not aware of what’s going on. She is very, very poorly and my brother and I decided that it would be churlish to deprive her of visitors when she gets very few.’Five dead in warehouse massacre: Laid-off worker, 45,...Ryan Adams is dropped by sponsors, removed from radio, and...Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox in private jet terror:...Share this articleMr Hemstalk told the medical tribunal that his aunt’s massive cash gifts to McFarlane were only discovered in 2017 when he took over her financial affairs after her stroke. When he asked his aunt about it, Mavis denied having given McFarlane any money — possibly because she was afraid of getting the doctor into trouble.McFarlane had previously warned her of such a possibility. Among the dozens of letters and cards she sent to Mavis over a decade is one from November 2008 in which the GP makes clear: ‘We simply need to be careful that those who do not understand that our friendship is quite apart from who your doctor is, do not then accuse me of taking advantage of your kindness.‘I have simply grown to love you as a true and wonderful friend, which is quite apart from — and nothing to do with — me being your doctor.’The tribunal heard that McFarlane suggested an ‘excellent solution’ to this ethical dilemma because ‘the GMC are very strict about these things’. She encouraged Mavis to switch to another female doctor at the Crown House Surgery and told her to falsely claim she was doing so on the grounds that McFarlane’s waiting times had become too long.‘If anyone asks why you changed, you can explain, it is because I have gone “part-time” (though you know as well as I do that 50 hours plus a week of work is not part-time!!).‘This would be the best compromise, it would make me feel so much more at ease, as I do not want to feel hindered in being your friend.’Unfortunately, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service regarded this ‘compromise’ as an attempt ‘to conceal the nature of her relationship’ with Mavis who, they said, was vulnerable at the time.          Dr Andrea Mcfarlane practised at the Crown House Surgery in Retford in NottinghamshireTurn back the clock to 2004 when McFarlane first became Mavis’s GP and it is not immediately clear why the two women, who are separated by a 33-year age gap, should have become friends in the first place.Andrea McFarlane was born Andrea Sigune Urania Lindenberg in Scotland in 1964 and was one of six children raised within a Camphill Community in Aberdeen.Camphill, which was founded in Scotland in 1940 by a small group of refugees and has branches around the world, is based on the principles of ‘anthroposophy’ — a belief system created by the Austrian social and educational reformer Rudolf Steiner. It is dedicated to building communities ‘where everyone can find purpose and belonging’ and extols the virtues of living in extended families.Andrea’s German father joined the community as a young man and her Swiss mother moved there as a teenager. She studied medicine at Aberdeen University and married in 1988 — a year before qualifying as a doctor. Later, she moved to Nottinghamshire in 1999 with her two sons after her orce from her first husband — Ewan McFarlane — and married again in 2006, but left her second husband just a year into the marriage.Mavis, meanwhile, was a farmer’s daughter born and raised in Retford and, as the youngest of four children, lived with her parents until she married delivery driver Cliff, nine years her senior, when she was 35.She trained as a teacher and worked locally, becoming headmistress at a village infants’ school until taking early retirement at 55. She and Cliff, who died in 2012, were childless and spent much of their free time playing bowls or watching cricket and tennis.Holidays were generally spent in the UK and aside from the odd trip to Wimbledon for the tennis or Trent Bridge for the cricket, the pair were careful with their money, investing small sums to make sure they were cared for later in life.The bulk of McFarlane’s letters date from 2008, the tribunal heard, around the time she advised her patient to switch GPs so they could continue their friendship ‘unhindered’.Written in highly emotive, gushing prose and filled with exclamation marks, they are a far cry from the brief notes you might find in a doctor’s records.The earlier letters also refer to Mavis’s husband Cliff, making clear he was aware of his wife’s relationship with the doctor.In the letter of November 2008 in which she advises that Mavis switches doctors, she tells her: ‘Chat to Cliff about it and reassure him, above all, that . . . he can call me at home or on my mobile or at work, any time at all if he is ever again worried about you.’It is not known if he was aware of the cash gifts, the bulk of which were given after his death.          Dr Andrea McFarlane leaving the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in ManchesterIn the November 2008 letter, she writes: ‘Your humour, your intelligent quick mind, your positive and strong attitude, (both you and Cliff), your kindness, your heart as big as a bucket (in fact, bigger!), your fun and gentle being, all that I admire and adore and I do so treasure our friendship, not just because you spoil me beyond any words, but because with all this, you are you, quite an incredible and fantastic lady! I have often said, I would like to be like you! I shall aspire to that!’The most disturbing content revealed during the tribunal relates to the gifts McFarlane received.She continues: ‘Thank you also for all the other goodies and help towards all that life needs sorting. My new tyres, my new locks, fixing my computer, the car service, the gutters needed fixing, the electrician needed to fix the lights, the petrol to rugby matches and so much more.’In another letter, dated January 2009, McFarlane writes that she has spent the ‘generous inclusions’ from Mavis’s Christmas card on car breakdown cover and ‘a little of what you have given’ towards a trip to London to visit her nieces.She adds: ‘As for my birthday, I do know of a beautiful thing I have wanted for many years, but never would have dreamed of buying for myself, an Ortak silver bracelet I adore. I promise to get that from you for this rather wonderful birthday of mine on the 4th, to wear when I am not at work and when you see it, you will agree it is quite special.’In March 2009, she writes: ‘I am still waiting for my beautiful new cooker, it is taking time in getting to me, but there we are, we can manage meantime (sic). I am so grateful to you, as without your help, I would not have managed to get one without great difficulty.’At the same time as receiving these gifts, the doctor enjoyed 20 foreign holidays between 2008 and 2014, including an Amazon cruise, a skiing holiday in Italy and a trip to the Grand Canyon, sending Mavis postcards from around the world despite complaining of money worries.Above all, the letters reveal how intense this secretive relationship became and how quickly the women’s roles appear to have reversed so childless Mavis was taking care of McFarlane’s financial and emotional needs, almost as if she was her own daughter.Meanwhile, Mavis’s health was deteriorating and when she suffered a debilitating stroke in June 2017, she was the one who urgently needed care — and the money to pay for it.While going through her paperwork, her nephew John, a retired salesman, noticed that shortly after her husband Cliff’s death in 2012, an investment worth £83,000 had matured, an amount the couple had intended to help them in their old age.But between December 2012 and January 2013 cheques totalling £98,000 had been paid out to McFarlane, the first for £73,000 and the second for £25,000. In addition to the cheques, multiple payments saw a total of £188,000 handed over.          John Hemstalk, 67, Mavis’s nephew and her lasting power of attorney, said: ‘My auntie is not aware of what’s going on. She is very, very poorly...\u0027She also gave McFarlane a gold ring studded with three diamonds, something the doctor described as ‘her inheritance to me’ and, when she could no longer drive, gave her Toyota Auris car, which was worth £7,000, to McFarlane’s sister.By the time she had her stroke, the tribunal heard, Mavis was left with just £2,000 in her account.‘I couldn’t believe my eyes,’ says John, who contacted the GMC about his concerns.What particularly upset him, he says, is that both Mavis and Cliff were always so careful with money.‘They were thrifty people,’ he says. ‘I found tins of fruits that were bursting they’d been in storage so long. The furniture and curtains were threadbare. The cutlery was fifty years old. The oven door was falling off. She didn’t spend anything on herself.’After John contacted the GMC, McFarlane was reportedly investigated by police over claims she received money from two other people. However there was insufficient evidence to proceed.She initially claimed she thought some of the money she received from Mavis was part of her orce settlement from her second husband, Sean Robb. Later, she told the tribunal the money was to help her pay off hundreds of thousands of pounds of debt.          John Hemstalk pictured with letters of thanks and postcardsMr Robb told the Mail this week detectives had visited him to question him about his ex-wife but said he was unaware she had any debts and that nothing was disclosed during their protracted orce.‘She has never contacted me asking for help with finances,’ he said. ‘She was beautiful, intelligent and caring. That was just her and she was a bit soft with it. She’s not an underhand sort of person. It’s probably that she has got into something she didn’t know she was getting into.’Businessman Mr Robb also said that after they split, his wife lived for a time with a 75-year-old man who was the widower of one of her patients who had died. ‘I thought it was a bit strange,’ he said. ‘She “doctored” his wife and moved in with him. It was a few years ago.’Had McFarlane been found guilty of grooming her patient, she would in all likelihood have been struck off and faced criminal charges. However the professional panel found no evidence ‘that Dr McFarlane actively solicited monies or gifts’. The report concluded Mavis ‘considered Dr McFarlane as extended family and was happy to help her’ even if she was vulnerable and the gifts were inappropriate.Giving evidence before the tribunal in December, McFarlane claimed she had been £250,000 in debt and that both Mavis and her husband ‘wanted me to be a better mother and stay more at home’. She said the couple regarded her as ‘their extended family’ and offered to help.She produced copies of letters she had received from the pensioner in which Mavis refers to McFarlane as ‘my dearest St Andrea’ or ‘my darling saintly friend’ and signs off as ‘your angel’.‘I regard myself as the luckiest girl in the world. To be called an Angel is superb,’ she wrote in September 2009. And another from May 2011: ‘It was so delightful to have two sessions in the last six days with so many hugs.’But John says: ‘Any decent doctor would have said no and informed the family that their vulnerable elderly patient was trying to give their life savings away.’Despite the tribunal’s decision to suspend McFarlane for serious misconduct rather than strike her off, he believes McFarlane’s ‘sickly sweet’ letters amount to grooming — saying that the one-year ban she received is an ‘insult’.His solicitor has now written to the doctor, who lives in a rented house in the grounds of Babworth Hall in Nottinghamshire, asking her to return the money. If she refuses, the family intend to sue her. McFarlane has offered to give back the diamond ring. The family say they are still waiting for it to be returned.What upsets John most is that he had to sell Mavis’s £200,000 three-bedroom bungalow to pay for her care when the cash she gave away might have covered the cost of making modifications so she could be looked after at home.‘She didn’t want me to sell her house but I had no other choice,’ he says. ‘I can’t bring myself to tell her I’ve done it, to be honest.‘I’m so angry about what’s happened. It’s not fair that my auntie, who worked hard and saved all her life, should be in this position in her final years.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Church England clears way female Archbishop rewriting laws","story":"    The Archbishop of York The Most Reverend Archbishop of York John Sentamu could be replaced by a female in 2020Ian Brady\u0027s locked briefcases may NEVER be opened as police...ISIS executioner who murdered prisoner in beheading video is...Share this articleThe CofE has picked a string of female bishops since the doors to the episcopacy were opened to women in 2014.

A giant fatberg. This behemoth, made up of wet wipes that have become tangled up in solidified cooking oil, is 210 ft long by 7 ft wide — the length of six double-decker buses end-to-end. Only in London — which has a population of 8.8 million to Sidmouth’s 15,000 — are fatbergs of this magnitude normally seen.Could there be a more striking visual representation of the scale of the single-use plastic we thoughtlessly chuck away daily, that often ends up in the ocean — and which the Mail has been campaigning against for more than a decade?Charlie says: ‘I’d watched YouTube videos of the London fatbergs but I’d never seen one for myself. I never thought I would — not here, in a small seaside town.’Now Charlie and his team have the unenviable task of dismantling it. Excavators work around the clock chipping away at the monstrosity in a bid to clear the drains before disaster strikes — peeling away layers of wipes and cotton buds.If they don’t remove it before heavy rains or high tides, the raw sewage flowing through these pipes, below the public toilets and fish shop, will back up and be forced out through the manholes that line the esplanade, sending the fetid soup across the elegant cafe pavements and out to sea.Five dead in warehouse massacre: Laid-off worker, 45,...Share this articleAs you near the esplanade, you detect a distinct whiff of rotten eggs on the salty sea breeze. The site is cordoned off with wire fencing, but locals and tourists gather to watch workmen being winched down a small manhole.They hack and scrape away at the rock-hard mass armed with shovels, small pickaxes and hand-held rakes. Once loosened, it can be sprayed with jets of water, which break the lumps down into a slurry that is sucked up a pipe and taken away in lorries. South West Water says it could take eight weeks to break up the fatberg, at a cost of more than £100,000.For the first few days the rancid fumes given off by the fatberg were so strong the team had to wear breathing equipment, but now pumps have been set up to force fresh air into the cavity.Everyone has a gas-detecting monitor clipped to their chest and carries an emergency air supply in case their excavations dislodge a pocket of toxic fumes.On one side of the site there’s a yellow bucket containing a chunk of fatberg for the people of Sidmouth to gawp at. I can see a cotton bud sticking out of one side, but it looks like stony mud and, even though I put my nose close and sniff, it seems innocent enough.          Workers confront the 210 ft fatberg. This behemoth, made up of wet wipes that have become tangled up in solidified cooking oil, is 210 ft long by 7 ft wide‘That’s been sitting out here for a few days so the rain has washed it,’ explains Charlie. ‘Do you want me to get the boys to bring up a fresh bucket full?’Oh, yes please.Minutes later he is standing before me, grinning, the yellow bucket in his hands. He beckons me closer and the smell hits me immediately — it’s so eye-watering it seems to singe the hairs inside my nostrils.I turn away to retch. As Charlie prods at the greasy mass I see food traces, cotton buds and a mass of knotted, twisted swathes of cloth — obviously wet wipes.Although fatbergs are formed by the fat which we pour down our sinks, or which drains out of our dishwashers, they are caused by wet wipes.According to Andrew Roantree, South West Water’s director of wastewater, the sewage system can usually cope with fat. It can even handle the odd nappy thoughtlessly flushed away. But it cannot handle the wet wipe.More than 670 million packs of wet wipes are sold in Europe a year — everything from cosmetic and baby wipes to moist toilet tissue and household cleaning wipes. And a shocking number, it seems, are being flushed down the loo.‘We’ve noticed a huge increase in wet wipes in the system in the last three years alone,’ says Andrew.One explanation could be the rise in popularity of ‘moist toilet tissue’ and bathroom cleaning wipes that end up in the lavatory. Despite the repeated entreaties from water companies to flush only ‘the three Ps’ (Poo, Pee and Paper) many wipes carry ‘flushable’ labels that imply that they’ll rapidly break down and dissolve like toilet paper.          On one side of the site there’s a yellow bucket containing a chunk of fatberg for the people of Sidmouth to gawp atIn fact, few do.Most wipes are either made from plastic, or natural fibres strengthened and treated with plastic. It makes them almost impossible to break down. Many will still be here in 500 years’ time. If a wipe is too tough to break down naturally by the time it reaches the sewage plant, it could be feeding a fatberg, ultimately poisoning the planet.Sewage plants are not equipped to ‘treat’ plastic. In many cases plastic solids can be scooped out and sent off to be burned or buried, but tiny particles of plastic can slip through the net, and potentially escape into drinking water, rivers and oceans.Some wipes make it out of sewers and into the sea. Marine conservationists report a 700 per cent rise in wipes washed up on beaches in the last decade.And they wreak havoc in the sewage system. ‘Wipes create a matrix that everything else gets caught up in,’ Andrew Roantree explains. His team deals with 8,500 small blockages a year and flushed wet wipes are increasingly to blame.They catch on bends and snag on brickwork, forming mini blockages which attract the fat. If the flow is allowed to slow — as it was in the cavern under Sidmouth — plastic detritus gets gummed together by clods of fat. Over time, the mass can react with the calcium in sewer water to set like concrete.No one ever wants to talk about sewage, but the out-of-this-world magnitude and repugnant horror of a fatberg provides a stark reminder of the harmful plastics we forget about the second we flush them away.          Workers go down to sewers at The Esplanade in Sidmouth, Devon, as work continues to destroy the fatberg Giant fatbergs require vast quantities of unflushable plastic and space to grow, which is why they have previously only been identified in the London sewage system (such as the mammoth fatberg found under Whitechapel in 2017).This spot in Sidmouth appears to have provided the perfect environment. It is (or should be) a kind of holding tank for the town’s flush contents, before they reach the nearby pumping station to be propelled the three miles or so to the treatment works. Its size, low level and slow current allowed the fatberg to grow unnoticed.Andrew and his team believe the Sidmouth fatberg had been expanding silently under the town for around five years — fed by a steady diet of flushed wet wipes. There was no evil stench or unusual blockages to hint at its presence until Charlie’s discovery.You might think the residents of Sidmouth would be embarrassed about their bathroom habits, and surveying the shelves of wet wipes and ‘moist toilet tissue’ at the local Tesco, it’s easy to wonder whether this community might be less flush-savvy than most.But there are colourful ‘Stop the block!’ banners along the seafront and fun posters urging residents to ‘think sink’ (don’t pour fats down the sink — allow them to cool then tip them into your food waste) and ‘love your loo’.It’s clearly a great opportunity to get an important message out. There is an upbeat atmosphere around the site and palpable local support for ‘project fatberg’.Everyone wants to peer into the sewer (very much forbidden), with visitors from all over the country coming down to gawk at this unlikely tourist attraction. I watch as dog walkers edge closer for a sniff at Charlie’s yellow bucket, before pulling back, repulsed.South West Water have called in scientists from Exeter University to analyse their prize find. John Love, a professor of synthetic biology, is heading up the project.His team has started analysing the fat composition, bacteria levels and the chemicals the fatberg might be holding (one London specimen carried startling amounts of paracetamol and even traces of performance-enhancing drugs).‘We are very interested in the plastics,’ he says, ‘not just wet wipes, but the water-absorbing compounds which spill out of nappies, as well as micro plastics which might have leached out of beauty products.’ Their first findings are expected in the next few weeks.As I’m chatting to Andrew about the perils of non-flushable plastics, a woman approaches and pokes a bag of cakes through the perimeter fence. ‘You’re doing such a great job so I’ve done a bit of baking for you lads,’ she says.Andrew tells me someone else left them a consignment of pasties last week.‘Sidmouth is no different to any other town,’ he explains. ‘Wherever people flush wet wipes there will be blockages — and unless people stop flushing wipes, there’s every chance fatbergs will be growing across the country right now.’A troubling thought indeed."},{"url":null,"title":"JACK DOYLE Principled No hard Brexit mob just want burn house down","story":"    Theresa May was beaten principally because 57 hardline Brexiteers in her own party had defied her and abstainedThe blame for this shambles does not lie entirely with the hardline Tory Brexiteers in the European Research Group (ERG). Eleven Tory MPs on the Remain side also rebelled, an equally unbiddable and uncompromising faction determined to force a second referendum and stop Britain leaving the EU.Arguably, tactical mistakes were made, too, on the Government side, in not recognising and trying to avert the rebellion.But in the final analysis, it was ERG votes which have hobbled Mrs May at this critical juncture and undermined her prospects of securing the very thing these MPs claim to want: a better deal for Britain.So why did they do it?This potentially self-defeating act of sabotage was sparked to a large degree by comments made by Mrs May’s chief Brexit negotiator, Olly Robbins. He was overheard in a Brussels bar this week by journalists who said he remarked that Mrs May would opt for a long delay rather than leaving the EU without a deal. The Tory rebels also believed — despite protestations to the contrary from ministers — that the Commons motion on Thursday explicitly took No Deal off the table.The ERG’s ‘shop steward’, Steve Baker, desperately attempted yesterday to defend the indefensible by portraying his and his fellow hardliners’ position as one of pragmatism and compromise, insisting he had ‘put an enormous amount of effort into uniting the party’.Class warfare!

As one senior source told me: ‘The ERG are going to burn the house down. It’s not a question of if, but when.’The allusion to arson is a very powerful one. Although there are not yet any big flames, the touch-paper has been lit. Of course, not all ERG members hold the same views, and not all deserve the ‘kamikaze’ or ‘nihilist’ labels some of their colleagues privately attach to them. Indeed, what has been described as a ‘party within a party’ is itself riven with ision.          Hardline Tory Brexiteers in the European Research Group (ERG) are making Theresa May\u0027s job hard. Pictured: Jacob Rees-MoggThere is a chance Mrs May can yet win over some who are looking for a ladder to climb down.Others may be biddable as they are cynically positioning themselves for the next party leadership contest and will see how the chips fall before making their move.A small minority, however, cling on to the belief that they can force through No Deal — and to hell with the economic consequences.Tory Euroscepticism hasn’t always been so red-bloodedly radical. Various members of the ERG have, in the past, publicly backed staying in the Customs Union (David Davis) or a gradual transition (Owen Paterson), while ERG chairman Jacob Rees-Mogg once floated the idea of a second referendum after the negotiation was complete. How grimly ironic that now, as the prize of Brexit is within their sights, this pragmatism has been abandoned.One Tory MP told me this week he thought some of the most zealous Brexiteers, who have spent their entire political careers trying to get Britain out of the EU, now perversely don’t want Britain to leave because they would have nothing left to fight against. This interpretation may be going too far.Of course, the unhelpful arithmetic of Commons votes is the result of Mrs May losing the Tories’ majority in the 2017 general election. As a result, she has been unable to take a harder line with Brussels.          Theresa May is battling both remainers and her own back benchers who seek to stand in her wayBut her calamitous miscalculation of calling an election three years before it was necessary led to a Remain-dominated Parliament.For their part, Tory opponents of No Deal aren’t prepared to sit on their hands much longer, and Thursday night’s antics by their ERG colleagues simply enraged them further.To date, they have heeded entreaties from the likes of Chancellor Philip Hammond to hold their nerve and give Mrs May more time. But with Brexit just 41 days away, they are running out of patience.The next crunch point in the Parliamentary calendar is February 27. If Mrs May hasn’t got a deal accepted by then, expect dozens of Tory MPs — among them several ministers — to ally with Labour in an attempt to seize control of the Brexit timetable to avert what they see as a No Deal catastrophe.If that happened, the prospect of Brexit happening on March 29 would all but vanish, and with it Mrs May’s room for manoeuvre.These are the darkest fears of those closest to the Prime Minister. Summing up her mood, one tells me: ‘Sometimes she thinks it’ll be ok . . . but sometimes she just despairs.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"If staircases getting try latest fad indoor sides","story":"    Charlie Freeman is an actor, musician and artist, and lives in Notting Hill, West London.

She’s married to Alex, 53, an architect, and they live in Brook Green, West London. Between them they have seven children: Zac, 20, Olive, 18, Kit, 17, Orlando, 16, Ro, 16, Samb, 11, and Raffe, eight. Susanna says:When we built our home four years ago, our whole ethos was that houses don’t have to be serious places. With seven children, we wanted this to be a fun space for everyone, so when Alex suggested an indoor slide I thought it was a great idea.          Swish finish: Susanna uses the stairs, while her son Samb finds the slide much quickerMade of white Corian (a hard material used for kitchen worktops), the slide runs adjacent to a curving staircase starting from the upstairs landing, where the bedrooms are, down to the ground floor hallway.Corian is an incredibly smooth material and can be shaped to order. But the fact that the slide had to be curved and is around five metres long made it quite a challenge for the builders.It also required us to have a wider space than you’d normally need for stairs and the slide worked out to be slightly steeper than we imagined.At first, we had a small mat at the bottom, but when one of the children crashed at high speed into the wall three metres away, I realised we needed a much larger, thicker mat, plus extra cushioning on the wall.Our children all love it and the house is popular for playdates, sleepovers and parties. It’s also extremely useful for sending clothes, forgotten school books and swimming bags down rather than having to run up and down stairs.When people come over for dinner or drinks you can see the adults eyeing up the slide, secretly desperate to have a go, but they only usually ask when they’ve had a few drinks. Some don’t anticipate quite how steep it is and have a bit of a fright as they come speeding down.The youngest boys, Raffe and Samb, use the slide most and frequently climb up it, too, rather than taking the stairs. But if we’ve had a stressful day, there’s nothing like a quick go on the slide to blow the cobwebs away. Mum isn’t a fan, Dad loves it — even Grandad had a goLaoise Doherty, 20, is studying computer science at university, and lives near Belfast with her parents and her four siblings aged 21, 18, 17 and 15.

When he got to the bottom, even Grandad said: ‘Oh, I don’t think I should have done that!’ He scared himself a bit, but secretly enjoyed it at the same time.Dad’s a big kid, too, and it was his idea to have a slide when we had the house built.

What is behind the boom? Plus the fresh voices to read nowSomewhere towards the end of last year, I stood up in front of 400 or so 17-year-olds to talk about poetry. The lecture was one I’d already given in various guises a comparative reading of two poems: one canonical, the other contemporary. In the past, I’d compared WB Yeats with Sharon Olds, Helen Dunmore with Tishani Doshi, and John Donne with Tiphanie Yanique. That day, we were back with Donne again: “The Sun Rising”, one of the language’s greatest love poems, as fresh and exultant now as it was when it was written four centuries ago. But rather than scouring the work of Forward or Pulitzer prize winners to find something to read with it, this time I turned to YouTube. The poem I chose was Hollie McNish’s “Watching Miserable-Looking Couples in the Supermarket”.A few months earlier, McNish had found herself at the centre of a whirlwind, when an argument that had been rumbling for some time behind the poetry world’s tightly closed doors abruptly burst forth in public. McNish – whose vivid, visceral poems have been watched by millions online – had won the Ted Hughes award for new work in poetry in 2016 for her debut collection, and subsequently secured a publishing deal for a new book, Plum, with Picador. Plum came out in 2017, was broadly well received, and rapidly became one of the year’s bestselling collections, part of a surge in poetry sales that was spearheaded by Instapoet Rupi Kaur, whose two collections had together sold in the hundreds of thousands. But it wasn’t until January 2018 that Plum made headlines. Rebecca Watts (a prize-shortlisted poet in her own right) was commissioned to review it for poetry journal PN Review, but submitted, instead, an essay in which she decried “the rise of a cohort of young female poets who are currently being lauded by the poetic establishment for their ‘honesty’ and ‘accessibility’ – buzzwords for the open denigration of intellectual engagement and rejection of craft”. She declined to review Plum on the grounds that “to do so … would imply that it deserves to be taken seriously as poetry”.Born in Wakefield in 1989, Abbott is a poet, educator and activist. His one-man show, Two Little Ducks, resulted in both his debut poetry collection and a studio album of the same name.Sat slurping black coffeein the services, gone midnight.You almost kid yourself it’s cinematic,as lorries fly by in the inside lane:blurring with the reflectionsfrom the seats by the window.Premier League highlights on the plasma in the cornerprobably would’ve been omittedfrom anything cinematic.

It’s a truism that there’s no row like a poetry row. “For some reason,” says Don Paterson, McNish’s editor at Picador, “poets saying ungenerous things about each other is considered news, which is pretty funny, given they fight all the time”. But the speed and fury with which this one exploded marked the point at which a formerly nebulous territorial dispute within a small community suddenly hardened, and everyone felt obliged to pick a side. “In every period you’ve had poets who write what’s seen as being more accessible poetry,” says Anthony Anaxagorou, award-winning slam poet and founder-director of live poetry night Out-Spoken, citing, among others, Charles Bukowski, Maya Angelou and Emily Dickinson. “The difference now is that things are more democratic. Anyone is free to set up a social media account or website and publish their poems. Gatekeepers traditionally have been responsible for maintaining a sense of quality control, which many feel has diminished since the rise of social media. What you’re left with is a widening chasm. The establishment and the academy have buttressed their positions as ‘knowers’ of good poetry, resulting in serious readers and writers swaying over to one side, leaving the more casual reader to trundle through the badlands of social media poetry.”At the heart of the dispute was this notion of “accessibility” – and the question of whether heightened accessibility necessarily involves a blunting of the fine edge that is poetry’s USP. Whatever your view, there’s no doubt that, historically, the number of people accessing poetry has been low. In audience terms, poetry has long been the literary world’s poor relation, at once revered as high art, the place where language works at its outer limits, and viewed as difficult and (that word again) inaccessible, only touching the lives of the wider public when it was wheeled out to mark births, deaths and marriages.At Arts Council England, where I work as director of literature, our mission is “great art and culture for everyone”, but the plain fact is that, when it came to poetry, the sector’s success in reaching new audiences has been limited. While there have been moments when it broke through – via the wildly popular Poems on the Underground initiative, for example, and in the form of Bloodaxe Books’ series of bestselling contemporary anthologies, both Arts Council-supported – these were statistical outliers. As recently as 2012, poetry sales (as reported by industry bible Nielsen Bookscan) appeared to be on an alarming slide’ from a (relative) high of £8.4m in 2009 to a dismal low of £6.4m. Even for poetry - accustomed to existing on short rations - things were looking bleak.And yet, beyond the bookshelves, the world was on the move. Smartphones went mainstream, and social media use erupted. Mobile devices apparently offered the perfect vehicle for sharing poems, while spoken word artists found, in YouTube, a means of connecting with new, physically dispersed audiences. Poetry popped up in people’s Facebook feeds, was served to them as they sat on their sofas, and casual readers of the sort Anaxagorou describes were born in abundance. The latest Nielsen figures for 2018 show poetry sales hitting an all-time high of £12.3m – nearly double what it was in 2012.Born in 1982, Garbutt is from Knottingley, West Yorkshire and has toured with John Cooper Clarke.

The Instapoetry popularised by Kaur, Lang Leav, Nayyirah Waheed and Nikita Gill, among others, is unquestionably a recent phenomenon Kaur didn’t join Instagram until 2014. But spoken word has far deeper roots, as well as a history of attracting practitioners and audience members from more socially and ethnically erse backgrounds. Apples and Snakes, the UK’s leading spoken word promoter and a member of the Arts Council’s national portfolio of organisations, was founded in a room over a pub back in 1982. Its chief executive, Lisa Mead, points to “years of grassroots development”, which have led to a sector that has “successfully developed a broad range of poets – from Kate Tempest to Inua Ellams to Debris Stevenson – and created an appetite among young people to engage with poetry. Without all the graft that’s been put in we wouldn’t be where we are now current poets have risen on the shoulders of those who went before.”Anaxagorou agrees, describing a rich hybrid form that draws on “the dub poetry and live literature movements of the 80s and the slam movement of the 90s” alongside rap music and “American sermonising, which employs language, ideology, performance and intonation … Today it feels very much like a fusion of different traditions and approaches that all stem from the oral. A highly communicative, informed, visceral way of connecting with people while also keeping them entertained.”The raw material has been here for some time what the internet and social media have done is lift it out of geographical silos and allow anyone, anywhere access to it. But theoretically, haiku and villanelles are just as shareable as Kate Tempest videos. What is it about spoken word that’s captivated contemporary audiences in such numbers?Joelle Taylor is one of slam poetry’s leading lights, and the founder of national youth slam championship SLAMbassadors. As well as acknowledging the form’s availability to her, as a working-class woman (“There were few opportunities in the area I grew up in to access the arts … Spoken word allowed me to bypass literary gatekeepers”), she also cites its ability to “reach across class and culture to create a community of free thinkers ... In these increasingly dystopian and hostile times, we need that sense of belonging, of thoughtful uprising.”Mead also notes the urgency of “the current political climate” as an audience driver. “Poets have always been the social commentators of the moment, tuning in to the issues that are bubbling under the surface. Given what’s going on currently, people are looking for someone who’s saying aloud what they’re feeling.” Just as Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon articulated the most urgent experiences of their generation in the poetry of the trenches (and were soundly rebuked at the time by Yeats, who declared, in terms that might ring bells for Instapoets, that “passive suffering is not a theme for poetry”), so today’s young poets are responding passionately to crises in government, finance and the environment.A British Nigerian writer born in 1994, Lola was joint winner of the 2018 Brunel International African poetry prize.

Whatever criticisms might be levelled at poetry in 2019, irrelevance is no longer one of them: quite apart from the rise in sales, the most prominent and profound responses to the Manchester terror attack and the Grenfell fire were delivered via poetry. “We’ll always need poetry, especially at thresholds, in times of difficult transition,” says Paterson. “If you think this is a boom, wait until you see poetry after a no-deal Brexit.”But what about the fear that this broadening of the artform is diminishing its excellence? The poetry world’s prize givers appear to be taking, if anything, the opposite view. In 2018, Jay Bernard won the Ted Hughes prize with an hour-long performance, “Surge: Side A”, on the 1981 New Cross fire. The Forward prize, meanwhile, formerly won by the likes of Seamus Heaney, Ted Hughes and Alice Oswald, was awarded to Danez Smith, who started life as a performance poet. “The media may have focused on Smith’s youth, gender, race and background,” says Susannah Herbert, executive director of the Forward Arts Foundation, “but they didn’t win for any of these: their book was judged the best collection of the year because it expands the language and nourishes the imagination. This is skilful, closely worked and inspired poetry. It’s built to last.”Linton Kwesi Johnson, regarded by many as the father of modern spoken word, was originally derided by the establishment a Spectator profile claimed his poetry had “wreaked havoc in schools and helped to create a generation of rioters and illiterates”. In 2002, he became only the second living poet to be published in the Penguin Modern Classics series. “I like to think,” he says now, “that for the generation who came after me, some of them thought, ‘Bloody hell, if that geezer can do it so can I.’” As Paterson argues, “I think you’re obliged to make some account of what the culture regards as important – or at least learn to distinguish between not liking something and not understanding it. I used to think I didn’t like performance poetry. But if an activity is widespread and clearly involves a lot of intelligent people – you’re the problem.”Bernard, born in 1988, last year won the Ted Hughes Award for ‘Surge: Side A’, a cross-disciplinary exploration of the 1981 New Cross Fire.

So why the anxiety? Well, to paraphrase William Gibson, the future may be here, but it’s not evenly distributed. For all the talk of a poetry boom, this appears to be confined primarily to poetry’s new wave the traditional market remains challenging. Although Paterson reports a rise in poetry sales across the board at Picador, he acknowledges “it hasn’t quite been the tide that’s lifted all boats”. At Carcanet, meanwhile, director Michael Schmidt believes “the ‘boom’ is based largely on poetry which originates in the social media, where would-be writers develop a substantial following”.What’s more, while there’s a growing acknowledgement that spoken word poetry deserves its place at the table (Bloodaxe director Neil Astley, who championed many of the original dub poets such as Benjamin Zephaniah and Jean “Binta” Breeze, observes “a real and fluid crossover” between stage and page), the line often seems to be drawn at Instapoetry. “What troubles me as a reader and editor,” Schmidt says, “is the privileging of cliche inherent in the movement … the intolerance of subtlety.” Even Paterson says of Kaur that “she writes a kind of affirmative sloganeering for folk who don’t really read books – it clearly does some people a lot of good, so all power to her.” This is not real poetry, runs the theory, and it’s not delivering a crossover audience, either in fact, according to Astley, “the more successful Instagram poets” are “overshadowing the valuable, edgy, thoughtful and beautifully written real poetry”.Born in 1986 in London to British and Jamaican parents, Antrobus is a deaf poet whose debut collection, The Perseverance, was a Poetry Book Society choice last year.Salvador Dali in a 1950s McDonald’s advert,of red gold and green tieson shanty town dapper dandies, of Cuba Gooding Jr.in a strip club shouting SHOW ME THE MONEY,of the woman on her phone in the quiet coach,of knowing you’ll be seen and served,that no one will cross the road when they see you,the sun shining through the gaps in the buildings,a glass ceiling in a restaurantwhere knives and spoons wink,a polite pint and a cheeky cigarette, tattooson the arms, trains that blur the whole city without delay.I want the confidence of a coffee bean in the body,a surface that doesn’t need scratchingI want to be fluent in confidence so large it speaks from its own sky.At the airport I want my confidence to boardwithout investigations, to sit in foreign caféswithout a silver spoon in a teacup clinkinginto sunken places, of someone named after a saint,of Matthew the deaf footballer who couldn’t hearto pass the ball, but still ran the pitch,of leather jackets and the teethof hot combs, rollin’ roadmen and rubber.I don’t want my confidence to lieit has to mean helium balloons in any shape or colour,has to mean rubber tree in rain make itmy sister leaving home for university, my finally sober father,my mother becoming a circus clown.There is such a thing as a key confidently cutthat accepts the locks it doesn’t fit.Call it a boy busking on the canal path singingto no one but the bridgesand the black water under them.From The Perseverance (Penned in the Margins)\u0026nbspIt’s easy to see how those steeped in decades of writing and editing have come to this conclusion. Yet quite apart from the very real worry about dismissing a form of expression that is produced and consumed overwhelmingly by young women, there’s a danger in writing off any enterprise still in its infancy: if history teaches us anything, it’s that this always comes back to bite you. From modernism to the metaphysicals, there is no form of poetry yet that hasn’t produced great art it’s hard to imagine Instapoetry won’t, too. In some senses it appears to be doing what YA literature did for the novel: bridging a gap between the already verdant fields of poetry for children and adults. Poetry Society director Judith Palmer points to the society’s 2018 survey of under-18s in which participants expressed their desire “to read poetry that feels like it was written by people like them it’s no accident that the most successful Instapoets are young women of colour”, but also noted that those surveyed referenced Kaur and Leav in the same breath as Anne Carson, Ocean Vuong, Sylvia Plath and John Keats when asked to name their favourite poets. “Young people,” she says, “are discovering poetry through Instapoetry.” Whether this growth in audiences is sustainable only time will tell, but in the short term it may be worth bearing in mind that a lack of crossover audience works both ways: it’s unlikely readers of traditional poetry are forsaking it for Instagram. “If I’ve learned anything,” Paterson says, “it’s that I should stop paying lip service to this lazy rubbish about poetry being a broad church. It can be many churches, and we needn’t worship at them all.”By taking McNish as the subject of my lecture, I was, in part, asking a question of myself: whether poetry that arose out of social media could hold up under intensive close reading. The answer, in short, was yes. I talked about McNish’s use of conjunctions and repetition about her deployment of the passive tense about the way she sets us up to expect one word, and then wrongfoots us with another. As time passes, and the new poets grow older, a critical discourse will develop, and we’ll begin to see a canon emerge. Until then, let’s give the last word to one of them. “Spoken word,” Joelle Taylor says, “is proper poetry. But poetry for the mouth has a different instinct than that for the pen of equal value, but different. We must be judged on the terms of the chosen expression. Those who undermine the form often reveal an elitist, classist bias – as seen in their need to define and own poetry. You cannot own an art”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f13fe273fcd2e023df484577632c126aca438647/31_460_1931_1158/master/1931.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3716eae2e76785df3e5685ed3675d133","title":"the library book review by susan orlean","story":"Recipes for hooch, designs for a boat, a place to cry or sleep … a fascinating account of what a city of seekers found at LA Central LibraryOn 29 April 1986 Los Angeles Central Library went up in flames. The fire started somewhere in the fiction stacks, snaked up the staircases and, gathering force, banged into ceilings. As the temperature reached 1370C, the metal shelves brightened from grey to white and then subsided in a tangle of cherry red. All the staff and visitors got out safely, although the same, of course, could not be said of the books. By the time the fire, and then the high-pressure hoses, had done their worst, half a million volumes were pronounced dead, with the same number again on the critical list. If books could bleed, you would have said the scene was carnage.Susan Orlean has a knack for finding compelling stories in unlikely places. In 1998 she turned the niche-sounding topic of banditry among the orchid- growing community of Florida into the gripping true crime narrative The Orchid Thief, subsequently filmed by Spike Jonze as the arthouse hit Adaptation. Twenty years on, Orlean again pokes about in an area that most writers would have put in their “interesting but not quite interesting enough” file of possible book ideas. For while the 1986 LA library fire was spectacular for the seven hours it lasted, it was also oddly indeterminate. No one died, the library got back on its feet, the man suspected of arson was never charged, quite possibly because he didn’t actually do it.These are hardly the building blocks of a tense forensic procedural. Instead, Orlean uses the fire to ask a broader question about just what public libraries are for and what happens when they are lost. You might not perhaps have LA pegged as the most bookish city, yet right from its inception in 1873, the central library attracted a higher proportion of citizens through its doors than anywhere else in the US. By 1921 more than a thousand books were being checked out every hour. The reason for that, Orlean suggests, is that LA has always been a city of seekers – first came the gold prospectors and the fruit growers, then the actors and the agents, and then all the refugees from the dust bowl prairies. No one was as solid or as solvent as they liked to appear, everyone was looking for clues about how to do life better.This was where the library came in, providing the instruction manual for a million clever hacks and wheezes. In the runup to prohibition in 1920 every book on how to make homemade hooch was checked out and never returned. Five years later a man called Harry Pidgeon became only the second person to sail solo around the world, having got the design for his boat from books borrowed from the LA public library. More mundanely, the library quickly became the chief centre for free English language classes in the city, a service that it continues to provide for its huge immigrant population today.It is this sense of a library as a civic junction that most interests Orlean. Much of her book is concerned not with the quaintness of the past – the eccentric librarian who branded trashy titles with a skull and crossbones to warn against their moral poison, the readers who deposited turkeys in the cloakroom before nipping in to change their books – but with the urgencies of modern life. Or, as she puts it: “Every problem that society has, the library has, too nothing good is kept out of the library, and nothing bad.”Consequently what you find in the Central Library is boundless kindness and intelligence coming up against the intractable problems of poverty, homelessness and mental illness. People come to sleep, to cry, and to find out, say, whether sticklebacks are more evil than grasshoppers.And at every turn they are met with kindness, intelligence and grace. No one gets huffy and splutters that this is not what they trained for. No one makes sarcy remarks about how few people read books these days. All the employees that Orlean meets seem confident and content that today’s library is an information and knowledge centre rather than a vast storage container for dead trees.Despite her ardent affection for LA’s library, Orlean cannot find it in her heart to be angry with the man many still believe torched it in 1986. Harry Peak was a likable, exasperating would-be young actor who told stories about himself – hanging out with Burt Reynolds, sipping cocktails with Cher – to put himself at the centre of things. First he boasted about having been at the library on the morning the fire broke out. Then, when the attention started to feel uncomfortable, he claimed to have been 100 miles away. In the end, Orlean produces modern forensic testimony that suggests the Llibrary fire could just as easily have been caused by bad wiring or a sneaky cigarette. In a less assured telling this might come over as an anticlimax, a dull narrative thud. For Orlean, though, there is something about this open-endedness, the and and the and rather than the and and the or, that fits exactly with the endlessly generative possibilities of a much-loved public library.• The Library Book is published by Atlantic (£20).

Education is a public good and should be treated as such. Our universities are there for all of us.”Under Labour the Office for Students (OfS) would see its role heavily revised, repealing the legislation that forces it to promote competition and replacing it with a new requirement for cooperation between institutions.Rayner will also unveil a new policy to improve the ethnic ersity of staff in higher education, with the reformed regulator given specific powers to address inequality as part of Labour’s plans for a national education service.“Like much of our establishment, our universities are too male, pale and stale and do not represent the communities that they serve or modern Britain,” Rayner will say.“Women and staff from ethnic minority backgrounds are chronically under-represented across these institutions, and in particular at the most senior levels.“Universities must do much more, and under Labour they will be held to account.”The regulator would be required to enforce a commitment to a 20:1 pay ratio between the highest and lowest paid members of staff in universities, while vice-chancellors would be barred from sitting on the committees that set their pay.Sources say that Labour hasn’t ruled out scrapping the OfS and replacing it if the regulator is unable to adapt, with Rayner saying that the OfS is “not fit for purpose”.Rayner’s speech will also take aim at statements by the higher education minister Chris Skidmore, who said some institutions “may exit the market altogether as a result of strong competition” and that increased choice for students “does not equate to propping up any particular failing HE provider”.In the past year a number of universities have announced multi-million pound deficits and are having to cut budgets and staff as a result of the cut-throat competition for students.“These are not profit-making private companies that can simply be left at the mercy of market forces. Ministers cannot simply bury their heads in the sand when we’re faced with losing some of these vital institutions,” Rayner is to say.“Students would be left with immense uncertainty about their futures and entire communities would lose one of their major academic, economic, and social institutions in the event of bankruptcy.”Under Labour the regulator would be set an explicit objective to avoid the bankruptcy of any higher education provider in England, and given powers to make emergency loans and replace senior management in the event of severe difficulties.Matt Waddup, the UCU’s head of policy, said: “Angela Rayner is right to highlight the damage that this government’s marketisation agenda is doing to further and higher education.“While students and staff are central to the social and economic future of this country, their views are habitually ignored by both ministers and the OfS.”Labour’s stance means the OfS may have a relatively short life, having only come into existence last year. Its first days were beset by difficulty, thanks to the controversy over Toby Young’s appointment to its board, and it has been slow to fulfil some of its key obligations.In response, Skidmore said: “I’ve yet to find a vice-chancellor who supports Labour’s plans to damage the sector and roll back progress that has been made in recent years.“Under the Conservatives there are more 18-year-olds in higher education than ever before, including more students from disadvantaged backgrounds being the first in their family to go to university.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdb28dfa3fc2c41612dcc9703436368afa9e144a/0_142_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9f1621e885e11b403ca238b816bf2c0","title":"european tree year contest 2019 in pictures","story":"Voting is open throughout February for the ninth European Tree of the Year contest, organised by the Environmental Partnership Association and featuring entrants from 15 countries"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be25f6941999eaaac908f4be115383b3fcdeb81a/0_0_2808_1917/master/2808.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a546e2340496bdcc5a77db602f10132e 1320w","title":"tell us about the outfit you loved wearing the most","story":"We’d like you to send in photos of your favourite ‘look’ and share your memories of when you wore itThe clothes we choose to wear can impact our mood, and leave a lasting impression on our memories.

Portraits by Tyler Mitchell• Read more from the springsummer 2019 edition of The Fashion, our biannual fashion supplement Of course. Anna Wintour plays to win in everything she does. She is editor-in-chief of American Vogue and artistic director of parent company Condé Nast, but her job titles do not come close to describing her iconic status. Vogue has been a launchpad from which she has powered herself to become a player in culture and politics. She is a fashion industry kingmaker, a Washington insider (Barack Obama’s fourth-biggest fundraiser in the 2012 campaign), an art world luminary (the Costume Institute at the politan Museum was renamed in her honour in 2014) and a Dame of the British Empire. And her haircut alone – as preternaturally unruffled and impenetrable up close as it looks in photographs – is recognisable from space.The Anna Wintour mythology is as much about power as it is about fashion. It owes a great deal to the 2006 film The Devil Wears Prada in which Meryl Streep’s ice-queen editor, assumed to be a cartoonised Wintour, created a character that popular culture has thrilled to ever since. Such is her fame that a mere rumour of her departure is enough to send shockwaves through the fashion and media worlds. (Last summer, these rose to such a clamour that Condé Nast issued a statement confirming Wintour would remain at Vogue “indefinitely”.)Her office has an air of ambassadorial gentility. No industrial styling, no modish succulents. Definitely no treadmill desk. The south wall is glass, diffusing the room with silver light bouncing off the towers of the financial district. Framed photos of her son Charles and Bee, as children and as the thirtysomethings they are now, are prominently displayed on her desk, on the window ledge and between a pair of topiaried miniature trees standing sentry on the limewashed sideboard. A cornflower-blue ceramic vase is filled with fresh ranunculus in Titian reds and coppers a glass pot holds sharpened HB pencils. Only the lipstick mark on the grande Starbucks coffee cup and the Chanel sunglasses in the in-tray give the Vogue game away.I am summoned to this inner sanctum 10 minutes before our scheduled 9am interview time. Wintour is wearing a calf-length Erdem dress in dark silk with a bright floral print, collared with two sparkling necklaces. A blush pink coat and a jade green scarf are thrown over a corner chair next to a small Victoria Beckham black leather tote. With characteristic briskness, she has already wrapped her portrait shoot with Tyler Mitchell, who last year became the first black person to shoot a Vogue cover when he photographed Beyoncé for Wintour’s September issue. “He’s charming, he’s intelligent – I’ve been impressed by what he’s said yes to, and what he’s said no to,” she says of Mitchell. “Also, he’s quick.”Before the shoot, she was watching Andy Murray’s match at the Australian Open on television – his first after announcing his retirement. “So emotional,” she says, gravely. Is it true that she herself plays tennis every day at 5am? “I don’t play tennis as much as I used to, but I get up every day between 4am and 5am, and I work out every day.” (Her game is, she says, “terrible! But I enjoy it.”) While we’re on the subject, this seems an opportune moment to verify some of the other Anna Wintour myths. What about spending only 20 minutes at parties? “Well, it depends on the party. If it is fashion week, then most likely I will be in and out. But there have been many times I have stayed a lot longer, believe me.” She is smiling, but her folded arms semaphore impatience to change the subject. I am sorry to say that I chicken out of asking her if it’s true about eating medium rare steak for lunch every day.Becoming a public figure in a way no other Vogue editor ever has been “wasn’t a conscious path”, she insists. “I don’t work for Anna Wintour, I work for Condé Nast. I don’t have any kind of social media accounts or look for personal recognition.” But Wintour is instantly recognisable, thanks to a style that has remained almost unchanged since the 80s. Her sleek bob teamed with a sharp wit has often been a power combination, channelled by Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace in Pulp Fiction, by the diminutive Edna Mode in The Incredibles and by Taylor Swift at her most sassy. But the style was “not a strategic decision”, Wintour insists. “I feel comfortable with it, that’s all. I am a creature of habit. Honestly, Jess, it’s not something I spend any time thinking about at all. I come to the office and do my job.”For the best part of two decades, Wintour’s Vogue was closer to the White House than Vogue had ever been. Hillary Clinton became the first first lady to cover Vogue in 1998 – an honour not bestowed, even, on Jackie Kennedy – and in 2016, Vogue endorsed her presidential candidacy, the first time the magazine had ever been publicly partisan. But it is the mention of Michelle Obama that sends Wintour into raptures. “What intrigued me and the rest of the world about Mrs Obama from the beginning was her poise, her intelligence, her grace, how articulate she was, and the sense that she gave of being a true partner to her husband. She was remarkable in so many ways – and still is, look at the incredible success of her book – and I was thrilled to see how she embraced fashion in such a democratic way. She would wear leggings one day, a designer gown the next, and look comfortable in both. She wasn’t locked into one idea of how a first lady should dress. For Vogue, she was a gift.” When the Met’s Costume Institute was renamed in recognition of Wintour’s work as a fundraiser and cheerleader, Michelle Obama cut the ribbon, saying, “I’m here because I have such respect and admiration for this woman, who I am proud to call my friend.”Since Trump’s election, Vogue has found itself in opposition, a position it has embraced with unexpected relish. The September issue included a profile on Stormy Daniels (the adult film star who had a hush money deal with the president) which saw Daniels resplendent in evening gown and Tiffany diamonds, photographed by Annie Leibovitz. “Today’s audience – not just Vogue’s audience, every audience – wants journalism to take a stand,” Wintour says. “People want to know what you believe in and what you stand for. In this time of fake news, when there is so much disregard for truth and value and for supporting those less fortunate than oneself, we have a moral obligation to stand up for what’s right.”While Michelle Obama starred on three Vogue covers as first lady, Melania Trump is still waiting for Wintour to call. Will Melania be in Vogue, I ask? “Melania has been on the cover of Vogue,” Wintour fires back without missing a beat. Indeed she has, in her wedding dress, in 2005, but not as first lady, representing the White House. “We do report on Melania consistently, on vogue,” says Wintour. “Which is Vogue.” Her inflection puts the emphasis firmly on the full stop.She picks up her mobile phone. “I’m going to ask someone to bring me another coffee. Would you like one?” I say no, and wait for her to make her call, but after a few seconds she raises an amused eyebrow at me. “Go ahead. I can type and think at the same time, you know.” She has texted the coffee request, I realise. As perfect as Wintour’s manners are, I do not get the impression it would be wise to put them to the test by boring her. I try not to think about the scene in the 2009 Vogue documentary The September Issue when Stefano Pilati, then designer of Yves Saint Laurent, withers under her stony-faced appraisal of his latest collection.Born in London in 1949 to a British father (Evening Standard editor Charles Wintour) and an American mother, Wintour moved to New York in her 20s. She returned to London in 1985 to edit British Vogue, but was back in New York two years later. Her first issue as editor of American Vogue, in November 1988, featured a model wearing jeans, which famously caused the printers to call Vogue’s office to check they had the right picture. It was an early signpost of the shift from fashion being “something that was directed at a small group, to becoming something that speaks to everyone. That has been the most extraordinary change that I have seen.” As fashion has swelled to a powerful force in culture over the last three decades, Vogue has ridden the crest of that wave. A Vogue cover has become an official stamp not just of beauty, but of relevance. For Amal Clooney, Serena Williams and others, a Vogue cover has signalled a change in gear from success in their field to general superstardom. “Vogue stands for quality,” Wintour says. “To be recognised by Vogue always has an impact.”In 1998, Renée Zellweger became the first non-model to cover an all-important September issue of Vogue (traditionally the biggest of the year). As the era of the supermodel waned, Wintour coached and coaxed a new generation of actresses to take their place. “The supermodels led us to celebrity,” Wintour says. “The generation of models who came after the supers just wanted to be models, and didn’t want that spotlight. Meanwhile, celebrities were starting to engage with fashion, realising the power of fashion to build their personality, to express who they were, on the red carpet or the front row. So the supermodels ended up being replaced by celebrities.” The alchemy that happens when fashion meets celebrity is at its most potent at the Met Gala, over which Wintour (who has chaired the event since 1995) will once again preside on the first Monday in May.It is a year since the New York Times published allegations of sexual misconduct against Mario Testino and Bruce Weber, two star photographers of Wintour’s Vogue. Wintour has faced criticism for having failed to use her power to better protect the vulnerable in fashion. “We take very seriously events that happen in the industry, whether in or out of our control,” she says today, “and after so many unfortunate incidents came to light, we took a strong stand.” Testino and Weber were banished from Vogue. A new Condé Nast code of conduct forbids the hiring of models under 18, and requires images involving nudity, swimwear, lingerie or suggestive poses to be approved in advance by the subject.How long Wintour will remain at Vogue is impossible to predict, because Condé Nast is itself in turmoil. Having lost an estimated $250m over the past two years, the company recently announced plans to merge US and international operations, and is searching for a new CEO to replace the departing Bob Sauerberg. Wintour enthuses about the digital age as “a golden era for journalism, because we have the luxury of being able to talk to more people than ever before”, but digital has undoubtedly eroded the might of Vogue. The magazine’s Instagram account has 21.5 million followers but that sounds less impressive when you note that three of the Kardashian family – Kim, Kylie and Kendall – have more than 100 million followers each.Wintour insists that she believes print magazines will be around “for ever”. Really? “Yes, for ever. I really believe that. Print remains the jewel in the crown.” Does she think of Vogue as a magazine, these days, or is it now a brand? “I don’t care for the word brand, to be honest,” she says. “It makes me feel like I’m in a supermarket. But I love Vogue – very deeply.” She types a few words on her phone and the door opens to signal our time is up. She walks me to her door, shakes my hand, bids me a warm goodbye and turns to her assistant. “I asked for a coffee,” she says. There is no discernible hint in her tone that this is a sackable offence. But then, Anna Wintour doesn’t give much away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

I can’t immediately think of one, and maybe that’s the problem, but I arrive at it eventually. I want to stop giving up. I’m trapped in a cycle of getting quite competent – a half-hour 5k that doesn’t kill me, then tailing off and having to start from scratch. Laziness is like gravity: obviously I am lazy, but I think of my laziness as a constant, so it can’t explain why I sometimes run and other times don’t.I find it hard to imagine how examining my technique will help, but that’s because I’m not imagining hard enough. Any improvement in style will make running less taxing. I start with a moderate walk along a corridor. My arches are fine. (But maybe yours aren’t: a lot of strain and injury, the main causes of losing your running mojo, can be prevented by orthopaedic insoles.) I do a couple of squats, a lunge and a half squat. My left side is weaker than my right, which I knew (old traffic injury, 1978!). But I did not know the degree to which this had altered the muscle balance in my right leg, so that the outer muscle was stronger than the inner, which has given me “patella maltracking”, ie my kneecap doesn’t fit congruently with the femur groove. I love the language of physios, somewhere between grammar and discos. This is why I occasionally feel like my knee will give out and never be the same again this is also why I sometimes but not always I tail off with my regime.Moving to the running machine, Rob takes a video from the side and from behind, whereupon it is clear that my knees are too sociable, which is to say they want to meet in the middle when they should be pointing forwards or slightly outwards. This is mainly because of the business with the patella, but also my twisty arms are making the rest of me twisty. There’s an immediate fix I can do, just by keeping my elbows in. My butt looks great, thanks for asking, and there’s no rolling in my ankles, so I don’t need better shoes.“If you have strength issues, or asymmetry in your strength, just being told to change your style isn’t going to work,” Rob says, which unlocks the mystery of nothing ever seeming to change (I’ve known about my wonky knees for years). Instead, I have to try specific, targeted strengthening exercises aimed at the weaker side (doing them on both sides: only doing them on one side would just heap up a load of other problems). A set of bridges, then one-legged bridges, using a resistance band then a clam shell exercise, which is lying on one side with knees bent and opening and closing your legs like a clam.I don’t have to stop running while I do all this I won’t necessarily notice a difference until I’ve been doing it a few months, though. These are “biomechanic insufficiencies”, to give all this wonkiness a technical term: we all build them up if we live long enough. But it’s always possible to build them back down again.My cadence is 162 BPM – about average for any jogger: a marathoner would be more like 180 – and if you search 160-165 BPM on Spotify, you’ll find a load of perfect running music."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0ee092cf22fb531ab23067c5c873951c4e3b862/109_183_3045_1827/master/3045.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd744ac87bf78800624daf4cb6e5645a","title":"which sportswear logo was designed in 1971 for 35 the weekend quiz","story":"From Arafura to Timor, test your knowledge with the Weekend quiz1 Chairman Mao.2 Doctor of Divinity.3 France and the Netherlands.4 Grey squirrels.5 FBI.6 Aphelion.7 Nike swoosh.8 Volgograd, Russia.9 Seas around Australia.10 Boarding schools in series by Enid Blyton.11 Wheat species.12 First husbands of English queens: Eleanor of Aquitaine Elizabeth Woodville Anne Neville Catherine of Aragon Catherine Parr.13 Hands: Shorthand (nicknamed) Slowhand Red Hand Black Hand.14 Number of teams at postwar Fifa World Cups.15 In various Van Gogh self-portraits."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c21195451ba5a7ae58ed7b609268fc62e6e42b9/302_67_566_340/master/566.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=2f7c6d0ebaa62a2b20cc6c18eb9e208c","title":"banks faking signature campaign evidence","story":"A new campaign group claims the practice is taking place on an ‘industrial scale’Have some banks, or their legal representatives, been faking signatures on UK court documents used to repossess people’s homes and to recover other debts?It’s a serious charge, but a new campaign group claims there has been “alleged industrial-scale forgery” of signatures. And the Bank Signature Forgery Campaign has some powerful supporters in high places. The all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on fair business banking – a cross-party group of MPs and peers – publicly voiced its support this month, as did the high-profile police and crime commissioner for Thames Valley, Anthony Stansfeld.Meanwhile, a signature expert told  Money: “The whole thing is highly suspicious.”If the campaign’s claims are true, it would mean a multibillion-dollar scandal that played out in the US was being repeated in the UK (see box).Julian Watts, the man behind the campaign, says big banks and lenders are linked to documents carrying questionable signatures, and that, in some cases, people were evicted as a direct result.He has amassed a dossier of signatures purporting to be by one person that sometimes appear to be very different. He is asking people to send in photos or photocopies of signatures on bank or company court documents so they can be examined.The central allegation of the campaign, running on Facebook and Twitter, is that signatures on some UK court documents appear to have been forged – that is, not signed by the person whose printed name appears under the “statement of truth” (the bit that typically says something like “I believe the facts stated in this document are true”).It is claimed that in some cases, employees at the law firms acting on behalf of the banks or the bank’s representatives, may have faked them in order to speed up the legal process. For example, it might be that the case handler whose name is on the documents was off sick or on holiday when they needed to be signed, so other members of staff simply signed that person’s name in order to keep the process moving.Handwriting expert Adam Brand has viewed some of the documents and says they definitely appear worthy of further investigation, adding: “There certainly appears to be a case here, although further extensive work is going to be needed.”Money asked Brand – a forensic handwriting analyst – to comment on one set we were shown. They relate to a home repossession, and all the signatures – in this case, a squiggle – were supposedly made by the same person. Yet there are arguably variations.Brand told us that someone who had adopted a reduced signature, or squiggle, would tend to stick to that same signature. “Here we have a totally inconsistent situation. Purely from a common-sense point of view it is unreasonable.”However, both the inidual named on the documents, and the law firm that employed them, have firmly rejected any suggestions that multiple people had signed in the employee’s name.Giving its support to the campaign, the APPG on fair business banking, co-chaired by Tory MP Kevin Hollinrake, says it “receives frequent and consistent representations from constituents with concerns over the forgery of signatures”. It adds: “This campaign will provide a vital method of gathering evidence of possible signature forgeries by UK banks in court documents.”Some may take the view that even if this did happen, it is hardly the crime of the century, while others may feel that the campaign’s real agenda is trying to help people wriggle out of their debts on a technicality.But Watts rejects this and says it is more than just a technicality: “While it’s fine for people to pp letters, people cannot pp the signature on court documents such as witness statements ... signed ‘statements of truth’ are a foundational aspect of the justice system.”He says that if it was conclusively proved that signature forgery had taken place, “people may have been fraudulently evicted from their homes, or had court judgments fraudulently secured against them for other consumer debt”.It is fair to say that faking a signature on a “statement of truth” is a very serious business: in late 2017 a UK solicitor was struck off for – among other things – directing other members of staff to fake signatures on witness statements.The official ruling in that case stated that “the seriousness of the misconduct is at the highest level ... the dishonesty was of such gravity that public confidence in the profession would no doubt be undermined were the public to learn of what occurred.”However, it should also be pointed out that Watts is no impartial observer: he has an axe to grind in that he and his wife have been the subject of several bank court cases. He wants MPs to review the evidence and, if necessary, pass it on to the National Crime Agency or the Serious Fraud Office.In the US, fake signatures on documents in the wake of the housing market bubble bursting in 2006-07, were among the “reckless and abusive mortgage practices” that resulted in a $25bn (£19bn) settlement between mortgage lenders and the US government and most US states in 2012.One of these practices was known as “robo-signing”, where some staff signed someone else’s name, or signed documents they hadn’t even read, to speed up the foreclosure process.In one article about fake signatures on American mortgage documents, Associated Press reported that “one name, ‘Linda Green,’ was signed almost two dozen different ways”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75eba6b37afae87ce4183950a015c7be523a2a26/0_97_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=480eae5fd9a0e1fe2d1eae23f4b81bd2","title":"best top end smartphones mobile","story":"There’s never been a better time to buy a top-of-the-line mobile – here are our top picksThere’s never been a better time to buy a top-of-the-line smartphone, with a large range of truly excellent phones available from a variety of different manufacturers starting at £500 and stretching to a wallet-busting £1,000-plus.But with all that top-quality choice, it’s difficult to know which one to buy. Here’s a quick guide to get the best flagship phone for you right now.The Chinese firm might be in the middle of a political storm, but that didn’t stop Huawei from producing the most cutting-edge, feature-packed phone of 2018: the Mate 20 Pro. Headline features include 3D IR-based (the most secure kind) face recognition matching the iPhone XS, a pressure-sensitive in-display fingerprint scanner and a brilliant triple-camera system on the back that is the best in the business.If that wasn’t enough the Mate 20 Pro also has a huge and beautiful 6.38in OLED screen squeezed into a slim and curved body, which keeps the whole phone relatively easy to handle. Huawei’s own Kirin 980 processor matches or bests rivals, while a large battery means it running for close to two days.When it does run out, it has really fast cable charging, fast wireless charging and it can even wirelessly charge another device with the flick of a switch.If you’re going to blow the budget, this is the one to do it on, unless you’re an iPhone diehard.RRP: £999 - deals from £749 (with trade-in)The best iPhone available isn’t the most expensive, nor is it, sadly, the cheapest. The iPhone XS is the middle of the road with best combination of features, size and that premium feel that makes and iPhone special, which it has to have costing this much.The 5.8in screen is stunning and both big enough for watching videos on the commute and small enough to easily hold and fit in your pocket. The dual camera system on the back is one of the best, the Face ID system works great (there’s no Touch ID or home button anymore) and Apple’s gesture navigation is the best in the business.Performance is top-notch, but battery life is only about a day compared to almost two for competitors. It still has Apple’s Lightning connector, not the newer universal USB-C standard, but does have wireless charging and will get software support longer than any other phone here.If you want an Apple smartphone, the iPhone XS is the best, but it costs a pretty penny.OnePlus has made a name for itself by offering top phones that undercut the competition on price, and the latest OnePlus 6T is no exception.OnePlus doesn’t skimp on the software either, with one of the best Android experiences you can get and three years of software updates from release. The only downsides are a camera that isn’t quite as good as the top-priced models, no wireless charging and not formal water resistance.With a great Android experience second only to Google’s, good battery, top performance and a gorgeous screen, the OnePlus 6T is hard to beat for £500.Until recently the OnePlus 6T was the king of the cut-price flagship. Now it has some real competition in the form of the Honor View20. Made by Huawei’s e-brand Honor, the View20 has a big, 6.4in full HD+ LCD screen that takes up the entire front with just a small hole in the top left corner for a selfie camera.It also has good battery life, super fast charging, a premium feel, a great rear-mounted fingerprint scanner and the same processor as Huawei’s Mate 20 Pro making it fast and capable. On the back it has a new generation of 48-megapixel camera, which is really very good and a cut above the OnePlus 6T.The Android software experience is solid, but not on the same level as the OnePlus, but you get a similar two to three years of updates from release. It’s even still got a headphone socket - a rarity in 2019.If you want the best camera for under £500, the Honor View20 is a cracking performer that feels and operates like a phone that’s much more expensive.RRP: £739 - deals from £550As the Android-marker, the Pixel 3 is Google showing what can be done when you create both the hardware and software together, just as Apple does. And as a result it has the best, most polished Android experience going.The hardware more or less matches the competition on specifications, but lacks any truly cutting-edge additions. Instead you get advanced software, a brilliant single camera and Android updates first with software support guaranteed through October 2021. Features such as Gmail’s Smart Compose are fun, while the recent update with Night Sight produces some amazing and unparalleled low-light images.The downside is you have to put up with battery that doesn’t quite match up to the competition lasting only about a day, but at least it has fast cable and wireless charging. There’s a bigger sibling, the Pixel 3 XL, but the Huawei Mate 20 Pro is better all round at that size.The Google Pixel 3 offers a first-class experience and is the best smaller Android phone currently available.Samsung is due to replace the Galaxy S9 next week, but if you can find it for £400 or less it could be a good deal. The larger S9+ could also be a worth looking at.The Galaxy Note 9 is Samsung’s huge, stylus-equipped productivity beast that’s overkill for most, but if you need a phone to do everything, this is it.Huawei’s original hit, the P20 Pro is due to be replaced in the next couple of months, but is still a great phone with a camera that rivals the excellent one on the Mate 20 Pro and can be picked up for as little as £430. Dual-sim versions are available.If you don’t want to spend £999 on the iPhone XS and the £749 iPhone XR just doesn’t cut it, Apple’s selling last year’s smash hit, the iPhone X for £769 refurbished.

By  Daniel ImmerwahrThere aren’t many historical episodes more firmly lodged in the United States’s national memory than the attack on Pearl Harbor. It is one of only a few events that many people in the country can put a date to: 7 December 1941, the “date which will live in infamy,” as Franklin D Roosevelt put it. Hundreds of books have been written about it – the Library of Congress holds more than 350. And Hollywood has made movies, from the critically acclaimed From Here to Eternity, starring Burt Lancaster, to the critically derided Pearl Harbor, starring Ben Affleck.But what those films don’t show is what happened next. Nine hours after Japan attacked the territory of Hawaii, another set of Japanese planes came into view over another US territory, the Philippines. As at Pearl Harbor, they dropped their bombs, hitting several air bases, to devastating effect.The attack on Pearl Harbor was just that – an attack. Japan’s bombers struck, retreated and never returned. Not so in the Philippines. There, the initial air raids were followed by more raids, then by invasion and conquest. Sixteen million Filipinos – US nationals who saluted the stars and stripes and looked to FDR as their commander in chief – fell under a foreign power.Contrary to popular memory, the event familiarly known as “Pearl Harbor” was in fact an all-out lightning strike on US and British holdings throughout the Pacific. On a single day, the Japanese attacked the US territories of Hawaii, the Philippines, Guam, Midway Island and Wake Island. They also attacked the British colonies of Malaya, Singapore and Hong Kong, and they invaded Thailand.At first, “Pearl Harbor” was not the way most people referred to the bombings. “Japs bomb Manila, Hawaii” was the headline in one New Mexico paper “Japanese Planes Bomb Honolulu, Island of Guam” in another in South Carolina. Sumner Welles, FDR’s undersecretary of state, described the event as “an attack upon Hawaii and upon the Philippines”. Eleanor Roosevelt used a similar formulation in her radio address on the night of 7 December, when she spoke of Japan “bombing our citizens in Hawaii and the Philippines”.That was how the first draft of FDR’s speech went, too: it presented the event as a “bombing in Hawaii and the Philippines”. Yet Roosevelt toyed with that draft all day, adding things in pencil, crossing other bits out. At some point he deleted the prominent references to the Philippines.Why did Roosevelt demote the Philippines? We don’t know, but it’s not hard to guess. Roosevelt was trying to tell a clear story: Japan had attacked the US. But he faced a problem. Were Japan’s targets considered “the United States”? Legally, they were indisputably US territory. But would the public see them that way? What if Roosevelt’s audience didn’t care that Japan had attacked the Philippines or Guam? Polls taken slightly before the attack show that few in the continental US supported a military defense of those remote territories.Roosevelt no doubt noted that the Philippines and Guam, although technically part of the US, seemed foreign to many. Hawaii, by contrast, was more plausibly “American”. Although it was a territory rather than a state, it was closer to North America and significantly whiter than the others.Yet even when it came to Hawaii, Roosevelt felt a need to massage the point. So, on the morning of his speech, he made another edit. He changed it so that the Japanese squadrons had bombed not the “island of Oahu”, but the “American island of Oahu”. Damage there, Roosevelt continued, had been done to “American naval and military forces”, and “very many American lives” had been lost.An American island, where American lives were lost – that was the point he was trying to make. If the Philippines was being rounded down to foreign, Hawaii was being rounded up to “American”.One reporter in the Philippines described the scene in Manila as the crowds listened to Roosevelt’s speech on the radio. The president spoke of Hawaii and the many lives lost there. Yet he only mentioned the Philippines, the reporter noted, “very much in passing”. Roosevelt made the war “seem to be something close to Washington and far from Manila”.This was not how it looked from the Philippines, where air-raid sirens continued to wail. “To Manilans the war was here, now, happening to us,” the reporter wrote. “And we have no air-raid shelters.”Hawaii, the Philippines, Guam – it wasn’t easy to know how to think about such places, or even what to call them. At the turn of the 20th century, when many were acquired (Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Guam, American Samoa, Hawaii, Wake), their status was clear. They were, as Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson unabashedly called them, colonies.That spirit of forthright imperialism didn’t last. Within a decade or two, after passions had cooled, the c-word became taboo. “The word colony must not be used to express the relationship which exists between our government and its dependent peoples,” an official admonished in 1914. Better to stick with a gentler term, used for them all: territories.Yet a striking feature of the overseas territories was how rarely they were even discussed. The maps of the country that most people had in their heads didn’t include places such as the Philippines. Those mental maps imagined the US to be contiguous: a union of states bounded by the Atlantic, the Pacific, Mexico and Canada.That is how most people envision the US today, possibly with the addition of Alaska and Hawaii. The political scientist Benedict Anderson called it the “logo map”, meaning that if the country had a logo, this shape would be it:The problem with the logo map, however, is that it isn’t right. Its shape does not match the country’s legal borders. Most obviously, the logo map excludes Hawaii and Alaska, which became states in 1959 and now appear on virtually all published maps of the country. But it is also missing Puerto Rico, which, although not a state, has been part of the country since 1899. When have you ever seen a map of the US that had Puerto Rico on it? Or American Samoa, Guam, the US Virgin Islands, the Northern Marianas or any of the other smaller islands that the US has annexed over the years?In 1941, the year Japan attacked, a more accurate picture would have been this:What this map shows is the country’s full territorial extent: the “Greater United States”, as some at the turn of the 20th century called it. In this view, the place normally referred to as the US – the logo map – forms only a part of the country. A large and privileged part, to be sure, yet still only a part. Residents of the territories often call it the “mainland”.On this to-scale map, Alaska isn’t shrunken down to fit into a small inset, as it is on most maps. It is the right size – ie, huge. The Philippines, too, looms large, and the Hawaiian island chain – the whole chain, not just the eight main islands shown on most maps – if superimposed on the mainland would stretch almost from Florida to California.This map also shows territory at the other end of the size scale. In the century before 1940, the US claimed nearly 100 uninhabited islands in the Caribbean and the Pacific. Some claims were forgotten in time – Washington could be surprisingly lax about keeping tabs. The 22 islands included here are the ones that appeared in official tallies (the census or other governmental reports) in the 1940s. I have represented them as clusters of dots in the bottom left and right corners, although they are so small that they would be invisible if they were drawn to scale.The logo map is not only misleading because it excludes large colonies and pinprick islands alike. It also suggests that the US is a politically uniform space: a union, voluntarily entered into, of states standing on equal footing with one another. But that is not true, and it has never been true. From its founding until the present day, the US has contained a union of American states, as its name suggests. But it has also contained another part: not a union, not states and (for most of its history) not wholly in the Americas – its territories.What is more, a lot of people have lived in that other part. According to the census count for the inhabited territories in 1940, the year before Pearl Harbor, nearly 19 million people lived in the colonies, the great bulk of them in the Philippines. That meant slightly more than one in eight of the people in the US lived outside of the states. For perspective, consider that only about one in 12 was African American. If you lived in the US on the eve of the second world war, in other words, you were more likely to be colonised than black.My point here is not to weigh forms of oppression against one another. In fact, the histories of African Americans and colonised peoples are tightly connected (and sometimes overlapping, as for the African-Caribbeans in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands). The racism that had pervaded the country since slavery also engulfed the territories. Like African Americans, colonial subjects were denied the vote, deprived of the rights of full citizens, called racial epithets, subjected to dangerous medical experiments and used as sacrificial pawns in war. They, too, had to make their way in a country where some lives mattered and others did not.What getting the Greater United States in view reveals is that race has been even more central to US history than is usually supposed. It hasn’t just been about black and white, but about Filipino, Hawaiian, Samoan and Chamoru (from Guam), too, among other identities. Race has not only shaped lives, but also the country itself – where the borders went, who has counted as “American”. Once you look beyond the logo map, you see a whole new set of struggles over what it means to inhabit the US.Looking beyond the logo map, however, could be hard for mainlanders. The national maps they used rarely showed the territories. Even the world atlases were confusing. During the second world war, Rand McNally’s Ready Reference Atlas of the World – like many other atlases at the time – listed Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Philippines as “foreign”.A class of seventh-grade girls at the Western Michigan College Training School in Kalamazoo scratched their heads over this. They had been trying to follow the war on their maps. How, they wondered, could the attack on Pearl Harbor have been an attack on the US if Hawaii was foreign? They wrote to Rand McNally to inquire.“Although Hawaii belongs to the United States, it is not an integral part of this country,” the publisher replied. “It is foreign to our continental shores, and therefore cannot logically be shown in the United States proper.”The girls were not satisfied. Hawaii is not an integral part of this country? “We believe this statement is not true,” they wrote. It is “an alibi instead of an explanation”. Further, they continued, “we feel that the Rand McNally atlas is misleading and a good cause for the people of outlying possessions to be embarrassed and disturbed”. The girls forwarded the correspondence to the Department of the Interior and asked for adjudication. Of course, the seventh-graders were right. As an official clarified, Hawaii was, indeed, part of the US.Yet the government could be just as misleading as Rand McNally on this score. Consider the census: according to the constitution, census takers were required to count only the states, but they had always counted the territories, too. Or, at least, they had counted the continental territories. The overseas territories were handled differently. Their populations were noted, but they were otherwise excluded from demographic calculations. Basic facts about how long people lived, how many children they had, what races they were – these were given for the mainland alone.The maps and census reports that mainlanders saw presented them with a selectively cropped portrait of their country. The result was profound confusion. “Most people in this country, including educated people, know little or nothing about our overseas possessions,” concluded a governmental report written during the second world war. “As a matter of fact, a lot of people do not know that we have overseas possessions. They are convinced that only ‘foreigners’, such as the British, have an ‘empire’. Americans are sometimes amazed to hear that we, too, have an ‘empire’.”The proposition that the US is an empire is less controversial today. The case can be made in a number of ways. The dispossession of Native Americans and relegation of many to reservations was pretty transparently imperialist. Then, in the 1840s, the US fought a war with Mexico and seized a third of it. Fifty years later, it fought a war with Spain and claimed the bulk of Spain’s overseas territories.Empire isn’t just landgrabs, though. What do you call the subordination of African Americans? Starting in the interwar period, the celebrated US intellectual WEB Du Bois argued that black people in the US looked more like colonised subjects than like citizens. Many other black thinkers, including Malcolm X and the leaders of the Black Panthers, have agreed.Or what about the spread of US economic power abroad? The US might not have physically conquered western Europe after the second world war, but that didn’t stop the French from complaining of “coca-colonisation”. Critics there felt swamped by US commerce. Today, with the world’s business denominated in dollars, and McDonald’s in more than 100 countries, you can see they might have had a point.Then there are the military interventions. The years since the second world war have brought the US military to country after country. The big wars are well-known: Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan. But there has also been a constant stream of smaller engagements. Since 1945, US armed forces have been deployed abroad for conflicts or potential conflicts 211 times in 67 countries. Call it peacekeeping if you want, or call it imperialism. But clearly this is not a country that has kept its hands to itself.Yet among all the talk of empire, one thing that often slips from view is actual territory. Yes, many would agree that the US is or has been an empire, for all the reasons above. But how much can most people say about the colonies themselves? Not, I would wager, very much.It is not as if the information isn’t out there. Scholars, many working from the sites of empire themselves, have assiduously researched this topic for decades. The problem is that their works have been sidelined – filed, so to speak, on the wrong shelves. They are there, but as long as we have the logo map in our heads, they will seem irrelevant. They will seem like books about foreign countries. The confusion and shoulder-shrugging indifference that mainlanders displayed at the time of Pearl Harbor hasn’t changed much at all.I will confess to having made this conceptual filing error myself. Although I studied US foreign relations as a doctoral student and read countless books about “American empire” – the wars, the coups, the meddling in foreign affairs – nobody ever expected me to know even the most elementary facts about the territories. They just didn’t feel important.It wasn’t until I travelled to Manila, researching something else entirely, that it clicked. To get to the archives, I would travel by “jeepney”, a transit system originally based on repurposed US army jeeps. I boarded in a section of  Manila where the streets are named after US colleges (Yale, Columbia, Stanford, Notre Dame), states and cities (Chicago, Detroit, New York, Brooklyn, Denver), and presidents (Jefferson, Van Buren, Roosevelt, Eisenhower). When I would arrive at my destination, the Ateneo de Manila University, one of the country’s most prestigious schools, I would hear students speaking what sounded to my Pennsylvanian ears to be virtually unaccented English. Empire might be hard to make out from the mainland, but from the sites of colonial rule themselves, it is impossible to miss.The Philippines is not a US territory any more it got its independence after the second world war. Other territories, although they were not granted independence, received new statuses. Puerto Rico became a “commonwealth”, which ostensibly replaced a coercive relationship with a consenting one. Hawaii and Alaska, after some delay, became states, overcoming decades of racist determination to keep them out of the union.Yet today, the US continues to hold overseas territory. Besides Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands and a handful of minor outlying islands, the US maintains roughly 800 overseas military bases around the world.None of this, however – not the large colonies, small islands, or military bases – has made much of a dent on the mainland mind. One of the truly distinctive features of the US’s empire is how persistently ignored it has been. This is, it is worth emphasising, unique. The British weren’t confused as to whether there was a British empire. They had a holiday, Empire Day, to celebrate it. France didn’t forget that Algeria was French. It is only the US that has suffered from chronic confusion about its own borders.The reason is not hard to guess. The country perceives itself to be a republic, not an empire. It was born in an anti-imperialist revolt and has fought empires ever since, from Hitler’s Thousand-Year Reich and the Japanese empire to the “evil empire” of the Soviet Union. It even fights empires in its dreams. Star Wars, a saga that started with a rebellion against the Galactic Empire, is one of the highest-grossing film franchises of all time.This self-image of the US as a republic is consoling, but it is also costly. Most of the cost has been paid by those living in the colonies and around the military bases. The logo map has relegated them to the shadows, which are a dangerous place to live. At various times, the inhabitants of the US empire have been shot, shelled, starved, interned, dispossessed, tortured and experimented on. What they haven’t been, by and large, is seen.The logo map carries a cost for mainlanders, too. It gives them a truncated view of their own history, one that excludes part of their country. It is an important part. The overseas parts of the US have triggered wars, brought forth inventions, raised up presidents and helped define what it means to be “American”. Only by including them in the picture do we see a full portrait of the country – not as it appears in its fantasies, but as it actually is.How to Hide an Empire: A Short History of the Greater United States by Daniel Immerwahr will be published by Bodley Head on 28 February.

He told diplomats that he “does not expect a solution this week”.“The vote yesterday indicated there is no majority in the Tory party for the withdrawal agreement,” one diplomat said after Barnier’s address. “He said ‘strategy May has failed’ and that she needs to go cross-party.”A number of ambassadors echoed Barnier’s reading. “We have a major problem,” one told the meeting.Barnier, who will meet Corbyn on Thursday, also told diplomats that during a dinner with Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, on Monday, the British cabinet minister had pressed the need for a legal guarantee of being able to exit the backstop or a time-limit on the customs union it envisages.The EU official told the ambassadors that it appeared crucial to the government to be able to change the legal advice given by the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox. Cox is due to go to Brussels with Barclay on Monday.Sources in London suggested the prime minister had hoped that other EU leaders would be more understanding of the kind of parliamentary game-playing seen on Thursday than officials in Brussels. “They are all politicians,” said a government source.Privately, Downing Street is exasperated by what it regards as self-interested posturing by some MPs. Sources described the prime minister as furious in the voting lobbies on Wednesday night.On Friday, May’s spokeswoman said the previous vote in January, where MPs passed an amendment demanding the backstop be replaced with alternative arrangements and rejected the possibility of no deal, was the only one that had spelled out what parliament would accept.“The motion on 29 January remains the only one the Commons has passed expressing what it does want, and that is what we are pursuing,” the spokeswoman said.Anger at the ERG’s antics was explicit from soft Brexit ministers in the aftermath of the defeat. The defence minister Tobias Ellwood called the group’s actions “selfish and provocative” and said they were acting as a “party within a party”.Alistair Burt, the Foreign Office minister, gave his strongest signal yet he was prepared to resign unless the government allowed him to back efforts to stop no deal by the next vote at the end of February.“If my colleagues cannot accept a necessary compromise, or if government does not itself move to prevent no deal, then I expect parliament to do so, as such moves would certainly pass a commons vote,” he said. “I will continue to act consistently with the views I have regularly set out.”Senior Labour figures, including Keir Starmer and Jon Trickett, are to hold a fresh round of meetings with their government counterparts next week over whether a cross-party consensus can be found.One person present at the last meeting said Barclay and May’s de facto deputy, David Lidington, appeared serious about looking for common ground – but that little progress was likely to be made until May is willing to lift her objection to a customs union."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/337cc98ed67483d28425c19deb9bf78026fc9b28/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e96aba4a7f2ae746577dea41031d80cd","title":"may has been playing all sides readers on the eu brexit strategy vote","story":"You have been reacting to MPs passing an amendment to replace the Irish backstop and discussing what might be next for BrexitAnother awful day in Brexitland. This country is limping towards a chaotic exit. The strident voices of the far right shouting down any rational discussion. We have a PM who is incompetent and who has become an international embarrassment, an ineffectual leader of the opposition at odds with his membership and half his party and a media largely hell bent on driving us over the cliff. How has our once revered democracy morphed into this mess? DaivedoverEvery time that May makes a concession to the ERG they take a step back to reveal yet another demand and uncover more of the trap that has been there all along. She is like a weak, second-rate school teacher who is letting the louts in the back row of her class dominate and control all lessons. The ERG has a clear agenda of their own and that has nothing to do with what is best for the country or for the majority of people in the country. These are the arrogant and self-serving men who conned and coerced voters into taking back control and now expect that power to be given to them. Theresa May is incapable of spotting a wolf in wolf’s clothing. Why? John HewardYou get what you deserve. May has been trying to play to all sides of the argument. It cannot work. The hard right Tories will only accept a no strings deal. The more centrist Tories want to either remain or have a deal that to a certain extent, ties us to Europe. This is where Tories have existed for decades. Surely May didn’t really think that the two groups would unite over policies that either side could not agree to? She did not think to plan an exit before even triggering article 50. She should have spent a year in trying to find consensus instead of just applying her “my way or the byway” approach. Cameron is to blame for this fiasco, but May is guilty of completely mishandling the whole thing. morbileBrexit is bad enough, but the constitutional disaster that May and co are overseeing is worse. In the space of just over two months, her government has been found in contempt of parliament, and heavily lost votes on key items of government policy. Yet she maintains that nothing has changed, continues on her path unaltered with little or no admonition from the populist press or the public. Given the precedents she is setting - if a really competent leader ever got into power, imagine what havoc could be wreaked - as parliamentary scrutiny has effectively been shown to be, well, ineffective. dougmeyberryBetween the Malthouse fiasco and now the ERG abstaining on this vote (and handing May another authority sapping defeat) the PM needs to stop pretending that Rees-Mogg and his merry men will accept anything except a no-deal exit. The days are long gone where there was any point in pretending that she can somehow come to terms with them, except by a complete surrender to their position. If there are any solutions to this mess, it will be in found spite of the ERG, and pretending it can be part of any solution is delusional. CaligulaMcNuttMay’s premiership has delivered the very worst of all worlds. It has allowed the ERG to undermine her from the sidelines, given disproportionate levels of influence to the DUP, and allowed no-deal advocates like Davis and Raab to fritter away two years’ worth of negotiating time while supposedly acting as Brexit Secretary. On the evidence since 2017, May must now outstrip Cameron as our worst PM ever. Her almost unique combination of total inflexibility, weakness and insecurity leads to her appeasing the ERG and the hard Brexiteers in her own party while failing to realise that the ERG aren’t remotely interested in anything other than “no deal” WestonTigerSurely it’s time that even Theresa May acknowledges that the ERG are not acting in good faith? They’re advocating no deal because they know parliament will finally have too much sense to go down that route, leaving them free to proclaim their ideological purity and completely disassociate themselves from any problems that arise from Brexit. davidabsalomThe Tories have completely failed at every stage of this process, from calling a referendum on the issue in the first place to everything that has ensued as a result. Any PM with even a crumb of authority would have disciplined or expelled members of herhis party who vote against the interests of the nation. May clearly has no authority and, it is becoming clear, no respect for the good of the nation. Brexit must be paused of stopped altogether so we can bring in a government worthy of the name.

Some party colleagues say that if she were to go it could represent a tipping point.Conservative MPs considering their futures, according to those involved in the talks, include Sarah Wollaston, the MP for Totnes, Anna Soubry, the MP for Broxtowe, and Heidi Allen, who represents South Cambridgeshire.The three have cooperated closely with Labour MPs as part of the People’s Vote second referendum campaign, and were all lead signatories of an amendment on Thursday that forced the government to agree to release no-deal cabinet documents.Those involved in the discussions believe that a crunch point could come at the end of February, when pro-EU Labour MPs desperately want Corbyn to back a second referendum and restless Conservatives want May to rule out no deal if she cannot get a revised Brexit agreement through parliament.A source in the People’s Vote campaign said: “Whatever happens, it is important to emphasise this is nothing to do with our campaign which is strictly and proudly non-partisan, involving supporters from all parties and none.”Another idea circulating is that the new group could be called the Reformist party, with the Lib Dems contributing national and local resources. “There are a lot of generals here without an army – well the Lib Dems have an army of members,” one MP involved said.A Labour MP contacted by members of the group said he believed there were around a dozen MPs in his party close to quitting. Those involved in the organisation are understood to have conducted significant polling, including in target constituencies.“I honestly believe this is imminent. You will see the values emphasised first, rather than policies to help people make that change. There are the names that are public but others are involved, including in the organisation of it, who have never been named,” the MP said.Labour strategists say they are relaxed about a potential breakaway, arguing that the figures involved are unlikely to be of the political standing of the four former cabinet members who helped found the Social Democratic party in 1981.They also believe there is a firm majority in the shadow cabinet against a “people’s vote” and continue to hope May will ultimately be forced to soften her red lines and shift towards something more like the form of Brexit they have proposed.The Momentum founder, Jon Lansman, issued a stark warning to MPs considering leaving the party that their project would be rejected by voters. “Chris Leslie, Chuka Umunna and Gavin Shuker are marginal figures with marginal politics,” he said.“This is very different to the SDP breakaway in 1981. I was there, and I remember at least a certain level of public support for their policies. The situation is completely different now. Socialism has gone mainstream, a Blairite programme has no support amongst the public and parties pursuing similar programmes across Europe have seen their vote share plummet.”Some in Labour appear to be goading the grouping to split. On Thursday, Momentum released a spoof Valentine’s Day video aimed at Umunna, set to the song Please Don’t Go. It urged him to stay in the party, but concluded: “If you go we’re keeping the house xxx.”Local Lib Dem parties in some constituencies, such as Wavertree and Totnes where it has a presence, have been told to be receptive if any MP were to quit Labour or the Conservatives, even if they do so to sit in Westminster as an independent.Party insiders say the Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, could step down after the local elections in May, creating a vacancy for a leader of any new movement. They, too, have been studying the history of the SDP and say the Lib Dems could be open to anything from a full merger to an alliance or supporting independent candidates."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eba500e7a709538a6868c7a02c4678e44271d038/0_123_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d13f23526c0415d316396c60000b4dd","title":"ageing and the happiest age 16 or 70","story":"Figures released last week show that 16 and 70 are the ages when we are most likely to be content with our lives. Does personal experience bear this out?In the play Songs for Nobodies, currently on in London’s West End, the remarkable Bernadette Robinson plays Beatrice Ethel Appleton, a young powder room attendant working in New York on a night in 1961. Her husband has walked out on her and, tearful, she is about to meet Judy Garland, whom Robinson vocally mimics in the musical. “Happiness,” Beatrice remarks dolefully, “is the temporary illusion that nothing is about to change for the worse.”Last week, the Resolution Foundation thinktank published a report that analysed seven years of wellbeing surveys run by the Office for National Statistics since 2011. Respondents of a variety of ages rated their life satisfaction, self-worth, happiness and anxiety levels on a scale from one to 10. In a U-shaped curve, it showed that being in one’s 50s is the pits, while the ages of 16 and 70 are the twin peaks of happiness. Bearing in mind that the average is indicative of a trend, not a universal truth – and that 16 and 70 can also mean, for some, poverty, loneliness and regret for what is lost or hasn’t happened – according to the report, what contributes to happiness at 70 is, predictably, the good fortune to have health, a degree, a job, a partner and to own your home.I know seventysomethings who have all these in their lives and still rage – as if ageing can be shaken into submission, youth restored and mortality avoided. They resist change. Even for them, however, the face eventually pleats into wrinkles, friends and family die and invisibility becomes the norm. Whatever the surveys say, there is no illusion, at 70, that decline is not at hand. As American comedian George Carlin once said, “Age is a hell of a price to pay for wisdom.” So where is the joy?For feminist Lynne Segal, it lies partly in resistance to how society expects women to age, while, ironically, how we choose to live the final decades of life can bring a kind of liberation. Mark Twain was right. If we could be born at 80 and live our lives backwards, happiness would hit not twice over the decades but many more times in a less materialistic (though fairly paid) and more philosophically purposeful life. Hindsight is grand.Sir Richard Layard, “happiness tsar” under New Labour, diagnosed us, as a nation, as suffering from lack of trust and excessive concern with status, materialism, envy and winning the rat race. This view is endorsed by Professor Paul Dolan of the London School of Economics: “To be happier we need to move from a culture of ‘more please’ to one of ‘just enough’.”Another thinktank, the New Economics Foundation, has proposed five ways to boost wellbeing – take notice, be active, connect, keep learning and give. At least two of these – connect (death of community services and public spaces) and keep learning (demise of adult education) have been hammered by cuts, and still wellbeing continues to rise – if only just. In April 2011, the ONS said the nation’s average out of 10 for happiness was 7.29. Last year, it was 7.52. Eight years ago, the 16-19 age group (in spite of an anxiety epidemic) had the highest levels of satisfaction. Now, it’s the 70-74s, with women slightly higher than men. So what seems to be happening?Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, “What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared with what lies within us.” But what lies within us is difficult to establish when life is one headlong rush. Family commitments multiply, and work and stress are too often twin companions. In contrast, at 70, for some, time may suddenly and unexpectedly become “free”, less squeezed, less throttled by ambition.When I was in my 50s, I read a remarkable book, Rowing Without Oars, by a Swedish television presenter, Ulla-Carin Lindquist. In it, she magnificently celebrated her final months, having been diagnosed at the age of 50 with a form of motor neurone disease. She died in 2004, leaving her husband and four children. “It is now for the first time that I feel myself to be living in the present,” she wrote. “Death brings me closer to life.”On reading it, I felt gratitude for the profound meaning she drew from her existence – in spite of a body that had lost almost all function – and for her bravery. Fifteen years later, I’m still grateful, but the sagacity of Lindquist’s words now has a greater resonance: living in the present in the – hopefully long – shadow of death can make you infinitely more appreciative of the magical “ordinary” incidents in everyday life.Ageing is problematised. Yes, it may mean less money, autonomy and energy, and poorer health. But, with luck, the failures and tough lessons over the years have also taught resilience, perspective, tolerance and patience. (Though they might equally have taught you to be grumpy, narrow-minded, tight-fisted and reactionary.)Best of all, perhaps, the true luxuries in life that we have less time to value when younger – relationships, family, community, giving back, the changing seasons, doing nothing, caring less what others think – will, if we are fortunate, finally receive due care and attention. And long may it last.

Still, he had matters well in hand before that incident and could have a few pounds to spare over the rest in this Reynoldstown Novices’ Chase.1.45 Wincanton This looks a good chance for Gino Trail, who put up a fine effort behind Dolos a fortnight ago, in his first outing for 10 months. Kerry Lee’s veteran, who had a wind operation in the off-season, will provide these rivals with a serious test from the front.1.55 Haydock With Alan King firing in winners for fun just now, it may be worth taking a chance on the fitness of Yanworth, who has not been seen since the last festival, when he was sixth in the stayers. He would be comfortably the best of these if on song.2.10 Ascot The winner of this race last year, Regal Encore has a fine record around Ascot and is only a couple of pounds higher this time. His one run this season was not especially convincing but Anthony Honeyball’s string was under a cloud at the time and is faring better now. This has been the plan for some time.2.45 Ascot Moving the Denman Chase from Newbury has cost us the chance to see Native River, who seems ill-suited to right-handed tracks. As a result, this looks a straightforward opportunity for the King George winner, Clan Des Obeaux, and it will be a surprise if Terrefort can give him a fright.3.00 Wincanton A close third to Yanworth in this race two years ago, Sceau Royal is of interest as he reverts to the smaller obstacles. His Shloer Chase success in November suggests he retains plenty of pace.3.35 Haydock The Welsh National was too much for Ballyoptic, who carried top weight on a testing surface, but the drier ground and flatter track here can show this stout stayer to better advantage. It should help that the fences will not be as stiff as they were in November.3.55 Ascot Ruth Jefferson was hoping to walk the course early on Saturday morning in the hope it has sufficient give for Waiting Patiently. If he ran, he would be hard to beat but the odds seem against that. Cyrname looks the one to be with after his dominant performance here last month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f719f5d16301859ac2b5df339b92eacff9082e9c/0_154_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68c7cd8ffd27b1324bedd78b2bc5f35e","title":"amazon new york long island city hq2 michael gianaris","story":"Michael Gianaris turned his outrage into leverage when he was appointed to an obscure state board – and soon after, the company called the project offAmazon made plenty of enemies with its plans for a new headquarters in New York, but one of those foes played an outsized role in sending the tech giant packing.The man who stared down Amazon is state senator Michael Gianaris, a Democrat who represents Long Island City, the Queens neighborhood where the company set its sights.Gianaris came out in opposition to a deal that proposed $3bn in subsidies and tax breaks for the new campus, alongside a slew of other politicians. But his outrage turned into leverage when he was last week appointed to an obscure state board where he would be one of three people with veto power over the project. Days later, reports emerged that Amazon was rethinking its plans.By Thursday, the company had called the project off.“New York is in a unique position to stand up and draw a line, because Amazon is not bigger than New York,” Gianaris told the . “We have the ability to set the tone for the nation.”If Amazon had had its way, its new campus would have risen on a waterfront parcel across the East River opposite Manhattan. It was to employ at least 25,000 people and, backers said, generate $27bn in tax money for the city and state over the next 25 years.Grassroots groups organized quickly against the project, which they worried would drive up rents. Amazon executives further angered opponents when they vowed to oppose any effort by workers to unionize.“A community that was facing its own demolition was salvaged. And New York took a stand against the type of corporate subsidies that are increasing the wealth concentration in this country,” Gianaris said.New York governor Andrew Cuomo, the project’s chief proponent, has made clear who he will blame for the project’s collapse: his fellow Democrats in the state senate.“The New York state senate has done tremendous damage,” he said on Thursday. “They should be held accountable for this lost economic opportunity.”The state senate’s top Republican also took aim. “From the start, the senate Democrats have politicized and poisoned this process just so they could avoid the wrath of the extreme left wing of their party,” minority leader John Flanagan said after the deal’s collapse.But Gianaris had no problem playing the chief naysayer. “I’m very comfortable being the person that says we should not be giving $3bn to Jeff Bezos when we can’t afford to fix our subways or have enough housing for people to live in,” he said.The politician fought the project on multiple fronts, holding rallies, gathering petition signatures and introducing bills that would bar New York from participating in nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) like the one used to lure Amazon, and prohibit real estate sales based on inside information.But his best chance to stop the project came through a little-known panel called the public authorities control board, which had to sign off on a development plan.Gianaris, who became a deputy majority leader in the senate when Democrats claimed control of the body this year after years of Republican dominance, was chosen as the senate’s representative on the board, a post that comes with veto power. That was a hurdle for Amazon, which had counted on the state’s maneuver to avoid a city council vote.Amazon picked New York and Arlington, Virginia, for new offices after staging a national competition between cities vying to host its secondary headquarters, after its base in Seattle.News that the company was wavering on New York set off a new scramble among cities which had lost out but were quick to say they would still welcome the project.Dallas was eager for another shot, with an editorial in the Dallas Morning News headlined: “Dear Amazon, New York Doesn’t Want You Dallas Does.” Miami and Chicago renewed their interest, as did Newark, New Jersey, which had offered Amazon $7bn in incentives. Even a Staten Island city councilman made a pitch for the company to simply switch New York city boroughs and avoid the strife.But Amazon disappointed the other contenders, saying it has no plans to reopen the HQ2 search.It’s not unusual for big development projects to generate big opposition in New York. A few are killed, but more commonly local officials extract concessions from the developer.For a company like Amazon, that may have meant giving up some of its subsidies or agreeing to remain neutral if employees attempted to unionize.But Amazon, which dangled its headquarters as a prize for cities to covet, proved unwilling to deal.“Rather than engage with the community that would be most affected by their project, they instead decide to pack up and leave like a petulant child,” Gianaris said. “There’s no indication they took seriously the community’s concerns regarding this project.”Gianaris, meanwhile, isn’t about to start shopping at Amazon again.“I was lamenting during the holidays that it was really hard to shop without using Amazon. That’s how pervasive it’s become,” he said. “They’re into everything, and that’s part of the danger of who they are and the kind of power they have.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5229b6fc07baf1f9ce995fd84e7a324caea1dab/0_285_6175_3706/master/6175.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7191f6120c94a56eeb3062b8cd537c48","title":"amazon new york long island city activists","story":"Abrupt collapse of company’s plans seen as a milestone victory for leftwing insurgents over Democrats who backed the dealAmazon picked a tough moment to come to New York.Progressive groups were in the ascendant and they turned their fire on an obvious target: a plan to lure a company run by the world’s richest man with $3bn in subsidies and tax breaks.The abrupt collapse of Amazon’s plan for a new headquarters, or HQ2, in Long Island City was a milestone victory for leftwing insurgents over establishment Democrats who backed the deal.“This is a new day in New York City politics,” said Sasha Wijeyeratne, executive director of Caaav: Organizing Asian Communities.“They sauntered in here and said HQ2 was inevitable,” she said. “Queens and New York City rose up, and we proved Amazon wrong.”Local politicians, well aware of the influence of activists who helped unseat a longtime incumbent and elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to the House of Representatives last year, joined the resistance. City councilman Jimmy Van Bramer and state senator Michael Gianaris became leaders in the fight to stop the project.They were girding for a years-long fight but it turned out to be unnecessary. Amazon was dragged before the city council for hostile questions and opponents went beyond the New York deal to pound the global company over its labor practices and work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement on facial recognition technology.Amazon opted not to stand and fight. With remarkable speed, executives called off their plans and left.New York City’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, supported the project but thought Amazon should have anticipated the onslaught. This was New York, after all.“Yeah, we are a tough city, but they should have known that coming in,” De Blasio told reporters, saying he was “flabbergasted” when an Amazon executive called to tell him the company was pulling out, not long before the decision was made public. He had expected the company to negotiate with its critics.“There wasn’t a shred of dialogue,” he said. “Out of nowhere they just took their ball and went home.”In Queens, activists were celebrating complete with a mariachi band, a piñata with a likeness of Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos, and choruses of: “Hey, hey, hey, goodbye.”“If they had good intentions, they would have stayed and figured it out,” said Maritza Silva-Farrell, executive director of Align. “I don’t think they ever would have, because of who they are.”Amazon came promising jobs: 25,000 paying an average of $150,000 a year. But New York, unlike some HQ2 contenders that bet on Amazon to turn around slumping economies, has enjoyed years of economic growth, including a booming tech sector. In a bulletin after the collapse of the deal, S\u0026ampP Global Ratings called it a “nonevent” for the local economy.Opponents were more concerned about the cost of housing, saying rising rents in Queens would drive residents out of their homes. When pressed to remain neutral if their New York workers attempted to unionize, Amazon executives flatly refused.“The tide is turning,” said Fahd Ahmed, head of the group Desis Rising Up and Moving. “People need good jobs and they can’t afford their rent.”While opponents celebrated, some residents and business owners rued the death of the deal and expressed anger at what they saw as a betrayal by officials who bowed to the loudest voices.“This was a gift,” said Josh Bowen, who owns John Brown Smokehouse near the site now dominated by warehouses and old industrial buildings where Amazon planned to build its campus. “Have you seen this neighborhood? It’s a dump over here.”“They want to out-AOC AOC,” he said of local politicians channeling the rhetoric of Ocasio-Cortez. “One of the things I thought this new wave would do is breed a lot of leaders. It bred a lot of lemmings, is what it did. It bred a lot of robots.”Polls showed that solid majorities of New Yorkers supported an Amazon campus in Queens. Tenant leaders at public housing developments spoke in favor of the project and unions for construction and building service workers supported the plan. But supporters never mobilized at the scale opponents did.In a statement, Queensbridge Houses tenant association president April Simpson and other tenant leaders called the failure of the deal a “disaster” and blamed “grandstanding politicians” who “spread misinformation to whip up the small band of opponents”.Frank Raffaele, founder of Coffeed, a Long Island City-based coffee shop chain, said he was “overjoyed” when he learned Amazon would be coming to Queens.“We took it and we destroyed it. For no reason,” he said. “These socialists, whoever they are, these activists, they’re not doing the math on this. Their whole mindset is ‘No, no, no, no’.”Raffaele said he understood Amazon’s decision to pull out in face of the torrent of criticism because: “They are not going to be bullied. They don’t want to be bashed all the time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74fa19e5499aad025db2c945c4a86b0816fda258/0_403_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93f2cc1e0c525f830410188ede979a03","title":"art walks yorkshire sculpture trail parks banksy bristol birmingham grizedale","story":"These trails take in everything from street art in Birmingham to Henry Moores in West Yorkshire – where our man and his dog find the natural attractions as alluring as the manmade onesAs we head up out of the trees by the lake, the snow comes down and for a few minutes we can see nothing but the grey shapes of sheep as they huddle together. I even mistake the ovine drinking trough for a piece of modern art, an error that could probably only happen here in the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, 500 acres of parkland, pasture and lake where on your winter walk you are as likely to bump into a Highland cow or Texel ewe as a Gormley or Caro.Wilf, my terrier, thinks he knows which is more interesting, delivering a stinging jet of canine criticism towards Ai Weiwei’s Zodiac Heads. What Wilf lacks in artistic nous, however, he makes up for in appreciation of the walk, recognising a good yomp when he sees one. We had started at the car park, passing Barbara Hepworth’s Family of Man, then looped around the various gallery buildings. There was plenty to see around these outlying buildings: we got sidetracked by a multicoloured octopus and a video installation, but finally dropped down to the Cascade Bridge and then up into the snowstorm on the hill.Not all the park is available to dog-walkers unfortunately. We are going to abandon the hound later in order to see Jaume Plensa’s Wilsis, a seven-metre-tall head by the lake. In the meantime we press on, climbing to the Longside Gallery (closed in winter) then on to a wooded ridge where Andy Goldsworthy has constructed Hanging Trees, three stone-walled rectangles, each containing a dead tree.The joy of this walk is partly in the conversation and debate. I’m with someone who loathes Goldsworthy’s “bouldery balderdash” while I am a committed fan of his subtle stonework. Our verbal battle keeps the cold at bay all the way down through beautiful beech woods, back to the lake where we find Henry Moore. His bronzes really are the tour-de-force moments of the entire park and are given centre stage on the broad lawns below the visitor centre. And so we complete our first circuit, a 90-minute loop, depending on how fast you walk while smiling appreciatively, or shaking your fist, at large random objects.We pop Wilf back into the car and stride out for the shorter lakeside route, which is definitely worth the extra effort, although I am adamant that the frozen lake with swans beats any human artistic effort – another heated debate to keep us going. I’m also quite taken with the endeavours of a previous generation: the park was once home to a formidable branch of the Wentworth family who loved nothing better than constructing follies, inserting all kinds of pyramids, grottoes and grotesque stony nonsense into the woods.When I suggest that they did “garden furniture” with more humour and skill than all the pompous modern artists, we are propelled all the way back up the hill on a tidal wave of discussion.And there we reach the cafe, a lovely minimalist hunk of concrete with spectacular views – or a hideous brutalist nightmare – depending on your point of view. And there, at long last, we reach full agreement: both the curried parsnip soup and the coffee walnut cake are excellent. • Free entry, car parking £11 for the day,  ysp.org.ukOne of the UK’s first sculpture trails, this one provides some big-hitting names – Cornelia Parker and Ian Hamilton Finlay are here – plus three good walks of between two and five miles.

Opposite is the old Typhoo Tea factory, site of graffiti by Stock and a recent location for Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One.

They have spread across the United States and have been used by parents of homosexual or transgender adolescents against their will.Most such practices depend on talking therapy, but some techniques involve injections of large doses of testosterone, electric shocks, and other treatments.“I do not believe in these therapies, mainly owing to my own homosexuality,” said Spahn, who represents the right wing of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative CDU party.The health minister is counting on support from his colleagues if and when a vote is taken. “I cannot imagine there is a partisan of conversion therapies in my parliamentary group,” he said.Within the EU, only Malta and some Spanish regions have banned the practice outright.

There was a lull in its activity after the 11 September 2001 attacks when the Pakistani government cracked down on the group.But it has re-emerged in recent years, carrying out attacks in India including on a Punjab state airbase in January 2016, and nine months later, on an army base in Uri near the ceasefire line with Pakistan.The Uri attack killed 19 and prompted the Indian government to announce it had carried out “surgical strikes” to destroy militant camps inside Pakistan-controlled Kashmir – a measured response that salved public anger without igniting a wider conflict.Control of the Himalayan region, one of the most militarised places on earth, is ided between India and Pakistan and claimed in full by both. China administers a smaller patch in the east.A full-blown revolt against Indian control of Kashmir bolstered by Pakistani and Afghani fighters raged throughout the 1990s but waned after negotiations between Delhi and Islamabad.It has been replaced by a low-level insurgency waged largely by young Kashmiris disillusioned with India’s failure to accommodate popular calls for greater autonomy or independence for the region.Thursday’s attacker was identified as Adil Ahmad Dar, 20, a mason who joined the militancy in March last year. In a video released after the attack, Dar said he was avenging human rights violations and warned that more killing would follow.Both the ruling Bharatiya Janata party and the main opposition Congress cancelled all political events on Friday.

Elsewhere, 15 people were crushed to death at a ruling party rally in eastern Port Harcourt. On Thursday, 14 sacks of ballot papers were intercepted in Kano state – though police said they were merely “specimen” papers to educate voters.As Nigerians prepared to cast their votes, data analysts raised concerns about the number of new voters registered since January 2018, which they said increased by almost exactly the same percentage in each of the country’s states, and suggested that the results of Saturday’s presidential election could be open to mass rigging.Plotted on a scatter line graph, there was a 0.99 correlation across all the states, without a single outlier. According to three separate data analysts, the parity cannot be a coincidence, and two of them called it a “statistical impossibility”. “Only God works that closely,” one said.But other observers said there were other possible explanations for the correlation, including demographics.“In itself, it’s not an indicator of any kind of electoral malpractice or manipulation,” said economist Nonso Obikili. He said the correlation in the registration figures across states was “what you would expect, because demographic changes don’t happen very quickly”.If some of the new voters registered are fake, it could imply meddling at the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) , though it is unclear whether it would be the ruling party or the opposition that would stand to benefit.Additional data seen by the  shows irregularities in registration for the 2015 election in which Buhari came to power, until now considered to have been free and fair.On Sunday 16 February, 84m voters will choose who leads Africa’s largest democracy. Despite over 60 candidates, it is likely to be a choice between President Muhammadu Buhari, and former vice president Atiku Abubakar.Buhari\u0027s 2015 victory with his All Progressives Congress (APC) party was built on three promises: to rid Nigeria of endemic corruption, fix the economy and tackle security threats.The government says it is making progress in the fight against Boko Haram, but it is now in its tenth year, and the economy entered and climbed out of recession under Buhari. Opponents say his government is failing to tackle corruption, while Amnesty International say the army has been responsible for human rights abuses.After spending five months in Britain in 2017 receiving treatment for an undisclosed ailment, opposition groups said he was unfit for office, but Buhari, 76, says he is strong enough to serve.Main opposition People\u0027s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate Atiku, 72, has been caught up in corruption allegations since serving as vice president from 1999-2007. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.\u0026nbsp He has promised business-friendly policies to double the economy to $900bn by 2025. He wants to privatise parts of the state oil company, and create a $25bn fund to support private sector investment.Atiku\u0027s opponents have claimed he would exploit those pro-business policies to enrich himself and those around him.Nigeria is deeply ided between the mainly Muslim north and largely Christian south. There are more than 200 distinct ethnic groups. This has led to an unofficial power-sharing agreement, with the presidency alternating between north and south every eight years.It isn\u0027t just religion or ethnicity causing fractures. Half of Nigeria’s registered voters are aged 18-35. Many say their ageing leaders are out of touch, and supported a Not Too Young to Run campaign to encourage younger people seeking office.2015 was the only time Nigeria had a peaceful power handover since civilian government took over in 1999. Even then there was evidence of vote buying, voter intimidation, and other forms of corruption. International observers fear election interference and rigging this time around.Last month, Buhari triggered a constitutional row when he suspended the chief judge, who has a crucial say in resolving election result disputes.The candidate with the most votes is declared winner, as long as they have at least one-quarter of the vote in two-thirds of Nigeria\u0027s 36 states and the capital. Otherwise there is a run-off.An analysis of separate figures shows that manipulation may have happened in favour of Buhari’s party, which was running in opposition to Goodluck Jonathan’s People’s Democratic party. A clue may have been dropped last July when the INEC, perhaps inadvertently, publicly referenced a different set of results from the one on which Buhari’s victory was based.Both documents showed 29.4 million votes were cast. But according to the original results, 31.7 million accredited voters participated in the election, whereas in the second set of results, that figure dropped to 23.6 million.The discrepancy suggests an additional 6 million accredited voters, far more than the APC’s winning margin – as per the original result set – of 2.6 million votes.Smartcard readers were used for the first time in 2015 and the second set of results was released in response to widespread criticism after the new technology malfunctioned, forcing millions of voters, including Jonathan, to use the manual process. The second set of results appears to have disappeared from the INEC’s website two months ago, along with all others relating to the 2015 poll.Nigerian elections have a long history of rigging, and it is not usually limited to whichever side happens to be in power at the time. Powerful politicians move fluidly between the two main parties, taking support and manipulation mechanisms with them.If free and fair, the election is expected to be very close, with many Nigerians either proclaiming themselves to be “Atikulated” and fed up with the state of the economy or chanting “Sai Buhari”, a term of respect used by those vigorously defending the president’s record.In the ancient northern city of Kano, a Buhari stronghold, men in embroidered kaftan robes and colourful caps said they were voting for Buhari, while opposition billboards had been torn down in the streets. Innocent Okpanachi, an architect in Abuja, said: “The entire system is bad. You vote for who will unite the country.”• This article was amended on 15 February to reflect doubts over the way in which analysts who spoke to the  had interpreted new voter registration data for the 2019 election"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d957ffd00b4f01aaa31fd3bc046d18900d78b7ee/753_144_575_345/master/575.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5ba2b3de75c08ac10b6f7ce4ddf33ec","title":"last option not first rise tasering","story":"Why are so many people like Max – 25, but with the comprehension of a seven-year-old – being shot with stun guns by UK police?at around 2pm, Margaret, a manager for a marketing company, received a phone call about her son. She was travelling for work in Wiltshire. Max, then 25, had assaulted a police officer, she was told. “I thought, ‘Oh my God, what has happened now?’” she says.Margaret drove to the flat near Bristol where Max had been living for four months. It’s a self-contained part of The Maples, a residential building for adults with moderate to severe learning disabilities and mental health problems. Max has the reading age of a 12-year-old and the comprehension of a seven-year-old. He is autistic and has difficulty telling the time.The manager of The Maples told Margaret he had called the police because Max was drunk and had broken a window. When the police came, Max was in front of the building, in the driveway. This is where the alleged assault took place, after which he was taken into custody. But there was worse news to come: Max had been shot with a Taser by the police as he tried to run away. “I was shocked,” says Margaret. “It seemed off the scale.”Tasers were introduced to the UK in 2003, initially only for authorised firearm-trained officers, as a way to resolve a crisis without having to resort to a gun. But in 2008, after a 12-month Home Office field trial, Tasers were gradually rolled out to forces across the country. They are termed “less lethal weapons” and can only be used when “mitigating a threat of violence”, according to a House of Commons briefing document.“Clearly, as time has gone on, their use has grown beyond their original intention,” says Gary Wedge, who trains police officers in Taser use. “But unarmed officers face many dangers and providing them with a Taser helps to mitigate those risks.”Human rights campaigners and mental health charities feel Tasers are overused. “We’ve got serious concerns about Tasers becoming the norm for day-to-day policing,” says Oliver Feeley-Sprague, police and security programme director, Amnesty International UK. “We’re particularly concerned at the alarming rise in overuse against vulnerable and minority groups, including on people with mental health issues and BAME people.” He argues that police officers need specialist training: “We’d like to see police officers better trained to recognise the likely behaviours of a person with a mental illness in a highly stressful situation. Overall, we’d like to see police officers being more prepared to use a range of de-escalation techniques.”The Taser was invented by Jack Cover, an American aerospace engineer, in the late 1960s. It was partly inspired by Tom Swift And His Electric Rifle, a book he had read as a child, about a boy who invents a gun that fires bolts of electricity. Cover adapted the title to come up with the acronym Taser. But it was Rick Smith, a business graduate, and his brother Thomas, who took Taser worldwide, founding Taser International in Arizona in 1993 (recently renamed Axon).A Taser looks like a Glock pistol and works by firing two live wires charged with 50,000 volts, each topped with barbed darts. When the barbs hook on to a target they create a charged circuit, causing muscles to contract painfully. Subjects are unable to control their bodies and fall to the floor. For the police, the advantages of a Taser are that it can reach a person 21ft away it produces immediate incapacitation, no matter how big or strong the subject and its effects wear off in seconds, leaving little trace.But as Taser use has escalated, so have reports of deaths. In the UK there have been at least 18 fatalities linked to the use of a Taser since 2003. Marc Cole, 30, a father of two with a recent history of mental illness, died in hospital last May, after being Tasered by police in Falmouth, Cornwall. His death is currently under investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). An inquest is also due to be held, but no date is set.The IOPC made a rare judgment against the police in connection with the killing of Jordan Begley, 23, who died of cardiac arrest two hours after being shot by a Taser on 19 July 2013. Greater Manchester police were initially cleared of any wrongdoing, but the IOPC identified improper use in a second investigation last year. They found that Begley had been fired at for over eight seconds, which they described as “not reasonable” (a Taser delivers its electrical charge in automatic bursts of five-second cycles).In August 2016, police in Telford fired a Taser at Dalian Atkinson, 48, a former Premier League footballer, outside his father’s house in the early hours of the morning. A pre-inquest hearing heard how Atkinson became “unresponsive shortly after being shot with a stun gun”. He was taken to Princess Royal hospital, in Telford, where he died. Atkinson had been suffering from depression, his brother told a newspaper at the time, and “was in a manic state, out of his mind and ranting”. After a lengthy investigation, the IOPC has referred the case to the Crown Prosecution Service to consider whether two police constables should face criminal charges. A pre-inquest review is due to take place in Shrewsbury this year.I meet Margaret at her mother’s house on a quiet cul-de-sac in Bristol. Max isn’t here, but is happy for her to speak on his behalf, she tells me. A smartly dressed woman with short, stylish hair, she is meticulously organised. Her habit of keeping documents and letters has proved crucial, she says, because “people remember things differently”.She tells me about Max. He can be dogged in his thinking, she says, and often talks repetitively about specific subjects at length, especially when he is anxious. And yet Max, who was educated at mainstream schools, is adept at cloaking his differences and fitting in. All of this means “people pick up much less than they should”.Margaret brings out a portable DVD player to show me the CCTV footage of the Tasering incident. On the day Max was charged, she asked the manager of The Maples for a copy of its surveillance camera footage. Margaret methodically makes her way through the film, stopping and rewinding whenever she sees something that catches her eye.The three men stand near the doorway for a while. “This is Max talking to the police officers,” she says. Both are in full uniform and what one of the officers described in the statement as a “state of ‘ties off’ due to the hot weather”. Max is not wearing a top because of the heat.Max is talking nonstop, according to officer B’s statement, “just repeating the same things over and over again” – further evidence, he suggests, of Max’s inebriation. But repeating things, talking incessantly, standing too close (“the male repeatedly came in my personal space,” said officer B) are also symptoms of autism (and how Max behaves even when he isn’t drunk).The action happens within just a few moments. Margaret points to the screen. “Did you see that?” She rewinds. The video appears to show a very different sequence of events from that described in the officers’ statements. Max has both arms up, hands above his head in apparent surrender. “I can’t see him push anyone,” Margaret says. “He puts his hands down to be handcuffed and then he suddenly gets scared and decides to run away.” She slows down the footage. “It happens very quickly, but can you see the police officer pushes Max in the chest?” The video shows Max losing his balance and falling to the floor. As he struggles to get up, officer A fires the Taser. One barb landed in the back of Max’s neck, the other in his upper back.“It is a home for people with learning disabilities and mental health issues,” says Margaret. ‘You don’t go around Tasering vulnerable people as your first option. That should be your last option.”“If you are vulnerable in any way, you’re more likely to be Tasered because of the officer not understanding what’s going on,” says Sophie Khan, a solicitor advocate who specialises in Taser-related injuries. In other words, a police officer may see the combative behaviour – not obeying commands, or aggression – and not the underlying cause behind it: a learning disability, perhaps, or mental breakdown.The government-appointed body that oversees Taser use, the Scientific Advisory Committee on the Medical Implications of Less-Lethal Weapons (SACMILL) has acknowledged that certain people may be at risk of being Tasered simply because of who they are. In a statement published in 2012, the list is long. Mental health conditions, learning difficulties and neurodevelopmental or neurobehavioural conditions (for example, cerebral palsy and autistic spectrum disorders) may “negatively influence how affected iniduals interact with the police”. The point might be: “Don’t be different”.Police say this is misleading. “Yes, a Taser is more likely to be used on vulnerable people, but in the majority of incidents the device isn’t fired,” says Michael Brown, a mental health coordinator at the College of Policing and for the National Police Chiefs’ Council. A Taser is described as being “used”, even if the gun is drawn but not fired. Merely taking aim, says Brown, is a very effective deterrent. He argues that Tasers can save lives. “If somebody is posing a risk, the police have to police that, regardless of whether the risk comes from straightforward criminality or whether it’s from drugs and alcohol use, learning disability or mental illness. By the time the police are crisis-managing risk situations where people are self-harming, non-communicative and posing a risk to themselves or others, it might – just might – be the least worst option available.”On 3 February 2013, Talhat Rehman, now 58, a halal butcher from London, jumped the barricades outside Buckingham Palace, where crowds had gathered to watch the changing of the guard. He had two large kitchen knives, which he waved in an aggressive manner, according to police, and went on to hold one knife to his own throat.“The disturbance obviously caused a great deal of alarm to members of the public,” observed Peter Zinner, the prosecutor in the trial at Southwark crown court on 27 March 2013. “The police had no option but to deploy Tasers.” Rehman fell to the floor and officers retrieved the knives. He was taken into police custody and charged with affray and two counts of possession of a knife in a public place.18,000\u0026nbspThe number of police incidents involving a Taser between April 2017 and March 2018Rehman was sectioned. When he was considered well enough to be tried, he pleaded guilty to the two counts of having a knife in a public place (the charge of affray was dropped after Rehman’s barrister said there was no evidence that he wanted to hurt others, only himself). His son, Kassum Raja, one of Rehman’s five children, explained in court that his father had lost £170,000 in a financial scam. The episode, in his view, was the culmination of months of worry and anguish. On 17 May, Rehman was sentenced to a 12-month community order, including mental health treatment and a supervision order.Rehman lives with his wife, his son’s family and his parents. When I visit Abdul, his father, 86, a trustee of Brent mosque, he explains that Talhat is in Pakistan seeing family. We talk about the Tasering and he confirms that his son had been “disturbed mentally” by money worries at the time he had gone to Buckingham Palace to get help from the Queen. “He loves the Queen. We all love the Queen. He must have thought she’d help him out.”The first he knew of the incident was when he saw it on the news: “We were very hurt and surprised.” But Abdul is not entirely critical of the police. “They are professional people, obviously they know what they are doing. But we thought it was wrong when they Tasered him. The knife, you know, was just there” – he points to his throat – “he could have fallen on the knife and hurt himself.”However, Abdul says the experience further unsettled his son and that it wasn’t an appropriate use of force for someone with mental health problems. “He was very affected by it – it upset him a lot.”In November 2013 Talhat Rehman contacted Sophie Kahn. “The entire episode had traumatised him,” Khan says. “He said he used to have flashbacks about being Tasered, and being dragged to the floor and handcuffed. They were quite rough with him at the scene.”In her view, Rehman should never have been Tasered. “Had he been thrusting the knives at the police officers I would have understood – they’ve got to protect themselves, but both knives were pointed to his body.” Even if Tasering Rehman was justified, Khan says, the situation should never have got to that point. She discovered that police had known about his unstable mental health for at least two years before the incident. They had visited his home to discuss letters he had sent to the BBC, the Queen and the politan Police commissioner, threatening suicide outside Buckingham Palace. Five months prior to being Tasered, he was arrested outside the Palace of Westminster. He was stopped, searched and found to have a knife. Police had been tipped off – by Rehman himself. “He contacted Brent Mental Health Service and the police to notify them of his plan,” Khan says. Rehman was sectioned and taken to a secure hospital.In Khan’s view, the case demonstrates how the police could have averted the situation. “The police knew he wasn’t well. Why didn’t they do something? They could have referred him to a team who could have come up with a care plan – then he would have been in regular contact with mental health services.”Almost a year after he was Tasered, Rehman wrote a letter of complaint to the police. He argued that the restraint was “unlawful” and that “police had failed to safeguard his welfare prior to the incident”. He received a response on 26 February 2015. They said that in their opinion there was “insufficient evidence” that the restraint against him “was unlawful”.Spencer Beynon was born in Llanelli, south Wales in 1972. His father, Chris, 75, was a double-glazing salesman, and his mother, Margaret, 73, a housewife. He grew up a very happy, rugby-playing boy who had plenty of friends and was close to his family. He met his wife at 23, after a seven-year stint in the army. Ellen, now 40, was a hairdresser in Llanelli. “He and his friends used to come in and go on the sunbeds,” she remembers, “He was a charmer.” They had two children, Victoria, now 19, and Jacob, now 15, but separated after four years of marriage. “We just drifted apart, but we were friends always.”In 2005, Beynon decided to go back into the army, and wanted to prove he could still make it at 33 by joining the elite Parachute Regiment (the Paras). “He said, ‘If I’m not fit enough for the Paras – the fittest of them all – I’m not fit to go back into the army,’” his father says. “He worked himself very hard.”After successfully completing the training, Beynon transferred back to his old regiment – the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Welsh. He was deployed to Iraq and then Afghanistan, where several deeply traumatising events changed the course of his life.Three months after arriving in Iraq, Beynon witnessed the death of his childhood friend, Ryan, when his vehicle was hit during a night operation. Beynon, who was in the vehicle behind, retrieved his friend’s body from the wreckage. “It was a policy with the boys, an unwritten law, get them out,” his father explains. “What they see out there, we haven’t got a clue.”There were other pivotal events: the death of a baby during a search-and-recovery operation in Basra the fatal injury of another army colleague in Helmand, Afghanistan. “Spencer and the nurse stayed with him for an hour and a half waiting for the helicopter to come. It was absolutely horrific. And people ask, ‘Why did he have post-traumatic stress disorder?’” his father says.In December 2011, Beynon found out that Ryan’s mother, Alison, had died from cancer before Beynon had a chance to speak to her. Deeply affected by her death, he left the army and moved back home with his parents in Llanelli. “Alison’s death did something to his head,” his mother says. “I’d hear him in the night screaming.” He’d take a bottle of Jack Daniel’s and sit by Ryan’s grave. “He was totally obsessed with Ryan’s death,” his mother says. “He’d lie in his bedroom for days and wouldn’t wash – and my son was immaculate,” she says. He tried to escape into cannabis and alcohol. When his mother complained, “he’d say, ‘Leave me alone. It’s the only thing that takes the memories away.’”On 14 June 2016, at around 7pm, neighbours contacted police to say Beynon was acting strangely. He was by now living in a cul-de-sac near the seafront, about a 15-minute drive from his parents’ house. His great love was Ganesh, a Boston terrier. “The dog kept him alive,” says his father. “If it hadn’t been for the dog, he would have taken his own life years ago.”According to witnesses, two officers from Dyfed-Powys police arrived at the scene at around 7.30pm. They found Beynon slumped on the pavement with a self-inflicted cut to his throat. He was bleeding heavily. He’d also turned on his dog, inflicting such severe injuries that he had to be put down. Within minutes of the officers arriving, Beynon was Tasered. He died soon afterwards. He was 43.Three years later, Beynon’s family are yet to receive answers about why police used a Taser, and whether that contributed to his death. Since August 2017, there have been five pre-inquest hearings. In one, last June, Sophie Khan, who represents the family, told the court that the officer who fired the Taser described Beynon as getting up and “charging” at the officers, but none of the other witnesses described him getting up, including the other officer.At the fourth hearing, last October, it was revealed that Beynon’s father, Chris, had called the police that morning asking to have his son sectioned under the Mental Health Act for his own safety this call was not acted on. “When the police attended the scene and saw Spencer Beynon bleeding they had an obligation to provide him with first aid, to protect his life,” Khan told the pre-inquest. “That did not happen.”The barrister representing Dyfed-Powys police said Beynon had died from the wound to his neck that the Taser “played no part” in his death, adding: “Three experts are of the unanimous view that a Taser was not the cause of death.” This included Anthony Bleetman, a freelance consultant who advises on emergency medicine for SACMILL, and one of three expert witnesses appointed by the coroner to comment on Taser use in this case. In his view, Beynon had an “in-survivable neck wound” and was beyond saving.But Khan raised another concern at the hearing: conflict of interest. Not only had Bleetman been instructed by the IOPC as part of its investigation into Beynon’s death (“the coroner should appoint its own experts,” she said) Bleetman has an ongoing professional relationship with the police, providing advice and training in the use of force for two decades. “He can’t be classified as an independent expert,” she stated. Bleetman also has a prior relationship with Taser International. He was paid by them to write a literature review of Taser-related injuries in 2001.“We are talking about a very modest sum, going back 20 years, which was always declared,” he says when we speak. Is there a conflict of interest? “That is a matter for discussion, but my approach to these things is straightforward: every time I am asked to comment on a Taser case, the first thing I do is alert the chair of SACMILL. His response has always been ‘Just declare everything’. It’s up to the courts to determine whether they consider my evidence to be truly independent or not.”Bleetman defends the use of the Taser on Beynon. “We are talking about an inidual who cut his own throat. Who did what he did to the dog. And in the cool light of day after the event, we say, ‘Well, why didn’t you talk to him? Why didn’t you guide him away?’”A date has yet to be set for the inquest, but it’s unlikely to be this year. “For the family who have lost someone in tragic, complicated and distressing circumstances, the lack of clarity around what happened and why is only adding to their distress,” Khan says. “We just want to get justice for Spencer,” says Ellen. “We want to get answers so we can move on.”On 30 November 2015, Max, his family and legal team went to Bristol magistrates court for a hearing. Before the hearing, Max’s solicitor met the prosecution barrister and showed him the CCTV footage of the Tasering. The case was dropped.“If Margaret hadn’t had the CCTV, Max could have gone to prison for something he hadn’t done,” says Lorne Wilkinson, a former police officer and the litigator on Max’s case. The sentence for assaulting a police officer is up to six months in prison or a £5,000 fine. “It would have been sending someone with the understanding of a seven-year-old into a man’s prison.”On 4 December 2015, Margaret submitted a complaint to the IOPC. She received a response on 6 October 2017. The IOPC found “inaccuracies” in the officers’ accounts, but did not find evidence of any misconduct. In a statement, Avon and Somerset police said: “The IOPC found there was no case to answer for misconduct for any of the officers involved. The report stated both the arrest and use of Taser were reasonable in the circumstances”. “I was stunned,” Margaret says. “I feel really let down.”Today, she campaigns for autisminjustice.org, an organisation that challenges the criminalisation of autistic people. She says she replays in her mind over and over the images of Max being Tasered. “This could have put Max in prison. That is how close we came.”• Max’s name has been changed.

He said more details would be released on Saturday afternoon.President Muhammadu Buhari faces a tight election contest in Nigeria, Africa’s largest economy, top oil producer and most populous nation, against the main opposition candidate, businessman and former vice president Atiku Abubakar.The election has been seen as a referendum on Buhari’s first term, which has been marred by his prolonged absence due to illness, a weak economy, and the government’s failure to effectively tackle corruption and insecurity.But the 84 million people registered to vote across Nigeria are waking up to learn that they will not be able to take part in the poll for another week.Nigerians have to return to their home states to cast their votes, and many of those who have travelled across the large west African country in order to do so will not be able to repeat the journey next weekend.On Friday, planes leaving Abuja airport were full of people going home in order to take part in the election. On election day, travel is restricted, and most people walk to polling stations to cast their votes.Elections for the state governors, due to be held on 2 March, were also delayed by a week. The cost of the election, already expected to be 242 billion naira ($670m) will increase now.The country’s presidential elections in 2011 and 2015 were also delayed over logistics and security issues.The decision to delay this year’s vote was criticised by the chairman of the main opposition People’s Democratic Party, Uche Secondus, said the move was an action that was “dangerous to our democracy and unacceptable”, adding that it was part of an attempt by Buhari to “cling on to power even when it’s obvious to him that Nigerians want him out”.The president’s ruling All Progressives Congress party criticised the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the delay.Buhari “cooperated fully with INEC by ensuring everything it demanded to conduct free and fair elections were promptly made available,” it said in a statement. “This news is therefore a huge disappointment to us.”An electoral commission official said that “some result sheets and some ballot papers are reportedly missing. We want to track every (piece of) sensitive material, take inventory of what we have and what is missing”.A government official said: “The legitimacy of the entire process will be questioned and the winner could lack the moral authority to superintend the affairs of the state.”In the lead up to the election Nigeria has been dealing with pockets of instability. Authorities bolstered security in much of the country on the eve of the vote, after past elections were marred by violence, voter intimidation and ballot rigging.A faction of Boko Haram attacked a state governor’s convoy on Tuesday, killing four people and stealing vehicles. Elsewhere, 15 people were crushed to death at a ruling party rally in eastern Port Harcourt. On Thursday, 14 sacks of ballot papers were intercepted in Kano state – though police said they were merely “specimen” papers to educate voters.As Nigerians prepared to cast their votes, data analysts raised concerns about the number of new voters registered since January 2018, which they said increased by almost exactly the same percentage in each of the country’s states, and suggested that the election results could be open to mass rigging.Plotted on a scatter line graph, there was a 0.99 correlation across all the states, without a single outlier. According to three separate data analysts, the parity cannot be a coincidence, and two of them called it a “statistical impossibility”.“Only God works that closely,” one said.But other observers said there were other possible explanations for the correlation, including demographics.“In itself, it’s not an indicator of any kind of electoral malpractice or manipulation,” said economist Nonso Obikili. If some of the new voters registered are fake, it could imply meddling at the electoral commission, though it is unclear whether it would be the ruling party or the opposition that would stand to benefit.Additional data seen by the  shows irregularities in registration for the 2015 election in which Buhari came to power, until now considered to have been free and fair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d472f205f2af7dd074b948c74e37ba8e1598aac/203_26_1333_800/master/1333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1650f01a6e8b6f5c758c354f484588e4","title":"documentary lorena bobbitt weirdness 90s","story":"Nineties women who dared to speak out, from Anita Hill to Courtney Love, were derided with a glee that was downright VictorianI was born at the end of the 1970s, which means I am somewhat in a no man’s land, generationally – at the fag end of Gen X, too old to be a millennial. “Xennial” someone suggested recently, and what that term lacks in clarity it also lacks in pronouncability.

But these days it does feel that the 90s was an exceptionally weird time, especially for girls.It was the decade of post-feminism. Feminism’s second wave had crashed out in the 1980s and, while feminists still existed, it became accepted mainstream thinking that the campaign for equality was now sorted and – Oh horror! – uncool. Modern women wore shoulder pads! Who needed those miserable hairy-armpitted harridans any more?While the 90s began with Thelma And Louise, Pretty Woman became the defining female film of the decade, opening with the ultimate “meet cute” of a man picking up a woman on Hollywood Boulevard and paying her for a blow job. (Aww, one to show the grandkids!) The rom in Pretty Woman was all about a man paying for a woman’s body, and the com was predicated on how fun it is to spend a rich man’s money and the mood was pretty much established from there. Instead of the gender equality of His Girl Friday and When Harry Met Sally, we got the creepy fairytale hysteria of Never Been Kissed, My Best Friend’s Wedding and You’ve Got Mail, in which women humiliated themselves in order to gain that all-important prize: a man. As a teenager, my favourite movies were Clueless, She’s All That and 10 Things I Hate About You, all of which were about how to change yourself to make a boy like you. Say what you like about teen culture today, but at least not every movie is telling girls they need a makeover (instead we leave it to social media to do that).Retrospectively damning pop culture has become something of an old shtick now. But I increasingly feel that the most formative narratives of the 90s came not from fiction but fact. Nineties women who dared to speak out, from Anita Hill to Janet Reno to Courtney Love, were derided with a glee that was downright Victorian. So it’s been fascinating for my generation to look back at the stories we grew up watching on the news and – instead of damning them – belatedly reclaiming them.Get Out director Jordan Peele is almost exactly the same age as me, so it makes a pleasing kind of sense that he is also the producer of Lorena, the new Amazon Prime documentary about Lorena Bobbitt. In 1993, Bobbitt notoriously cut off her husband’s penis with a knife as he slept, and of all the 90s women who were held up as warnings about what happens to women who unleash their rage (Tonya Harding) or sexuality (Monica Lewinsky), none was as mocked and dismissed as Bobbitt. Haha, just look at her surname: classic nominative determinism! As the woman now known as Lorena Gallo said in a recent New York Times interview, “It’s like they didn’t care why I did what I did.”Few things make the 90s feel further away than the contemporary media coverage of Gallo, an immigrant who stated in court that she had been subject to years of domestic abuse. (Bobbitt himself has since been convicted, twice, of battery against women.) But the male columnists of the time wagged their fingers and told women that supporting Bobbitt was not how to Do Feminism Right. Gay Talese, reporting on the case for the New Yorker, asked if marital rape was actually a thing. The New York Times quoted Mel Feit, a self-described men’s rights advocate, who argued that, “This is the result of feminists teaching women that men are natural oppressors.”It’s tempting to think that the lesson of Gallo’s story is that the 90s were a foreign country. I think the lesson is that you don’t notice the water is boiling while you’re still in the pot. Bobbitt’s history of domestic abuse would probably be taken more seriously today, but it is not difficult to imagine today’s teenagers going on to make documentaries about how weird it was in 2019, when people still fretted openly over a female politician’s “likability” (see Elizabeth Warren and Hillary Clinton) when people spewed vicious garbage about Meghan Markle and Serena Williams when men still felt entitled to tell women how to Do Feminism Right.Where women were once harangued about getting a man, today they are merely expected to be perfect: strong but not too opinionated high-achieving but perfectly groomed successful but not intimidating feminist but accommodating to the male point of view. Instead, I recommend a different goal: be the person you want to be in the documentary your kids will make in 20 years’ time.

But trees couldn’t survive winter without the special relationship they have with birdsAside from the music of the westerlies playing through those skeletal canopies, British woods, when stripped of their leaves, tend to have an atmosphere of expectant quietude. Winter is a time of frugality, and the two major tree types, deciduous and evergreen, adopt very different strategies to cope with the double challenge of little sunlight and low temperatures.A deciduous tree operates by shedding all its leaves. This means that it lacks the means to photosynthesise and, thus, to generate fresh energy for five to six months of the year. However, there’s an upside to losing foliage, because it has ended the loss of moisture that occurs through leaves.This endless recycling of water from the trees to the atmosphere, known as transpiration, is costly. A single large mature oak may possess up to 200,000 leaves, and lose as much as 150,000 litres of water over the course of a year. A summer wood in full foliage conceals thousands of rising columns of tree-borne moisture, which is why it often feels so warm and humid within woods, when the surrounding countryside can be cool and breezy.Conifer trees reduce the stress of water loss by possessing fine needle-like leaves with minimum surface area and thick, waxy water-retaining cuticles. The adaptations slow down the process of transpiration. While the structure of evergreen foliage doesn’t have the energy-producing efficiency of a flat plate-like deciduous leaf, the fact that conifers can continue to photosynthesise year-round compensates for this. Some pines even have antifreeze in their needles, to enable them to work in icy conditions.The dormancy of winter trees means that this is the best time for planting or transferring them around our gardens. Choose a warm winter’s day so the earth is soft, dig a hole deep enough so the soil fully protects the roots from frost, then water well once planted. Observing how that new tree slowly grows and flourishes is one of the most satisfying processes in gardening.Trees also make use of the winter to do some self-propagation of their own. Much of the work for this process begins in the autumn, with the production of seeds and fruit. British oaks are a perfect example. From September onwards they leave a great larder of sugar- and protein-rich food for hungry birds or mammals, in the form of acorns. Squirrels, rodents and several species of crow store these nuts away to consume during the colder months. Yet, no species has more of a capacity to plan ahead than the creature that William Henry Hudson called the “British bird of paradise”: the European jay.In late autumn, this glorious pink-and-blue bird can be seen making repeat journeys to and from acorn-producing oak trees. The jay then buries them, sometimes flying several miles from the original source tree. Over the course of autumn, the average bird hides about 5,000 acorns. Across Britain and Ireland, the entire jay population stores somewhere in the region of 1.7bn acorns.The birds possess extraordinary memories for where they have hidden their stores, and yet – here is the clever part – they can’t remember them all. Not only do those forgotten acorns stand a strong chance of growing into oak saplings the following spring, but jays show a preference for open ground between tree cover in their choice of burial sites. In other words, they plant their acorns precisely where they might grow best.This acorn storage system thus benefits the jay twice over. Not only does it provide itself with food for the winter, but by forgetting some of its larder it also creates fresh habitat for future generations of jays. These birds are truly s of our oak woods. But it works both ways: by taking care of the birds, the trees ensure they prosper themselves.The dispersal of seed is, in fact, a major part of the woodland scene in winter. Hawthorn, holly, yew, mountain ash, crab apple, blackthorn and sea buckthorn – not to forget woodland shrubs, such as mistletoe and ivy, or garden favourites including cotoneaster and pyracantha – all produce fruit that birds love.Thrushes are especially drawn to these trees and consume vast quantities of their fruits. In return for this generosity, the thrushes then fly to their roosts in some hedge or tall tree at dusk and do what comes naturally. They poop out seeds during the night and leave each one in its own little store of fertiliser.So woods and birds are truly partners in reproduction. You can see how they interact on any winter’s day and in any wood, from John O’Groats to Land’s End, and from the mountain tops to the seashore. Because we legally “own” it, people like to imagine that they control the land, but the British woodlands have ways of shaping their own destinies.Yorkshire Tea and treesYorkshire Tea is planting a million trees over five years – with a bit of help from the Woodland Trust, UK schoolchildren and Kenyan tea farmers.

There’s an unseen network to forests in which trees send signals to each other and form part of a ‘wood wide web’Despite appearances, trees are social beings. For a start, they talk to each other. They’re also sensing, co-operating and collaborating, even across species boundaries. Peter Wohlleben, the German forester-turned-tree-whisperer and author of The Hidden Life of Trees, also says they are suckling their young, that juveniles are learning, and that some elders are sacrificing themselves for the sake of the next generation.While Wohlleben’s view is a step too far towards anthropomorphism for some scientists, the traditional view of trees as isolated, non-sensory beings has been shifting for some time. For example, the phenomenon known as “crown shyness”, in which similarly-sized trees of the same species appear to be respecting each other’s space was recognised almost a century ago. Sometimes, instead of interlacing and jostling for light, the branches of immediate neighbours stop short of one another, leaving a polite gap. There’s still no consensus on how this is managed – abrasion of growing branch tips is one possibility, another is that growth is inhibited when leaves sense infrared light scattered by other leaves close by.Much of the current research on this so called “wood wide web” stems from the work of the Canadian biologist Suzanne Simard. Simard describes the largest inidual trees in a forest as hubs or “mother trees”. Mothers have the deepest, most extensive roots, and are able to supplement smaller trees with water and nutrients, allowing saplings to thrive even in heavy shade. Further experiments suggest that iniduals are able to recognise close relatives and favour them when it comes to transferring the good stuff. Thus healthy iniduals can support damaged neighbours, even leafless stumps, keeping them alive for years, decades, even centuries. This connectivity and collaboration makes much more sense when you realise that the dependent trees may not be random strangers, but old friends, or more persuasive still, close relatives.The discernment shown by trees extends to their enemies as well as allies. Scientists have known for more than 40 years that if a tree is attacked by a leaf-eating animal, it releases ethylene gas. On detecting the ethylene, nearby trees prepare to repel boarders – boosting production of chemicals that make their leaves unpalatable, even toxic. The strategy was first discovered in a study of acacias, and it seems giraffes understood it long before humans: having finished browsing one tree, they habitually move more than 50 metres in an upwind direction before starting on another that is less likely to have sensed the emergency.More recently, however, it’s become clear that not all enemies trigger the same response. When elm and pine trees (and probably others) are first attacked by caterpillars, they respond within seconds to distinctive chemicals in caterpillar saliva, releasing an additional scent that attracts specific varieties of parasitic wasp. The wasps lay eggs in or on the bodies of the caterpillars, and then the emerging wasp grubs devour their host from the inside. If the damage to leaves and branches is caused by something for which the tree has no means of counterattack – such as the wind or cutting with an axe – the chemical response is focused on healing rather than defence.A sobering aspect of recent revelations is that many of these newly recognised “behaviours” are limited to natural growth. In plantations, there are no mother trees, and there is very little connectivity. This is partly because of the way young trees are transplanted and partly because when they are thinned to prevent competition, what little underground connectivity neighbours have established is severed. Seen in this light, modern forestry practices begin to seem almost monstrous: plantations are not communities but crowds of mute, factory-farmed iniduals, felled before they have ever really lived. None of the scientists involved are seriously suggesting trees have feelings, or that the newly discovered sociability of trees is driven by anything other than natural selection. The transactions being observed may be utilitarian rather than altruistic, they might be accidental. Nevertheless, the result is that in supporting each other, trees build sheltered, humid microcosms in which they and their future offspring will stand the best chance of surviving and reproducing. We know these places as forests. The trees, if they “know” anything, know them as home."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3795611.1550259475!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may to travel to brussels again next week for talks with junker","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDowning Street said Theresa May remained committed to securing changes to the text of the legally-binding withdrawal agreement. Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesBritish prime minister Theresa May will travel to Brussels next week for talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker following MPs’ rejection of her approach to Brexit on Thursday.Downing Street said on Friday that the prime minister remained committed to securing changes to the text of the legally-binding withdrawal agreement that includes the Northern Ireland backstop.Sixty-six Conservative MPs, including 57 Brexiteers in the European Research Group (ERG) led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, abstained in Thursday’s vote and five voted against the government. The vote exposed deep isions within the party and Brexiteers and Remainers traded recriminations afterwards.Remainers described the ERG as “a party within a party” that was bent on leaving the European Union without a deal on March 29th. Foreign office minister Alistair Burt hinted on Friday that he would resign from the government if necessary to vote later this month to rule out a no-deal Brexit.“If my colleagues cannot accept a necessary compromise, or if government does not itself move to prevent no deal, then I expect parliament to do so, as such moves would certainly pass a Commons vote,” he said.“I will continue to act consistently with the views I have regularly set out.”Prepared to resignFormer attorney general Dominic Grieve suggested that a dozen ministers, including six members of the cabinet, were prepared to resign if whips would not allow them to vote for a motion that would oblige the prime minister to postpone Brexit rather than leave without a deal.Britain’s Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay is also due to travel to Brussels next week to meet the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier. But senior EU sources said there was no appetite in the European institutions or among member states to offer any concession on the backstop before MPs vote again on Brexit at the end of this month.Mr Barnier will meet Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn next week to discuss Labour’s proposal for a permanent customs union and close alignment with the single market. Pro-EU Conservatives hope that Thursday’s defeat will persuade Mrs May to abandon the ERG and seek a consensus with Labour in favour of a softer Brexit.Senior Labour figures including shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer met government ministers this week and will hold further meetings next week. But Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said the government remained committed to its current approach to Brexit and would not rule out leaving the EU without a deal.“The government does not want no-deal, but it is there because that is the legal default position, and any competent government must prepare for all eventualities,” she told the BBC.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.Aerogels are a material made up of air that is stuck within a network made of a solid medium, such as ceramic, metal or carbon.Ceramic aerogels can be incredibly lightweight, but still able to endure demanding environments. However, they are usually very brittle and easily degrade, making them hard to use as insulation and limiting their adoption.However, the new ceramic aerogel has been created using atomically thin sheets of a substance known as\u0026nbsphexagonal boron nitride. That was carefully engineered into a new material that does not expand outwards when it is compressed or heated up, unlike other similar materials.It then succeeded in a whole host of tests, including experiments that heated and cooled it rapidly. The aerogel hardly changed at all, the authors right, and did not lose any strength.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And they could be as big a change as when the wires dropped out of Apple\u0027s existing headphones and they were first born.Introduced in 2016, the two truly wireless earphones haven\u0027t been updated since. They came with a wide range of futuristic features – but a range of rumours have swirled around them about new updates, that would bring new and even more futuristic features.The AirPods are actually two (or three) different things: the case that protects them and the earphones that sit inside. Until recently, they\u0027d be considered one and the same – but recent leaks have suggested that Apple might update the two separately, with different release dates.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialAccording to recent rumours, the new case is likely to arrive earlier, and maybe soon. It could even be a part of Apple\u0027s March event. The actual release date is probably dependent on when Apple releases the AirPower mat that it\u0027s charging could rely on.The earphones themselves are likely to undergo a more dramatic reinvention. But that could also take longer to arrive. Those could not be updated for some months, according to recent rumours – and perhaps won\u0027t even arrive until September, when the new phones are introduced.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

And most of the rumours focus around how exactly it would do that.New AirPods charging case could come before updated earphonesMost likely, the biggest change in any new case would be the addition of wireless charging. That would allow them to charge up just like a phone, being able to be plonked down a wireless charging puck and then transfer that into its battery as well as the AirPods themselves.Apple has actually teased a new case before, when it announced the AirPower wireless charging mat. It said that a new case would be needed to allow the AirPods to be charged through that new product – but then the new product never actually arrived.The company did say then that the case would be updated but that the existing AirPods would be compatible with the new one. And people would be able to pay a reduced price just to buy the case and update, it made clear – an offer that will presumably stay around with the new earphones.Another rumoured change includes the addition of a new and grippier kind of plastic, which should make the box easier to hold. And if as suggested Apple does introduce new colours of AirPods, such as black, presumably the case will also change colour too.But it\u0027s the earphones that have most of the technology. Rumours have suggested that a whole host of new (and sometimes strange)\u0026nbspfeatures could be coming to the new earbuds.The most likely feature – in part because it\u0027s been apparently revealed by Apple\u0027s own software – is always-on Hey Siri. That will mean that people don\u0027t have to do the uncomfortable move of tapping their own ears to wake the earphones up, and instead just say Hey Siri any time they\u0027re wearing their AirPods to speak with the voice assistant.Other rumoured updates including new health tracking tools. Apple has been keen to get into those features with technology like the Apple Watch, and the inside of people\u0027s ears is a great place to take readings for things like heartbeat and temperature, which could happen with future AirPods.Apple is also likely to improve the performance in less obvious ways. The new buds will probably feature better wireless connectivity, and improved waterproofing.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In Inglourious Basterds, Waltz plays terrifying Nazi colonel Hans Landa, while in Django Unchained, he seems a world apart playing benevolent dentist-cum-bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz. Both roles were rewarded with Oscars for Best Supporting Actor.Spacey won two Oscars, for The Usual Suspects in 1996 and American Beauty in 2000. After numerous allegations of sexual assault emerged in 2017, the actor was removed from the Ridley Scott film All the Money in the World, and Christopher Plummer was given a Best Supporting Actor nomination after reshooting Spacey’s scenes in his stead.Swank won two awards for Best Actress, for Boys Don’t Cry and Million Dollar Baby. Accepting the award for the former, Swank neglected to thank her then-husband, Chad Lowe. Girls star Lena Dunham would later thank Lowe when she received a Golden Globe in 2013, tweeting that she did it “because Hilary Swank forgot.”Leigh’s performances as Scarlett O’Hara in Gone with the Wind in 1939 and as Blanche DuBois in the Tennessee Willimas adaptation A Streetcar Named Desire in 1951 stand as two of the most iconic in film history. The actress was fittingly rewarded for the roles, taking home a Best Actress trophy each time.Wiest appeared in five films by writer-director Woody Allen, winning Best Supporting Actress awards for her roles in Hannah and Her Sisters and Bullets Over Broadway. She is currently a regular on the CBS sit-com Life in Pieces.Ustinov was a highly acclaimed performer – with two Academy Awards to his name, for Spartacus and Topkapi – but was in no way limited to acting. Ustinov held a panoply of other occupations, including as a writer, a dramatist, a filmmaker, a director of theatre and opera, a humorist, a newspaper columnist, a radio broadcaster and a TV presenter. The son of a stage and silent film actor who was a victim of Hollywood’s transition to sound, Jason Robards was blessed with more success in the industry, eventually winning two Academy Awards. The actor appeared in numerous stage and screen adaptations of Eugene O’Neill plays, but it was his work in All the President’s Men that bagged him his first Best Supporting Actor statuette, doubling his tally the next year, in 1977, with Julia.Douglas won two Oscars, for Hud (1963) and for acting alongside a revelatory Peter Sellers in Being There (1969). The actor was known for being an outspoken anti-fascist ever since visiting Europe in 1931 with his wife, Helen Gahagan, who served three terms as a US Congresswoman, running against Richard Nixon for Governor in 1950.Over the course of her 63-year career, Winters appeared in successful blockbusters such as The Poseidon Adventure. But it was her more nuanced supporting roles in 1960’s The Diary of Anne Frank and 1965’s A Patch of Blue that would win over Academy voters, for which she collected two awards in the category.Quinn is something of an anomaly in the ranks of multiple Oscar-winners. The actor was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, in 1915, to a Mexican mother and an Irish father, and is one of one only five actors with a Latin-American background to win an acting Oscar – the others being Rita Moreno, José Ferrer, Mercedes Ruehl, and Benicio del Toro – and the only one to win twice. Roma nominees Yalitza Aparicio and Marina de Tavira are in contention this year.Jackson was one of the most accomplished actors of her generation, with two Best Actress wins under her belt by the age of 37 (for Women in Love and A Touch of Class). But starting in 1992, she took a 23-year sabbatical from the industry, serving as the Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn.Long before she was captivating younger audiences with her roles in the Harry Potter franchise and popular TV series Downton Abbey, Dame Maggie Smith had wowed Oscar voters with The Prime of Miss Jean Brody (1969), adding a Best Supporting Actress win for California Suite in 1978.Davis won her only two Best Actress Oscars in 1935 and 1938 – for Dangerous and Jezebel respectively –but over the course of her hugely successful six-decade career, she would continue to accrue more nominations, eventually becoming the first actor to reach a milestone of 10.Along with Helen Hayes, March is one of only two actors to win two Oscars and two Tony Awards. The multi-talented star won Best Actor for the bifurcated titular role in 1931’s horror adaptation Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, winning again in 1946 for The Best Years of Our Lives, a post-WWII drama about soldiers returning home from the war.Field’s Oscar win for Places in the Heart in 1985 has been immortalised by her acceptance speech – which included the infamous lines “you like me, right now, you really like me” - but the actor had already proven she was more than just a soundbite having won the same trophy for her star turn in Norma Rae five years earlier.Taylor gained 30 pounds for the 1966 black comedy Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, a film which sees her trapped in a poisonous marriage with a character played by her off-and-on real-life paramour Richard Burton. The star had previously nabbed a Best Actress award for her portrayal of a sex worker in BUtterfield 8, a film she claimed to dislike.After scooping up the Best Actor prize in 2003 for Mystic River, Penn won another for portraying iconic LGBT campaigner and US politician Harvey Milk, who was assassinated in 1978. Penn opened his victory speech with “Thank you. Thank you. You commie, homo-loving sons-of-guns!”Fargo Oscar-winner McDormand delivered a rousing address at the 2018 Oscar ceremony, demanding an end to Hollywood’s gender imbalance. The speech, made while accepting her second Best Actress prize - for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri - brought all the women in the audience to their feet in solidarity. She ended her speech with the phrase “inclusion rider,” a stipulation that can be put into a performer’s contract to ensure equal opportunity hiring on set.Hackman won his first Oscar playing “Popeye” Doyle in William Friedkin’s The French Connection – a taboo-busting cop thriller that was hardly the stuff of Academy tradition. 19 years later, his supporting turn as the villain in Clint Eastwood’s revisionist Western Unforgiven made it a double.Hanks made his name in romantic comedies with some successes in the 1980s, but his first Oscar win – for AIDS drama Philadelphia - was a big departure. The next year, in 1995, he won again, for the hugely popular Forrest Gump.Dame Olivia de Havilland, now 102 years old, is perhaps best known for her role in Gone with the Wind. Garnering five nominations across her career, de Havilland took home two statuettes in the 1940s, for To Each His Own and The Heiress.Next to Luise Rainer, Jodie Foster is the only other actor to have won two Oscars before the age of 30, for The Accused in 1988, and Silence of the Lambs in 1991. It’s a fitting record for an actor whose career took off while she was still a child, with breakout roles in Bugsy Malone and Taxi Driver.Sir Michael Caine, familiar around the globe for his distinctive cockney accent, once confessed that 1983’s Educating Rita was “the last good picture I made before I mentally retired.” In spite of this, the actor managed to win Oscars for Hannah and Her Sisters in 1986 and The Cider House Rules in 1999.Cooper won his first Best Actor Oscar in 1942 for Sergeant York. The famously stoic star didn’t turn up to collect his second award – for an understated turn in the classic Western High Noon – instead sending John Wayne, who said: Coop and I have been friends, hunting and fishing, for more years than I like to remember. He\u0027s one of the nicest fellows I know. I don\u0027t know anybody any nicer.”In 1982, Jessica Lange became the first star in nearly four decades to be nominated for two films in the same year, for Tootsie and Frances, the former of which yielded a win. Lange is currently tied as the sixth most nominated Actress in history.Initially winning at the same time as co-star Meryl Streep for Kramer Vs Kramer, Hoffman’s second Best Actor Oscar came for Rain Man in 1988, in a role which has been recognised as important in raising awareness of autism.The poster girl for the flower child generation, Jane Fonda was always expected to politicise the Oscars. After an unexpectedly reserved acceptance speech for Klute in 1972, she presented part of her 1979 speech – for Coming Home – in sign language.Following a supporting turn in 1974’s The Godfather Part II, Robert De Niro’s second Oscar-winning role, playing boxer Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull, is about as hard-earned as they come. The actor honed his boxing ability to professional standards, and gained approximately 60 pounds to play an older, washed-up version of the character.The Aviator is often dismissed as a minor Martin Scorsese film, but the Howard Hawks biopic won Blanchett her first Oscar in 2004. She would have to wait until Blue Jasmine seven years later - her sixth nominated performance, out of seven total - to win in the Best Actress category.Lemmon was legendary for his mastery of both comedy and pathos, and it was chiefly his humorous chops that saw him win Best Supporting Actor in 1955, for his role in Mister Roberts. With a follow-up win for Save the Tiger, the Some Like it Hot star became the first actor to claim Oscar wins in both the lead and supporting categories.Eight-time Oscar nominee Brando influenced a generation of actors with his revolutionary approaches to method, winning Hollywood’s biggest prize twice in the process - for On the Waterfront (1954) and The Godfather (1974). Brando famously sent Native American actress Sacheen Littlefeather to accept his second award in protest of the industry’s representation of Native Americans. Littlefeather later revealed the protest caused her to be blacklisted by many studios.Spencer Tracy won two Oscars from nine nominations for Best Actor. He holds the joint record for the most nominations in the category, along with Laurence Olivier, who won only once.Rainer has been described as the first victim of the so-called “Oscar curse”. The Austrian-American star won Best Actress twice in quick succession – for The Great Ziegfeld in 1936 and for The Good Earth in 1937 – which resulted in MGM studios eagerly miscasting her in a series of flops. This would lead to a 54-year break from cinema, before returning alongside Michael Gambon in 1997’s The Gambler.Helen Hayes holds the record for being the actor with the longest gap between two Oscar victories. A practiced stage actress, Hayes also appeared in a few silent films before making her debut ‘talkie’ The Sin of Madelon Claudet, for which she won Best Actress. Hayes’s next and final win would be for a supporting role in Airport, nearly 40 years later.Denzel Washington is the only black actor to win multiple competitive Academy Awards, for Glory in 1990 – a Best Supporting Actor award - and then Training Day in 2002. No African-American actor has won more than one award since, although Mahershala Ali could match his total should he win for Green Book.Brennan had originally started work as an extra after losing most of his money in the 1925 real estate slump, appearing (often uncredited) in over 120 films across the next decade. He would then win three Best Supporting Actor Oscars in the space of four years, for Come and Get It (1936), Kentucky (1938) and The Westerner (1940).Nicholson became regarded as one of the voices of his generation at the start of the 1970s with iconic roles in Easy Rider and Five Easy Pieces, but it took six nominations for him to win his first Oscar, for the Miloš Forman-directed One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest in 1976. He would later win two more, one for Terms of Endearment and the other for As Good as It Gets.Ingrid Bergman, the Swedish star who successfully crossed over to Hollywood in 1939, won three Oscars during her career, beginning with Gaslight in 1944. An extra-marital affair with director Roberto Rossellini in the early 1950s scandalised her American audience, but the success of Anastasia in 1956 brought her back into the bosom of the public favour and she won a second Best Actress trophy. She added a Supporting Actress honour in 1974 for Murder on the Orient Express, one of her last film projects.Sir Daniel Day-Lewis is the only male actor to win three Best Actor awards, for his roles in My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln. After writing himself into the annals of film history with his 2012 win for portraying the American president, Day-Lewis took a step back from the industry, appearing in only one film since – Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread - which he has claimed is his final role. For Meryl Streep, Oscar nominations are nearly as regular as dental appointments. Streep’s name has appeared on the ballot a total of 21 times, 17 of which were in the Best Actress category, and she has won three times: for Kramer vs Kramer in 1980, Sophie’s Choice in 1983, and The Iron Lady in 2012.Katharine Hepburn boasts more Oscar victories – four – than any other actor, all in the Actress in a Leading Role category. Hepburn’s The Lion in Winter trophy was shared with Barbra Streisand in the only ever instance of a tied Best Actress result. Hepburn never attended any of the ceremonies.It was the Austrian-born actor’s long-running collaboration with controversial filmmaker Quentin Tarantino that brought him to the mainstream public consciousness. In Inglourious Basterds, Waltz plays terrifying Nazi colonel Hans Landa, while in Django Unchained, he seems a world apart playing benevolent dentist-cum-bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz. Both roles were rewarded with Oscars for Best Supporting Actor.Spacey won two Oscars, for The Usual Suspects in 1996 and American Beauty in 2000. After numerous allegations of sexual assault emerged in 2017, the actor was removed from the Ridley Scott film All the Money in the World, and Christopher Plummer was given a Best Supporting Actor nomination after reshooting Spacey’s scenes in his stead.Swank won two awards for Best Actress, for Boys Don’t Cry and Million Dollar Baby.

Lange is currently tied as the sixth most nominated Actress in history.Initially winning at the same time as co-star Meryl Streep for Kramer Vs Kramer, Hoffman’s second Best Actor Oscar came for Rain Man in 1988, in a role which has been recognised as important in raising awareness of autism.The poster girl for the flower child generation, Jane Fonda was always expected to politicise the Oscars. After an unexpectedly reserved acceptance speech for Klute in 1972, she presented part of her 1979 speech – for Coming Home – in sign language.Following a supporting turn in 1974’s The Godfather Part II, Robert De Niro’s second Oscar-winning role, playing boxer Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull, is about as hard-earned as they come. The actor honed his boxing ability to professional standards, and gained approximately 60 pounds to play an older, washed-up version of the character.The Aviator is often dismissed as a minor Martin Scorsese film, but the Howard Hawks biopic won Blanchett her first Oscar in 2004. She would have to wait until Blue Jasmine seven years later - her sixth nominated performance, out of seven total - to win in the Best Actress category.Lemmon was legendary for his mastery of both comedy and pathos, and it was chiefly his humorous chops that saw him win Best Supporting Actor in 1955, for his role in Mister Roberts. With a follow-up win for Save the Tiger, the Some Like it Hot star became the first actor to claim Oscar wins in both the lead and supporting categories.Eight-time Oscar nominee Brando influenced a generation of actors with his revolutionary approaches to method, winning Hollywood’s biggest prize twice in the process - for On the Waterfront (1954) and The Godfather (1974). Brando famously sent Native American actress Sacheen Littlefeather to accept his second award in protest of the industry’s representation of Native Americans. Littlefeather later revealed the protest caused her to be blacklisted by many studios.Spencer Tracy won two Oscars from nine nominations for Best Actor. He holds the joint record for the most nominations in the category, along with Laurence Olivier, who won only once.Rainer has been described as the first victim of the so-called “Oscar curse”. The Austrian-American star won Best Actress twice in quick succession – for The Great Ziegfeld in 1936 and for The Good Earth in 1937 – which resulted in MGM studios eagerly miscasting her in a series of flops. This would lead to a 54-year break from cinema, before returning alongside Michael Gambon in 1997’s The Gambler.Helen Hayes holds the record for being the actor with the longest gap between two Oscar victories. A practiced stage actress, Hayes also appeared in a few silent films before making her debut ‘talkie’ The Sin of Madelon Claudet, for which she won Best Actress. Hayes’s next and final win would be for a supporting role in Airport, nearly 40 years later.Denzel Washington is the only black actor to win multiple competitive Academy Awards, for Glory in 1990 – a Best Supporting Actor award - and then Training Day in 2002. No African-American actor has won more than one award since, although Mahershala Ali could match his total should he win for Green Book.Brennan had originally started work as an extra after losing most of his money in the 1925 real estate slump, appearing (often uncredited) in over 120 films across the next decade. He would then win three Best Supporting Actor Oscars in the space of four years, for Come and Get It (1936), Kentucky (1938) and The Westerner (1940).Nicholson became regarded as one of the voices of his generation at the start of the 1970s with iconic roles in Easy Rider and Five Easy Pieces, but it took six nominations for him to win his first Oscar, for the Miloš Forman-directed One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest in 1976. He would later win two more, one for Terms of Endearment and the other for As Good as It Gets.Ingrid Bergman, the Swedish star who successfully crossed over to Hollywood in 1939, won three Oscars during her career, beginning with Gaslight in 1944. An extra-marital affair with director Roberto Rossellini in the early 1950s scandalised her American audience, but the success of Anastasia in 1956 brought her back into the bosom of the public favour and she won a second Best Actress trophy. She added a Supporting Actress honour in 1974 for Murder on the Orient Express, one of her last film projects.Sir Daniel Day-Lewis is the only male actor to win three Best Actor awards, for his roles in My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln. After writing himself into the annals of film history with his 2012 win for portraying the American president, Day-Lewis took a step back from the industry, appearing in only one film since – Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread - which he has claimed is his final role. For Meryl Streep, Oscar nominations are nearly as regular as dental appointments. Streep’s name has appeared on the ballot a total of 21 times, 17 of which were in the Best Actress category, and she has won three times: for Kramer vs Kramer in 1980, Sophie’s Choice in 1983, and The Iron Lady in 2012.Katharine Hepburn boasts more Oscar victories – four – than any other actor, all in the Actress in a Leading Role category. Hepburn’s The Lion in Winter trophy was shared with Barbra Streisand in the only ever instance of a tied Best Actress result. Hepburn never attended any of the ceremonies.The dance was performed by Ribeiro, in character as Carlton Banks, on the Will Smith-starring sitcom back in the 1990s.In 2014,\u0026nbsphe won\u0026nbspDancing with the Stars, the US version of\u0026nbspStrictly Come Dancing.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The losses are not due to any changes to the UK’s trading relationship with the EU, but instead are “related to expectations of future changes, and uncertainty about future changes”, he said.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialCompanies have told the central bank that Brexit fears had hit\u0026nbspinvestment, with many scaling back plans for expansion.

Mark Carney warns of further market volatility due to no-deal fears“This slowdown mainly reflects softer activity abroad and the greater effects from Brexit uncertainties at home,” said the bank, as it held the base rate at 0.75 per cent.

Like many other entrepreneurs, she is spending a lot of time in London, masterminding the expansion of Karma in the UK.\u0026nbspSince it launched in London in February 2018, 80,000 users have signed up to click and collect surplus food from delis and restaurants for half price. On any day, users can browse nearby restaurants and cafes for surplus salads, pastries and full meals to buy and collect before closing.\u0026nbspAll that waste has been good for business: Karma is working with 600 independent retailers in London and makes money by taking a cut of sales. Food waste costs businesses in the UK around\u0026nbsp£20bn annually, according to Wrap, the food waste charity –\u0026nbspthe equivalent of more than £300 per citizen.In September, 90 organisations signed a commitment to reduce food waste through the food chain, from field to fork, by working with suppliers and engaging with customers alike. Supermarkets are increasingly seeing apps as part of the solution.\u0026nbspIn November last year, Karma teamed up with appliance manufacturer Electrolux to test out a smart refrigerator for grocery stores. In a trial in Stockholm, users signed up to buy reduced-price chilled goods that would have otherwise gone to waste, unlocking a connected fridge at the entrance to a supermarket with a QR code.Karma has raised €18m\u0026nbsp(£16m) from investors to expand the number of retailers it works with in London and is planning a test launch in Paris in 2019. But Bernadotte says the app works just as well in small towns with just one or two retailers as it does in big cities. She says: “It’s about matching supply and demand.”It’s also about beating the competition. The number of food waste apps on the market has multiplied in the last decade, fuelled by environmental pressure from consumers and industry bodies. Winnow, which launched in London is 2013, provides chefs in commercial kitchens a set of scales to weigh food and measure how much is thrown away. The app can then assess the value of what is being lost, with the idea that restaurants adapt their menus.\u0026nbspOther apps are based on Bernadotte’s notion of matching supply and demand. Tessa Cook co-founded Olio\u0026nbspin the UK in 2015. The app now connects supply and demand for surplus food within communities in 32 countries, with 75 per cent of food listed picked up within 24 hours.\u0026nbspOlio\u0026nbspcurrently makes money by charging business for its Food Waste Heroes Programme, in which a group of volunteers rescue unsold food from businesses and add it to the app. But its core business is connecting people within communities who may only need one red onion, for example, and have another two to give away. Olio\u0026nbspattracted $6m\u0026nbsp(£4.7m) in Series A funding in July led by Octopus Ventures, which was attracted by the value of connecting people through the app.\u0026nbspKarma’s major competition comes Too Good To Go, an app founded in Copenhagen in 2016. It\u0026nbsphas raised a total of €16m\u0026nbspto expand\u0026nbspin Europe. Too Good To Go founder Mette Lykke knows a thing or two about seeing a gap in the market and scaling a business. She previously co-founded Endomondo, an app for tracking and sharing workouts. It sold to Under Armour for $85m\u0026nbspin 2015.\u0026nbsp“The reality is that it’s standard practice for food businesses to throw away perfectly edible food,” she says. “We give them the flexibility to offer up anything that’s still good to eat and sell it to consumers through the app at a discounted price. It’s a win for retailers, because they reduce waste, acquire customers and increase revenue\u0026nbspit’s a win for consumers who get great food for a reduced price –\u0026nbspand it’s obviously a win for the environment.”In France, Too Good To Go is campaigning for Carrefour, the French retail company, to change its food labels from “best before” to “best before, not bad after”. The campaign comes after Tesco scrapped “best before” labels in the UK in October 2018\u0026nbspon more than 100 products. In its native Denmark, Too Good To Go is also working with the country’s minister for education to create webinars to educate children about how to reduce waste at home.\u0026nbspBut its main business is comes from taking a cut of surplus food sales from restaurants and cafes – with a plan to save 20 million\u0026nbspmeals by the end of 2019. Bernadotte says the main difference between the apps is that Karma users know exactly what food they are picking up, which can help with allergies and dietary requirements. Many of the meals on Too Good To Go are listed as “the magic bag”, a mixed bag of any surplus food that a restaurant might otherwise throw away.\u0026nbspHarriet Jenkins is chief operating officer for Detox Kitchen, a health-food home delivery service that has two delis in London. Detox Kitchen switched from using Too Good To Go to Karma after it was contacted by the latter app when it entered the London market in 2018. “Karma was working with a good number of stores and slightly bigger numbers, so we thought we’d experiment with them,” Jenkins says.6 easy ways to prevent food waste at homeDetox Kitchen had long been interested in reducing food waste in its kitchens, but had found it difficult to strike deals with charities because the delis couldn’t guarantee a set amount of waste to make a worthwhile pickup at the end of the day. Through Karma, they could list as much or as little food for half price to be picked up by customers. In the first week of December last year, Detox Kitchen sold 100 units through Karma, raising £230.\u0026nbsp“It’s not a huge boost to revenue, but it’s not about making money – it’s about not losing money by throwing this stuff away,” Jenkins says. “Anything that is raising the profile of our brand is good for us.”With 700 retailers in London, Karma hasn’t even begun to test the potential of the model, according to Bernadotte. “We started off with restaurants and big hotel chains, and now we’re ramping up with grocery stores, supermarkets and school kitchens,” she says. “I haven’t found anyone who doesn’t have any food waste.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

There’s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here – listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey’s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn’t, well, too fey. Kimmy’s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there’s still something rather inspiring about that. If you’ve ever dreamt of sacking off the rat race and giving countryside self-sufficiency a try, why not live vicariously through this delightful, warm-hearted Seventies sitcom? Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don’t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good’s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy.310 Pride and PrejudiceThe work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It’s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there’s the lake scene – need I say more?Five gay American men do a makeover, and it’s fabulous. That’s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise – Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France es into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming – and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they’re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love.Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise.

He must carry ampoules for injection in the event of an emergency, but these have a limited shelf-life and he needs regular fresh supplies.He recently went to his usual pharmacy\u0026nbspto obtain a new batch of these life-saving drugs, but was informed by the pharmacist that she did not have them in stock. She told Woodman that “we can’t get hold of them” and explained it was because of Brexit.If Brexit is reversed ‘there will be blood on the streets’The experience of being denied the drugs that he needs to keep himself alive reinforced Woodman’s opposition to the UK leaving the EU. “I am horrified by the biggest act of national self-harm in my lifetime – I am 52 – and probably going back a lot earlier,” he says. “It’s not as bad as going to war, but it’s not far off.”The maternity services in Llandough would have collapsed if it was not for the Filipino nursesHe does not see the political and economic damage as something confined to a post-Brexit future, but as a destructive process that is underway and already inflicting losses among real people. As a regional organiser for Unison in Wales, he deals with the problems of union members such as staff at less well-known and less well-funded universities that can no longer attract foreign students. The prospective students are deterred by Brexit uncertainties over their status and qualifications but formerly paid high fees and were an essential cash-cow for the institutions.Woodman says he is particularly concerned about the University of South Wales. Brexit, he believes, “has the capacity to bankrupt the place because the supply of overseas students has dried up”. Other universities are coming under intense financial pressure, meaning “lecturers and support staff are being let go … I am trying to save my members’ jobs”. He adds that Brexit is exacerbating the crisis in the NHS in Wales because of the difficulty in recruiting foreign doctors and nurses who have hitherto kept it going.Ian Thomas, a psychiatric nurse at Llandough Hospital in the Vale of Glamorgan, agrees that the active recruitment of foreign medical workers has been essential. “The maternity services in Llandough would have collapsed if it was not for the Filipino nurses,” he says.Created with Sketch.

There are hints that it shares an undercurrent of resentment towards The Sun newspaper too.Debate in Britain over the advantages and disadvantages of leaving the EU have focused largely on the economic consequences of the move. The first concrete signs of this are in higher education and health as well as in international companies such as Airbus and Nissan. But it is the political changes in Britain produced by the 2016 referendum which are more advanced and more visible than the economic ones – and which have the potential to be much more serious.Two very different political trends have gathered pace since the vote to leave the EU and are becoming irreversible: Britain is a far more ided society, perhaps more so than at any time since the Home Rule crises in the 19th and early 20th century and possibly since the turmoil of the 17th century. “People who lived happily next door to each other are now at daggers drawn,” says Woodman. Grievances that have little or nothing to do with the EU\u0026nbsphave been energised and envenomed by the anti-EU vote.Outside Westminster, people are becoming numb to the Brexit crisisCardiff and south Wales are a useful guide to the politics of Brexit in Britain because the outcome of the referendum here helps demolish conventional wisdom about why a majority of those who went to the polls in the rest of Britain wanted to exit the EU.\u0026nbspWales voted Leave\u0026nbspby 52.5 per cent to 47.5 per cent, which surprised some because it receives substantial EU subsidies, amounting to £680m a year, according to the Welsh government. What’s more, Remain\u0026nbspwas backed by the Labour Party, which has dominated Welsh politics for the past 97 years. Yet only five out of 22 local authorities voted to remain, very much mirroring the split in England between poor and better off, less educated and well-educated, old and young.Cardiff, a prosperous-looking city of 350,000 – one of five UK cities most dependent on EU markets – voted 60 per cent to stay in the EU. But the valleys just to the north of Cardiff, a de-industrialised region once filled with coal mines and steel plants, opted strongly for Leave. The pattern of voting was much the same as in England, though the valleys are famous for their strongly-held Welsh identity and loyalty to the Labour Party, something which they were to confirm in the 2017\u0026nbspgeneral election.In the 1980s we used to regularly have dog shit in Tesco bags pushed through our letter box and ‘Pakis Out’ in big letters written on the side wall of our houseThe outcome of the referendum in Wales puts in doubt the widely credited belief that Brexit was significantly fuelled by resurgent English nationalism and nostalgia for a lost imperial past. This thesis looks less convincing if Welsh socialists, who do not feel the same about the British empire and are still bitter about the crushing of the miners’ strike in 1984-85, voted the same way as English Leavers.Care also needs to be taken when arguing about the degree to which the Brexit vote was propelled by opposition to immigration and Islamophobia, because, while there are many immigrant communities in Cardiff, there are very few in the valleys,\u0026nbspwhere there is not a single mosque according to residents.Of course, the absence of immigrants on the street does not necessarily mean that there is no hostility towards their presence\u0026nbspnationally. Local opinion is split on this, but Graham Simmonds, an independent member of Caerphilly Council who is a Leave supporter, says that emphasis on anti-immigration as an issue in the valleys “is just a stick that the media uses to beat us”. He adds: “I have never encountered it.”Whatever the role of the anti-immigrant vote, there is a simple reason why Cardiff, a government centre with much employment in health and education (it has three universities), should vote differently from the families of former miners and steel workers in the valleys.West Wales and the valleys, once a hub\u0026nbspof the industrial revolution in Britain, today top the list of the five poorest areas in northern Europe, according to 2016 figures. Interestingly, the next four on the list are all in England: Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, Lincolnshire, South Yorkshire, and the Tees Valley and Durham. As in Wales, these deprived regions voted strongly for Brexit, with Lincolnshire having the highest proportion of Leave voters in the UK. Poverty, not national identity, appears to be the dominant factor.UK manufacturers stockpile at record pace in January ahead of BrexitImmigration is an easy explanation for people in deprived areas who want to know why they are jobless or have ill-paid, insecure employment. Pro-Brexit tabloids have for decades drip-fed readers with stories portraying immigrants as parasites on the NHS and the undeserved recipients of largesse through exploiting state benefits.Even so, it is difficult to judge the extent of anti-immigrant feeling, because people are embarrassed to express it and, even when they did in interviews with The Independent, some later asked for their comments to be removed. Police figures for hate crimes or abuse are not very accurate because officers often do not have the resources, the numbers or the inclination to follow such incidents up, according to Cardiff residents.Those from ethnic minorities in the city are better judges of the extent to which the referendum and its aftermath turbo-charged racism in Britain and raised it to a new and more toxic level. Trade union leaders from minority communities (Pakistani, Sikh, Caribbean, Portuguese) spoke to The Independent about their personal experience of racism and about their members who had filed or been the targets of complaints about alleged abuse. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShavanah Taj is a national officer for the Public and Commercial Services Union, whose father came from Pakistan to work in a steel plant in south Wales in 1958-59. She is married to a Nigerian and has two children aged five and seven. She says that racist abuse has markedly increased in the last three or four years, though she stresses that it was also bad in the past.\u0026nbsp“In the 1980s we used to regularly have dog shit in Tesco bags pushed through our letter box and ‘Pakis Out’ in big letters written on the side wall of our house.” She says this of kind of abuse ebbed in the following years, but has now returned – and strengthened. \u0026nbspAs an Asian woman with two small children, she says she has been harassed by white men who block her way in the street. Invariably, when she walks into a shop “the security guard will follow me around”.For the first time she and her husband are asking themselves if they\u0026nbspwill get to the point when they\u0026nbspno longer think of the areas as\u0026nbsphome.\u0026nbspPreviously, she and her family had never felt it necessary to have a Plan B about where they should live.\u0026nbspNow they wonder if they ought to.Created with Sketch.10 novels to help you beat the Brexit blues Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Lucky Jim by Kingsley Amis Mansfield Park by Jane Austen310 Diary of a Provincial LadyDiary of a Provincial Lady by EM Delafield410 Tales of the CityTales of the City: the Seventies and Eighties gay bible, by Armistead MaupinThe Mating Season by PG WodehouseNot Working by Lisa Owens810 A Gentleman in MoscowA Gentleman in Moscow by Amor TowlesCold Comfort Farm by Stella GibbonsAdrian Mole, The Prostrate Years by Sue TownsendLucky Jim by Kingsley Amis Mansfield Park by Jane Austen310 Diary of a Provincial LadyDiary of a Provincial Lady by EM Delafield410 Tales of the CityTales of the City: the Seventies and Eighties gay bible, by Armistead MaupinThe Mating Season by PG WodehouseNot Working by Lisa Owens810 A Gentleman in MoscowA Gentleman in Moscow by Amor TowlesCold Comfort Farm by Stella GibbonsAdrian Mole, The Prostrate Years by Sue TownsendAmarjite Singh, a Sikh who works for the Royal Mail, is branch secretary of the Communications Workers Union and wears a distinctive red turban. He agrees with Taj that open racism receded from the end of the 1980s up to 2016. Other are less sanguine and say there has been mounting Islamophobia propelled by 911, 77 and the rise of Isis after 2014.Singh says\u0026nbspthe most significant change is the degree to which the extreme right is today able to mobilise\u0026nbsppeople. “I haven’t seen so many far-right demonstrations up and down the country ever before with rallies on the same weekend in Birmingham, Leeds and Newcastle,” he says.I know a plasterer who told me that he is now reading a book by Tommy Robinson called ‘Enemy of the State’, which he says is the first book that he has ever readBrexit may originally have been about leaving the EU and about anxiety over immigration from Eastern Europe – indeed, says Singh, many Sikhs voted Leave because they thought foreigners were coming to take their jobs. But then they found that immigrants from the subcontinent and beyond were also targeted.Singh recalls:\u0026nbsp“Two weeks ago I was on a bus and there was a Somali woman with a baby in a pram who could not put it in the space allotted for it because a young man was blocking it. When the bus driver told him to let her park the pram there, the young man replied: ‘Who does she think she is?\u0026nbspShe’s only a foreigner’.”Woodman, whose mother immigrated to the UK from Portugal in 1952 and whose father came from Guyana, agrees that the Brexit vote has exacerbated racism, saying: “It emboldens people, as it does in Trump’s America, to say in public what they used to say in private. I have been called the n-word and that rarely happened in recent years.” He adds that it is wrong to blame everything on Brexit, but he finds it difficult to think of any other explanation for the racist surge.It’s time to call out broken Brexit promises on tradeWhite indigenous residents in south Wales confirm that the extreme right is becoming legitimised in a way that it was not in the past. Ian Thomas, who has long campaigned against racism, says\u0026nbsphe is more worried now than he has ever been before, because he believes that racial hatred, that was always there, but hidden, is coming increasingly to the surface.The rise of the extreme right and open displays of racism have occurred in the past (Oswald Mosley in the 1930s, the Notting Hill riots in the 1950s, Enoch Powell’s “Rivers of Blood”\u0026nbspspeech in 1968, the National Front in the 1970s) but they have peaked and then evaporated or returned to obscurity. Often, they took advantage of periods of acute economic and political instability which came to an end.What is so different about the current crisis over Brexit is that there is no reason why the crisis should come to an end any time soon, and every reason why it should get worse, providing the far-right with fertile ground to expound their racist creed.Not all the arrows point in the same direction and some polls show that hostility to immigrants has receded somewhat since 2016, when Syrian refugees were flooding into Europe and Isis was carrying out highly publicised atrocities in the centre of European capitals.But in the eyes of many people, immigrants remain a threat and the evidence is that this perception has not changed very much. As Woodman says, all that you need to do to generate racial hatred “is to persuade people that those who are different from themselves are the reason they are poor”.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

This beautiful axehead was found in the Scottish Borders\u0026nbspbut it’s not from Scotland, it’s from central Europe – and it’s been here for 6,000 years.Several floors above, in the museum’s revamped East Asia galleries, curators from a range of countries are celebrating a landmark in the museum’s history. After 15 years, the £80m\u0026nbspoverhaul of this historic institution is finally complete. The project was completed on time\u0026nbspand on budget. The museum’s 29 galleries look magnificent. By any measure, it’s been a spectacular success. More than two million people visit the\u0026nbspmuseum every year, making it Britain’s most popular visitor attraction outside London – not bad for a venue in a city with a population of half a million, and in a country with a population of just five million. However, this relaunch comes at a critical time in Scotland’s national history. When this redevelopment began, in 2004, who would have thought it would be completed just as Scotland braces itself to leave the EU?In case anyone needs reminding (and it seems quite a lot of English voters do), Scots voted to remain in the European Union in 2016, by a considerably larger margin than they voted to remain in the United Kingdom in 2014. According to English Brexiteers, this “will of the people”\u0026nbspdoesn’t count because Scotland is merely part of the UK, rather than a distinct and separate country – and in a narrow\u0026nbsplegalistic sense they’re right. But as you wander around this museum, which charts the history of the Scottish nation and its relationship with the wider world beyond the British Isles, you realise there’s nothing eternal or automatic about Scotland’s place within the UK.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBrexit putting the union at risk, new poll revealsThe history of the National Museum of Scotland\u0026nbspmirrors Scotland’s shifting relationship with Great Britain over the past few hundred years. The museum’s roots stretch back to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, founded in 1780, at the height of the Scottish Enlightenment, when Edinburgh, then as now, was a European cultural and intellectual hub.In 1861\u0026nbspthe current building was erected here in Chambers Street. Prince Albert laid the foundation stone. Originally called the Industrial Museum of Scotland, it was the UK’s first national museum outside London. The central atrium, flooded with natural light, was inspired by London’s Crystal Palace, where Albert staged his Great Exhibition in 1851. The museum’s mission was “to bring Scotland to the world, and the world to Scotland”.\u0026nbspThat mission statement held true in 1861 – it still holds true today.Over the next century, this museum was renamed several times. It was the Edinburgh Museum of Science and\u0026nbspArt, and then the Royal Scottish Museum, before finally becoming the National Museum of Scotland in 1985. In 1998\u0026nbspa modern wing was added to the original Victorian building, and since 2004 the Victorian building has been undergoing an enormous renovation programme. Now finally, after 15 years, that renovation is complete.So is this the\u0026nbspend of the story, the conclusion of a process which began back in 1780? Hardly. A stroll around this museum confirms that history is always unfinished business – particularly here in Scotland, in a national museum in a country which hasn’t been an independent nation for more than 300 years. For visitors, from Britain and abroad, this ambiguous status begs the question: what is the purpose of a national museum in a land that is not (yet) a nation? Is it a sop to rebellious Scots, to appease their nationalist ambitions? Or is it a cultural harbinger of full independence – a sign of things to come?As these displays remind us, England and Scotland have shared a monarch since 1603, when James VI of Scotland inherited the English crown from the childless Queen Elizabeth I. What’s less widely known – outside Scotland, at least – is that the Scottish parliament stumbled on for another century, until the Act of Union in 1707. Since the foundation of the Scottish parliament, just down the road from here, in 1999, Scotland is back where it was in the 17th century –\u0026nbspa country with its own parliament\u0026nbspbut subservient to Westminster. A century from now, will Scotland be independent again?Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

The European Council president launched the scathing attack as he accused anti-EU campaigners of pushing for Brexit “without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely.” Mr Tusk also dismissed suggestions that the EU could reopen negotiations over the controversial Northern Ireland backstop, dealing a blow to Theresa May‘s hopes of securing fresh concessions as she tries to get her exit deal through parliament. Speaking in Brussels alongside Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Mr Tusk said: “I’ve been wondering what a special place in hell looks like for people who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely.” He also tweeted the accusation moments later4242 EU and UK announce talks to restart after Theresa May visits BrusselsBoth have agreed to restart Brexit talks to find “a way through” the deadlock in Westminster, following a visit by Theresa May to Brussels. In a joint statement the British government and European Commission said Ms May had had a “robust but constructive” meeting with president Jean-Claude Juncker, and that the pair would meet again before the end of the month. But the EU again refused to reopen the withdrawal agreement and its controversial backstop – with any negotiations expected to focus on the future relationship between the UK and EU insteadScotland isn’t the only European nation within a nation, and several of these quasi-nations have their own national museums. Their respective histories reveal a good deal about these statelets’ differing attitudes to independence. The Bayerisches Nationalmuseum in Munich was founded in 1855\u0026nbspby King Maximilian II of Bavaria, when the region was still an independent nation. Bavaria voted for union with the Deutsches Reich in 1871, and has remained part of Germany ever since, yet it retains many of the cultural trappings of a nation state, including this national museum. A significant minority of Bavarians still pine for a return to statehood (a YouGov poll in 2017, at the height of the refugee crisis, put the number as high as 32 per cent), but as immigration falls it looks as if these separatist ambitions have peaked.Conversely, the Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya, in Barcelona, reflects far stronger independence aspirations. Despite its long history as an independent country, Catalonia has been part of Spain since 1715, and until 2004 the Palau Nacional in Barcelona merely housed the Museu d’Art de Catalunya. In 2004 it was renamed the Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya, and in 2017, when Catalonia held an (illegal) independence referendum, the Palau Nacional was a popular focal point for pro-independence demonstrations.At present, Scottish independence seems to sit somewhere between these two positions. In 2014 Scots voted to remain in the UK, by 55.3 per cent\u0026nbspto 44.7\u0026nbspper cent, but Scotland’s subsequent vote to remain in the EU, by 62 per cent\u0026nbspto 38 per cent, puts the Scottish parliament on a collision course with Westminster. The National Museum of Scotland is careful not to take sides in these isive debates. They don’t need to. The exhibits speak for themselves. Scotland may leave the EU\u0026nbspand may remain in the UK, but the contents of this museum show Scotland has always been a European country, as much as a British one.Entering the wing of the museum\u0026nbspdevoted to Scottish history, you’re confronted by a cri de coeur from Robert the Bruce: “As long as one hundred of us remain alive, we will never on any conditions be brought under English rule.”\u0026nbspOn the opposite wall is a similarly stirring pronouncement from the Declaration of Arbroath (the letter the barons of Scotland sent to Pope John XXII in 1320, confirming Scotland’s independence, and its right to resist the English by force): “For we fight not for glory nor riches nor honours, but for freedom alone, which no good man gives up except with his life.”For an English visitor in particular, what is unfamiliar (and instructive) about this display is the pan-European focus, and the refreshing absence of Anglo-centric emphasis. You realise that, for long periods of its history, Scotland’s relationship with England was nothing special. The Romans occupied all of England for several centuries and left a lasting mark upon it. Their partial incursions into Scotland were short and insubstantial. During the dark ages, Scotland enjoyed closer links with Ireland than England. As the old Roman roads crumbled away, it became far easier for Scots to sail to Ireland than to trek to England. The Irish Sea wasn’t a barrier\u0026nbspbut a busy highway.There was nothing inevitable or preordained about the Act of Union in 1707. Like a lot of historical turning points, it owed a good deal to happenstance. At the end of the 17th century, despite having shared the same monarch for almost 100 years, the Kingdom of Scotland was still independent. And with better luck and better judgement it might well have remained so. If only the Scottish government hadn’t invested a quarter of Scotland’s wealth in a new colony in Panama, it might still be independent today.Like a lot of heroic failures, the idea was inspired. By establishing a base in Panama, on the isthmus between North and South America, Scotland would control the growing trade between the Pacific and the Atlantic, anticipating the Panama canal by 200 years. Mindful of the Romans, and the new empire they hoped to build, they called this new colony Caledonia.If Caledonia had been successful, Scotland might have become a world power, with no need of England. However, the English government did its best to scupper the venture, colluding with the East India Company in a trade blockade. The colony collapsed, sparking a financial crisis\u0026nbspin Edinburgh. If anything, the collapse in national confidence was even more severe. Seven years later the Scottish parliament voted narrowly for union with England – and that was the end of the Scottish parliament\u0026nbspuntil 1999.Of course this isn’t new information, but it’s a shock to English eyes to see it presented here so prominently, and so starkly, rather than buried in the footnotes of a dry and dusty history book. I studied this stuff when I did my history degree, but I never knew about the £20,000 in bribes the English paid to Scottish politicians to push the Act of Union through the Scottish parliament, and vote for their own extinction. In the light of this betrayal, the Jacobite rebellions of 1715 and 1745 make a lot more sense.Hunting with dogs to be ‘effectively halted’ in Scotland Women win equal pay dispute after 12-year battle with Glasgow councilCross-party rally calls for second referendum in ScotlandThe top floor of the museum is devoted to Scotland in the 20th century. The exhibition Scotland:\u0026nbspA Changing Nation is a vivid picture of where Scotland stands today. Here you’ll find Jimmy Reid, the Scottish trade unionist, and Winifred Ewing, the pioneering SNP politician. Here you’ll find Margaret Thatcher, opining that:\u0026nbsp“We English, who are a marvellous people, are really very generous to Scotland.”\u0026nbspThe display lets you draw your own conclusions. The exhibition concludes with the opening of the Scottish parliament, designed by the Catalan architect Enric Miralles. “We have a building which is more than a building,”\u0026nbspsaid the Scots poet Edwin Morgan, and he’s right.So what does the rebirth of this museum tell us about the rebirth of Scottish nationalism? This museum isn’t a nationalistic project, as its curators are at pains to point out. The National Museum of Scotland is devoutly, resolutely apolitical. It flies no flag for any party. Yet Scottish politics has flowed in a very different direction since 1998\u0026nbspwhen this museum was last expanded: an independence referendum (defeated) an EU membership referendum (won in Scotland\u0026nbspbut lost across the UK, thanks to Brexit votes in England)\u0026nbspand a resurrected Scottish parliament, reconvened after 200 years.In party politics, the biggest story by far has been the rise of the Scottish National Party, now the governing party here in Scotland. These have been seismic changes, and though this museum’s impartiality is admirable, it wouldn’t be doing its job if it didn’t reflect this tectonic shift.The internationalism of this museum, and the growing internationalism of Scotland, is reflected in this museum’s perspective, and the nationalities of its staff. The three curators I spoke to, entirely at random, were Chinese, French and German. Time was, talent tended to drift south from Scotland. Now, increasingly, it’s the other way around. The museum’s director, Dr Gordon Rintoul,\u0026nbspis a Scot who returned to Scotland from England.“We’ve certainly attracted a substantial number of people from outside Scotland, and I think people have come here because they sense an opportunity to do something different, an opportunity to make a difference,”\u0026nbspsays Rintoul. His curator of Chinese collections, Dr Qin Cao, is a case in point. Originally from China, she worked in London and Oxford before she relocated to Edinburgh. “It is a very vibrant place,”\u0026nbspshe says.“We have so many visitors coming from all over the world,”\u0026nbspsays Friederike Voigt, a senior curator\u0026nbspwho was born and raised in Germany. “In a way what makes Scotland great is the same thing that makes this museum great,”\u0026nbspsays Dr Xavier Dectot, keeper of art and\u0026nbspdesign at the musuem, who comes from France. I know what he means. It’s big enough, but it’s small enough. People feel connected here.“There’s a greater awareness that we’re actually dependent on other people, so we want to interact,”\u0026nbspadds Voigt. “It’s very outward looking,”\u0026nbspconcurs Dectot. “Not only do we feel Scottish, but the other Scots don’t perceive us as anything but Scots.”\u0026nbspIf only this were true in England.“A large part of what defines the architecture of this city is late 18th century – neoclassical – that’s something that is very European,”\u0026nbspsays Dectot, who personifies Scotland’s Auld Alliance\u0026nbspwith France, and its cultural affinity with the continent. And now the street life is catching up. The city always used to feel cosmopolitan in August\u0026nbspduring Edinburgh\u0026nbspFestival Fringe. Now it feels cosmopolitan all year round. “Everyone in the city has responded to that,”\u0026nbspsays Rintoul. “That does actually give the city a more international feel.”Scottish devolution has had a direct effect on the evolution of this museum. “A key point for this project was the strong support from Scottish government,”\u0026nbspRintoul tells me. It doesn’t hurt that the Scottish parliament, in Holyrood, is just a short walk\u0026nbspfrom the museum. “It’s clearly easier to argue your case.”\u0026nbspIt’s also clearly easier to secure public funding when the public keep coming in such numbers. The museum’s recent Mary Queen of Scots and Bonnie Prince Charlie exhibitions were both hugely popular. Their popularity reveals a growing appetite for Scottish heritage, particularly for shows like these, which re-evaluate the mythic elements of Scotland’s past.There’s definitely been a resurgence in Scottish history as an academic discipline. As a consequence we know a lot more about whole areas of Scotland’s history than was the case 20 or 30 years ago“Since the time of devolution there’s been\u0026nbspmuch increased interest in Scotland’s history. There’s definitely been a resurgence in Scottish history as an academic discipline. As a consequence we know a lot more about whole areas of Scotland’s history than was the case 20 or 30 years ago.”Although Edinburgh feels more international now, Scots internationalism is nothing new. “Scots have always engaged with the rest of the world. These galleries, throughout the whole museum, are replete with items that were acquired by Scots who were abroad, as missionaries\u0026nbspor to seek their fortune\u0026nbspor in military service, and bringing things back to Scotland.”Speaking personally, as a Londoner who’s spent more time in Edinburgh than in any city outside London, I grow to love Scotland more with every visit, but I also become more and more aware of how different it is from England. Without Brexit, the National Museum of Scotland might have remained what it has been for more than a century – an expression of national identity for a nation within a nation – a Bavarian model, if you like. After Brexit, it looks destined to become the focal point for a more Catalan model, whether these curators like it or not. What an exquisite irony that the Conservative and\u0026nbspUnionist Party, of all parties, has brought the Act of Union to its current crisis point! What a fascinating exhibition that will make, in 20 or 30 years to come.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

That light is invisible to the human eye but is a useful tool for exploring the universe: it will give astronomers a look at more than 300 million galaxies, as well as 100 million stars in our Milky Way.This amazing mission will be a treasure trove of unique data for astronomers,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, in a statement. “It will deliver an unprecedented galactic map containing ‘fingerprints’ from the first moments in the universe’s history. And we’ll have new clues to one of the greatest mysteries in science: What made the universe expand so quickly less than a nanosecond after the big bang?”To answer those questions, SPHEREx will look out at all those galaxies, some of which are so far away that the light reaching us has taken 10 billion years to travel through the universe. It will hunt out water and organic molecules in the hope that we can understand where – and how often – those ingredients for life occur throughout the cosmos.It will also look out\u0026nbspto create\u0026nbspmap of the entire sky, in 96 different colour bands.

No prizes for guessing where this is…From one mighty ocean to another – ships passing through the Panama canalAstronaut Tim Peake previously revealed the damage that orbital junk can cause spacecraft, when he shared an image of a chipped window panel on board the International Space Station in 2016.It is believed that something as small as a paint chip could have caused the damage, as it hurtled towards the International Space Station.When in full operation, scientists aim to make the harpoon fire at debris up to 30 metres away.Engineers back on Earth are still trying to work out how the system can be used to target moving objects.A previous RemoveDEBRIS\u0026nbspexperiment demonstrated how a net could be used to catch potentially dangerous pieces of rubbish orbiting the Earth. Next, the group are expected to test the drag sail part of the test on 12 March.\u0026nbsp“Successful in-space demonstration of the harpoon technology is a significant step towards solving the growing issue of space debris, said Chris Burgess, Harpoon Lead Engineer at Airbus Defence and Space.Professor Guglielmo Aglietti, director of the Surrey Space Centre at the University of Surrey, added: “This is RemoveDEBRIS’ most demanding experiment and the fact that it was a success is testament to all involved.\u0026nbspThe RemoveDEBRIS project provides strong evidence of what can be achieved with the power of collaboration – pooling together the experience across industry and the research field to achieve something truly remarkable.”Additional reporting from agencies.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side.

There’s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here – listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey’s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn’t, well, too fey. Kimmy’s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there’s still something rather inspiring about that. If you’ve ever dreamt of sacking off the rat race and giving countryside self-sufficiency a try, why not live vicariously through this delightful, warm-hearted Seventies sitcom? Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don’t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good’s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy.310 Pride and PrejudiceThe work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It’s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there’s the lake scene – need I say more?Five gay American men do a makeover, and it’s fabulous. That’s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise – Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France es into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming – and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they’re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love.Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that’s always enlivening to watch. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its erse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct. After all, if they can do it, anyone can.A staple on ITV3, Inspector Morse is the televisual equivalent of slipping on your favourite slippers: familiar and cosy. Sure, there are quite a few murders, but what about that beautiful Oxford setting, where dreaming spires tower above the grisliness? It\u0027s intelligent and has brilliant characterisation, with John Thaw\u0027s curmudgeonly, Wagner-loving, real-ale man its wonderful centre of gravity. The series ran from 1987 to 2000 and its legacy has lived on through spin-offs Lewis and Endeavour, but neither of which can quite match this series for charm. Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends’s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are – but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable. It rightly made stars of its six cast members when it premiered in 1994, and managed to continually evolve through the course of its ten seasons without losing its warm, inimitable charm. Once you\u0027re hooked, you\u0027ll have 236 episodes to get your teeth into – which is enough that by the time you\u0027re done, you\u0027ll be ready to start again.She dresses like a primary school teacher, smiles like the Cheshire cat, and sees the best in absolutely everybody: Kimmy Schmidt is an unusual heroine today.

Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that’s always enlivening to watch. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its erse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct. After all, if they can do it, anyone can.A staple on ITV3, Inspector Morse is the televisual equivalent of slipping on your favourite slippers: familiar and cosy. Sure, there are quite a few murders, but what about that beautiful Oxford setting, where dreaming spires tower above the grisliness? It\u0027s intelligent and has brilliant characterisation, with John Thaw\u0027s curmudgeonly, Wagner-loving, real-ale man its wonderful centre of gravity. The series ran from 1987 to 2000 and its legacy has lived on through spin-offs Lewis and Endeavour, but neither of which can quite match this series for charm. Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends’s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are – but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable. It rightly made stars of its six cast members when it premiered in 1994, and managed to continually evolve through the course of its ten seasons without losing its warm, inimitable charm. Once you\u0027re hooked, you\u0027ll have 236 episodes to get your teeth into – which is enough that by the time you\u0027re done, you\u0027ll be ready to start again.“They don’t usually do that.

The homeowner also claims that an independent surveyor conducted a site survey of the flat before the sale took place.Islington council is claiming Mr Zomparelli has been “unjustly enriched” by the apparent administrative blunder.In a letter in March 2016, the local authority explained that where a public body “acts outside their jurisdiction, their decision is void”.Mr Zomparelli said: “It’s madness really. They have doubled the price of a property based on a box room.”Having failed to agree terms out of court, the council and Mr Zomparelli are due to begin legal proceedings at Clerkenwell and Shoreditch County Court but are still waiting for confirmation on a date.Additional reporting by SWNSWe’ll tell you what’s true.

For its devoted fans it has a symbolic value totally unrelated to its workability, its true cost or the glaring self-interest of its proposers, whereas non-believers see nothing but a deranged and costly vanity project.brexit is like a sitcom where at the start of the episode the main character tells a casual lie about being able to skye to impress someone and now they\u0027re at the end of the episode in a plane about to jumpBrexit is like if Farage \u0026amp Johnson said “May we make you an *amazing* apple crumble?” \u0026amp then 18 months later handed you a leaking bag of maggots \u0026amp offal. You shouldn’t have to eat it.‘Asking me to support Brexit is like asking me to punch my constituents in the face,’ said Anna Turley, the Labour MP for Redcar, which voted 66:34 to leave. ‘It doesn’t make it easier if you tell me my constituents want to be punched.’Watching this government deal with Brexit is like being locked outside your house while you can see people inside setting fire to the furniture as the law’s telling you you can’t go in and stop them.Brexit is like living in a superhero movie that has no heroes, just loads of incompetent villains fighting over who is more evil.Brexit is like a bad novel. You are so far into it you just want to skip to the end to see if it ended as badly as it had begun.Watching Brexit is like trying to reverse engineer the rules of cricket by listening to the radio. I have absolutely no idea what is going on.Brexit is like the UK took a motorway exit, then found the road turning into a rutted grassy track, and now the car\u0027s stuck in a muddy field, there\u0027s no help in sight, it\u0027s getting dark, everyone\u0027s shouting at the driver, and the passengers are beginning to worry about food.Watching Brexit is like watching someone try and plug a coaxial aerial cable into a HDMI port. There is a lot of anger, a lot of swearing, and a lot of remarks about how this used to work before.#Brexit is like going back to Windows 3.1I\u0027m sure most people remember a kid at school who just lied constantly?

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.One leading Tory described the night as a “fiasco”, Jeremy Corbyn said the country was heading for a “catastrophe”, and a senior source in Brussels said: “There goes the strong mandate.”The Brexit fault line also cut through Mr Corbyn’s party on Thursday, with a significant number of Labour MPs apparently defying their leader’s will in a separate vote\u0026nbspamid suspicions that some are close to breaking away.Corbyn suffers revolt as 41 Labour MPs back ‘immediate’ Brexit delayBut the spotlight was firmly on the prime minister’s ailing administration as it contorted in an attempt to avoid defeat on what did not have to be a difficult night for Ms May.The wording of Thursday’s motion called on MPs to reiterate their support for the approach set out in an earlier set of votes on 29 January, when the Commons backed a plan to reopen negotiations with Brussels on the withdrawal agreement –\u0026nbspbut also voted for a non-binding amendment rejecting a no-deal Brexit.After the government apparently combined\u0026nbspsupport for both issues in Thursday’s motion, rather than just focussing on renegotiating with the EU, Tory Euroceptics who want to keep no deal on the table found themselves unable to back Ms May’s position.It’s an unfortunate fiasco that the government’s clumsiness createdGovernment whips tried and failed in the hours running up to the vote\u0026nbspto convince Brexiteers that backing the government on Thursday would not take no deal off the table.After the defeat, prominent Eurosceptic Bernard Jenkin MP said: “It’s an unfortunate fiasco that the government’s clumsiness created.“I don’t know why the government doesn’t consult a bit more widely before they table these motions. There are 110 Eurosceptic Tory MPs who helped defeat the withdrawal agreement – not one of us was consulted.”The ision list showed the government’s Brexit motion was supported by 243 of Ms\u0026nbspMay’s MPs.\u0026nbspWhile just five of them voted against it, many Tories in the\u0026nbspBrexit-backing\u0026nbspEuropean Research Group (ERG) abstained, robbing Ms May of her majority.Steve Baker, vice-chair of the ERG, said its members were not prepared to be “coopted into taking no deal off the table”, but he insisted that Ms May retains “a clear mandate” from last month’s vote to negotiate a better deal with Brussels.He said: “It’s time for some people to grow up and think about what is in the national interest.\u0026nbspThat is standing firm that we are leaving and then negotiating with the EU to get an acceptable deal.”Mr Corbyn demanded the prime minister come back to the chamber with a “coherent plan” following the defeat, claiming the vote showed there is no majority for her course of action.He went on: “The government cannot keep on ignoring parliament or ploughing on towards 29\u0026nbspMarch without a coherent plan.“She can’t keep on just running down the clock and hoping that something will turn up that will save her day and save her face.”A Downing Street spokesman accused Mr Corbyn of putting “partisan considerations” ahead of the national interest and voting in a way to make a no-deal scenario more likely.He added: “While we didn’t secure the support of the Commons this evening, the prime minister continues to believe, and the debate itself indicated, that far from objecting to securing changes to the backstop that will allow us to leave with a deal, there was a concern from some Conservative colleagues about taking no deal off the table at this stage.The spokesman said the government will now continue to seek legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement in order to secure Britain’s departure from the EU on 29 March.But the defeat does not bode well for a more significant set of votes coming on 27 February, when parliament could well use Commons amendments to take control of the process away from Ms May and delay\u0026nbspBrexit.Pro-Europe Tory\u0026nbspAnna Soubry\u0026nbspsaid: “This is a serious blow to the credibility of the prime minister. We are in such a mess, I’m afraid, that parliament is going to have to take back control of this.“It is a symbol of the profound lack of leadership in both political parties.”Mr Corbyn also suffered a major revolt when dozens of his own MPs backed an\u0026nbspSNP\u0026nbspcall for an “immediate” move to delay Brexit by extending\u0026nbspArticle 50.The Labour leader had ordered his MPs to abstain – but he was defied by 41 who voted with the Scottish Nationalists for a suspension of “no fewer than three months”, past 29 March.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The BBC — fuelled by £billion of public money — has expanded into a state-backed media monster encroaching on areas that should be none of its business, from trivial “clickbait” stories to lestyle advice.After all, the BBC Charter states that it should “provide impartial news and information to help people understand  the world around them. It should offer depth and analysis not widely available from other UK news providers”.Somewhere, this has gone very wrong.It churns out so much stuff online that it could be renamed the British Publishing Corporation.In the process, the monster is devouring the market for everything from local newspapers to gossip websites.Why does “our” national broadcaster now feel obliged to publish “news” stories such as the classic “Serial poopers: What makes people poop in public ” The BBC is also hopelessly addicted to pumping out recipes. Type in “spaghetti bolognese” on Google and the first result that s is from BBC Good Food — a commercial site that trades on the broadcaster’s brand.Why is the BBC even in the already-crowded recipe market  Never heard the one about “too many cooks” By stretching its insensitive tentacles into local areas from its London and Salford HQs, the BBC has contributed to wrecking the local and regional Press, longstanding voices of real communities.At least  local and regional titles have closed since , as circulation halved from .million weekly in  to .million in .Since , the number of regional journalists has also been halved, to around ,.An estimated  per cent of the country now has no daily or weekly title.A robotic BBC web page is no substitute for local Press coverage of council meetings and court proceedings.And yet the money pours in to fund this expansion way beyond its remit.Last year the BBC spent £million on BBC Online and “Red Button” services. The national and local Press are under siege from the tech giants and their BBC collaborators. But this is about more than newspaper self-interest.The future of dirt-digging journalism and democratic debate is at stake.Cairncross estimates that “legacy newsbrands” — aka national and local newspapers — are responsible for around  per cent of all original news journalism in the UK, more than broadcasters and online-only outlets put together. That seems an underestimate.The role of the Press in reporting the news is not just a matter of historical “legacy”. As one ex-editor of a London local paper observes, “councillors and crooks must surely feel relaxed” without local hacks watching and reporting what they are up to.Every big story of recent years was broken by newspapers, from the fire risk Vauxhall Zafira and how Age UK pushed expensive power deals to OAPsto Philip Green gagging reports of sexual and racial harassment .Even last year’s most popular BBC-based story — the snogging scandal on Strictly Come Dancing — was a Sun on Sunday exclusive, before the BBC did its usual parasitical trick of topping Google searches for articles about “the Strictly Curse”.The newspaper tradition of long-form writing and forensic examination will continue to struggle as the online purveyors suck up adverts for cheap and cheerful clickbait.The print medium remains unmatched for serious analysis.Yet the BBC’s self-aggrandising aim is now to expand its global audience further, rather than meet the needs of the underserved as a public service broadcaster surely should.Thus the social media chief of BBC News, Mark Frankel, boasts of the corporation having on Facebook “the largest news page and total fanbase of any news organisation in the world”.The publicly funded BBC need not care that the tech giants don’t pay for stories, as for them Facebook is just a free publicity funnel.That alliance makes it even harder for the rest of the media to take a stand against being royally ripped off.Auntie is effectively in league with greed-driven tech giants.What of the output of all these BBC s  They claim to be a beacon of liberal ersity.The one thing the BBC can’t tolerate, however, is ersity of opinion.It is a bastion of illiberal luvvie smugness, peddling its elitism as the centre ground, blasting out conformist propaganda in Brexit-bashing  debates and Brexit-bashing comedy shows.Lord Reith, the first BBC chief, wanted the then-monopoly corporation to “inform, educate and entertain” the public, from the point of view of the British Establishment.Reith’s successors might have quite a dferent world view.But the new BBC establishment —  managers paid between £, to £, a year,  on between £, to £, — would love to have a state-backed news monopoly again, educating and informing the ignorant public, whether we like it or not.Those of us who appreciate the importance of a vibrant and erse media to democracy, should tell the BBC to get its tanks off the free Press’s lawn.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, he’s broken it, Mills  Boon style, “into a million pieces”.No one is suggesting that Meghan isn’t upset by the way her father and other off-message relatives have behaved — who wouldn’t be But this supposedly “private” attempt to build bridges lacks authenticity.Decades of dealing with PR spin designed to deflect suspicious journalists away from the real storyhas taught me to trust my gut instinct.And given Thomas’s previous form on speaking to the Press, it’s telling me that Meghan wrote this rather staged letter in the expectation that he would leak it and, therefore, seamlessly allow her to peddle her own narrative while maintaining the cover of the innocent party who has been betrayed by her own father yet again.But Thomas kept the letter under wraps. Until, that is, he was baited in to defending himself against claims made by some of Meghan’s close friends, who spoke anony-mously , about the duchess’s plight to the US-based People magazine.One said: “After the wedding she wrote him a letter. She’s like, ‘Dad, I’m so heartbroken. I love you. I have one father. Please stop victimising me through the media so we can repair our relationship’.”Look, Thomas Markle is by no means blameless. He did a deal with the paparazzi for staged photos, is clearly given to petulance, has only released the parts of the letter that suit him and, as the parent in this scenario, should be the one to stop this tit-for-tat soap opera and just shut the hell up.But equally, any sympathy one might have felt for Meghan in dealing with her off-message family is evaporating fast in the face of such a blatant PR exercise that has her manicured fingers all over it.One of the friends who spoke out has “let it be known” that the duchess herself knew nothing of them speaking to People magazine.Sorry, but I just don’t buy it. Meghan has form for dropping friends like hot potatoesthey displease her, so the notion that those who remain “close” would speak to the Press — anonymously or otherwise — without approval is, to my mind, utter bunkum.Which leads me to conclude that this was a ham-fisted, Hollywood-esque attempt to try to manipulate Press coverage and put a stop to, as her friends put it, the “global bullying” of The Duchess of Sussex. But it has backfired badly.Yes, plenty of the criticism levelled at Meghan is unfair, and some of it is downright offensive.But as the rest of the Royal Family could tell her, they’ve all suffered their share of brickbats over the years but come through it.How  By earning respect through dutul and consistent hard work, not demanding it early doors via an ill-conceived PR initiative.JENNIFER ANISTON has just celebrated her th birthday.Or “poor Jen” as she’s frequently referred to because she’s single and childless which, obviously, is something to be pitied because marriage and giving birth defines us.Meanwhile, back in the real world, the single le appears to suit the fierce Ms A very well indeed.She says she considered her marriages to be successful, but when the end came: “This is our one le and I would not stay in a situation out of fear. Fear of being alone.“To stay in a marriage based on fear feels like you’re doing your one le a disservice.”She’s right, of course. But moving on is far simpler when you don’t have children together.If you do, then taking the decision to break up the family home is a far tougher one.Because your kids only have “one le” too.NOW US teenager Ethan Lindenberger has turned , he has finally had the MMR vaccination while criticising his “anti-vaxxer” movement parents for refusing to give it to him when he was younger.His mother, Jill Wheeler, who believes that vaccinations cause illnesses such as autism, says his decision is “insulting” and a “slap in the face”.Ethan, from Ohio, did his own research into the jab and commented on social media site Reddit, “God knows how I’m still alive” – presumably a reference to the fact that measles can be deadly.He probably swerved it thanks to all the parents who recognise the need for herd immunity and do have their children vaccinated.PARENTS in America say that regular viewing of children’s TV show Peppa Pig is causing their kids to start speaking in a British accent.Many moons ago, I went to collect my youngest from her first day at nursery and was greeted by an excited young assistant who hailed from Valencia.“I didn’t know your daughter could speak Spanish!”“Neither did I,” I replied.Turns out that rather too much time in front of Dora The Explorer had indeed been educational.LUNG cancer screening units are to be offered in supermarket car parks across the UK in an NHS bid to improve early detection rates.This reminds me of when a mobile cervical cancer screening unit was set up in a Birmingham car park in the s and an elderly lady approached the receptionist.She was directed to a curtained booth, given a smear test, then emerged to declare: “I’ve never had to do this to get a bus pass before.”NETFLIX documentary Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened is proof,needed, that all on Instasham etc is not what it seems.The Fyre festival was the brainchild of US “entrepreneur” Billy McFarland, now serving six years in prison for fraud, aided and abettedby a close coterie of consultants, marketeers, media experts andonline “influencers” who helped sell the dream of an exclusive event on a luxury, Bahamian island to unsuspecting, albeit wealthy punters who turned up to find a nightmare of soggy tents, bad food and no headline acts.Among those who appeared in a promotional video and posted the event’s distinctive “orange tile” to their millions of followers to help drive ticket sales were models Bella Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski.Most notably, model Kendall Jenner was paid an eye-watering , via wire transfer for just one post about it to her million-plus followers.It shows with compelling clarity that while the power of A-list, online influence is real, what’s being promoted can sometimesbe a Grade A dud.So, buyer beware of those “influencers” who only post for favours or cash.They’re just the social media version of the old-fashioned freeloader.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s pretty close to that stage right now.Why has this happened  Because our establishment do not want us to leave. And while they may pay lip service to “respecting the voice of the people”, they don’t remotely mean it. They never did.And so, on the one hand we have establishment voices — Blair, Mandelson, Heseltine — and a growing number of current politicians demanding we must have another vote. Because we got it wrong last time.The European Union has a history of ignoring popular votes and getting countries to run the vote again, after a slew of propaganda about why the people were so wrong.Then, on the other hand, we have a Prime Minister who voted Remain leading our negotiations. And at every stage of the process more and more has been given away.We started from a position of weakness by allowing the EU to dictate the order of the negotiations. So they got to demand things from us — such as extortionate amounts of money — before we even got down to talking about our trading relationship.And at every stage the deal has got weaker. Every time she came back from Brussels, something more had been given away. Until we reach today’s position, where the deal before us isn’t really leaving the EU at all.We’ll still be tied to the customs union for the foreseeable future. We will still have the horrible European Court of Justice telling us what we can and can’t do for another two years.And there are plenty of people who believe that the famous issue of the Northern Ireland backstop is simply an attempt to get us to remain, for ever, inside the customs union.Here’s what I think will happen.Brexit will, in the end, be delayed. And by the time a deal is put before us again — months down the line — it will bear no real resemblance to “leaving the European Union”.And so those of us who have no trust in our liberal establishment, because we know what scant respect it has for democracy, will be able to say: “Told you so. They were never going to let it happen.”Congratulations to young Hartlepool lad Michael Rice for becoming our entrant in the Eurovision Song Contest.He’s singing a ditty called Love Is Really Lovely or something, and will come third from last, just above Kosovo and France.Michael Rice will represent the UK at Eurovision but will probably come third from lastBut bless him, at least he’ll be going.Far left, anti-Semitic bullies have been demanding we boycott the extravaganza because it’s in Israel.A bunch of C-list celebs wrote a letterinsisting we pull out.They said nothing when the contest was held in the repressive Islamic state of Azerbaijan.Good luck, Michael.

The current number is somewhere in the region of  per cent.But still, this is just the BBC trying hard to represent the country as it is, and we shouldn’t complain.In fact, here’s a few more areas where they might try to better represent the country as it is.Pro-Brexit people on political programmes.A majority voted to leave. But remainers outnumber leavers on Question Time and Any Questions by two to one, according to a report by the Institute for Economic Affairs.So how about it, BBC  More leavers on air please – and they can be as camp as a row of tents for all I care.A beautul – and very rare – African black leopard has just been caught on film in Kenya.They haven’t been photographed for more than  years.Its time to stop trophy hunters from bagging rare wild animalsIf I were the leopard, I’d keep my head down a bit.Some smirking gimp from Butthole, Texas, will be out with a gun trying to blow its brains out. In the past week there have been two more horrible, distressing photos of American big-game hunters standing over some poor animal they’ve just shot.One scumbag was looking proud as punch having murdered a baby elephant. Another one shot an extremely rare horned goat. It’s time we sorted these people out.I know what my we is getting me for Valentine’s Day. I’ve seen it.

He said: “Probably very similar to the place reserved for those who designed a monetary union without a proper banking union.“And when the financial crisis hit, cynically transferred the bankers’ gigantic losses on to the shoulders of the weakest taxpayers.”Apparently, people are their most happy when they’re  years old – and .That’s according to a new study.

The truth is that Meghan is not remotely being hunted by photographers and enjoys extraordinary freedoms.The paparazzi do not stalk her like they did the Princess of Wales — although they were often tipped off about where Diana would be.Snappers were told  when she was going for lunch  with a friend, dressed up to the nines, or out for a night on the town in a sizzling frock. She had her favourite writers and her favoured photographers.But the only paparazzi pictures ever to have been published of Meghan were taken when the story first broke that she was romantically linked with Harry.This was a genuine news story. But because their media minders at Kensington Palace refused to issue an official photo of the couple together, they had created a market for one, and every paparazzo was desperate to get the first photo of them together.Since then, in all her public engagements, she has been closely monitored by the Palace Press team. Even her wedding pictures were so tightly controlled that just one Press agency was allowed to photograph the marriage service inside St George’s Chapel in Windsor last May.As a result, Meghan can quite happily live as a semi-private citizen in her palace.She comes and goes when and where she wants, with no photographers following her.We know precious little about the le she and Harry lead in London or at their luxury bolthole in Oxfordshire.Yes, she likes Soho Farmhouse and she writes on bananas — but that’s about it.Like everyone in the public eye, she is trolled on social media. Palace aides supposedly “spend hours” deleting hateful comments — but why bother  Why not simply ignore it  Their PR advisers hope to bypass the traditional media by controlling the photographs and stories they release.Meghan deleted her own social media accounts when she and Harry became engaged.  Perhaps the Royal Family should do the same. Instagram does not equal real le.When The Sun accurately reports about Meghan in fairly harmless stories, their frankly second-rate PR people set lawyers on us.Yet the biggest invasion of her privacy was triggered by Meghan herself, after she gave consent to friends to talk to People magazine in America last week about the awful relationship she has with  her dad.Although there have been stories about the “dficult Duchess” and the fall-out with Kate, most of her problems stem from back home in the USA.Meghan’s father Thomas Markle, her half-sister Samantha — who Meghan says she barely knows — and her cannabis-grower half-brother Thomas Jr, have only ever said disparaging things about the Duchess.I suspect that Meghan knew the letter she sent to her dad last August would be published and she used it to make sure the world knew she was disgusted with the lies being told by her family.Meanwhile, in his bid to “protect” his we, Prince Harry — once the Press photographers’ favourite among the royals —  has gone from hero to zero in his relationship with the media.I have asked twice for Meghan to meet Britain’s royal correspondents but so far it has not happened. If she did, I am sure her profile would improve.Despite being surrounded by great wealth and privilege, the young royals seem to have been seduced by the cult of victimhood.Harry talked about his anxiety and stress and Meghan is a victim of “global bullying” — whatever that means.Meghan really needs to lighten up. So does Harry.The pair of them should look across the road at Harry’s father, the Prince of Wales, and his lovely we Camilla, who has had more hostile Press coverage than any other member of  the Royal Family, including Diana.But they just worked harder and harder to win people over, and Camilla’s approval rating is now sky high and she will certainly be our Queen.Every job I have been on with Meghan she has been the star of the show. She engages brilliantly with people and is a true royal star.My main hope is that this phoney war with the media — that they started and which has now been  intensied by their friend Clooney — comes to an end before the Press loses interest.Newspapers and websites could, after all, simply stop covering Harry and Megan’s engagements, which I’m not sure would please either of them.So stick to acting, George, because there is no part for you in this royal soap opera.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So British workers, who earn an average of £, a year, are each getting richer by £ a week, every week.Not that you may have heard the good news on inflation and real wages.As ever, it was drowned out by the relentless drone of bad news stories, all trying to convince us that Britain is in an economic crash, caused by Brexit.In this fictional version of Britain’s economic health we are all getting poorer. Factories are closing like never before and jobs are drting away to the rest of the EU.Yesterday, for example, thegave prominence to a claim by a member of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, Gertjan Vlieghe, that Brexit is already costing us £million a week.It was fantasy, based on Mr Vlieghe’s guess that the economy would have been two per cent larger had we not voted to leave the EU.Why should anyone believe him when the Bank of England’s economic forecasters have such a terrible record A month before the  referendum, the bank’s governor, Mark Carney, predicted Britain could fall into a “technical recession”we voted to leave.It didn’t happen — or even come close to happening.Then on Wednesday, Carney stunned many with a speech saying Brexit could usher in a golden era of “international co-operation and crossborder commerce” and even that it could be a springboard to a “new global order” of free trade.It is true that economic growth in Britain is sluggish by historical standards, but then it has been ever since the economic crash of  .But at . per cent growth in the past three months, it is outpacing Germany, where the economy was static over the same period. Italy is in recession.It is more than six years since Britain saw the economy shrink over the course of three months, and more than nine years since the economy shrank by more than two quarters in a row — the official definition of a recession.We might not be booming, in other words, but we have gone a remarkably long period without a bust.As for jobs, the unemployment rate has fallen to four per cent — the lowest since the first three months of .Employment, however, is far higher than it was then.We are in the middle of a jobs miracle, yet you would never guess this from listening to many news bulletins.Last week, we never heard the end of it when Nissan announced that it would not, after all, be building its new X-Trail model in Sunderland. You had to read a little more deeply to realise that not a single job is being lost at Britain’s Nissan plants and that the X-Trail is only being dropped because European consumers have turned against diesel.In France, by the way, the unemployment rate is . per cent and in Italy it is . per cent. So much for the notion that the Eurozone economy is powering ahead while Brexit Britain lags behind.Ever since the referendum, the economy has defied the doom-mongers. The past month has been no exception.The High Street was predicted to be a bloodbath. Yet several large chains, including Next, Dunelm and Pets At Home, reported strongly rising sales in the weeks up to Christmas.We have continued shopping after Christmas, too. Consumer spending in January was . per cent higher than a year earlier, according to Barclaycard.The stock market and housing market have both failed to crash, as many predicted they would. In fact, the FTSE  is up seven per cent this year.House prices, according to the Government’s index, are up . per cent over the past  months. That’s no rampant boom, but it is certainly nowhere near a crash.The one thing on which economists were right was that the Pound would fall after a Brexit vote.It is  per cent lower than in early .That is bad newsyou are going on a foreign holiday. Butyou have a job in a company which exports goods or services, it is a pretty good thing.By increasing exports and decreasing imports, the lower Pound is helping to reduce Britain’s trade deficit.In  we imported £billion more in goods and services than we exported. In  the deficit grew to £billion. But by , once the lower Pound had taken effect, it was £billion. However former Brexit Secretary David Davis was wrong when he pinned hopes this week of a sizeable, long-term export boost on a devaluation of the Pound.Brexit success depends on cutting taxes, trade barriers and regulatory burdens, just as Singapore has done.No matter how positive the economic data, however, there are many Remainers who simply will not accept that the economy is not crashing.They want that to happen because they want to be proved right. It is surprising the relentless tales of doom have not caused a recession by destroying consumers’ confidence.If we had taken notice of what the Eeyores were trying to tell us about economic collapse and stopped spending, recession would have become a self-fulfilling prophecy.Evidently, British consumers have the good sense to see the forecasts of doom as the anti-Brexit propaganda that they are.The economy is not roaring ahead, but strip away the gloomy headlines and there is more good news than bad.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What shes done doesnt portray Islam in a good light.”While her family pleas for compassion the teen shows no sign of repentance.During interviews she even called herself “weak” for leaving ISIS and praised those who stayed to fight with the death cult.Meanwhile critics are furious at the thought of her picking up her le at home in Bethnal Green, East London.Security minister Ben Wallace said British lives will not be risked trying to rescue the jihadi bride.He added thatshe does make it back to the UK she will face prosecution “at the very least”.Mr Wallace said today: “Shes a British citizen, she has rights. Thats the reality of it. Its not about me or anyone  saying you cant come.“You have rights. But you know, dont be surprised by what reception you get when you come back when it comes to investigations and law enforcement.”Ex UKIP leader turned LBC radio host Nigel Farage was also among those calling for the government to stop Begum ing to Britain.He fumed: “This woman shows no remorse for her actions, remains a committed jihadist and is totally unsuitable to come into our country.”Begum made the plea toto the UK after telling reporters she could give birth “any day now”.Her pregnancy comes after her first two children died of starvation and illness, with Begum hoping the baby can have a decent le with her in the UK.Speaking to a Times reporter who tracked her down she said: Im scared this baby is going to get sick in this camp.Thats why I really want to get back to Britain.Because I know it will be taken care of, healthwise at least.And she calmly revealed that the first time she saw a severed head “didn’t faze me at all”.She revealed she had been married to a Dutch fighter and but now believes she is a widow.But shockingly just one in ten have been prosecuted for direct action theyve carried out in Syria.Around  per cent of the  Brits believed to have travelled to Syria or Iraq have died.The Home Office says every person who s is questioned by police and an assessment made over whether they are a threat to Britain.However few have been prosecuted.The Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Bill is currently going through Parliament, after its third reading in the House of Lords.This could make travelling abroad to join terror groups an offence which carries a penalty of ten years in prison.Security Minister Ben Wallace said: The UK advises against all travel to Syria and parts of Iraq. Anyone who does travel to these areas, for whatever reason, is putting themselves in considerable danger.Everyone who s from taking part in the conflict in Syria or Iraq must expect to be investigated by the police to determinethey have committed criminal offences, and to ensure that they do not pose a threat to our national security.There are a range of terrorism offences where iniduals can be convicted for crimes committed overseas and we can also use Temporary Exclusion Orders to control an inidualsto the UK.She added: “I know what everyone at home thinks of me as I have read all that was written about me online. But I just want to come home to have my child. I’ll do anything required just to be able to come home and live quietly with my child.”Discussing what made her walk away from the embattled village of Baghuz, Begum described herself as “weak” for leaving ISIS and praised those brave enough to stay.She added: “In the end, I just could not endure anymore.

Her parents are from Bangladesh — raising the bar to re-entry here.Other alternatives could see the teen prosecuted in her absence for being in a designated terror area — or to allow her tobut under heavy monitoring.Critics today argued Begums lack of remorse shows she is a danger to Britain.Dr Kim Howells, a former Foreign Office and Counter-Terrorism Minister under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, said: She sounds to be completely unrepentant, she sounds cynical, she said she wasnt phased by the sight of these heads in a bin as she described it.

It repeats endlessly that the withdrawal agreement is closed and that it isn’t going to reopen it.When the Brady amendment passed the House of Commons, saying Parliament would accept the dealthe backstop was replaced, the EU responded by saying they didn’t think this Parliament majority was “stable”.Thursday night’s vote helps them make that argument.As one No source laments: “We don’t want to give the Europeans a chance not to engage with us.”I understand that when the Brexit Secretary, Steve Barclay, dined in Brussels this week Sabine Weyand — the EU’s deputy negotiator — spent her time telling him that a customs union was the only major change available to the backstop.The EU think that Corbyn’s support for it means that a customs union could pass Parliament. I am told Barclay attempted to disabuse them of this idea.Mrs May can’t entirely escape blame for this week’s fiasco.No should have made sure that its own MPs were happy with the wording before publishing the motion.“She’s like a football team that can’t string two wins together,” complains one minister.But the Tory Brexit ultras should have paid more heed to the real-world consequences of their actions.Another effect of Thursday night’s defeat for the Government is that it increases the chances of the Cooper amendment passing on February .This would compel the Government to seek an extension to Article Mrs May hasn’t won Parliament’s support for an exit deal by March .One Cabinet minister, with close links to several of the ministers who might quit to ensure this amendment goes through, tells me it is now “much more likely” to pass.This Secretary of State complains that the Government’s defeat “makes it harder to make the argument that we should hold our nerve” as “the best evidence for holding your nerve was that the outcome would be the same as when the Brady amendment went through”.Another minister warns: “If she doesn’t come back with something cooking by the th, there’ll be trouble.”I understand those around Mrs May know they need to have shown progress by the th.One insider tells me: “If the Government doesn’t want Parliament to take control, they need to have a plan.They can’t just sit there for two weeks.”Other Cabinet ministers aren’t so sure Cooper will pass.One tells me: “I don’t think the ministers will resign, andthey don’t resign, then it doesn’t pass.”If Cooper does go through, politics will enter into an even more unpredictable phase. One May Cabinet ally is predicting a general electionthis happens.But it is hard to see how a general election could end in anything other than disaster for the Tories in these circumstances.If Mrs May is forced to ask the EU for an extension but with no Parliamentary agreement in sight, the EU is more likely to offer a long extension than a short one.I understand the view in several EU capitals is that the longer the extension, the more likely it is that the political dynamics in the UK will change.But a long extension would prolong this damaging, political uncertainty.This Government, and this Parliament’s, job is to get Brexit done. Time is running short. Both Parliament and the Government need to get their act together.But it may well be because the NHS – traditionally Labour’s strongest suit – is not the most important issue in politics right now.But that number is down to  per cent this winter, according to the pollster Ipsos Mori.The question now is whether the Tory decision to spend an extra £billion a year on the health service by  leads to a decline in public concern.But in January AE departments recorded their worst waiting times since the figures started being collected in .Matt Hancock, the new Health Secretary, is setting up a new NHS-X unit to try to bring the health service into the digital era, which would help the NHS to better use its resources.There are many things the Tories have to do to win the next election – not least, deliver Brexit – but they must also reassure voters on the NHS.Butthey can be ed they should be subject to the full force of the law.Justice must be done and must be seen to be done.Churchill wouldn’t have been Prime Minister but for the Labour Party’s willingness to serve in a government led by him.When it came to the crucial decision to fight on in , Clement Attlee and Arthur Greenwood, two Labour members of the War Cabinet, were more solid than some of Churchill’s Tory colleagues.But Attlee and Greenwood came from a very dferent Labour tradition to McDonnell: They weren’t Marxists or Trotskyists.There are some Labour MPs who are just not prepared to try to put into power people who are so outside the traditional bounds of the party.One minister likens the coming Tory leadership race to the  Grand National, when a crowded field led to a pile-up at the rd fence and the victory of the - outsider Foinavon.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But say anything against our th-century Boudiccaand you’re a commie, or a Poundland Lenin as Churchill’s grandson Nicholas Soames called the Shadow Chancellor. In Britain, our history has always been written from a perspective that defines the ruling class being heroic and everyone  being incidental. Deviate from that line and you’re committing treason. Yet that is precisely what is frequently committed when the same establishment creates heroes, in our name, through the honours system.

Single mum Elysia Downings can make up to pound, a year and says the job has made her the happiest she’s ever been.The -year-old, from Buxton in Derbyshire, charges punters pound. a minute to watch her get her kit off and perform ious erotic acts online. She has around  subscribers, with some loyal fans dishing out thousands of pounds to see her private broadcasts from her bedroom. And she admits you’ve “got to have a sense of humour”you want to do it. “You need to let go and not have any worries. It’s all in our heads,” she said.   In just one week, Elysia, who has a six-year-old son, earned pound, in the run-up to Christmas. On average, she aims to make pound a day for two to three hours work – and this is on top of the income she makes from her online lingerie and sex toy shop, Betsy Boudoir. Despite earning around pound, a month - after the camming sites take a percentage - the mum says she does not live a le of luxury and is careful with her money having been in debt before. She shuns designer clothes for high street clobber and is always on the lookout for a bargain and reduced sticker items. “I’m saving as much money as possible,” she said. “Hopefully I am going to retire by the time I’m , which by that time my son will be , so I can enjoy le and not have to worry about work.” She first dipped her toe into the webcam waters last year after seeing an article and signed up to agency, Off the Record Models. Surprisingly some of her clients are usually more interested in talking and want a ‘girlfriend experience’ – not anything sexual. But Elysia will still be wearing stockings and lingerie that are “revealing but leave something to the imagination”. This includes lacy black babydolls or red bodysuits so she can ‘channel her inner Pamela Anderson.’  She said: “At first it took a little while to build up the clients, but I love the freedom it gives me. “It’s just like any business you get out what you put in. “And I really don’t think it’s all to do with attractiveness. It’s just about being a businesswoman – and I’ve had years of practise seducing men.” It takes Elysia around  minutes to get glammed up before getting in front of the camera, but most of this time is spent putting on her wig, which helps her “adopt a persona.” Her oddest request was from a man with a wet and messy fetish, also known as sploshing. He asked her to watch people getting gunged on Noel’s House Party - the s BBC comedy show hosted by Noel Edmonds, which propelled Mr Blobby to fame. She knows of another webcam girl with a client who has a fetish for being eaten – known as vorarephilia – and he pretended to be a Jaffa Cake while she ‘ate him’. Elysia has been single for three years andshe were to get into a new relationship, she admits it would be a tricky situationfaced with an ultimatum to quit her webcam career.  “I thinkI was in love and I had a way of being able to make that amount of money then it would be no issue,” she admitted. Elysia’s family and her son’s father are all aware and supportive of her career choice as they “can see how happy” she is. They were initially concerned about her safety, but she made it clear it was not like escorting and she wouldn’t be meeting men face-to-face. All her son knows is “mummy sells underwear” which he finds funny – but she is not naiumlve to the fact he will one day discover the other side of her career. She said: “I don’t want him to get bullied, but kids will get bullied for anything these days. My mum was a lesbian and I got a lot of stick for that. “The only thing I can do is raise him to not care what people think and it doesn’t matter. There is even more of a stigma about being in this industry as a mother, she added. I feel that women should be allowed to express their sexuality freely regardless of whether or not they are a mother.   “I don’t mind what other people think of me. I don’t need the validation and that’s what I want to teach him.” Elysia considers herself a shrewd businesswoman – although as a young girl she pictured herself one day being a journalist and editingCosmopolitan magazine. Sheleft school with seven A*s in her GCSEs and says her IQ score was in the top five per cent of the country. But after going through a dficult period in her le, Elysia left college and took on ious jobs such as working in shops or as a cleaner. But she knew she wasn’t fulfilling her potential and felt miserable. However, she finally feels like she has hit the jackpot and found a job she loves, which also makes herfeel sexually empowered. “I love doing it, I feel free and liberated - and I do feel powerful,” she said. “It’s been so good for my confidence, especially after having a baby and stretchmarks – I’ve learnt to accept my body. “I know people will judge me regardless, but I am the happiest I’ve ever been.”  Meanwhile, fellow webcam girl Sophia has lted the lid on what it’s like to secretly moonlight as an adult entertainer. As she buttons up her crisp white shirt and slips on a black skirt and heels she looks just like any other office worker.But the -year-old isnt going to be sitting behind a desk all day, instead shes about to perform in front of a webcam as a dominatrix from the comfort of her own bedroom. Punters fork out hundreds of pounds to see Sophia fulfil their fantasies through a computer screen.She can make up to pound a week pocket money to top up her salary working in the hospitality industry. Sophia, from London, wants her real identity to be kept shrouded in secrecy for fear her family may find out. And she is among thousands of women leading a double le as a webcam girl behind closed doors. The flexibility is the best thing about the job, she admitted. And when the money is good, its very good. Sophias go-to role play is to be a sexy secretary who needs to punish her workers. Her clients, who often chose not to show themselves on their own webcam, revel at the thought of being controlled. I get a lot of people who want me to be their boss, Sophia revealed.  I will give them an appraisal, or monthly appraisal, and say their performance is not very good and they are going to have to be punished. I will then go on to say how I am going to spank them. Sophia, who can earn as little as pound a day or as much as pound, gets paid by the minute so she uses a iety of tactics to keep her viewer online for as long as possible. She does not want to ulge the nitty gritty details but added: Its a job and light-hearted fun. Some people can be derogatory but its the nature of the work.” She advertises her service on the CamNClimaxxx website, where women create a profile under dferent categories, including housewives, redheads, college girls and many others too explicit forto publish. Each woman lists what they offer and what they like. The client will then log in to a chat with the girl and the fantasies can begin.  Sophia, who is single and describes herself as a normal size , said: I offer domination and other things such as striptease. But I always stay clothed. You get a lot of fetish requests like people wanting to be dominated or people who want you to be sexy. Its a fantasy. Every request is dferent, and every person has dferent likes. Like Elyshia, Sophia said her weirdest request was from someone who wanted her to be gunged like on a TV quiz show, so she duly obliged by pouring water all over herself. Nobody - not even close friends - know about Sophias career and she is terried by the thought either they or her colleagues could find out. Its the stigma around it, she said. You can do things to disguise yourself like using wigs, but there is always the possibility that someone you know will see you.” Sophia has been doing it now on and off for  years to fit around her day job. However she plans to quit later this year as her hospitality career looks set to take off. I was nervous the first time I did it, she said. Then it becomes normal to you. “I find it fun and it does make me feel confident.” "},{"url":null,"title":"el chapo law agent tells","story":"NewsEl Chapo: Law agent tells of obsession that led him to stop drug lordAmericas top drugs cop Jack Riley was set to retire before Mexicos notorious cartel boss escaped prison - and once that happened, the hunt was onShareCommentsByChristopher Bucktin:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsEl Chapo \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAfter a letime of service to his shycountry, Jack Riley sat in his corner office overlooking the Pentagon planning a retirement playing golf. As number two in America’s Drug Enforcement Administration, he had led the most successful operations in the agency’s history. The target of his obsessions were either dead or safely put away. But then in July , Riley’s nemesis, Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, escaped. While being held in Mexico’s supposed maximum security Altiplano prison, the leader of the murderous Sinaloa Cartel – the world’s biggest drug-trafficking shyorganisation – fled through a mile-long tunnel built under his cell before riding away to freedom on a makesht motorbike. “I was going to retire until this d*** escaped,” Riley said.   Chapo had been his white whale, the object of an infatuation that sidelined shyeverything , including his family. “I love my we and kid, but I was never home for dinner,” said Riley. What followed was a very personal shyfour-year mission that this week ended with Chapo being put behind bars on US soil for le – and Riley finally retired. After a three-month trial in New York, jurors found the Mexican guilty on all  charges after six days of deliberation. They convicted the near legendary cartel boss of operating a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiracy to launder narcotics proceeds, international distribution of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and other drugs, and use of firearms.   He faces le in a “supermax” American jail in Florence, Colorado, known as the “Alcatraz of the Rockies” alongside Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, British shoe bomber Richard Reid and   conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui. The verdict brought a welcome end to Riley’s decades-long hunt for America’s most wanted man, who once offered an pound, bounty to anyone who brought him the DEA agent’s decapitated head. It is a fact Riley, , admits not only scared him but also “p***ed” him off. In , Riley was handed a transcript of a conversation wiretapped by his staff. It eavesdropped on Chapo’s men negotiating a price to kill him. “I saw a transcript, and it basically said, ‘What do you think Chapo would give us to shut him up and cut his head off.’ “The joke is, they talked about only , , which p***ed me off.  “What bothers me the most is I did exactly what that d*** wanted me to do. I got scared, and I started looking over my shoulder. And that’s what he intended.” Riley is the son of a hospital shypathologist and a nurse, and grew up in Chicago. His first jobs with the DEA had him working undercover as a s yuppie making cocaine deals. But he soon realised he wanted bigger fish – those who ran the operations. As he worked his way up through the ranks, he became involved in combating the Colombia drug trade, helping bring down Pablo Escobar in Medelliacuten and catch the leaders of the Cali cartel. Then when during the early s Chapo announced himself to the world by executing dozens of rivals and decapitating several Mexican cops, Riley’s interested piqued. “The images were seared into my soul. I never forgot the brutality or the name,” Riley said. Plus Chapo showed a gt for logistics no other cartel could match. At one point, he was called “El Rapido” because of his ability to move drugs from Mexico into the States within  hours. “Guzman was the most business-savvy son of a bitch who ever ran a criminal shyorganisation,” Riley said. His obsession with Chapo helped him become the head of the El Paso DEA office covering nearly one-third of the US-Mexico border. Upon his arrival, Riley made known his sole intention was “to get El Chapo under control”. His display of defiance did not go shyunnoticed. A sign reading, “Welcome Jack Reilly [sic]” was hung off a bridge just across the border in Mexico.  Weeks later as he drove along a deserted road, Chapo sent his men to give a warning. Riley was pursued at speeds of up to mph before he got out of his car, gun drawn expecting a firefight. But his pursuers shyinexplicably then sped off. Their job, however, was done. “That whole thing was just to scare the s*** out of me,” Riley said. However it only served to further cement his resolve. “I got p***ed off and said, ‘It’s either him or me,’” said Riley. “I’m a stubborn old Irish cop from Chicago. I’d put my money on me.” Despite a move back to his hometown, Riley refused to let his hunt for Chapo die. He began building a case in the Windy City targeting local gangs who worked for the cartel boss to stop the streets flooding with heroin. Under one roof Riley brought together the DEA, FBI, state troopers and police to chase the “choke-point guys” – the brokers who were buying in bulk from Chapo before then selling it on to the gangs. It opened huge resources to him including shywiretapping local criminals’ phones. “What really stands out is how stupid all these guys were,” Riley said. “On one call, [a dealer] is talking to Chapo’s guys in Mexico, and he says he thinks the ‘three letters’ [DEA] are onto us. So the guy says, ‘Don’t call me at this number anymore.’ Then he gives out his new number. We laughed our ass off in the office.”  Operation Strike Force was a huge success. Arrests and seizures rose, local drug lords fell and the busts netted millions in cash forfeitures. In , Chicago named Chapo Public Enemy No – and the fallout from Riley’s move surprised everyone, him included. The Mexican government was bombarded with calls from enraged shybusiness leaders demanding the drug lord’s arrest. “They screamed that Chapo was disgracing their country,” Riley said. Authorities in Mexico immediately changed their approach, offering new levels of shycooperation. They pledged to hunt down Chapo in the hills and working hand in glove with the DEA they closed in on him. US intelligence began shymonitoring the phones of those around him, so Chapo ordered his henchmen to dispose of their burner phones regularly, but many got lazy and didn’t. The US also used drones to carry out surveillance of suspected hideouts, hoping to snap an image of Chapo. The method led to several close calls – in one raid, Chapo escaped through a tunnel hidden beneath his bathtub – and shyultimately his capture in . A year after Riley’s announcement, they chased him to Mazatlaacuten and arrested him, without resistance, in his hotel room. A few months after his capture, however, Chapo was gone through that mile-long tunnel from his Mexican prison cell.  Although only ft ins, the drug lord compensated for his short stature as a giant in the Mexican underworld. He paid a reported poundmillion in costs and bribes to officials to remove more than , tonnes of earth to escape. It all added to the myth of El Chapo. “One of the reasons he’s been successful is he’s used the media. There are folk songs written about him,” Riley said. “There is the Robin Hood theory that he builds soccer fields and water purication. I’ve never seen any evidence of that, but he tries to paint himself that way. The only thing I know is he’s a stone-faced killer.” Riley, by now second in command at the DEA, had flown down a few days earlier to noty Mexican officials that Chapo was planning to escape. The alarm went ignored.  Then in late , they got another break. Officials suspected Chapo was heading to Los Mochis, a coastal town in Sinaloa. Surveillance images showed building crews reinforcing the front door on one house, and locals were overheard saying, “Papi is coming.” In the end, “burritos and porn are what did him in,” Riley said. It was January , when Mexican shyofficials saw a van leaving from a safe house late at night. Inside the vehicle, one of the men looked like Chapo. “They were going out for burritos and porn – who  would need both at that hour ” said Riley. After watching him , the Mexican marines moved in. Chapo escaped through the sewer and emerged, carjacking a driver before finally being apprehended. He was extradited to the US in .Riley, who is now retired, is happy his nemesis is facing le behind bars afterhis conviction.He has no love or admiration for Chapo. “He was on top for  years, has billions of dollars hidden – and he’s a second-grade dropout who can barely read and write and has to dictate love letters in prison. Explain it to me, ’cause I don’t get it. How did this f***ing mope become El Chapo ” Riley said. But sadly such was his business acumen that the drug lord has left a deadly legacy. Riley said: “All those routes he opened, all that fentanyl he shipped – he’s gonna kill our kids for years to come. This monster he built, it’s too big to fail now, thanks to him.” Fling Penn in jail for cartel bosss escape The cop credited with capturing Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman says Hollywood star Sean Penn should be in prison for allowing the drug lord to escape arrest. As Jack Riley, his DEA team and elite Mexican marines were poised to arrest the fugitive kingpin in October  in a rugged mountain hideout in his birthplace of La Tuna, their mission had to be aborted when the Oscar-winning actor suddenly appeared.  Just as the order was about to be given to move in, Penn and Kate del Castillo, a Mexican soap opera actress who had praised Chapo online, bizarrely arrived at the compound. The pair had arranged to met Chapo in secret for a film about his le before the Dead Man Walking star then published a gushing interview with the cartel boss in Rolling Stone magazine. Fearing the civilians would be caught in the crossfire, commanders ordered the marines to stand down. It gave Chapo the chance to escape. Riley, who inspired Breaking Bad’s Hank Schrader, is furious Penn has not faced prosecution. “Oh, my God. If I could get my hands on Sean Penn,” Riley said. “The people he put at risk because of that stunt. He should be in jail.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum mowed down cyclist after","story":"NewsMum who took five or six bags of cocaine with vodka at party lost consciousness at wheel before mowing down cyclistSingle mum-of-four Kelly Sumner, , from Chorley in Lancashire, was  times over the drug-drive limit when she ploughed into respected IT consultant Stephen Derbyshire leaving him brain damagedShareCommentsByHannah Dawson:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsKelly Sumner has been jailed for three years \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum who had taken five or six bags of cocaine  along with vodka and cider at a party lost consciousness at the wheel of her car before ploughing into a grandfather on a bike ride.

Mr Derbyshire was treated by an off-duty nurse, a midwe and an off-duty surgeon, one of whom gave him CPR. A witness described seeing a bone protruding from Mr Derbyshires skin. He was taken by helicopter to Preston Royal Infirmary, the court heard.  Mr Derbyshire had to have blood drained from his chest which had to be drained was left with bruising to the brain and suffered multiple spine fractures. His we Patricia submitted an emotional statement to the court, in which she said she has had to become his full time carer. Mr Derbyshire now needs -hour supervision as he gets disorientated, the court heard. His daughter Leah choked up reading the statement on her mothers behalf. On June , , our lives were changed by a selfish, reckless act, she said. The defendant chose to take drugs and get behind a wheel. My husband did not have a choice. There is nothing that Stephen loves more than being at home with his family but this has been taking from him so cruelly. We feel as though we have been taken away from him. He has repeatedly said that he is not the man that I married.   We are at a time in our lives where we should be making plans for the future, now everything hangs in the balance. At one point he told me that he wanted to end his own le. She added: The defendant can leave here today and move on, but this will never change for us. None of us will ever be the same again. Mr Derbyshire, a grandfather to two young children, has to be helped sitting up, showering and dressing. Medics dont knowhell ever fully recover or be able to work again. Sumner, a cleaner, wept in the dock as the letter was read out.   In mitigation, Jon Close said Sumner had no previous convictions and that she was a single mother to four children, aged five to . Judge Timothy Stead condemned Sumners irresponsibility and disregard for safety. She was sentenced to three years for causing serious bodily harm by dangerous driving. She was also banned from the road. I am completely satisfied that the combination of fatigue and intoxication caused her to become unconscious whilst driving, Judge Stead said. The Derbyshire family said in a statement: If anything can come from this, we hope that this prosecution will deter anyone tempted to drive under the influence so that no family has to go through what we have had to over the last eight months.

Niki Shaw, , was once a size  and was forced to wear a mens unorm at work as she was too large for the ladies sizes.“I only took the kids abroad for the first time in , the mum of three told the HullLive .I would never go before and it wasn’t because I couldn’t afford it - I just didn’t want to get shown up.” The west Hull mum said that was missing out on experiences with her family due to her weight. “We used to go on holiday to Scotland a lot with the kids and my husband would say ‘shall we go up this mountain ’   “I’d stay down the bottom with the dog and you miss out on things, she added. It was a health scare that kicked started Mrs Shaws incredible transformation, when she realised her size and thyroid issues could lead to other complications. Mrs Shaw revealed it was her husband who urged her to ask the doctor about sleep apnea during her thyroid check - a suggestion that she initially viewed as laughable. “I said ‘don’t be stupid, I’m .’ The doctor asked me five questions and she said answer and I will tell you at the end. I answered and she said she was going to have to send me for further tests. “I said you are not putting me in a mask at night at . I’ve got three kids and when you look at things like thyroid there is a greater chance of diabetes and cancer. This was the jolt that she needed to get into shape. Mrs Shaw said she knew that she needed to do this andshe was going to do it [she] had to grab the bull by the horns.”   After that Mrs Shaw joined WeightWatchers, determined to get into shape. The west Hull woman revealed that initially she struggled to shed the pounds, but it was her group’s coach, Jo Barr, that spurred her onto stop her from falling off the wagon. “Jo would text me and say ‘don’t give in.’ Some people lose nine pounds in the first week but that’s not realistic for everyone. For me in the first weeks it was only a pound and then it was half a pound when everyone  was losing a stone in a month. “I would be luckyI lost two and a half pounds but after a couple or months I had gone on holiday and I was still big but I lost one and a half stone. By tweaking her diet and hitting the gym, Mrs Shaws weightloss began to pick up speed. Now she spends six days per week in the gym and has changed her routine so she can get up earlier to keep healthy. “I used to come home from work andI sat down I would be asleep. Usually, I would come in, cook the kids’ dinner then fall asleep and wake up at pm. “I didn’t get a good night’s sleep and that caused a knock on effect. I would hit snooze until the very last moment I had to get up.  I used to get everything ready the night before so I could get out of bed at the very last minute but now I’m up in the mornings as early as .am because I’m at the gym and when I’m not I’m up at .am. The mum of three said that she eats three meals a day, changing her portion control to bring her diet into line. “I don’t snack anymore, You can - and I still can have crisps and chocolate but for me they are the things I used to turn to for comfort and I would eat them in secret, she added. Mrs Shaw did not say exactly how much she now weighs, but she did reveal that she has dropped from a size  to a size  since she started her weightloss journey. Now, she describes herself as more confident and has gained a supportive circle of friends. “I never would have worn a dress because I would never have really gone shopping, she said. “I no longer have to buy things that cover me - I can buy fitted dresses and I was never able to do that. “It has changed my le because I’m not stuck in all the time. I would have gone to work, come home, sorted the kids’ dinner out and gone to bed - that was my routine. “Now I can be selfish. The kids can make their own meals so they can look after themselves and I think it’s good to be selfish. This is my time now and I want to put time and effort into me.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mystery sad dog abandoned beach","story":"NewsMystery of sad dog abandoned on beach with Valentines Day balloon solvedOne visitor to Langland Bay in Swansea said it looked like \"a Disney movie, with a lonely prince trying to find his princess\"ShareCommentsByLaura ClementsAmber Hicks:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video owner-gordon-sad-dog-spotted-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe mystery surrounding a dog found abandoned on a beach with an I love you balloon tried to him has been solved. Fears had been raised by walkers over the sad pooch after they spotted him alone on Langland Bay in Swansea on Valentines Day. It was a scene that couldnt fail to melt even the hardest of hearts, especially when the lovelorn figure got up and strolled towards the rocks, trailing his balloon sadly behind him. Some passersby believed he may have been stood up by his Valentines date - others feared something more sinister may have happened to his owner, reports Wales Online .   However, it has now emerged the dog is an English Pointer named Gordon - born in Turkey and adopted by a family in Wales. He is in fact a local celebrity who has his own Facebook page named Gordons Tails My Le in Wales , Gordon, who has cancer, is spending his final days showered with love by his Welsh family, who rescued him after he had spent almost all his le abused or in a shelter home. And he couldnt fail to catch the attention of visitors to the beach yesterday as he ran in the sand with the Valentines balloon flying behind him. Joann Randles, who was on the beach with her partner for a late-afternoon walk, took his photo as he wandered up and down the beach.   We started off in Caswell Bay and walked over to Langland, where there happened to be a dog with a balloon tied to its collar all on its own, she said. We didnt think anything of it, but he looked so sad, I took his picture. The couple continued to walk across the bay, and as they walked back, the dog was still there. Miss Randles added: There were other dogs on the beach with their owners, and he went over to seemingly try and play with them, but they all ran off. That was when we realised he didnt seem to have anyone with him, like an owner or anything.   It looked like a Disney movie, with a lonely prince trying to find his princess. The dog hung around on the beach until Miss Randle left just before pm. But for the rest of the evening, she couldnt help wonderinghe ever did find someone who loved him. It was cute at the time, but it played on my mind when I got home, said the -year-old. Where were his owners  He looked so forlorn with his droopy face, and it being Valentines Day, it seemed ironic. I cant help wonderinghe did ever find a date or a friend. Gordons owners confirmed he was perfectly happy - although a bit mfed off he had to wear a balloon.   Writing on behalf on Gordon, Jayne Lambe posted on the poochs Facebook page: So today is Valentines Day,a day to spoil and cherish your loved one.

James Defalco was sentenced to  months after breaching court orders which meant he must tell any woman he meets that he is HIV positive. The order was first made in  when he infected an -year-old woman with the virus after having sex with her. Since then Defalco has breached the Sexual Offences Prevention Orderand Sexual Harm Prevention Orderon ious occasions. Those orders banned him for engaging in sex with anyonehe had not told them he was HIV positive, and associating with children under  in a public or private place. Yesterday Judge Paul Cook jailed him for a total of  months. Defalco met his latest victim after setting up a profile on the dating website Plenty of Fish. He told his victim she looked lovely and he met the woman and visited her and her family on four occasions.   Judge Paul Cook said: You engaged in sexual activity with her which involved intimate kissing. The sexual activity was intimate but it fell short of penile penetration. The judge said he also played with her two-year-old great granddaughter, bouncing her up and down on his knees and playing with her toys. He said he infected the -year-old woman with HIV when he was  and in  he had a sexual relationship with a -year-old woman. Prosecutor Mary McCarthy said Defalco has a long history of offending including violence, dishonesty and sexual offences. In  he breached the orders four times when he undertook work for an elderly lady. In  after he was freed from jail he associated with a vulnerable female family member. In  he breached it by going to Guernsey with a woman with whom he had unprotected sex. And again in  he befriended a woman who had children. Exeter Crown Court said his police offender manager investigated last September that Defalco had begun a relationship with a -year-old woman in Brixham, Devon.   Miss McCarthy said: It quickly developed into a relationship but not a sexual one. They were close quite quickly and there was kissing and sexual touching. She had not been informed he was HIV positive. Defalco was arrested but told police he had informed the woman of his HIV status. And he said their relationship was a friendly one where he pecked her on the cheek - and denied it was a sexual relationship. Kevin Hopper, defending, said: There is a theme here of the same old offences committed time and time again. The terms of the order have been made crystal clear to him. He said Defalco, of Brixham, Devon, claims the chances of passing on his viral infection are zero. Mr Hopper said: He does not consider himself a sex offender. The order is an albatross around his neck. He said-year-old Defalco discloses his sexual status to anyone it marks the end of the relationship before it has started. Defalco admitted breaching the SOPO in October  and breaching the SHPO in January . The judge told him: You have persistently breached the order since . The public are entitled to protection because you have infected someone in the past. He said Defalco had retreated from the last relationship just as police began investigating him.

Ms Begum said she understood the controversy and intense media scrutiny ato the UK would bring, but said she did not want to be separated from her child. However she may allow her and the baby to be parted -it went to her family back in the UK. Speaking to The Times at a refugee camp in northern Syria, she said: What do you think will happen to my child  Because I dont want it to be taken away from me, or at leastit is, to be given to my family.   She also said she had been taken to hospital after having contractions following her arrival at the refugee camp, and could give birth any day. The pregnant -year-old was tracked down by the newspaper four years after she travelled to Syria as a -year-old to join Islamic State, and she told how she would do anything required just to be able to come home and live quietly with my child. Her case has been the subject of intense debate over what should happen to the teenager. In a statement issued to ITV News, her family urged the Government to help herto Britain to protect the welfare of her baby.   Given Shamimas four-year ordeal, we are concerned that her mental health has been affected by everything that she has seen and endured, they said. Now, we are faced with the situation of knowing that Shamimas two young children have died - children that we will never come to know as a family. This is the hardest of news to bear. The welfare of Shamimas unborn baby is of paramount concern to our family, and we will do everything within our power to protect that baby who is entirely blameless in these events.  Ms Begum told The Times she understood she could face a police investigation on her , admitting: I knew that coming back to the UK wouldnt be a quiet thing. Its uncomfortable. If I ever do go back, itll be a long time before the cameras stop and all the questions stop. The former east London schoolgirl had previously admitted that she did not regret travelling to IS-controlled Syria, and asserted she was not the same silly little -year-old schoolgirl who ran away from Bethnal Green four years ago. The statement her family issued on Friday evening said they were shocked by her comments in the interview, but her words were those of a girl who was groomed.  We are also mindful that Shamima is currently in a camp surrounded by IS sympathisers and any comments by her could lead directly to danger to her and her child, they added. Her family said her unborn child had every right as a total innocent to have the chance to grow up in the peace and security of this home. We welcome an investigation in what she did while she was there under the principles of British justice and would request the British Government assist us in ing Shamima and her child to the UK as a matter of urgency, the statement said. Meanwhile, the head of MI warned that Britons ing from Islamic State were likely to have acquired potentially very dangerous skills and connections.  Alex Younger, who did not comment specically on the case of Ms Begum, said UK nationals have a right to come home but that public safety was the first priority. Home Secretary Sajid Javid warned he would not hesitate to prevent theof Britons who travelled to join IS, while security minister Ben Wallace said runaways who now wanted to come back must realise that actions have consequences. The head of Counter Terrorism Policing, Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, said anyone ing from a conflict zone having gone to support a terrorist group should expect to face a police investigation. Any investigation is carried out with an open mind and based on the evidence available, he said. This is to determineiniduals have committed any terrorist or other criminal offences, regardless their motivation, and to ensure that they do not pose a danger to the public or the UKs national security.  Any hopes of a rescue mission by British officials were also swtly quashed on Thursday as the Government ruled out an effort inside Syria to assist Ms Begum. While refusing to comment on inidual cases, Mr Wallace told the BBC: Im not putting at risk British peoples lives to go and look for terrorists or former terrorists in a failed state. Theres consular services where in the region and the strong message this Government has given for many years is that actions have consequences. Questions have been raised over whether Britain would be able to prevent Ms Begums eventualto the UK. Former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation Lord Carlile told the BBC thatMs Begum has not gained a second citizenship of another country, she will have to be allowed back to her homeland because under international law it is not possible for a person to be made stateless.  Meanwhile, Richard Barrett, a former director of global counter-terrorism at MI, suggested it would be unreasonable to expect the Syrian Defence Force to look after her indefinitely. He also warned that summary execution is the most likely outcome for such captured foreign nationals who are handed over to Syrian or Iraqi authorities. Ms Begum was one of three schoolgirls, along with Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase, from Bethnal Green Academy who left the UK in February .Another girl, Sharmeena Begum, also from Bethnal Green but not related to Shamima, had travelled to Syria two months earlier.Ms Sultana was reported to have been killed in an air strike in .Shamima Begum said she had recently heard second-hand that the other two girls may still be alive.

The -year-old set up an imaginary drink driving trial in the Palm Beach County Courthouse in the US and told Jen it was important that she saw his opening statement.

Unsuspecting Jen, also , began to cry when Brandon addressed the room with a specially tailored statement declaring his love for her.   Speaking after saying yes, Jen said: He and I had always talked about getting married and we knew we were going to be together but I didn’t think we would get married any time soon. When we worked together we would regularly watch each other’s opening statements and critique each other, so it wasnt unusual for me to be in the courtroom with him. I didn’t know the facts about the DUI trial he made up, and I didn’t really ask. I wasn’t really paying attention until I recognised that one of the jurors looked like Brandon’s dad, which I thought was funny.  Then I saw my dad and I was so confused.

Shocked investigators found that the the infant weighed only pounds,  ounces after being recorded at birth at  pounds,  ounces, according to WFTV news. The Florida Department of Children and Familiessaid the boy was obviously malnourished with his ribs visible and eyes appearing sunken.  Titusville Police Detective Lauren Watson said: At one point, when the child was doing good and healthy and gaining weight, he was on an organic formula and they changed it on their own. Ive never seen a child to this level, this close to possible death. The couple are unmarried however a person familiar with the investigation told WESH that French claims to be Buskey’s concubine under Nazarite Hebrew religious principles. They are both accused of ignoring the type of formula that would fit with their vegan lestyle ordered by their doctor, and instead fed him on a potato-based creation found on the internet by French.  Police said the parents could afford the prescribed formula and did not present a reason as to why they did not provide it to their child. Since Wednesday, the baby, who is now in DCF custody, has gained a half a pound on fluids alone. The baby had been lethargic and not crying when found according to court papers, and had dficulties maintaining his temperature and sugar due to dehydration and malnourishment. During booking, Buskey appeared to contest the medical reports about his child. Both Buskey and French are currently being held in Bred County Jail.

But whether or not you want to have children is a decision that is totally and completely up to you, your partner and no one . However one mum clearly didnt get this memo, as she decided to take matters into her own hands when her son and his we told her they didnt want to have a baby.  The womans daughter-in-law revealed the shocking story in a post on Reddit, which has since been removed. She began by explaining that she and her husband are in their late s and had made a deliberate decision not to have children.Some people had labelled them selfish for choosing this, but the worst response came from the husbands mother who apparently went into hysterics and began raving about how the bloodline and family name will die. The couple remained true to their decision despite this and hoped she would come around eventually, but she never did - and now shes gone and done something despicable.   After offering to cook dinner for the couple one night, the mother-in-law sent her son out to the shops to buy some ingredients. His we explains how she ed home from work, to find her husband still out of the house. So she went upstairs to change, but what she saw upon entering her bedroom has turned her world upside down.Her mother-in-law was poking holes in the couples condoms.  She wrote: When I opened the door into our bedroom what I see is what looks like MIL carefully trying to poke holes into our condoms. She snaps her head in my direction with this mortying deer in the headlights look on her face. Like a fish out of water. She mumbles something about how shes trying to save the family and frantically runs out of the house before I even have a chance to say anything. When her husband eventually came home, she recounted the events to him and says he was absolutely horried by his mothers actions.  To make matters worse, they soon realised that she had been in the home a few weeks earlier and could have tampered with their contraception then as well. Reddit users were equally as horried to hear her story, with one person telling them to go to the police and press charges against the mum. Others said they should end all contact with her and described the behaviour as assault. Many advised that the couple chuck out all of their condoms immediately and take a pregnancy test, just in case the mother-in-law had been doing this for a while. Sadly it seemed she had done it before and after taking a test and visiting the doctor, the woman updated her post to reveal that she was in fact pregnant with her first child and is unsure of what to do next.Im so distraught that I havent been able to sleep in the last four days, she admitted. Im sorry I didnt update sooner but Ive been in a really dark place. At this point we havent even spoke or contacted MIL. Shes been blowing up our phones for the last three days, but we havent responded. Im just so lost as to what to do. I mean I never wanted to have kids sure, but at the same time having an abortion feels so wrong to me. She added: I cant believe Im in this situation right now. I dont know what Im going to do.

Firas Al Izzawi, a spokesman for the local health department, said in a statement that the -year-old mother, who has not been named, had a natural birth and was healthy after the procedure.

Now it’s a question of getting settled in as quick as I can and just playing football,” he said.“I had obviously spoken to Derek McInnes and he said to speak to Jim McIntyre before making any decision.“The gaffer at Aberdeen left it up to me.“He told me he’d love to have me still up there butI wanted to go and get games he understood.“So I spoke to the gaffer here on the phone and I loved everything he had to say. I jumped at the chance to come down here.”And the -year-old sees the draws against Hamilton and Kilmarnock since he arrived as proof this is a squad that can pull away from the relegation zone between now and the end of the season.“The only frustrating thing for me so far is that we’ve not taken six points out of six from the two games I’ve been involved in but I think all the fans and us as a team can feel from those performances that we are building momentum.“In the Hamilton game it was a case of everyone trying to get used to each other. A lot of us had only come in right before the deadline and we only really had one training session together.“It was about trying to get to know everyone’s games, their personalities. I think we are all starting to gel now and you can see that on the pitch.“Not having a game last weekend because we’re out of the cup has given us a bit more time to work on that. That gives us a better picture going into the game against Livingston this weekend.”Today’s trip to the Tony Macaroni Arena to face Livingston is a meeting with a team who have taken the Premiership by storm this term but have been struggling for a win of late.Since thumping Hearts - in mid-December, Gary Holt’s team have not won in eight outings. Wright does not see that as a sign this could be an easy  minutes for Dundee.“We have to treat it that every game from now on is going to be a big game for us and this will be.“We know how Livi will be and they will work hard but all we can do is just prepare the way we want to and work on how we can play. Hopefully, that will be enough.“They haven’t won in a few games but it’s a testimony to Livi how many points they have. They started the season so well.”Today, of course, will see Dundee asked to play on Livi’s much-criticised plastic pitch.The debate over their use has surfaced again this week via the PFA canvassing their members for views on them. While Wright is very much in the camp that prefers grass surfaces, the articial surface is not something he’s going to gripe about.“All we can do is get on with it and we are not going to use the pitch as an excuse,” he added.“Playing in Scotland, you get used to them.“However, I think having everyone playing on grass is something that would benefit the top league.“You prepare for a team each week but, for these games, you also have to prepare for the pitch as well.“All we can do as players is give our opinion about them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"gomis set to take over as dundee united target hat trick of wins down at queen of the south","story":"Veteran Morgaro Gomis is set to take over in midfield when Dundee United try to make it three wins on the bounce as they head for Queen of the South today.The -year-old is expected to replace Calum Butcher, who will serve the first game of a two-match ban after his red card in the Scottish Cup win at St Mirren last weekend.His second game on the sidelines will be the cup quarter-final against Ross County or Inverness Caley Thistle which has been confirmed for Sunday, March  at pm.The game is also being televised live on BBC Scotland.As well as continuing their recent winning run, the Tangerines will be looking for their third success of the campaign over Queens.To do that, though, manager Robbie Neilson is well aware they will have to keep in-form home striker Stephen Dobbie quiet.His spectacular strike in the cup at Aberdeen on Sunday was the -year-old’s th goal in just  appearances this term.“He has been on fire lately and someone we will have to get to grips with,” said Robbie.“He has a lot of quality, he knows how to score goals.“He’s just a very good player and I think he has the freedom of Dumfries these days. He’s a god down there.”United have their own in-form attacker in the shape of Pavol Safranko.The Slovakian, who’s on loan from Aalborg, has hit the net three times in his last four games.That’s taken his tally so far to  goals and he’s scored on the two previous occasions he’s faced the Doonhamers.“We been playing well and we’re looking for that to continue,” added Robbie."},{"url":null,"title":"legend maurice malpas reckons january business could help dundee united reach premiership","story":"With a total of  appearances for Dundee United, there’s not many better qualied to speak on the state of things at Tannadice than Maurice Malpas.And the club legend reckons their January business has given them “a chance” of promotion back to the Premiership –they can keep displays up for more than  minutes.He said: “The last couple of games they’ve been good in the first half but ran out of steam in the second. If they can get the players bang at it for more of the game I think you have to say they have a chance.“There is a bigger iety of player to choose from now and they have some players who are willing to put a boot in, which you need when games aren’t going your way.“They have a chance of getting up but they can’t drop many points.”As for his own situation, Malpas is quite content looking on from the stands after being assistant to Richie Foran at Inverness last season.Malpas added: “These days I watch United on a Saturday and do a bit of babysitting.“I’ve no desperation to get back in.

They have some very good players,” he said.“The first thing we have to do is try to win our battles but don’t forget they have scored some quality goals, some good team goals.“We have to try to make sure inidually we get the better of them and try to go and create opportunities to win the game.”Dundee go into the clash with controversy over plastic pitches like Livi’s rekindled by a PFA survey showing top-flight players are unied in opposition to them.The manager is also in that camp but hasn’t forgotten that defeat at the Tony Macaroni in his first game in charge was down to what happened in the air and not the surface.That day back in October his team conceded four goals from set pieces.“We didn’t deal with set plays and that killed us. It was an eye-opener that day in terms of what we had to work with,” he said.“There’s no doubt, though, the surface is an advantage. I was the manager of a team, Queen of the South, who had an articial surface andyou train on it every day it’s a definite help.“At the same time I’m not trying to detract from how well Livingston have done because they’ve done exceptionally well.”Dundee are still nursing a few niggling injuries from that Killie draw, but it’s hoped everyone who was on duty then will be available. Midfielder Ethan Robson is expected to recover in time from the groin injury that forced him to miss that game."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c6694bcb9cc67.14376388.jpg ","title":"masterchef star dean banks is coming to dundee and wants to open venue in city","story":"A Tayside chef who reached the final of one of the country’s most popular cooking programmes will visit Dundee for a special event.MasterChef: the Professionals finalist Dean Banks will showcase his signature dishes to his local followers and fans in the city next month.The Tele reported last week the foodie is also set to appear in his home town Carnoustie.The budding restaurateur also announced he plans on opening a venue in Dundee.Dean will appear at the Apex hotel at the end of March, where he will present a five-course signature dinner.Dean said: “These events are a chance to give back to the people of Dundee.“I’ve received so much support from them.“When I announced that I would be opening a restaurant in Edinburgh, so many people contacted me saying to stay true to myself and open a restaurant here in Dundee.“And I’d say that’s definitely in line.“I love coming back to Dundee.“The city is changing its image to the world.“There are so many things happening in Dundee, like the opening of the VA design museum.“I can really start to see a space for my type of a restaurant.“These events help me see the response I could get from locals, test the waters and see what feedback I’ll get.“Hopefully one day I’ll open a restaurant in Dundee.Dean will present a series of “modern fusion” dishes accompanied by a selection of drinks from Eden Mill near St Andrews.The Angus chef has been busy hosting events throughout Scotland.As well as touring the country, he has been adding the final touches on his soon-to-open restaurants, all in the wake of his appearance last year on the hit BBC show.Dean’s first restaurant is expected to open doors in St Andrews this April.This will be shortly followed by another in Edinburgh.The Bank of Eden event will take place at the Apex on March .Tickets are still available and can be bought online.Those interested should visit eventbrite."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c6693c1dcc3e1.49955226.jpg ","title":"party goers turning dundee street into bottle graveyard","story":"Locals fear streets around one of Dundee’s busiest nightle spots are turning into a “bottle graveyard”.Areas around South Ward Road have been left in a mess in recent months, with revellers knocking back booze on the streets and using electrical boxes as tables before moving on to city nightspots.Pictures taken earlier this week show beer cans and bottles of spirits dumped opposite the petrol station.One local said the area was particularly bad yesterday morning after party-goers had been out on the town.He said: “I came down Thursday morning just before am.“I was greeted with sick, urine, bottles of spirits and empty cans of beer.“It always seems to be worse on a Thursday morning after a Wednesday evening.“It’s a bottle graveyard on the way into work.“I would assume most of the revellers are partaking in student nights out and are trying to save themselves a few quid.“I feel sorry for the street sweepers who need to clean these areas up because it’s a total disgrace.“This isn’t a one-off either as it’s happening every week.“I came down today and it was totally clear, which leads me to believe it’s a problem related to Wednesday nights.”Despite the worries of residents, owners of nightclubs in the area have denied any knowledge of their customers drinking in the streets before entering their premises.The owner of Carbon and Kush nightclub on South Ward Road, Tahir Ramzan, said he was unaware of issues of alcohol being consumed on the surrounding streets.He said: “This is the first I’ve heard about this.“Anything that happens en route to the club is outwith our control.“The problem isn’t directly outside the clubs and might be impacting more on the petrol garage.“We certainly don’t have issues with our customers who come in during the week.

He’d done his homework and, equally importantly, worked out exactly where his squad needed strengthening.That means the right players for the right positions have been found, or so it seems.That’s produced victories over Morton and St Mirren that have lted spirits among Arabs. Rightly so, because both outings have seen impressive work.Of course, with most of those brought in lacking match fitness – that’s usually the major issue with January signings – the good football, has mostly come in the first hour.Players who’ve not had a lot of game time have tired, particularly when reduced to  men at St Mirren. They’ve then shown their ability to manage matches.What the manager also looks to have done well is identy those already in his squad who were good enough to be part of his plans.For all new boys like Peter Pawlett, Mark Reynolds and Mark Connolly have deserved the praise they’ve received for their first couple of performances, attackers Pavol Safranko and Nicky Clark have shown they remain big players.After a run of just two goals in nine games, Safranko has found his scoring touch with one in each of the last two outings and has looked the lethal striker he did when he first arrived on loan from Aalborg.Now he’s finally got fully fit, Clark also looks dangerous and there’s no doubt both have benefited from having better players round them in the last two outings.For Neilson and his players the trick is now to keep the good work going. The good news for United fans is, this time, that might just happen."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c66c8cf998353.32516121-e1550241983408.jpg ","title":"va dundees new exhibit features 200 toy planks","story":"VA staff have taken the wraps off a colourful new exhibit featuring  toy planks.The display is inspired by the theory of children learning through play and was designed by Gabriella Marcella, founder of Glasgow print studio Risotto.The new installation has been described by critics as “asking visitors to considerlimitations on form and shape help, or hinder creativity” and is entitled Rules of Play.Made up of  enlarged toy planks in five bright colours, Rules of Play celebrates the work of educational pioneer and inventor of the child care system, Friedrich Froebel.German-born Froebel, who founded the first kindergarten in , believed that play could help children build a better understanding of the world.Ms Marcella said: “In an increasingly digital world, this installation aims to question what it really means to get back to basics.“It seems obvious to us now, but Friedrich Froebel was one of the first people to recognise the true value of play and how it can help explain the world around us.“I became intrigued by the idea that simple tools and forms can help us understand complex ideas.”She added: “Rules of Play uses oversized building blocks to explore pattern and geometry in a three-dimensional space, much in the same way as I’ve used print to experiment with colourful forms in the past.”Ms Marcella’s installation also includes , Kapla planks plus simple questions written on the wall to help inspire visitors to create their own structures.VA project curator Lauren Bassam said: “Gabriella has created a wonderfully playful installation that is not only bright and beautul, but also challenges the way we think about the basics of design.”The exhibit is on display until Sunday June ."},{"url":null,"title":"young women urged to attend voting event run by dundee womens festival","story":"Organisers of a centenary suffrage conference have urged young women to turn out in their droves.Dundee Women’s Festival will run the event on Saturday March  entitled “Why Should I Bother to Vote ” and is stressing that it is aimed at the -

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"hscp welcomes community commitment ahead of crunch meeting","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

The bunds will help reduce the risk of debris reaching the A in the event of a landslide.This project allows BEAR Scotland to maximise the benefit of recycling the material being excavated from the Rest and Be Thankful while minimising the overall cost of these works.To keep roadworkers and motorists safe throughout the works, temporary traffic lights will be in place on the A at each location. This next phase of the works is expected to last approximately  weeks.Commenting on the works, Eddie Ross, BEAR Scotland’s North West Representative said: #The installation of the next stages of the mitigation measures will provide more protection and resilience against any future landslips blocking this key route at both the Rest and Be Thankful and Glen Kinglas.#The temporary traffic lights are necessary to keep our teams as well as users of the route safe during the works, and the teams will do all they can to complete the project as quickly and safely as possible.#We encourage road users to plan their journeys in advance by checking the Traffic Scotland website for up to date travel information.#"},{"url":null,"title":"third sector interface launches new approach to service delivery","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Third Sector Interfaceis changing the way it supports all types of third sector organisations, including charities, social enterprises and community groups.Due to many people now finding information through digital means and the need for information and assistance to be accessible and consistent across the whole of Argyll and Bute, not just in the main towns, the organisation has launched a new website, argylltsi.org.The website, reflecting the TSI’s new corporate identity, contains a self-serve area allowing third sector organisations to find links to a whole iety of locally-based and more national resources that can support their development needs, as well as useful templates to use to run their organisations.The TSI will be growing and developing self-service over the coming months, with the site becoming a ‘one-stop shop’ for information that third sector organisations need to set up, govern and manage organisations – everything from how to start a social enterprise to raising funding from major donors.The TSI can also now be contacted through a central freephone number #   , available between the hours of am-pm, Monday-Friday.

Her conclusions drawn from experience was that when the monitors were around, there may have been unpleasant situations, but no tragedies. When there was no monitor around – clearly defined by their unorms – people died.Philippa had only been home for eight weeks when she spoke to the Justice and Peace Group, and she admitted that she was still processing the often brutal and violent scenes she had witnessed. And though she wryly joked that it had not exactly been a picnic, she encouraged her audience to become involved in the work of EAPPI – through prayer, support, even by volunteering to be a monitor .For more information, visit eappi.org en or visit the EAPPI Facebook page @EAPPI.WCCPIC:Her stories of the hardships in Israel kept visitors engaged. no_aholylandPhillipa Bonella speaking at the MS Centre. no_aholyland"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr pub look revive nightlife","story":"NewsAyr pub look to revive nightle with music in beer gardenArthur Street Kitchen applied for permission to host live al fresco entertainment in the town centre.ShareBySarah Hilley:,  FEB News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pub operator wants to revive Ayr’s former nightle strip with music in a large beer garden. Arthur Street Kitchen applied for permission to host live al fresco entertainment in the town centre. But councillors worried about noise want to carry out a site visit before making a decision. The venue’s manager Andy McPherson said: “We would like to have entertainment for customers in the garden this summer.” He said the music would not be too loud as the business is aware of residents living in the Arthur Street area of the town. Appearing before the South Ayrshire Council licensing board, he added: “We are hoping to reinvigorate Arthur Street. It is starting to come to le again.” Board chair Craig Mackay said: “Noise is the main issue here. “We would be looking for a noise report.” Mr McPherson said it would be background music featuring a musician playing acoustic guitar, for example. Ayr manager John Neil told the meeting no noise complaints were made last summer. The restaurant and pub also want to have a large screen to show sport and films. Arthur Street Kitchen is based in the former West of the Moon premises and beside the Vinyl night club. Councillor Mackay said: “The West of the Moon was a family space. What you are proposing is quite dferent.” Mr Neil said Arthur Street Kitchen still caters for children. He said: “We want to cater for as many dferent people as we can.” The decision will be made at a later meeting following a visit to the venue.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGardens and flowersAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire health board 22m debt","story":"NewsAyrshire health board £m debt fearNHS Ayrshire  Arran have slashed the amount spent on agency nurses and made other cutbacks but the shortfall is still soaring.ShareBySarah Hilley:,  FEB NewsBoard Chair Martin Cheyne \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyrshire’s health board is on the verge of racking up a poundmillion debt this year. NHS Ayrshire  Arran have slashed the amount spent on agency nurses and made other cutbacks but the shortfall is still soaring. Now the Scottish Government are poised to step in and wipe out poundm of the debt mountain. A report presented at a board meeting this week said the “Scottish Government are currently planning on poundmillion of brokerage”. The board had already overspent by pound.m up to the end of December. The debt could soar to pound.m by the end of March. Health bosses are under pressure to reduce that figure before the end of this financial year. Board chair Martin Cheyne said: “It is right to see that we as an organisation are keen to get below the pound.million and we are working as hard as we can towards that.” North Ayshire Council leader Joe Cullinane, who attended the meeting, said: “How many cuts are the health board looking at making during  to   “NHS Ayrshire  Arran have severerly overspent and been underfunded.   “They have received loans from the Scottish Government. “But the headline budget won’t be enough to meet the demands of the health board and the citizens across Ayrshire.” Director of Finance Derek Lindsay told the board it “has managed to reduce spend in agency nursing”. Nursing agency spend has been pared down to poundm for the current financial year. The report said: “ Whilst it may not be possible to completely eradicate the use of agency nurses, a further poundm reduction is on target to be achieved in  .” There has been a dramatic reduction over the last three years with costs paid on external nursing staff droppng by half. The figure dipped from pound.m in   to pound.m in  . The risk for “financial performance” overall has been branded as “high” in the report.

Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights.

His death revealed he had left his entire fortune in his will to his native town of Troon. His legacy would provide education awards and grants for the people of the town along with a new public school. As Marr’s train travelled north he decided to break his journey, to pay a visit to his sister in Girvan. He was close to his sister Helen and visited her often after her marriage to ColonelABGrant, owner of Killochan Castle estate at Girvan, who was also a senior partner in the firm of Grant Somerville  Co in London and was later ordained as Revd. Grant in the Church of Scotland. Marr had intended to spend part of his fortnight at Girvan but extended his stay to a month. Perhaps his change of heart was due to the widespread unrest taking place in Glasgow at that time. The January of  saw the so-called ‘Harbour Riots’, where racial confrontations were breaking out between black and white merchant seamen on the town’s quayside and spreading into the town. A four day General Strike was called for on January  and four days later George Square was crammed with tens of thousands of angry workmen. Crowds of unemployed men joined in the fracas for a  hour working week. As tempers flared the army was deployed, troops brought in tanks and armored vehicles to control the crowds. As tensions heightened it was not an environment travellers would want to find themselves caught up in. Eventually CK Marr left Girvan on Saturday February  for his onward journey north to his annual shooting and fishing break in Perthshire. As the train made its way towards the city he took ill with acute appendicitis. When taken off the train at the Central Station he was rushed to the Glasgow Nursing Home, but it was already too late as he tragically died in the operating theatre. There is little known of Charles Kerr Marr, despite having a successful career in the coal exporting business. Born on October , , at  Welbeck Crescent, Troon, he was the third son of Captain John Marr, master of the merchant ship ‘Reciprocity’, sailing between Troon and Canada. John Marr and his we Amelia had five children, sons William, John and Charles, along with two daughters, Helen and Amelia. Up to the age of ten, Charles attended the Parish School in Academy Street at Troon, going on to join his two brothers at Irvine Royal Academy to complete his education. On finishing his schooling, Marr was apprenticed at A  J Guthrie, Coal Agents at Troon Harbour. Unlike his brother John, who followed in his father’s footsteps to become a sea captain, Marr left home as soon as his apprenticeship ended, to work as a Commercial Clerk with Kitstons, Iron Merchants in Glasgow. Moving later to take up the position of cashier at Clyde Ironworks, only to leave a short time later to be manager of the firm of GrantSomerville  Co in London. The move may have been influenced by A B Grant, who was a senior partner in the company and married to his sister Helen. By the time he met his future we, some years later, there is no evidence as to when he moved back to Glasgow, or indeed any explanation found as to his change of occupation. Marr is recorded in the Scotland census of  as residing in Renfrew Street in Glasgow and again on his marriage certicate a year later, where he is also recorded as being employed as a Soft Goods Warehouseman.  Little is known as to why he left coal exporting to go into the Drapery business, or where he met and fell in love with his we Agnes Murray Kinghorn. However, Agnes’s father was a General Merchant, so it would seem likely he met her in his line of work. Charles and Agnes married on March ,  and set up home at Sutherland Terrace in Glasgow’s Hillhead. Unfortunately, after only  months of married le, Agnes tragically died of Phthisis Pulmonalis . She was just  years of age. Her death was a severe blow to Marr, leaving him brokenhearted and distraught, which had a profound effect on him. Shortly after he laid his we to rest, he had thought of going abroad to work, but instead accepted an appointment with Hull Blyth  Company of London. Within a year he was made a partner in the company when he developed the firm’s export trade. His work of establishing depots in numerous ports in the world gave him an opportunity to travel abroad, especially to China and Japan, where he found an interest in collecting oriental treasures. During his time with Hull Blyth the firm went on to become one of the largest shipping charterers in the UK. Charles Kerr Marr played a signicant part in the company’s worldwide success. Charles Marr moved to London after his we’s death, he never again owned a house. All his years in London, he alternated between two clubs, the Athenaeum and the Constitutional. The nearest he came to having a home was in his later years, when he rented two rooms in Camden House at Chislehurst in Kent, which was originally built for Napoleon the rd. Just being there helped him to relax and take up golf. He was reputed to be good company with a great sense of humour and well known to be very generous. Marr was a lover of the arts and music and in all that time he rarely spoke of his we, or of her death and he never remarried, even his closest friends assumed he was a bachelor. When he retired in  he spent a good part of each year fishing and shooting in Scotland. Two years before his untimely death, Charles Marr carefully drafted out his will in , leaving his entire fortune to the people of Troon and setting out the way it was to be carried out. Marr’s coal fortune legacy has given the town a magnicent architectural school building with playing fields the envy of the country. Marr College on its own is a fitting tribute to this man of extraordinary vision. By the time Marr College opened in  the school had attracted the most renowned academics to come and teach. It was the only grant aided school in Scotland that didn’t charge fees. A public school for every child of the town, had oak led class rooms, inlaid parquet flooring, Italian tiled corridorsa copper domed library, purple velvet drapes and teachers attired in flowing cloaks with mortar boards on their heads, this was seen by all to be a stunning,not magnicent, comprehensive school, deemed to be the best school in Scotland and envied by it. The CK Marr Educational Trust, the only one of its kind in Scotland, has provided awards or grants to hundreds of Troon students, of all ages each year. The addition of the MarrEducation Resource Centre in Troon Library, the only one then in Ayrshire, is a valuable educational resource for all who use it. Marr College and the CK Marr Educational Trust are a testimony to the wishes of Charles Kerr Marr and a fitting memorial to this great benefactor. He was buried beside his beloved we in CathcartCemetery in Glasgow. Over the past century the people of Troon owe a huge debt to custodians of Marr’s vision, the Marr Trustees, past and present. Over the decades the many Trustees, Boards of Governors and ious Clerks, Treasurers and Accountants, who have and still do today and for many decades to come, have successfully upheld the wishes of the town’s greatest ever benefactor and extraordinary visionary, Charles Kerr Marr.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnChurch of ScotlandUniversities and CollegesGlasgowEducationFishingArmed forcesLove and romanceSchoolsRenfrewTroonPerthshireGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema set return prestwick after","story":"NewsCinema set forto Prestwick after  year gapReturn to the golden age of screen in PrestwickShareByStephen Houston:,  FEB NewsFriends of Broadway - they want cinema open again \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCinema made a boldto Prestwick for the first time in more than  years.

A number of venues in the Auchinleck area applied to open their bars for a tipple at am on match day as Talbot geared up to face Ayr. Licensing bosses at East Ayrshire Council knocked back the flurry of applications for early morning drinking before the January  showdown. Despite the historic nature of the sporting event, the department decided to maintain their stance on trying to clamp down on excess boozing during football. The East Ayrshire Licensing board depute clerk Stuart McCall told councillors it was important to maintain the standard policy and have consistency. He pointed to Celtic and Rangers matches as examples of tense clashes requiring robust licensing rules. Mr McCall said: “The standard practice is games start early and the reason for that is to limit the amount of alcohol supporters can have.” “We all know the outcome excess alcohol can have in certain circumstances.” Congragulating Talbot, he added: “We are all delighted to see the result. “The maintenance of the policy is important so we are not accused of favouritism.” Some venues wanted to offer breakfast to supporters. Auchinleck Talbot defeated Ayr by one goal to nil. Alcohol was not permitted inside the grounds and fans were told they would be refused entryintoxicated.

John Senior has been an animal surgeon in the town for  years. He has also immersed himself in activities and volunteering for all sorts of causes. This week he was continuing his latest community activity as a hand bell ringer at Cumnock Old Church. John, , said: “All I want is the best for Cumnock and we are so fortunte to have so many things going on now. “I just want to make it better than it is.” The Keir McTurk Memorial Committee chose John after “much deliberation” from all the nominations. Chairman Colin Chisholm said: “John is someone who prefers to work behind the scenes rather than be at the forefront. “But his efforts for the community have proved invaluable.” John, originally from Edinburgh, has freshly retired from the Crossriggs veterinary practice in the town. When he arrived in  it was chiefly large livestock but treats mostly small animals. His we Heather, also a vet, remains involved in the management and their son Iain, the third member of the Senior family who is a vet, runs the practice. John is a very active member of the Cumnock Action Plan Committee, in which he has reformed the Cumnock Gardening Club assisted living in the arrangements for the Christmas festival and was actively involved in the poppy display marking the centenary of the end of the First World War. He is also an elder in the Trinity Church and a member of the fabric committee.

The three-wheeled rickshaw is a little more than a ‘sofa on wheels’ as it is engineered to accommodate two passengers in the front and driven by a pilot in the rear. Those with mobility restrictions - old and young- can take a trip to the seafront, enjoy the Prestwick promenade views and have a good old natter. Now the community project, who’s base has been kindly gted by St Ninian’s Episcopal Church, are eager to find more volunteer pilots and those keen to get out on the trishaw. Chris Cheales, of Cycling Without Age Prestwick, said: “We now have two trishaws and we are in the middle of a training programme to help - people become qualied before starting the operation in spring. We offer two-hour sessions to two passengers and there is the opportunity to go for a drink, stop to chat, pet a dog or just enjoy the views. “We are looking for people with limited mobility who may or may not also struggle with loneliness and isolation and who would benefit from the freedom of feeling ‘the wind in their hair’. “Time is a wonderful gt to give anyone. The group hope to expand as the project grows and take their trishaws on tour to visit care homes in the area. Chris added: “We envisage days allocated to ‘user groups’, to include care homes, those recommended by Dementia Friendly Prestwick, retirement housing and local churches. “Trishaws are not cheap so we need ongoing help to keep all this on the road. “We are looking forward to another sunny summer and sharing the project with others.” The Prestwick Peoples Project has also benefitted those involved, helping volunteers flourish and gain confidence. Zara Crumlish has been a Young Ambassador for Cycling Without Age for six months. Zara, , said: “I’ve always wanted to ride a bike when I was younger but I didn’t have the balance. “The trishaw has helped me get my confidence up. “It gets me out and about with the community. “And I’m excited because I really can’t wait to take elderly people out and show them the Prom.” •Would you like to be trained as a Trishaw Pilot  Or a willing volunteer to be a co-pilot to accompany trips  .

Open Doors Day event and the information session taking place for community groups, alongside the ongoing consultation to provide a name for the new campus.ldquoWe are determined to continue to improve our school estate to ensure it is fit for purpose for our young people, staff and local communities.The new campus at Hartrigge Park will replace Jedburgh Grammar, Howdenburn and Parkside primary schools.And it will have provision for nursery, primary and secondary school children while community facilities will include a multi-use games area, G hockey pitch, G sports pitch, running track, external changing pavilion and rural skills area.Councillor Carol Hamilton, SBCrsquos executive member for children and young people, said: ldquoI would encourage the local community to find out more and get involved in the events being held in the coming weeks and months.ldquoFor those who cannot make the Open Doors Day, we have provided a virtual tour of the exterior of the building on social media, and will be adding another of the inside of the building in the coming weeks.ldquoExcellent progress is being made with construction of the campus, which means it remains on course to open to Jedburghrsquos young people and the community in spring .Bruce Dickson, of contractors BAM Construction, added: ldquoAs members of BuildUK, we fully support Open Doors Day which is designed to change the public perception of the construction industry and what we do.ldquoJedburgh Campus is perfect for this, being both a landmark community building in terms of design and purpose and also an exemplar construction site run by a superb team.ldquoWe hope that all of our visitors will get an enjoyable and interesting insight into the world of construction and it will probably not be what they

tourism.We would like a larger Saab  or equivalent aircraft that can land in more adverse weather conditions # we understand the economies of scale and suggest a service that can fly to Campbeltown and then on to Islay, back to Campbeltown and ing to Glasgow, or vice versa.We would like the reinstatement of the radar system to assist landings in adverse weather conditions.As there is a separate service between Islay and Edinburgh we suggest that Campbeltown should be included as we also have key tourist attractions such as distilleries and three fantastic -hole golf courses and high-standard accommodation.We would like to see the service continue with a timetable with low ticket prices to allow the full day in Glasgow for NHS appointments, business and shopping trips and the reinstatement of seven days a week flights to enhance business and tourism.In addition, we want national advertising campaigns inclusive of timetables to promote the area for increased passenger numbers, including weekend breaks.These aspirations are very much in keeping with the council’s Community Plan Single Outcome Agreement   in particular relating to National Policy Priorities i.e. economic recovery,

Jesus is the light of the world who will guide us through our own dark times.Many customs have grown around Candlemas and one of the most interesting came from Scotland.In the olden days, Candlemas was the day when children brought candles to school so that the classrooms would have light on dull days.As time went on, gas lighting took over from candlelight and the children brought money to school with which the teacher was supposed to buy sweets for the children.The child who brought in the most money was declared Candlemas King or Queen and they ruled for six weeks.They had the power to make one whole afternoon a week a playtime and to excuse anyone they wished from any form of punishment.I don#t think this will catch on in Argyll!I think it is a lovely custom to take a child to

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

He effectively dropped his opposition to her Withdrawal Agreement, which Labour had repeatedly condemned as the ldquoworst of all worlds. The Labour leaderrsquos letter still calls for a customs union, regulatory alignment on trade and guarantees on workers rights and security cooperation. But, crucially, Labour is no longer holding to the ldquosix tests, and insisting a Brexit deal should deliver ldquoexactly the same benefits as being in the single market.Labour has even dropped its opposition to the Irish backstop, which Mr Corbyn condemned, as recently as December, for leaving Britain ldquoin an indefinite halfway house with no say on its future. The explanatory note that Labour circulated after the leaderrsquos letter to May is quite clear. ldquoAny withdrawal agreement,\" it says, ldquowill need to include a backstop.\" Labour is also hinting at further compromises in ldquonegotiations.Hitherto, Labourrsquos policy has been to make demands May could never accept now they are trying to make her an offer she canrsquot refuse.So at last, after months of there being nothing much new to say about Brexit, suddenly we have what looks like a breakthrough, a historic compromise. Of course, you canrsquot overestimate the ability of political leaders to look a gt horse in the mouth. Theresa May may be so wedded to being a ldquobloody dficult womanthat she may find a way to avoid accepting Labourrsquos free hooved mammal. But the deal is there to be made.Senior Tories like Sir Oliver Letwin have welcomed the Labour offer, seeing it as a step towards a Norway-style agreement, even though it isnrsquot. Labourrsquos plan is much closer to Turkey, which is also in a customs union and accepts regulatory alignment. Brussels likes Corbyns proposals too, as a way out of hard Brexit ldquohell.Ive argued that the logic of Labourrsquos position was always to back something resembling Theresa Mayrsquos deal with the EU. It corresponds to Labourrsquos manesto commitments to leaving the EU, including the single market, and ending free movement while seeking frictionless trade. Mrs May has always supported regulatory alignment, since the ldquocommon rule book in her Chequers plan. And the backstop, remember, involves the UK remaining in the customs union until there is a future comprehensive trade deal.In what could almost have been a coordinated intervention last week, Mrs May restated in Dublin her determination to prevent a hard border in Ireland. This put the wind up the DUP, since they fear that the border might now move to the Irish Sea.It didnrsquot appeal to the hardline Brexiteers in her own party either, who are adamant that no deal is better than her bad deal. They thought it had been killed off by last monthrsquos record-breaking Commons defeat ndash but it may now live again with Labourrsquos backing.They canrsquot admit it, of course, but May and Corbyn are now speaking broadly the same language. The customs union, regulatory alignment, rights and protections etc are all matters to do with the future trade relationship with the EU, not the Withdrawal Agreement. It covers only money, citizenship and the Good Friday Agreement.The trading relationship can only be negotiated after Brexit. It is to be hammered out within the up to four years of the transition period, during which the UK remains in the single market and the customs union.Onlythere is no agreement does the backstop comes into play, and that really just extends the transition period indefinitely. May has said she will get assurances that the backstop will be time-limited, but she canrsquot get that from the European Union. If it was limited, it would no longer be a backstop.What hard Brexiteers really fear is that the transition period might lead to a soft Brexit, not a clean break ndash and they are right. What we know is that MPs will block any no-deal Brexit. Hardliners face a choice of May Corbyn or no Brexit at all.To secure a Commons majority without them, Mrs May could promise legislation to keep Britain in regulatory alignment with the customs union until a new trade deal is finalised ndash one which delivers the same benefits. This is anyway implicit in her promises to keep trade ldquofrictionless. Indeed, remaining in a customs union is the only way of achieving this. Up to now, she hasnrsquot been able to say this openly for fear of a rebellion by her hardline backbenchers, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg. They want a managed no-deal now, or in four years, under the so-called ldquoMalthouse Plan.Butshe has an ounce of political sense, May will now face them down and pivot to Labourrsquos softish Brexit. Labourrsquos demand that she put the customs union in primary legislation can be finessed, because the trade negotiations canrsquot happen until after Brexit. She doesnrsquot even need to ensure that Labour votes with her. Labour could abstain in the meaningful vote and achieve essentially the same result. The DUP would accept the customs union as a guarantee against a backstop or an east west hard border.Jeremy Corbyn could explain Labourrsquos abstention, which will be attacked by Vote Leave MPs andleader writers, by saying, as his spokespeople did last week: that the top priority ldquofor the nation is to avoid a no-deal. Corbynite commentators can be relied upon to condemn any Labour MPs who continue to vote against Mayrsquos deal as traitors. Unreconstructed Blairites, voting with the hated Moggists to force a no-deal disaster.Corbynrsquos letter made no reference to a Peoples Vote. Remainers in the Labour Party realise where all this is heading, which is why a number, like former shadow cabinet figures like Owen Smith, and Clive Lewis, have threatened to leave the party. That could become part of the script.Corbyn has used the Brexit issue to smoke out Blairite Remainers like Chuka Umunna, and the Jewish MP, Luciana Berger, in order to portray them as disloyal splitters.Of course, ordinary members of the Labour Party will be mightily confused. Many of them still think Labour is committed to a referendum. It still could come to that, of course,May doesnrsquot seize this opportunity.I still harbour vague hopes that A could be revoked, but Irsquom afraid that pro-Europeans are on the wrong side of history right now. The country is destined to leave the EU, because letrsquos face it, Labour under Jeremy Corbyn is and has always been a pro-Brexit party.And after Brexit Day  Well, get ready for Groundhog Day  as negotiations over the future EU trade deal begin all over again."},{"url":null,"title":"fidelma-cook-uks-english-overlords-have-condemned-it-to-self-immolation","story":"I donrsquot know why I silence the fixed line. Nobody calls and anyway I never answer, and even the cold callers have given up. I silence the mobile too on such a day.So yesterday, a heap of pillows behind my head I did that leg-stretching, toe pointing slide-down of bliss while hearing the rain bullet the roof as I followed the wind swirling through the trees from my window.There is an added joy on days like this simply because, living in the South of France, I know there wonrsquot be too many before that sly old sun starts creeping around again.And the mimosa, the bougainvillea, the violets and all the other southern plants whose names I forget, push through the dead ground and thrust and weave their way to the light.Wonrsquot be too long before the ivy and the Virginia creeper throw out the healthy leaves to rapidly cover the bare walls I hate when the crumbling crepi is revealed ing LM to its pastiche of a far more impressive country house.Languid day after day will follow, peaking in the new, unforgiving heat waves that the destruction of our planet is bringing and driving all back inside to the cool of the bedchamber.I was idly, smiling to myself, thinking all this as I gazed out at my land ndash my land ndash when it hit me like a blow centre stomach that in a few short weeks I will look out onto uncertainty and the unknown.The view will still be the same but my angle on it will be tilted, smudged.For the first time I would truly,the worst comes to pass, be a foreigner with no more rights to be part of the greatest collection of nations ever assembled in modern times. No ndash ever.The unbelievable self-immolation of the United Kingdom by its English overlords was actually going to happen.Until I saw the defeated, sad, almost accepting face of Donald Tusk as he damned to hell those carrying out this without a defined plan, I was sure certain the cavalry would come to the rescue.But of course in this war there is no gallant opposition riding over the hill, star circled flags waving. For the opposition is led by a snaggle-toothed general in an anorak who lsquoleadsrsquo with words provided by his Marxist cabal.A shuffling, whiney-voiced, blinkered empty vessel only ever filled and energized by socialist gains and failures in far away lands. A back room plotter of photocopied handouts and posters to push through letterboxes and post on lampposts.A man who in the end has not the courage of his so-called convictions to admit his adversary is doing all he hoped.And his adversaryhellip Theresa May. She talks of God a lot ndash her shield of righteousness in bringing the will of the people to fruition.Each Sunday she kneels in her church. I wonder what she says to her God Marianne Taylor: Brexit reveals Germanyrsquos unrequited love for the UKHow she justies the Tory policies that have destroyed communities left the vulnerable to die waiting for their benefits flung out the Windrush generation and soon the rest presided over the homeless who seem now to be an acceptable part of the landscape.How dare she employ Him in pursuit of her selfish gains that seek only to keep her job and her party together  How bloody dare she and trash the genuine Christians who have no time for her cruelty.As you see, I am no longer arguing the intellectual case against Brexit. All has been said by minds finer than mine.Actually, I find myself utterly consumed by rage with a wish to lash out at the self-satisfied smuggeries of Davis, Rees-Mogg, Williamson, Fox, Hoey, Leadsom and the two worst of all: Gove and Johnson.Gerbil chops Gove scuttling and hiding in the back rooms ready to pounce and Johnson, his mouth curved in a secret smile of contemptuous superiority, fill me with a desire to smack them and never stop.This is what theyrsquove reduced me to ndash a cold hatred.

Itrsquos strange because itrsquos a very dry kind of cold itrsquos very dferent from the Scottish cold air. I donrsquot think itrsquos anything you can ever get used to.Le is completely dferent, even things like going to the toilet. The worst thing was probably that we didnrsquot get to shower for two months, which sounds quite shallow. I would rub snow on my feet to wash them which was cold and horrible but it was important to make sure that your feet didnrsquot get any sort of infection. Once a week we would try and wash ourselves with a little tiny bit of cloth and to get water we would melt the snow.Before I went to Antarctica I trained for about two years. I pulled tyres and had ski training in Norway. I had never skied before this. Initially I didnrsquot know any of the other women but now they are closer to me than some of the people who I have known my whole le because we have done so much together. We were six women who were together for two months, so there were quite a few arguments.We did a lot of research while we were there about how the female body copes in an intense endurance environment. Those results showed that our bodies faired incredibly well in fact in some areas better than the male bodies of the team that went the year before. We lost a lot of fats but no muscle tissue and it didnrsquot have any long-term effect on our hormonal or reproductive systems.I think about a week into the expedition I became quite ill and I was struggling to carry my weight. So the girls had to take some of the weight off me and help me out. I was very low mentally. The girls were able to keep me going and knew how to keep me motivated.The thing I was most nervous about was the carvassons, which are big holes in the ice. Sometimes they get covered by the snow and itrsquos easy to fall through. We had done all the training to prepare for this which was absolutely horric because it involved falling into these things deliberately. Probably this and getting an injury scared me the most before I had even arrived at the Antarctic.I had to pull the equipment behind me on a sledge and it wasnrsquot just a lot of pressure on your arms but also your core. I was attached to a harness and it pulled the weight behind me. Some daysthe ice is hard then itrsquos not that heavy and glides easily but other days it can feel like yoursquore trying to pull a concrete wall.I lost a lot of weight ndash around  kilos but we were expecting that so we put the weight on beforehand. I suffered a little bit of fat loss in my hips and in my ankles just from constant use on all the joints. Itrsquos taken a fair few months to fully recover. We were burning around , calories a day but we only really absorbed about ,. We were reaching , calories in dehydrated food, so we would have porridge with milk and melt the snow to add water. During the day we didnrsquot stop for lunch or anything and we would eat snacks along the way like chocolate, biscuits, flapjacks and lots of nuts.For days it felt like I was looking at the same flat, white surroundings but other times I would look up at the sky and thought that itrsquos just so beautul around here. I was completely in my own head space with nothing to think about apart from skiing. Itrsquos so beautul and your mind feels so free that you are almost moved to tears at times.The army is quite good for equal opportunities and Irsquove never felt that I was being judged because I was a woman.

Yes, the Havergal Prowse MacDonald era was ndash at its peak, and at its best ndash something very special indeed. Some of those still working in theatre in Scotland and beyond learned their trade there, but it was also, to some extent, and crucially for its success, a place apart ndash until Havergal became a key voice in the clamour for a National Theatre of Scotland late in their tenure. It was not hugely surprising that it struggled a little when they departed.But even a cursory acquaintance with the recent history of the Citz should be enough to see that under current artistic director Dominic Hill it has achieved great things, and that Hill has been clever enough to reference the great successes of the past under his illustrious predecessors as well as making sure that his venue is home to the best writing and performing talent of the present. As a director he has been a regular recipient of Scotlandrsquos purr-fect stage gongs, the Criticsrsquo Awards for Theatre in Scotland, winning more often than anyone , most recently for his staging of Zinnie Harrisrsquos brilliant re-imagining of Aeschylus, This Restless House. That production involved both the NTS and the Edinburgh International Festival that being the way to work in the st century, and Hillrsquos Citz is an integrated part of the Scottish artistic infrastructure.Therersquos been much more than that one show, of course.

During his fortnight in Scotland, he and his weDale Evans visited numerous schools and childrenrsquos homes ndash and even took one Edinburgh orphan, Marion Fleming, back to their Calornia ranch to join their growing brood of children.Rogers was coming to make his British stage debut and the excitement had been building for weeks, thanks to newspaper articles mentioning his Scottish ancestry and love of Burns, and a steady drip-feed of stories about Triggerrsquos rumoured hotel accommodation, million dollar insurance policy and travel arrangements.And so it was that for days leading up to Sunday February , staff at Prestwick Airport fielded enquiries from mothers about Triggerrsquos arrival time. When the worldrsquos most famous Palomino pranced down the gangway of his air-conditioned KLM freight plane at noon, he was greeted by the biggest turn-out and most rousing cheer any star had ever had at the airport.There was initial disappointment when the youngsters realised that Rogers wasnrsquot there as well, but -year-old Triggerrsquos natural charisma soon distracted them as he was paraded in front of the crowd before entering his horsebox for the journey into town. Mini cowboys and gals lined the route to the city centre where, as this newspaper reported, ldquothe Central Hotel was surrounded by more and more children as a honeycomb amid an enormous swarm of bees.They had begun to turn up as early as am children as young as five filled Central Station, little clusters of them standing on pillar boxes and draped around other station fixtures to secure the best vantage points. Others were waiting outside. By lunchtime, when Mr and Mrs Rogers slipped into the hotel, having driven from Carlisle in the brand new red Austin Healey they had collected in London two days earlier, the welcome committee of cowboy-crazy kids was well over a thousand.After grabbing a snack of fruit and milk, the couple decided to visit the Empire Theatre to finalise details for their show. As he left, Rogers told one of the publicity men: ldquoI am going out and see these children. Theyrsquove waited long enough.Dressed in white cowboy suit and matching Stetson, with silver pointed shoes, he made a round of the crash barriers, shaking countless outstretched hands.

He bowed on one knee, he nodded ldquoyes and then ldquono, and even managed to give an interview, in which he was full of praise for the police horses who had kept the children safe and hadnrsquot bucked once. After giving Dale Evans a kiss, he left to sign in at another establishment ndash the British Railways stables in Townhead, where he was going to shack up with some friendly Clydesdales.At the first of the weekrsquos sold-out shows the following night, children enjoyed a performance that was, as one review described it, ldquoa vaudeville curiosity ndash half circus, half Sunday School. Not only did Rogers sing a number of songs, accompanied by The Whipperwills vocal quartet, and prompt Triggerto show off his arithmetic and dancing skills, but he also did a spot of fatherly lecturing as he exhorted his fans to always clean their teeth and eat whatever their mothers put in front of them.The adoring youngsters listened attentively ndash when they werenrsquot nipping down to the orchestra pit to hand over gts of sugar and other treats for their four-legged favourite. One tot made a beeline for the band armed with two pistols. Before his grandfather could catch him, he had ldquoshot almost the entire orchestra. Rogers and Evans both chatted to him from the stage, and even invited him to join their shooting act.In an evangelical part of the programme which referred to Billy Graham, the American preacher who would arrive in Scotland later in the month, Dale Evans ndash addressed as ldquoMother ndash and Rogers sang revivalist songs, including Christian Cowboy.Some critics felt that the evangelical message blended in well with the rest of the show while others, including this paperrsquos, argued that ndash as in the movies - a baddie was needed to counter ldquothe all-pervading atmosphere of sweetness, light and fresh laundering. hellip The lsquowheersquo of a hostile arrow, and the paper balls shot down in rapid succession by Mr Rogers seemed no adequate substitute for a Rank Bajin.Between the first and second shows on opening night, Rogers appeared at a window of the theatre and led a singalong of Home On the Range for thousands of fans, most of them small boys on their parentsrsquo shoulders, packed into West Nile Street.Nevertheless, in one of the next dayrsquos papers, a reader, who had been outside the station all afternoon on the Sunday with her three sons, wrote: ldquoI wonder how many mothers, like myself, washed tear-stained faces and promised an extra treat to make up for the disappointment of not seeing Roy Rogers.Hopefully, word reached Rogers of Disgusted of Glasgowrsquos dismay. It would undoubtedly have spurred him into action. One boy whose mother had tried and failed to get tickets to the show was the subject of a story in the Sunday Mail. ldquoLike a prairie fire the news sped through Purdon Street: lsquoDuncan Lowingrsquos got a telegram from Roy Rogers!rsquo Said Mrs Lowing, mother of five-year-old Duncan: lsquoWhen I opened the door, kids were swarming all over the place.rsquo The telegram reads: lsquoBring this telegram to the stage door on Friday evening at .. Roy Rogers.rsquoNot only did the youngster get to meet his hero, but he was given a front row seat for the show. When he offered Rogers his Bible as a present, it was ed to him inscribed by Dale Evans: ldquoRoy and I want you to keep your Bible and read it all your le. It is Godrsquos Holy Word and will guide you right.Crowds, crushes and craziness: Laurel and Hardy in ScotlandItrsquos little wonder that at the Church of Scotland gave Rogers a rave review a few weeks later. The Rev. Frederick Levison told the Edinburgh Presbytery that Rogersrsquos encouragement to children to attend Sunday School was more effective than anything a church leader could say.As for Rogers and Evans, they wrote to a Loanhead boy who had missed their show due to German Measles, that their visit had been ldquoa great blessing to them - though the last night at the Edinburgh Empire might be one theyrsquod have preferred to forget .. For that was when Rogers was reported to have accidentally shot some pellets into Trigger onstage, in front of hundreds of children. A true professional, Trigger received backstage medical treatment ndash and the show carried on.That story may have been disputed, but there is no doubt about the fact that the visit by Roy Rogers and Trigger has become the stuff of local legend in Glasgow and in Edinburgh. Long after their films have been forgotten, their time in Scotland ndash and the brilliant publicity stunts staged to advertise their shows ndash lives on in the collective memory.Alison Kerr is collecting memories about this visit and others.

The numbers involved are startling and mostly beyond dispute and they convey the hope that in an independent Scotland they can form a cornerstone of our future economy.In  our country had a record year for creating eco-friendly energy with more than two-thirds of electricity having been produced from green schemes ndash an increase of  per cent on the year before. According to the Scottish Government this was  percent higher than that produced by the rest of the UK. The picture of Scotland as a renewable Xanadu was enhanced further by % and % increases in wind generation and hydro respectively. We have thus become one of the worldrsquos top countries for providing electricity from non-fossil fuel sources. We produce % of Europersquos tidal and offshore wind resource along the biggest coastline of any other country in the British Isles.Extravagantly optimistic job projections claims in this arena ought to be treated with caution. The opportunity to build a robust and sustainable economy around these figures is undeniable but Scotland has a patchy history in this area owing to questionable employment practices and recent European legislation.There are also some uncomfortable and inconvenient questions to be faced about Britainrsquos previous relationship with the EU and the degree to which trade union protections of workers have been stealthily eroded in this sector. According to one senior Scottish trade union official I spoke with this week ndash and this is a view shared by many of his colleagues in the movement ndash Scotland has become ldquoa bit-part player in our own market and one thatrsquos been dominated by state-subsidised European energy companies and Far East finance.Many of these factors were evident in the lamentable s Scottish workers gained from the manufacturing work on the Beatrice Offshore windfarm on the Moray Firth. Scotland received around % of the manufacturing work for this project which was worth pound.Bn, encompassed  wind turbines and is expected to generate enough electricity to power , homes. Even so, Burntisland Fabrication were supplying only a third of wind turbine jackets and were forced to sack hundreds of workers before receiving a poundm Scottish Government bail-out after it encountered dficulties with one sub-contractor.Ownership of this project was split across companies originating in Portugal, Spain, Japan, France and China. The turbines themselves will be built and delivered by Siemensand Vestaswhile the cabling will be provided by an assortment of firms including Boskalis from the Netherlands. The contracts for the manufacture of the turbine jackets have been awarded to Lamprell, based in the United Arab Emirates and Smelders in Belgium. Unions and industry figures were particularly incensed about the Lamprell contract award. The company ran at a loss on previous UK windfarm projects but the tax and employment advantages they have along with the sovereign wealth fund investment worked in their favour.The Green energy twins to offshore renewable projects in Scotland have been the publicly-funded biomass plants popping up across Scotland, among which the one at Dundee is typical.The city will lose more than , jobs next year with cuts at Michelin and local building firm McGills which went into administration earlier this month. The GMB Union believes that a logical argument for the ersication of those workers would be into construction and trades and thus deliver the vital Energy for Waste project at Baldovie.The ramications have been as profound as Taff Vale in , when it was ruled that trade unions could be liable for a companyrsquos losses arising from strike action. Gordon Brown was foolish and clumsy when he talked about British jobs for British workers. Since then, though, the British left has been sleep-walking as the hard right Brexiteers have exploited unhappiness in working class communities where sustainable wages have been undercut in this way. Itrsquos simplistic and lazy to dismiss those working class people who voted to leave the EU as racist or anti-immigrant. The Viking and Laval rulings should have been a red flag for the Labour Party of how real racists might exploit fears in some communities over the next decade.In Scotland over the last few years we have witnessed a chain of industrial disputes with under-cutting at their source occurring at Polmadie in Glasgowat Dunbar and Millerhill. These occur where large public sector contracts are awarded to overseas firms who then sub-ide and sub-contract the work into tiny and barely-sustainable packages for smaller Scottish firms. Trade unions are locked out and treated with disdain simply for seeking to protect real wages and humane conditions.Recent high-profile disputes in Scotland are portrayed in simplistic ways: Scottish Government and Cosla struggling under UK austerity to make the numbers work unreasonable trade unions being pig-headed. Usually, the unions are seeking to defend their lowest-paid members from wage cuts and seeking to ensure a livelihood sufficient to sustain a family.A class of trouser-press philanthropists has emerged in Scotland in the last  years which gets a fit of the vapours over the defence industry or old sources of energy.

If not that, why not local government finance, in the kind of \"grown-up\" policy-making called for in this very paper  Or making Scotlands education system once more the envy of the world Such major collaborative processes would ensure that all parties take notice of all the problems and take ownership of all the solutions, rather than using both as ammunition in their proxy wars. At the same time, the very act of co-operation will teach the politicians that their opponents are not black-hearted monsters ndash and the SNP may even get to like working with Scottish opinion rather than against it. We can live in hope.Peter A Russell, Munro Road, Jordanhill, Glasgow.IF Finance Secretaries would only recast their roles as prudent, responsible householders, the nations money would be better spent and resources better cared for. Nowadays, the way they behave often suggests that they become rather confused by sitting amidst vast piles of money, almost asit were to be directed for their personal household expenditures.Constant calls and plans for \"new\", additional taxes abound, for tourists, parking, and so on. Claims are made that public services will thereby benefit but existing commitments will likely become the real \"drain\".Thus, we in the UK have embarked, long term, on spending trillions in the vain hope and belief of offsetting adverse global climate events by decarbonisation of home and industry despite contributing negligibly to global greenhouse gas release. Serious questions have arisen about alleged conflicts of interests in the Committee on Climate Change, which is hugely influential in deciding our governments \"green\" spending policies.Secondly, without any moral or evident legal need, our PM has offered pound billion as an EU \"orce sweetener\", which, were it spent, would compromise financial savings in gaining Brexit, depriving outlays on vital national priorities.The rather indiscriminate foreign aid budget, set as a percentage of GDP, has in reality been found dficult to spend on deserving worldwide causes. This means that revision of the policy is vital.Disposals of viable UK businesses in recent years so as to defray national debts, sounds very like \"selling the family silver\", and hardly prudent.The political pay-off to the DUP of Northern Ireland at least keeps the money \"at home\" in the UK.Politicians in the UK, including Scotland, instead of forever seeking enhanced tax s, should rather, surely, aim to cut some of their more profligate, safely-avoidable spending  Charles Wardrop, Viewlands Road West, Perth.THOSE determined to see Scotland leave the UK sooner rather than later are no doubt frustrated that two years of attempting to link the Brexit process with independence has failed to move the balance of public opinion in Scotland. Yet an air of desperation is starting to come through with recent comments. First some more hard-line supporters of Scottish nationalism are openly speculating about the possible use of a Catalan-style referendum that does not have the force of law. At the same time, on the calmer wing of the movement, author of the Growth Commission report Andrew Wilson, is now talking of the ldquosoftest possible form of Scottish independence.Neither ignoring the need for legal authority, nor pretending that breaking up the UK will sound more palatableyou describe it as \"soft\", will do anything positive for Scotland, and its people will see through both ideas as simply shallow gimmicks.Keith Howell,White Moss, West Linton, Peeblesshire.YOU report yet more evidence that the Scottish Government is getting on with the day job, despite the clf-edge Brexit that is approaching, which may well have an impact on our social security system . Scotlandrsquos social security system is in its early years with  per cent of all welfare spend in Scotland being devolved to Holyrood. In the establishment of Scotlandrsquos social security system the Scottish Government has put \"dignity and respect\" to the fore. So it was very satisfying and goes some way to promote those values to learn that each local authority in Scotland will receive a social security team leader and this will be further enhanced by  support workers.The public have no confidence in social security at present due to the Westminster Governmentrsquos shambolic introduction of Universal Credit, so the Scottish Government has much to do with the percentage spend on social security that is being devolved to Holyrood to gain any confidence from the end user. The devolved welfare powers will affect approximately one million benefit claimants in Scotland and those future appointments will realise in excess of  jobs being created through Social Security Scotland with the establishment of Social Security main offices in Glasgow and Dundee a very welcome addition to our jobs market.Catriona C Clark, Hawthorn Drive, Banknock, Falkirk.Read more: Why the UK shouldnt veto a second referendum"},{"url":null,"title":"john-finnie-time-to-park-the-hysteria-over-more-powers-for-local-government","story":"We secured a package of measures that will reform how local government is funded, making taxes fairer and giving public sector workers and the services we all rely on security and stability. Part of that package was Government support for my amendment to the Transport Bill, which aims to give local councils the power to design, consult upon and introduce a workplace parking levythey choose.This modest measure has attracted the combined fury of the Tories, Labour and the Liberal Democrats, aligned together behind a hysterical tabloid campaign that has been misleading at best. To those outside the Holyrood bubble, the cause of the current apoplexy must be baffling.As The Heraldrsquos political editor Tom Gordon observed in these pages last week: ldquoLocal governments across Europe raise and collect numerous taxes. It is the norm. Two decades on, Holyrood should surely be more adult about tax, and let councils get on with it.My proposal is based on powers that local councils in England have had for  years. It was first proposed by the UK Labour government but removed by the Labour-LibDem Scottish Executive when they caved in to pressure from the business lobby. It has been implemented by a Labour-run council in England, and Labour councillors in Edinburgh have called for it. Lib Dem MSPs used to support devolving such power but are now inexplicably opposed to it.The Toriesrsquo knee-jerk reaction was predictable but for Labour and the LibDems to perform such a rapid hand-brake turn reeks of opportunism. They are happy to play along by talking about ldquoThe levy proposed by the SNP and the Greens... when there is no proposed levy.Why would political parties who claim to be concerned about air pollution, climate change and local democracy rage against such a win-win policy  Could it be that they actually distrust localism The Scottish Greens believe in local decision-making. We want to rebuild local democracy in Scotland so that communities have more control to address the issues that affect them, just like local government in most other European countries. Powers to introduce a Workplace Parking Levy where appropriate ndash and powers to introduce a tourist tax, which we also secured as part of the budget negotiations ndash are small steps towards this vision. Once introduced, however, itrsquos not for MSPs in Holyrood to develop such schemes. That is the job of local government, who understand and are able to engage with their communities, and are able to tailor policy so that it has the impact it needs to have.Is it any wonder that public trust in politicians generally is so low, when some parties so readily misrepresent and exaggerate  And all to cover their own unwillingness to engage constructively in a parliament of minorities, where every day presents an opportunity to help our communities. Mind you, public trust in local councillors is greater than for members of parliament, so perhaps itrsquos a case of jealousy from certain MSPs that explains their irrational desire to hoard powers centrally.As for the actual benefits of a parking levy, should a local council decide itrsquos an option they wish to pursue, letrsquos remember the public health crisis we face in towns and cities across Scotland.Traffic fumes are linked to poor mental health, reduced intelligence among children in polluted areas, and a record number of asthma deaths. Air pollution is linked with around , early deaths a year in the UK. On top of that, road congestion costs the UK economy nearly poundbn a year.In Nottingham, the decision to levy a charge on large employers came about after transport officers found that congestion was a signicant problem in the city during peak commuter times. The charge of pound per year per space is passed on to half of the car drivers affected. There are exemptions for emergency service workers and Blue Badge holders, and an extensive business support package.The council has ensured alternatives such as car clubs and bike hire, travel planning support, and integrated ticketing for public transport. It has resulted in a big sht toward public transport, walking and cycling. Climate change emissions are down by a third. Revenue of more than poundmillion has been raised and reinvested in the cityrsquos transport infrastructure.Campaigners and academics this week wrote to all five Scottish political leaders in frustration at some partiesrsquo attempts to mislead and spread hoods about an idea that has been shown to deliver benefits to public health, the environment and the economy. Organisations such as WWF and the Confederation of Passenger Transport see the opportunity presented by my amendment. I look forward to delivering a power local government in Scotland should have had long ago. It will bring us a step closer to a transport system fit for the future.John Finnie MSP is Transport spokesperson for the Scottish GreensRead more: pound fines a day warning"},{"url":null,"title":"who-organised-the-student-climate-strikes","story":"Youth Strike  Climate is the official name of the strikes, which attracted an estimated , people to street demonstrations around the UK.The event is co-organised by the UK Student Climate Network and the UK Youth Climate Coalition, which are both based in London.Both say they are led by students and young people who are passionate about climate justice.

If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

Whether it’s our personal information on social media or important financial details, it’s vital that we’re aware of how to keep our safe and secure from cyber criminals.”“By really getting under the skin of these hackers, our Cyber Sense workshops can point out how to understand how these iniduals work. Through the games we’ve designed, attendees will be able to competitively play roles on both sides of a cyber-crime. This offers a unique perspective that can show just what preventative measures can be taken to outsmart these online criminals.”To learn more about the Cyber Sense on Tour event and to book a free place, visit www.hellodigital.scot cyber-sense- copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While some famous people admit to drug-fuelled orgies or drink-soaked violence, Theresa May this week revealed she has been known to scrape the mould off the top of a jar of jam, as long as no one is looking.In the league table of misdemeanours, it probably sits alongside running through a field of wheat or licking the mixing bowl but it did have a serious intent. The Prime Minister was discussing ways of reducing food waste and pointed out a thin layer of mould on the top of the jam should not consign the jar to the bin. That might be what the rest of us would do but as her commitment to a Brexit deal few want proves, she is nothingnot tenacious.Our upcoming exit from the European Union and concerns about resulting food shortages have helped put food waste back on the menu. Every year around £ million worth of food is wasted in Scotland’s hospitality sector. Around  per cent of this is estimated to be perfectly good food left over at the end of the meal.: Scotland’s national chef Gary Maclean gives top tips for reducing food wasteThis week Zero Waste Scotland renewed its campaign urging more restaurant customers to take leftovers home. Research shows nearly half of diners in Scotland are currently too shy to ask for a doggy bag. That may be down to not wanting to appear mean or not fancying walking about town afterwards with a tinfoil handbag smelling of smoked haddock.Zero Waste Scotland want to change that dynamic and make it cool to ask for leftover restaurant food to go. Why wouldn’t it be  The only judgement about someone asking for a doggy bag should be that they are environmentally aware and not stupid enough to throw away good food they have paid for.Of course restaurants can help make this easier by asking customersthey would like to take food home when plates are cleared. They can also then present it in smart, attractive packaging instead of the tinfoil dishes most familiar from dodgy backstreet takeaways. Away from restaurants, our food waste in the home is also staggering with campaign groups estimating up to  million tonnes of food is binned in the UK every year. Most of this is household waste and it’s estimated about  per cent of that could be avoided.: Brexit: To expats in EUlt the UK sounds like it’s preparing for war – Alastair StewartInitiatives like Locavore are offering a dferent way of doing things.

Jeremy Corbyn is an enthusiastic producer of homemade jam with raspberry top of his list. A Labour spokesman said it is so delicious, it doesn’t survive long enough to develop any mould.

It sustains and nurtures our lives, refreshes our spirit and is central to our national identity. We all have a duty and responsibility to protect it – for its own sake but also because the success of our nation depends on it. It is vital to our well-being and achieving a sustainable, inclusive economy.I am proud of the bold, imaginative action people across Scotland are taking to protect our environment and help our country to become a world leader on global environmental issues. From communities tackling the litter on their streets to local beach cleans, people across the country are embracing grassroots action to help protect our environment.However, our momentum cannot be undermined. Despite the on-going chaos created by Brexit, we must keep a clear focus on the challenges and opportunities that will influence the health of our environment in the coming years.Ever since the referendum on EU membership in , I have been concerned that our natural environment may be at risk under future trade relationships. EU membership has enabled us to apply high and improving environmental standards to the benefit of our most precious natural assets. The EU provides a system of environmental protection, agreed across a community of  million people. These standards exist hand in hand with the single market and customs union. All member states keep to the same standards, and trade arrangements ensure that these standards are not undercut by imports and that there is no downward spiral to lower environmental standards to make cheaper goods. To ensure the effectiveness of this system, environmental standards are backed by credible enforcement by EU authorities.: Joyce McMillan: Why it’s time to panic about climate changeWe face losing so much from leaving the EU, but this must not come at the expense of Scotland’s environment. Although the people of Scotland did not want to be in this position, it is Scotland’s business to secure our environment for the future. The Scottish Government has committed to maintain or exceed current EU environment standards.This is essential to secure all the benefits a healthy natural environment brings to our economy and society, and to protect the treasures of our environment for generations to come.The future relationship between the UK and the EU is still uncertain and the UK Government remains unable to provide much needed clarity about the future. My choice would be to remain fully within EU governance systems. However, as a responsible government, we need to prepare for whatever the future brings. That is why, today, I am publishing a consultation to gather views on the best approach to underpinning future environmental standards. We need to ensure that our policies continue to reflect the four key environmental principles that have formed a solid foundation for EU law.We need to secure clear, appropriate governance arrangements to challenge the Scottish Government and public authoritieswe fall short of our obligations. These governance arrangements must complement the existing role of Parliament in holding Government to account and respect the role of the Scottish courts in interpreting and upholding the law.Moreover, we must have a role in developing future trade agreements as they will affect so many devolved policy areas, including the environment. It is vital that these agreements include full mutual respect for environmental standards in order to prevent a race to the bottom.: Global cardon dioxide emissions rise to new record high in The Scottish Government has been clear that powers in currently devolved areas like the environment must transfer directly to the Scottish Parliament in the event of withdrawal from the EU. However, during the passage of the European UnionAct  there were sustained efforts by UK Government to introduce wide-ranging restrictions on currently devolved powers.Maintaining environmental standards is a matter for Scotland. While we will continue to work with our partners across the UK where this is in our best interests, we need to find solutions that meet Scotland’s unique aims and ambitions.Having broken our relationship with the EU, the UK Government must not be allowed to use that resulting damage as a reason to creep into devolved areas.It is right that we take this systematic approach to safeguarding Scotland’s environment in the event of an EU exit. I will not, however, allow Brexit uncertainty to derail our ambitions for the future.I have been leading a discussion on Scotland’s environment strategy to define our long term, guiding ambitions for the environment and our role in tackling global challenges. It will provide the setting within which our future environment governance will work. I launched an online discussion last year seeking views on these ambitions and on the evidence base that supports decisions on future priorities for action. I was pleased to see so many people engage in this discussion and today I am publishing an independent analysis of the responses.The strategy will demonstrate how a healthy environment is fundamental to the well-being, equality and prosperity of Scotland’s people. It will therefore be vital to take time to engage widely during its development, to ensure it reflects these wider impacts and works for all of Scotland. This work will be undertaken in close connection with the development of future arrangements for environmental principles and governance.Protecting our environment and fulfilling our role in tackling global challenges is a moral obligation and one that the Scottish Government is fully committed to – whether by ensuring the right and proper environmental governance is in place, as a necessary but unfortunate part of our EU exit preparations, or by progressing our ambitions to develop an environmental strategy that will safeguard our environment for generations to come.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"youth strike 4 climate change should spur adults into action leader comment","story":"The Youth Strike  Climate Change campaign shows children have a better understanding of the science # and the urgency of the situation # than many adults.Schoolchildren going on ‘strike’ is an idea to which The Scotsman is fundamentally opposed.

And yet the actions that have been pledged by the nations of the world to address the problem fall far short of what is required to prevent the situation becoming dangerous on a global scale.Children have been learning about the science of climate change in school and, clearly, are aghast at this pitul state of affairs and the recklessness of adults who should know better.: Thousands of UK school pupils and students strike over inaction on climate changeThe basics of that science are simple and well-understood.

Global warming was predicted in the late th century by a Nobel Prize-winning chemist.As our columnist Susan Dalgety points out today, the teenagers leading the school strike campaign in Europe are winning praise from some influential people. Hillary Clinton, the former US Secretary of State, tweeted that “something extraordinary is happening in Europe – and perhaps soon in America. Teen girls are leading a movement to stop climate change”.Nicola Sturgeon also chided the journalist Toby Young – who dismissed the school strike as “idiotic” and “self-important” – by tweeting: “Some adults seem determined today to show exactly why we should be listening more to young people.”And the reason we should listen to them is that they have been listening to the scientists. Too many adults, perhaps set in their ways, have closed their minds to the warnings from researchers working in a host of dferent fields – from physics to chemistry to biology – or downplayed the need for radical change.

She will continue to seek those legally binding changes to the backstop that will enable Parliament to support our deal.“The one problem with last night’s vote is that it allows the EU to continue with this pretence that they don’t know what we want.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/WINTER-19-ROADS-1.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

Until now.All these club names have representation in the Scottish women#s under- squad which flew out to Portugal this week to take on three matches in an international development cup.And proudly flying the flag for the Western Isles women#s team is Rachael Johnstone, a -year-old goalkeeper from Balallan with a steely focus on forging a successful career in the ever-improving world of women#s football.Sport-daft Rachael took her first footballing steps while attending Stornoway Primary, where she says coach Gordon MacRae gave her huge encouragement to play.She started as an outfield player but began playing as goalkeeper for Stornoway Aths juniors in her first year at high school. She continues to train and play at the island#s capital club, as well as with the Western Isles women#s squad.Progress has been swt, and Rachael first featured for the Scotland under-s last year. Her performances have also caught the eye of the Celtic women#s team and she was recently invited to join the club#s national performance squad for a year#s trial. last week. #I can fly down and be in Glasgow on a Friday and fly back to be in school on Monday morning. It#s hard work, but I love sport and I#m determined to keep improving and go as far as I can in the game.#Being selected for the Scotland under-s makes me really proud # it#s insane really. It#s not really kicked in yet, and probably won#t until I am out on the field.#Rachael was in the starting line-up for the Scotland under-s opening match against the Netherlands on Thursday. Paul Brownlie#s side drew -, before going on to narrowly lose - on penalties. Their next match sees them take on hosts Portugal on Saturday before they conclude the three-match tour with a match against Germany on Monday.Mum Rhona was also making the journey to cheer Rachael on. She said: #I#m very proud. You always encourage them, but you don#t ever expect your children to be asked to represent their country. It#s a huge honour and I just want to support her as much as I can.#Rachael, who is a fourth-year pupil at Sir E Scott School in Tarbert in Harris, said she owed a big debt to local coaches Euan and Jenna MacLeod for their advice and encouragement as well as to her school for allowing her time off to pursue her footballing dream.Another of Rachael#s ambitions is to represent the Western Isles at the World Island Games # an event which has been pivotal in fostering women#s football in the Hebrides.#Ever since I was about seven it#s been my goal to make the Western Isles team and to go to the Island Games # that would be a huge thing for me,# added Rachael, who identied Scotland under- goalkeeper Lee Alexander as a key influence and role model, and star Scotland and Cha midfielder Erin Cuthbert as possibly her favourite player.As far as the future goes, Rachael says her priority is simply to keep learning the game, but she has already developed a keen sense of what it takes to be a top keeper.#Mindset is really important for a goalkeeper,# she added. #You need to keep the head up and keep going. If you let a goal in, you have to learn how to deal with it. Commitment is also really important.#My dream would be to get a pro contract, and be full-time in football. I just want to keep going to a higher level, and get more caps # that#s my ultimate goal.#"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1433384.jpg--.jpg?1549442071000\n","title":"cambridge house schoolfriends collaborate for charity single","story":"A BALLYMENA writer and his singer schoolfriend have teamed up to release a new single, the proceeds of which will be donated to a mental health charity.Daryl Ball and Marc Little both attended Cambridge House and both became involved in the arts in later le - but are now joining forces thanks to a chance encounter with a book.Daryl, who records as a solo artist as well as being a member of the Ballymena band Stripped, explained: An old schoolfriend Marc Little had a book of poetry published in .Its called Out Of Darkness and it was a very personal collection by Marc dealing with dficult yet common subjects like anxiety and depression.I bought a copy last year and really enjoyed his writing style as well as being very moved by the honesty in his poetry. “They inspired me to write a song on subject.I contacted Marc to ask would he mindI used words from two of his poems to create a new song.He was excited by the idea of working together and I agreed to send a rough demo to make sure he was happy with my treatment of it before proceeding.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

But that is just one aspect of an ambitious multi-phase redevelopment project at the site.“The building had been lying empty for about five years and we are now turning it into a new facility to house everything that the charity does under one roof,” explained Via Wings founder Gail Redmond.Having previously rented premises in the town, the charity worked hard on fundraising projects for several years and received two signicant financial gts which allowed it to buy a building. In  an offer was put in to purchase the former pub, and in September last year they finally moved in to the charity’s new home and began renovations to turn the building into a community facility.

Redmondshows Halax representatives Alan McLachlan and Gillian Boyd around the charitys new social enterprise shop, Wings n Things.“Mrs McFadden would have done a lot of work for charity within our town and in the local community so we really have brought that sense of community back in here,” Ms Redmond explained.Over the past six months charity staff and volunteers have been busy turning the run down pub building into a vibrant community hub which now houses a food parcel distribution project, a catering and education programme for vulnerable adults and those with learning dficulties and a senior citizens’ lunch club. Via Wings at Wellington House also provides space for after schools and parent and toddler groups, a monthly supper club and games nights, as well as volunteer and employment opportunities for many isolated and vulnerable members of the local community.Yesterday the charity held a special event to mark the opening of its new shop Wings ‘n’ Things, which will sell shabby chic and new craft items made by local crafters.Among the guests at the celebration were representatives from the Halax Foundation, which has provided funding for Via Wings to help it expand its Dare  Care project, which distributes food parcels to people in need.Thanking the Halax Foundation for providing £, towards the salary of a project manager, Ms Redmond said: “Their funding has enabled us to run the project much more efficiently because it has grown from a cupboard-sized project into a three-centred project.“We now provide food parcels to around  families every month, which averages out at about  people.Discovery of mans body sparks murder probePolice called to deal with agitated male carrying alleged offensive weapon Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DROM | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DROM | Article Teaser\"“As the number of people using our foodstore increases month-on-month the manager’s role is essential and the funding from the Halax Foundation ensures that we can continue to expand and develop the foodstore.”Gillian Boyd, trustee of the Halax Foundation NI, commented: “The Halax Foundation for Northern Ireland is delighted to support the important work of Via Wings. This particular award will enable the organisation to help those who are most vulnerable in their local community. We wish them every success in the future.”So far half of the old pub building has been renovated and Via Wings at Wellington House now boasts new offices, counselling rooms and a conference room. But that’s not the end of the redevelopment work.The charity is in the process of constructing a new coffee shop with a sensory garden and play area, which should be open within the next few months. And it also has long-term plans to redevelop another section of the building and create a wellbeing centre.“The wellbeing centre is going to be phase four,” Ms Redmond continued. “It would be our passion to have it up and running by the end of the year, but that will depend on fundraising and securing the necessary funding.“We hope the centre will help people – men and women – learn to live with their mental health.

It is time for an all-Ireland conversation and forum to look to the future... To define a new and united Ireland,” she said.DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said Sinn Fein is more focused on a poll than a sensible Brexit deal. “Indeed, judging by their hard border rhetoric, Sinn Fein seem to be cheerleaders for a ‘no deal ‘exit.” he said.And UUP MLA Doug Beattie said that with health and education “on their knees,” a poll would “further ision and instability”. But TUV leader Jim Allister said Mr Varadkar is only stalling because he wants the backstop in place first, “as the republican building block it is”.Alliance leader Naomi Long was open to a poll, but agreed with the SDLP that “the time is not right” due to Brexit.

After giving the matter some thought, Squinter has been unable to separate two candidates, and so the prize is jointly awarded. First co-winner is Andrea Leadsom, Tory Leader of the House, for her reaction to Donald Tusk’s statement that there’s “a special place in hell” for those who promoted Brexit “without a sketch of a plan”.Andrea’s response was rather more temperate than that of Sammy Wilson, who opined that Mr Tusk was a “devilish, trident wielding, euro maniac”. She remarked, with what would appear at first blush to be commendable restraint: “The man has no manners.”But on hearing Andrea’s mention of the word “manners”, a little bell went off somewhere deep in Squinter’s hippocampus and after a short period of beard-scratching and pencils-sucking, it came to Squinter why the Honourable Member is on rather thin ice when it comes to matters of polite conduct.Come back in time with Squinter to the summer of , just two weeks before Britain voted to leave the EU. Andrea was locked in a battle with Theresa May for leadership of the Conservative Party. In an interview with The Times, when asked why the party should opt for her, she replied that her rival “possibly has nieces, nephews, lots of people. But I have children who are going to have children who will directly be part of what happens next.”So there we have it. Andrea pitched for the top job by saying having children gives her more of a stake in the country. At which point, we should remind ourselves that Theresa May has spoken honestly and movingly about the fact that she and her husband Philip were unable to have children.Manners  Yih pays yer money…Joint winner is British Transport Secretary Chris Grayling who announced on Friday that he was cancelling the £ million contract he had awarded to Seaborne Freight just before Christmas to provide a ferry service from Ramsgate to Ostend to ease the pressure on the port of Dover should the UK crash out with no deal.Mr Grayling’s tenure has been one of the great comedy shows of British politics and it’s widely believed that he remains in office only to direct fire away from more senior colleagues. Not that he could have seen this mess developing. After all, Seaborne Freight was a highly respected company with a long history of professional and responsible conduct in the business of ferries and freight, right  Well, since the company only hit the news in December you probably don’t need Squinter to remind you that Seaborne Freight:• Was a completely new company• Didn’t own a ship• Cut and pasted its website terms and conditions from a pizza delivery firmand an online boutiqueThe high-flying cabinet minister sent out to back Grayling when the contract was scrubbed was Communities Secretary James Brokenshire. You know, the bloke was Secretary of State here for a while and nobody noticed.Chris’ll be gone by the end of the week, then.Fail to prepare#LET’S be honest, Jim Wells isn’t flavour of the month within the DUP. The South Down MLA had the party whip withdrawn last spring after he fell out with the top brass over his claim that they had reneged on a promise to reinstate him as Health Minister after he stepped down in  over an election hustings row.Jimbo claimed then party leader party leader Peter Robinson promised to reinstate him when andthe furious furoreblew over . He further alleged that when Arlene Foster took over as leader she ignored two written requests from him to honour Peter’s pledge. These days Jimbo’s something of a voice in the wilderness, technically still a DUP MLA but shorn of any authority to speak for the party. Which makes him of considerable interest to journalists, since the resentment he clearly still feels makes him a little bit more willing to open up about things than other DUP reps.Jim’s been at it again this week and, given the state we’re in at the moment, you’ll probably not be surprised to hear that it’s Brexit-related. Jim revealed that at the extraordinary meeting at which the party decided to back Leave in the months leading up to the EU referendum in , there was zero discussion of what a Leave vote would mean for the local economy. This would be an awkward revelation for most parties, but after the tsunami of controversies that the DUP has been through in the past couple of years, it seems to have reached the point that its brand is so polluted the tin can’t get any more dented, the label any dirtier. But that’s not the disaster that it would certainly be for any other party because the DUP’s substantial vote clearly consists of people who don’t care what they get up to as long as they’re not Sinn Féin.Lack of planning – it’ll do for ye every time. Fail to prepare, prepare to fail, that’s the old saying and nowhere does it ring more true than in the crazy world of Brexit. Let’s take a look at a few of the most notorious failures of a lack of foresight and seewe can work out where the DUP Brexit calamity fits in…Betamax’Member when video cassettes were the most exciting innovation in the history of technology  You don’t  Well, you must be under , so let’s seewe can explain. Two Japanese giants of the global electronics industry were caught up in the race to win control of the massive new market. JVC produced the eventually successful VHS format, while Sony produced the toploading Betamax system. Although the Betamax system was of a superior picture quality, it was considerably more expensive and had a shorter recording time. At a meeting in , Sony were advised by Matsushita engineers to switch to the VHS format, but declined. It wa a historic mistake, dealing the company a crippling financial blow from which it would take years to recover.Ford EdselFord were inordinately pleased with the Edsel, a new model released in the United States in , the year after the Ford family relinquished control of the company. The Edselwas designed to give Ford the upper-hand in the highly competitive premium intermediate market . The company missed the design boat, though, as the car harked back to an earlier age at a time when families were increasingly turning to compact vehicles. The Edsel was discontinued two years later, with sales signicantly less than half the break-even sales figure. Executives took their eye off the ball and didn’t realise the Edsel was flopping until over .bnhad been spent on design, manufacture and new dealerships. To this day, new models that fail are still referred to in the US automobile market as ‘Edsels’.New CokeIn the mid-s, as other soft drinks were increasingly threatening the dominance of Coca-Cola, the company decided it was going to ditch the original Coke formula and go with an improved ‘New Coke’.The  launch was a disaster and sales were badly hit, particularly in the southern states where Coca-Cola was considered an integral part of American culture. Tens of thousands of complaints flooded into company HQ weekly. The problem was not so much with the taste – the company had disastrously underestimated the hold that the Coca-Cola brand had on the American psyche. Smelling blood, rivals Pepsi began a new ad campaign with the strapline ‘Now I Know Why Coke Did It’ . Fans started booing ads for New Coke at large sports events. Just  days after New Coke was launched, the company announced that it was bringing back the old formula.Has to be a Brexit message in there somewhere, no "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-13.55.54.png","title":"eye on the past february","story":"RUC men sided with loyalist strikers last MayA SECRET memo prepared by British army intelligence has revealed that senior RUC men were closely involved with the Ulster Workers’ Council strike last May.The memo, prepared for Whitehall ministers some time ago, shows also that unormed members of the RUC “connived at and assisted with the maintenance of UWC and UDA roadblocks”.Referring to Special Branch actions during the strike the report says: “Co-opted personnel were isolated from information on events by being sent on routine tasks or being given rest days.”The ‘co-opted personnel’ referred to are Special Branch men recruited by British military intelligence to keep an eye on what is happening within the Special Branch.“As a result a ally clear picture of RUC reliability area by area has not emerged,” says the report.And it goes on to say that RUC activity of a routine nature appears to have failed by as much as  per cent.It goes on to predict that in a situation where there were large scale attacks on the Catholic population  per cent of the Special Branch would throw their weight behind loyalist gangs. A copy of the report, which was prepared as a briefing document for ministers in the Wilson Government, found its way into the hands of a number of journalists in London recently.Besides casting considerable doubt on the loyalty of the RUC to the British Government it claims that  to  per cent of the UDR could be regarded as hostile during a doomsday situation.BRITISH military policemen are being trained for civilian duties at a military training camp in Kent and it is believed that a large number of them will be drafted into Belfast and Derry within the next few weeks.The British Redcaps are expected to be used in areas like Falls and Andersonstown to take over from infantry patrols which will be withdrawn from the street.A number of UDR men from the thBattalion have attended a two-week course at the same camp and one report suggests that they may be used to form the nucleus of a ‘community police force’ in Belfast for a trial period. There have been two previous attempts to phase in military policemen to civilian duties. In the Bogside area of Derry they were withdrawn after a few days because of resistence by local people.Price sisters’ lives threatenedTHE Prisoners’ Aid Committee in London has said it is concerned about the safety of Irish political prisoners in British jails because “there is evidence of systematic victimisation by prison authorities and attempts to create hostility among other prisoners.”According to the PAC the Price sisters’ lives have been threatened by prisoners in Durham Jail. Since Christmas seven Irish prisoners have been ‘arbitarily’ moved to prisons far away from their families and another Irish prisoner’s cell has been set on fire. Officially the Home Office would not comment on the allegations but other sources firmly rejected them as being completely unfounded. There was nothing unusual in prisoners being moved to other jails under the nomal “dispersal systems”, they said.Since being transferred to the women’s wing of Durham from Brixton Prison, London, Dolours and Marion Price have been put on dferent floors in dference parts of the wing, the PAC statement said. The reason given by a deputy governor, Miss Ford, for the separation was “security”.The PAC said that the cells to which the sisters were moved were filfthy.The PAC said that in a letter to their father, the sisters said that their lives had been threatened by other prisoners all of whom were in need of medical treatment, some being “drug addicts or sex perverts”. They are being “continually harassed” by short-term prisoners, who wanted information to try to sell stories about the girls to newspapers, the statement said.“They have asked to be separated from Judith Ward, whose behaviour is bizarre, but Marion has been put into the neighbouring cell to this prisoner. Despite the fact that the Home Office describes Durham as a top security prison, Dolours and Marion and Judith Ward, are the only Category A prisoners there.“The other  prisoners in the women’s wing are Category C and they subject the girls to continuous anti-Irish abuses and obscenities. Miss Ford, the deputy governor, has instructed them to associate with these prisoners, although some of them have threatened to poision the Price sisters’ food. The families are complainning to the Home Office about the treatment of Mr Price and Mrs Claire Murphy, the girls’ sister, by Miss Ford on their last two visits. This treatment represents a marked worsening of prisoner attitudes from that of the prison staff in Brixton where the girls were during their hunger-strike.”Pay rise for home helpsHOME helps in the Andersonstown areas who were threatening strike action some months ago have just been given a big pay rise.The new rate for the job, which paid only p per hour this time last year, has climbed to p.After the reorganisation of local government services home helps who were working in the Antrim County Council area protested that they were being paid p an hour less than colleagues who were working in the area formerly controlled by Belfast Corporation.In some parts of Andersonstown women working within a hundred yards of each other were being paid at rates which were   p dferent.A pay rationalisation last December by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board, which now controls the district’s home helps, brought all of the women’s pay up to a standard rate of p per hour.Most of the women work at least ten hours per week, with the average time spent looking after old and housebound people being around  hours.Local Ads in paperPAULA’S Glen Road Shopping CentreLadies and Children’s Outfitters.

For me the most encouraging thing is that for the last three years weve shown progress year-on-year,\" he added.Mr Donnan said Ulster Banks primary concern around Brexit has been to ensure it will be in a position to support its customers whatever the scenario after March .\"We are preparing for the worst-case scenario so we can provide continuity of service to our customers,\" he said.He said larger businesses here have been active in preparing themselves for Brexit, with many stockpiling, establishing bases in the Republic or creating subsidiaries over the border.\"As we get closer to the time-line, we are seeing some businesses holding off on some capital expenditure,\" he added.But Mr Donnan said small businesses face a more dficult conundrum.\"The outcome is so uncertain. To make fundamental changes to try and second-guess an outcome is challenging for small businesses,\" he said.While somewhat reluctant to enter the political fray, the Ulster Bank boss reiterated the necessity for businesses to be given certainty.\"I would just encourage people to work together and move forward to get decisions made,\" he said.\"Where there has been a delay in making signicant decisions, whether thats around infrastructure or medium term strategy around skills or the programme for government, the delays of those will have an opportunity cost for Northern Ireland in the longer-term.\"Mr Donnan also confirmed that the lender will not shut any branches this year.

All bear striking similarities, with diggers used to tear machines from the walls, often in the early hours of the morning.Now concerns have been raised that local communities will pay the priceretailers remove outdoor ATMs from their premises due to the thefts. Retail NI chief executive Glynn Roberts saidthe raids continue, stores could act.He is due to meet with senior police officers later this month to press for a taskforce to tackle the criminal gangs responsible. He said the situation is all the more alarming as a series of bank closures in recent years has left people increasingly dependent on ATMs.Mr Roberts said: \"With four ATM robberies in the past month, these attacks are now a major problem for local retailers. \"With so many bank branch closures in rural towns and villages in recent years, ATMs provide an invaluable service to their local communities.\"There is a real danger that retailers in rural areas will start to withdraw their ATMs and the real loser will be the local community. Many people depend on these machines to access cash and to receive benefits or pensions.\"In the latest incident, reported around .am yesterday, a digger was used to remove an ATM from the wall of a filling station near Omagh.The ATM was stolen from the Glendale Service Station at Killyclogher Road at around .am. The digger used to remove the machine was found at the scene, and signicant damage was caused to the wall of the business premises. CCTV footage of the incident shows it took just  seconds for the thieves to rip the cash machine from the wall and place it into a trailer before making their getaway. A spokesperson for the business, which has been operating for over  years, said they were determined to get up and running again as soon as possible. Sinn Fein MLA Declan McAleer condemned those responsible.\"Glendale shop and filling station on the outskirts of Omagh is a family-owned business which provides a vital service for the community,\" he said.\"This is the latest attack of this kind in the community after a similar incident in nearby Killyclogher and others in recent years at Fintona, Carrickmore, Garvaghey and Greencastle.\"Omagh DUP councillor Errol Thompson said: \"Glendale has been here for many years and we want to see the family continuing to do business in this area for many more years to come.\"Hopefully they will not be deterred and rise up again.\" West Tyrone SDLP MLA Daniel McCrossan has expressed concern over the lack of PSNI prosecutions in relation to ATM thefts. \"There has been a scourge of ATM thefts across Northern Ireland recently and many of these have happened in Tyrone,\" he said. \"I do have concern that so many of these thefts are happening yet I am seeing very little in terms of arrests, prosecutions and indeed preventative action by the PSNI. \"I have written to the Chief Constable to demand action.\" PSNI Detective Chief Inspector David Henderson said: \"Each incident has followed a very similar process of targeting premises, before using plant machinery to remove ATMs from the exterior façade. This caused signicant damage to the property, as well as causing disruption to the business targeted and the local community.\"At this stage, officers are investigating the possibility that these incidents may be linked. Enquiries are continuing and we continue to work hard to identy the perpetrators.\"At present, Criminal Investigation Department detectives across Northern Ireland have been tasked to investigate these incidents and are proactively progressing enquiries, to identy and apprehend those involved.\"I would appeal to the community to be vigilant to this type of crime and to report any suspicious vehicles or activity oryou hear machinery operating either late at night or early in the morning.\" The PSNI said that over the last six months, there have been six reports of ATM thefts across Northern Ireland. Earlier this month, three cash machines were stolen - two from an Asda supermarket in Antrim and another at a Spar filling station on the Glenavy Road near Moira - within  hours. In January, an attempted robbery at a Spar store on the Old Mountfield Road near Killyclogher, four miles from the latest attack, was foiled when neighbours rushed to the scene and shouted at the thieves.The previous month a built-in cash machi ne was taken from a shop on Tattymoyle Road in Fintona using a digger which was set alight afterwards.

We want more than that.“There is no appetite to go around on a merry-go-round again in a circular conversation that winds up with the DUP either unable to deliver an accommodation or unwilling to deliver solutions to what are very legitimate asks, made in the spirit of equality and the spirit of powersharing.”The republican leader continued: “We are open to any credible proposition but we will not participate in anything that amounts to a sham.“People two years on deserve so much more than that, so much better.”I dont think Brexit should prevent us from having a government in Northern IrelandArlene FosterFacebookTwitterWith the UK Government reluctant to reintroduce direct rule from Westminster, Northern Ireland has operated in a political limbo land for two years, with senior civil servants being left to run public services.Those civil servants are seriously hamstrung, with ongoing uncertainty over what decisions they are able to make in the absence of elected ministers.As a consequence, numerous governmental decisions are in abeyance with many major policy initiatives in cold storage.Mrs Foster called on Sinn Fein to get “serious” about restoring the institutions.“We need devolution back in Northern Ireland,” she said as she arrived for the talks with party MEP Diane Dodds.“It should have been back in after March , after that election.“It didn’t and it’s a source of great frustration at this point, not just for us but for the whole population of Northern Ireland, that we are still talking about talks rather than actually dealing with government issues.”Mrs Foster reiterated that her party would go back into devolved government immediately, insisting the outstanding political disputes could be resolved in parallel.Many believe the prospects of an imminentto powersharing are bleak, with the crisis seemingly in drt as political attention focuses on Brexit.Mrs Foster said that did not need to be the case, insisting the Brexit process should not be a barrier to restoring powersharing.“I don’t think Brexit should prevent us from having a government in Northern Ireland,” she said.“I wish that we had had a government up and running since March , that’s when we should have been back into government, instead, because Sinn Fein has refused to go back in, we have to deal with that.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The UK is leaving the European Union The DUP leader expressed hope that there would be a Brexit deal before March .“We want to see a deal in relation to Brexit because we believe a deal that works for the whole United Kingdom and one that deals for the European Union is good for everybody,” she said.On Brexit, Mrs McDonald said: “Brexit sets the scene and the tone for everything that happens now in Irish politics.“Here in the North people voted to remain, as Arleneis well aware, she defies that democratic decision, she advocates what, in our view, is a very, very reckless position in respect of Brexit.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37821795.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/7_National_Trust_me.jpg","title":"wells bars dup pair from his social media sites over lgbt vote","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

These are personal sites, they are not party sites.”Mr Wells continued: “I can decide who I want and who I don’t, and I certainly don’t wish to hear either Councillor Cathcart or Councillor Smith coming out with their pro-LGBT comments.”While Mr Wells remains a DUP MLA and party member, he himself has had the party whip suspended from him for the past  months.The DUP withdrew the whip from the veteran politician early last year over his outspoken criticism of the party leadership, accusing it of “hanging him out to dry” over his conservative views.Mr Cathcart declined to respond to Mr Wells’s comments.Both Mr Smith and the DUP have yet to respond to Mr Wells’ remarks."},{"url":null,"title":"staff morale undermined over nounion recognition","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mrs Mitchell explained that following her sonrsquos death, his owed back pay from the Army would have settled the debt.The soldierrsquos mother also revealed that he had told her about two incidents in Afghanistan which had upset him.In one of them, he had been due to be the soldier at the front of the patrol but was swapped with a colleague at the last minute. The soldier who replaced him subsequently suffered severe leg injuries in an attack.Mrs Mitchell also told the inquest that towards the end of , her son had become hyper vigilant, confided in her less, was jumpy and struggled to sleep.She described how he had successfully applied for his ldquodream job in the Army as an outdoor instructor, explaining this had involved undertaking courses in the UK, Spain and Germany which left him very tired.The soldierrsquos mother also described how her son had felt isolated after a knee injury held him back from joining his unit in Afghanistan, and instead had to serve with a dferent unit.She said that when he ed to Ballykinlar and the new job, he continued to feel isolated as a number of soldiers were taking redundancy at that time.ldquoEverything hit him at that precise moment.

But she did not realise that her living in Cardf, away from family and friends, would take such a toll on her.ldquoI was just very, very homesick because our experiences in Northern Ireland were so unique and I didnrsquot have anyone that I could explain that to, she said.ldquoI felt emotionally unsupported. I felt very much like fish out of water as I was surrounded by a lot of very wealthy people and I struggled to connect with them. I was longing for the familiarity and the closeness, and the craic of home. My homesickness lasted for many years, it didnrsquot just go away.ldquoEvery time I went home for Easter or Christmas I was in floods of tears going back to the airport but yet I made myself do it, nothing nor nobody  was forcing me to do it.She went gone to appear alongside actors such as Sir Patrick Stewart of Star Trek fame in an acclaimed production Macbeth which played Londonrsquos West End and New Yorkrsquos Broadway, as well as former X-Files star Gillian Anderson and  Shades heart-throb Jamie Dornan in the psychological murder drama The Fall.Niamh is currently working on two film projects and says that as a newly married woman, her professional and personal le is going great.However, she maintains her mental health by practicing yoga and mediation and feels it is important to be upfront about having had issues.She explained: ldquoI donrsquot see a problem talking about mental health because I donrsquot like that itrsquos still taboo. If it helps one person seek help, then thatrsquos great.ldquoPeople could be sitting with mental problems and they donrsquot know it. Because thatrsquos what anxiety and depression do, they sneak on you and it really starts to alter your view of the world without you noticing.ldquoOver time with mediation you can be in control of your mind. It does not have to be in control of you. Itrsquos easier said that done as itrsquos a long and slow process but itrsquos absolutely possible.While she has excelled in support roles such as the policewoman in The Fall and a nurse in Holby City, Niamh has her eyes set on being centre stage and ldquoplaying a really bad person in the future.ldquoI really want to play the evil person in something.

Well done girlsAlex Robinson was the sole East Down representative in the boysrsquo race and should be very proud of his th place in the  runner field.Ollie Robinson was prominent throughout the U- boysrsquo race over a k distance and did extremely well to take third place behind the highly-regarded Willowfield pair of Colm McKee and Finn Cross.Emily Burns, who impresses more every time she runs, was unlucky to miss out on a podium position, though was well worth her fourth place and another up and coming star Kara Trainor was hot on her heels in th place mdash out of  finishers.Mackenzie Murray was again a lone wolf in the U- boysrsquo contest over k and he ran a controlled race to take an excellent third placeThe U- girlsrsquo race, which was run simultaneously with the U-s, was a tough race and Edie Carroll was pleased to finish first in her age group, though she still has some way to go to achieve peak fitness.Her result meant that East Down AC comprising Edie, Emily and Kara from the U- competition placed second junior girls team across the age groups. So, well done everyone again.The feature of the U- boysrsquo race was the performance of Newcastle ACrsquos Christopher Neill who took the race by the scruff of the neck from the beginning of the second lap to positively run everyone  into the ground. Well done to him. Another star in the making The East Down Ladies continued their quest for honours in the Cross Country League with Niamh Kellett leading from the front and coming home in th place, supported in th place by Deirdre Weatherall and Joanne Foster, a fast finishing st.The vital fourth scorer was to be a toss up between Clare Carson and Janine Murray with Clare continuing her recent good form crossing the line in th place to give the club fourth place on the day, in the league competition.While Janine, despite struggling in the last lap, crossed the line in th place out of  finishers, for another valuable participation point.A feature of the day for me and indicative of the camaraderie engendered by cross country running, was the activity of the Murlough AC squad who as each one finished ed to the run in area to loudly cheer home their club mates, some of whom were experiencing cross country running for the first time.Such were the ovations that it must have seemed aseach had won the race. And the club have fully embraced the cross country genre and had a full  runners out, ensuring maximum participation points. Well done and welcome to the mud.Menrsquos captain Dee Murray managed to field five runners in the open league race and they all performed well in what was a tough challenging course.Tom Dowey had already ran in the masters and did commendably well to take th place just behind Davie Seaton, so he was an interested spectator as the open race unfolded.Neil Curran made another impressive appearance, working his way through the field from th on lap one to nd at the tape.He was followed home by Davy Fosterwith Dee Murray close behind in rd.

The link with this area is part of our history, that is why I am here to meet with the council chairman and to visit local schools.The deputy mayor is keen to see links re-established between schools in France and the Ballynahinch area.ldquoThe link can help inspire young people in France and in this area and forging the link again will provide us all with new motivation, she added.David Stewart, who was a member of the former Ballynahinch, Drumaness and Spa twinning group and is now a key member of the Rowallane and Slieve Croob group, is also particularly keen for the formal link to be re-established.As someone who has visited Lamorlaye on a number of occasions and witnessed the value of cultural exchanges involving young people in particular, he hopes formal links with the French suburb can be reformed.ldquoThe old twinning link seemed to lose some of its impetus, but the Rowallane and Slieve Croob group is a much broader association, he continued.ldquoWe are delighted to have some people from Galicia with us at the moment and it would be fantasticthe Lamorlaye folk could join our group as well to be part of the Celtic region partnership.David added: ldquoYasmine has told us about some of the reformed committees in Lamorlaye, some of which are looking at environmental issues which I believe would be of interest to people in our area.Karen Patterson, acting chairwoman of the Rowallane and Slieve Croob twinning group which includes Ballynahinch, Drumaness and Spa area, is also keen to see Lamorlaye join the Celtic region partnership.ldquoYasmine approached David and we are meeting with council officials to discuss reconstituting the twinning link. She is keen to meet with local schools and while the initial focus is on those in the Ballynahinch area, we would be keen to roll this out to others, Karen explained.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council provides us with financial support as does Sport NI and we are grateful for all the support we have received. As part of our cultural heritage, looking at our past and history and aspart of our overarching Celtic nations initiative, we want to bring everyone together.Karen added: ldquoMoving forward, the focus is on culture, sports, language, arts and crafts, music and dance.

Her decision to take a case has been vindicated. “The damages figure is very satisfactory and all costs have been paid.”No apology is being made under the terms of the resolution.In  McCollum was caught with Scottish woman Melissa Reid attempting to smuggle £.m worth of cocaine out of Peru.They initially denied the charge, claiming that they had been forced to become mules.Known as the ‘Peru Two’, the pair later admitted to drug smuggling and were jailed for six years and eight months. Both women were released in .McCollum, now a mother-of-two, is pursuing similar privacy actions against a number of other media organisations.Mr Winters added: “We are confident that all other contentious publications, both print and online, will now be resolved without recourse to formal litigation.”Man caught with  ‘packages’ of cocaine in his body at Belfast City Airport Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingThe Northern Ireland bucket list -  things every person from N.I. should do before they dieTwo cases of meningitis confirmed at NI primary schoolIN PICTURES: The  locations across N.I. where speed camera vans operateFacebook ban for P.S.N.I. - photo shared by police adjudged to have contravened community standardsMeningitis outbreak in N.I. - What we know so far          ..

It is time for an all-Ireland conversation and forum to look to the future... To define a new and united Ireland,” she said.DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said Sinn Fein is more focused on a poll than a sensible Brexit deal. “Indeed, judging by their hard border rhetoric, Sinn Fein seem to be cheerleaders for a ‘no deal ‘exit.” he said.And UUP MLA Doug Beattie said that with health and education “on their knees,” a poll would “further ision and instability”. But TUV leader Jim Allister said Mr Varadkar is only stalling because he wants the backstop in place first, “as the republican building block it is”.Alliance leader Naomi Long was open to a poll, but agreed with the SDLP that “the time is not right” due to Brexit. FUUP Peer Lord Empey said: “Following on from similar comments earlier this week from Bertie Ahern, the penny is beginning to drop that this is a Sinn Fein strategy to create further ision.”Sam McBride: Sinn Féin might hope the SDLP-Fianna Fáil alliance fails – but that would be short-sighted Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingTwo cases of meningitis confirmed at NI primary schoolIN PICTURES: The  locations across N.I. where speed camera vans operateThe Northern Ireland bucket list -  things every person from N.I. should do before they dieFacebook ban for P.S.N.I. - photo shared by police adjudged to have contravened community standardsMeningitis outbreak in N.I. - What we know so far          ..

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Staff would of course always have a discussion with the patient and the family with regards to the risk.ldquoIt is not possible for staff to monitor patientsrsquo property on a continuous basis and there are occasions when family members bring in additional property for patients while they are in hospital and this may include medication.ldquoThe UHB has submitted a response to the coroner and will continue to benchmark in order to find an effective solution.No new lsquoNever Eventsrsquo took place between November and December.Of the , falls reported betweenNovember  and December , % resulted in no harm, or minor harm.In December , more than  falls were reported ndash but this was the lowest monthly figure for that period.The health board is developing a strategy to reduce falls and reviewing prevention and management of bed sores.New guidance from the Welsh Government will mean fewer pressure damage incidents will be reported as lsquoSerious Incidentsrsquo, a health board report says.Patient approval remains high with the arearsquos two main hospitals as surveys suggest % are satisfied with their experience atUniversity Hospital of Llandough, and % of patients are satisfied atUniversity Hospital of Wales.A spokeswoman for Cardf and Vale University Health Board said: ldquoIn line with our duty of candour we report allseriousincidentsto Welsh Government, the public and to our board in line with best practice.ldquoWelsh Government guidance requires us to report unexpected deaths of patients who are known to mental health services and die unexpectedly or experienceseriousharm in a community setting. Patients and their families are made aware ofincidentsand are kept informed during investigations and discussions with our clinical teams.ldquoThe increased reporting of pressure damage reflects a period of education and training of staff to improve the quality of data being recorded.ldquoAllincidentsare fully investigated and appropriate actions are taken to reduce the risk of recurrence in the future. This enables clinical boards and the corporate teams to identy areas of good practice but also to identy emerging trends and issues that require action in order to improve safety and quality of services. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately. For those minor illnesses and injuries which are less serious, we hope Woody the dog helps people realise that there are other, more appropriate, services available. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

On many of occasions I have witnessed motorists that use the turning lanes to enter the Stables complex and the Riverglade Manor estate prematurely driving into the turning lanes which increases the risk of a head on collision coming over the braw of the hill.”SDLP Lurgan Representative Ciaran Toman added, “I have contacted Transport NI to present my views that traffic islands should be installed up to and including the Gilpins Manor estate and also to redo the faded lane markings. People tend to drive faster on wide and straight streets. The installation of traffic islands placed in the centre of the road will reduce speeding and will ensure vehicles are within the lane markings.”“I want to thank the efforts from all the residents in the past who have campaigned for traffic calming on the Old Portadown Road.

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

Its surveying team are members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors . Nurturing talent and progression is a core principle that the firms stands for with  of their surveying staff having become qualied throughout the firm’s training program. We sat down with three members of the team.Gail Prentice-Jackson, associate director Over the last  years, Gail has worked right across the business, now within the asset management department.She manages a large mixed-use portfolio of property which includes leading shopping centres and retail parks right across Northern Ireland.Within that her role is ied and includes managing one of Northern Ireland’s most successful retail schemes. Day-to-day this can include everything from managing service charge budgets to maximising rental income through lease renewals and rent reviews. Another key role is to provide regular accounting and financial reports to clients.“One of my key roles is to support my agency department colleagues in their  acquisitions of investment assets and upon completion ensure that a comprehensive management regime is followed to ensure continued growth of our clients assets,” she says.“The role of a ‘property manager’ has evolved signicantly over the course of my career with much of our work now focusing on compliance and risk management. We pride ourselves on making sure our clients are well advised, mitigating any risks that may be involved with their particular property.”Some of those clients include retail sites such as Rushmere Shopping Centre in Craigavon.Gail is also one of just eight female surveyors in Northern Ireland with the designation of FRICS, a Fellow Member of RICS.“While females still only make up % of the surveying profession as a whole there are a signicant number of women working within the commercial property sector in Northern Ireland, it’s no longer a male orientated profession.”As for the business landscape Gail says that whilst there is general economic uncertainty they are seeing an increase in demand for their services as investors seek to maximisefrom their investments.“Interestingly we took on a number of new properties over the course of , often on behalf of investors who were keen to maximise rental s and ensure their property is run as efficiently as possible.”  Marian McFlynn, surveyor Since graduating from Ulster University in  with a degree in property investment and development, Marian’s career began on the other side of the globe – working for multi-billion dollar US-owned LaSalle Investment Management at its offices in Sydney.“In Sydney, as part LaSalle’s centre management team, I was responsible for leasing, marketing, administration and operation of a bulky goods shopping centre, home to over  homemaker and lestyle stores,” she says.“I ed to Northern Ireland, and joined the property and asset management department of Osborne King as a graduate surveyor in June ,” she adds. And following training, Marian became a chartered surveyor in . She’s now responsible for managing a range of commercial assets on behalf of clients. “This involves asset enhancement advice, tenant liaison, building maintenance, health and safety management, rent collection and accounting, service contract tendering and service charge administration,” she says.“I continue to build on my client and property portfolio.”And Marian also says that uncertainty hangs in the air for investors, while the ongoing lack of clarity over a post-Brexit landscape still exists.  Lisa McCaffrey, surveyorLisa has five years at Osborne King under her belt. Having graduated from the property investment and development course at Ulster University’s Jordanstown campus in , she worked at a Belfast estate agents before joining Osborne King in  becoming a chartered surveyor in .She works within the professional services team which sees her carry out valuations for a wide range of clients including private iniduals, large companies and the major lending institutions. As part of this Lisa is a member of the RICS Registered Valuers Scheme.Lisa also provides rent review and lease renewal advice to landlords and tenants throughout Northern Ireland.Additionally, Lisa was involved in the  non-domestic rating revaluation providing advice to a wide range of clients and negotiating the valuations with Land  Property Services on the clients behalf at application and appeal stages. Following the  revaluation Osborne King saved clients in excess of £.m. Lisa is working on the upcoming  non-domestic revaluation on behalf of a iety of clients.“I am fortunate to be involved in a wide range of work, some of which involves regular reporting to key clients such as one of Northern Ireland’s largest car showroom operators and well-known supermarket, convenience store businesses and global coffee brand.”  For more information contact Osborne King on   , email property@osborneking or visit the website at www.osbornekingView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/harbour_1221.jpg","title":"belfast harbour sets new cargo record","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Belfast Harbour has handled more than  million tonnes of cargo for the first time in its history.
