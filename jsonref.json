Meghan Markle imagined here wearing the gown she is rumoured to wear on her wedding day, at the Ralph \u0026amp Russo fashion show at Paris Fashion WeekWill Meghan’s wedding dress impact the bridal industry?Meghan, like Kate Middleton, is likely to choose a dress from a British brand in order to curry favour with the public and in turn, boost the nation’s valuable fashion and bridal industries.Despite the Meghan Markle effect being an industry in itself, being valued at £150 million to the British fashion industry in the form of unofficial brand endorsements, the new Royal’s impact on the bridal industry may be more subtle.After Kate Middleton’s marriage to Prince William, some bridal designers decided to replicate the Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen dress with hopes that all those who had watched the Royal Wedding would want to purchase a wedding dress similar to hers.According to Lori Conley, Senior Vice President of Product and Design at David’s Bridal, the recreated dress with lace sleeves, plunging neckline and full skirt did not sell. ‘We have internal benchmarks we work with to understand traction of a dress. It feel below those.’While women were inspired by Kate’s look, they did not want to feel as if they were in a costume, so bridal designers are expected to take elements from Meghan’s dress after May 19 and incorporate them in their new collections.However, before the 2011 Royal Wedding, 75 per cent of wedding dresses that David’s Bridal sold were strapless, but after, around 65 percent of brides opted for something with more coverage, from straps to full sleeves.          Kate Middleton seen here on her wedding day with her Maid of Honour and sister Pippa Middleton at Westminster Abbey in LondonIn the same way, Kate’s second wedding dress sparked an interest in sashes, Brides magazine Deputy Digital Director Roberta Correia told Racked that bridal designers are still being influenced by this accessory seven years on.‘Long sleeves, V-necks, and lace have been seen all over the bridal runways since, even at the most recent Bridal Fashion Week. H\u0026ampM released a new dress as part of their wedding collection, which looked almost exactly like Kate’s,’ Roberta said.Although there is high consumer interest in what Meghan wears, trend adoption is slower in the bridal industry, but some brands, like minimalist brand Floravere have already announced that they will have styles inspired by the dress ready within days of the Royal Wedding.Floravere CEO Molly Kang said: ‘As soon as she goes down the aisle, we can see what’s going to explode, whether it’s silhouette, fabric, or neckline.’Royal Wedding dressesWhile Meghan has somewhat disregarded the unspoken Royal dress code when it comes to her day-to-day fashion, she is expected to go for a traditional and classic bridal gown for her big day, similar to what other Royal brides have worn before her.The Queen’s wedding dressQueen Elizabeth II wore a timeless dress designed by the favoured royal couturier Norman Hartnell for her marriage to Lord Philip Mountbatten.The Duchesse ivory silk-creation took three months to complete and had a heart-shaped neckline with a scalloped edge, crystals and a 13 foot patterned train. Like all British brides at the time, the Government gave her 200 extra clothing coupons towards her wedding trousseau.          This picture was taken during the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh showing the couple at Buckingham PalacePrincess Margaret’s wedding dress Princess Margaret, the Countess of Snowdon and The Queen’s sister, was seen in a non-traditional dress made from silk organza in what was dubbed the most glamorous wedding of its time, in 1960.During her first marriage to Antony Armstrong-Jones, the Princess wore a modern dress with a skirt comprising of 30 metres of fabric, also designed by Norman Hartnell.Critics claimed it was the simplest wedding gown in history, yet beautiful and sophisticated and can be seen as part of a display at Kensington Palace in London.          Princess Margaret and Anthony Armstrong Jones seen here on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on their wedding day with one of the Princess\u0027s bridesmaidsPrincess Diana’s wedding dressAt the time, Lady Diana Spencer’s wedding dress was known as the ‘most closely guarded secret in fashion history’.Designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel, the meringue style gown was worth £9,000 in 1981 and is now valued at approximately £36,800.For her wedding to Prince Charles, Diana’s dress was made of ivory silk taffeta and antique lace with what has now become an iconic 25 foot train.

Shortly afterwards, when asked how he was feeling, he said: \u0027Great, thanks. How are you feeling?\u0027Meghan O\u0027Shea, aged seven, from Holyport in Berkshire, was among those who chatted with Harry.The prince noted the \u0027H\u0027 in the little girl\u0027s name - like his soon-to-be wife Meghan - and she said he remarked: \u0027Is that like the one I\u0027m going to marry? There\u0027s not very many Meghans with a \u0027H\u0027 around.\u0027Little Meghan said of her namesake: \u0027I think she\u0027s very nice.\u0027 As Harry was returning to the castle, he spotted a friend in the crowd who has made it home from a big cycling trip just in time for the wedding.Dean Stott, 41, travelled the 14,000-mile Pan American Highway in 99 days, 12 hours and 56 minutes, knocking an astonishing 17 days off the previous best. The former special forces soldier trained with the prince for six weeks in 2007 and the pair have stayed close, with the groom-to-be finding time to congratulate his guest on the record-breaking achievement.Afterwards Mr Stott said it was the first time he and Harry had seen each other since he returned, adding that he had not quite realised the magnitude of the wedding. Mr Stott said he was \u0027honoured and privileged\u0027 to be attending the wedding.   Accompanied by his older brother, Harry was met with loud cheers from the crowd as he emerged from the castle wearing a grey jacket, white shirt and slacks          \u0027I just want to go to the pub!\u0027: Harry pointed at the Horse and Groom pub behind adoring fans and photographers in Windsor this evening           Harry and Meghan are pictured among a crowd of well-wishers in the groom\u0027s final public appearance as a single man          Harry holds a teddy bear with a red jumper as he and Prince William greet crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening  Prince Harry walks around in front of Windsor Castle as he greeted well-wishers on his last evening of bachelorhoodAt tomorrow\u0027s service the bride  will walk through the Nave and Prince Charles will be waiting  at the start of the Quire - half way down the chapel - to take her to the altar.A source told MailOnline: \u0027It was something that she made clear she wanted to do when she and Prince Harry started planning their wedding last November\u0027.Many royal fans appear delighted at Meghan\u0027s decision because Charles does not have a daughter - but some critics believe the star, 36, should have plumped for Doria.The dramatic twist came as Prince Philip, 96, confirmed he will be well enough to attend the ceremony after successfully recovering from a hip operation last month. Harry\u0027s father is vastly more experienced than Doria at appearing at large-scale public events amid intense scrutiny. He also performed the duty for Alexandra Knatchbull, the daughter of his close friend, Lord Brabourne, in 2016. Meghan\u0027s father Thomas Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.       One member of the adoring crowd gave Harry what is possibly his and Meghan\u0027s first wedding present - a fluffy teddy bear    Outside the Horse and Groom pub, Harry shook hands with fans and spoke to children in the crowd while well-wishers filmed his every move on their mobile phones           Prince Harry is given the teddy bear by one of his well-wishers outside Windsor Castle this eveningMike Tindall discusses Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding on GMBThe Prince of Wales will walk Meghan Markle down the aisleThe Queen is seen driving to Windsor ahead of royal wedding\u0027I\u0027m off to the pub\u0027: Prince Harry greets crowd in WindsorPrince Harry and Meghan ready for wedding rehearsal in Windsor\u0027People will be disappointed\u0027: Robert Lacey on Prince Charles decisionMeghan Markle asks Prince Charles to walk her down the aisleRoyal fans camp in Windsor street the night before weddingPrince Harry and Meghan arrive at Windsor Castle for rehearsalTwitter users wonder whether guest is nodding off at royal weddingIn a statement, Kensington Palace said: \u0027Ms Meghan Markle has asked His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel on her Wedding Day.\u0027The Prince of Wales is pleased to be able to welcome Ms Markle to The Royal Family in this way.\u0027Until today Prince Charles was the second favourite at 31 yesterday to walk Meghan down the aisle, with her mother Doria Ragland the favourite at 13. Third favourite was Prince William at 51. Her half-brother, Thomas Markle Jr., was pictured outside Windsor Castle this week after flying to the UK ahead of the service.  The royal bride will hope there are no further surprises from her family to disrupt the build-up to the wedding. Ms Ragland has already enjoyed a \u0027jolly\u0027 meeting with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, just hours after landing, and yesterday met the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children.           Harry, looking relaxed wearing an open-necked white shirt and light jacket, waved to the crowds and chatted to his brother before making a beeline to talk to a young girl waiting among the crowds outside          Fans carrying royal wedding memorabilia were out in force tonight as they poured into Windsor to wish Prince Harry well before he ties the knot with Meghan tomorrow            The prince gives photographers and members of the public a thumbs up as he chats and jokes with people who gathered in Windsor tonight           Royal fans use their phones to take pictures of a smiling Prince Harry as he appeared outside Windsor Castle this evening    These ladies managed to secure a perfect vantage spot for seeing Prince Harry greet the public for the final time as a bachelor  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle looked relaxed as their Range Rover took them to Windsor Castle today with just a day to go until they marry  The couple waved and chatted in the back of their Range Rover while arriving at Windsor around an hour later (pictured)          Meghan looked happy and relaxed despite a tumultuous few days caused by her father\u0027s paparazzi deal and poor health          Meghan asked Prince Charles to give her away after her father dropped out at the last minute and the heir to the throne was seen entering the Windsor Castle estate todayThe surprise walkabout by the brothers echoed the eve of William\u0027s own wedding in 2011 when the pair greeted royal fans with an impromptu public appearance on The Mall in central London          Prince Harry waves and holds the teddy bear he was given by one of the well-wishers as spectators take their own pictures          Harry and William surprised royal well-wishers with a walkabout outside Windsor Castle the night before the wedding          Prince Harry smiles broadly with Windsor Castle and crowds of well-wishers in the background the night before his wedding  Prince Harry waves and gives a thumbs-up to members of the public as he steps outside Windsor Castle this evening          Harry smiles as he greets some of the thousands of royal enthusiasts who have descended on Windsor for the ceremony          William smiles as his brother Harry shows him the teddy bear which he was given as a gift by one of the crowd of royal fans          Prince William meets members of the public who have gathered outside Windsor Castle ahead of the royal wedding          Prince Harry and Prince William meet the public during a pre-wedding walkabout, outside the Horse and Groom pub          Prince Harry gives royal fans a thumbs-up as some of the people waiting outside Windsor Castle take pictures of the groom          Harry smiles for one royal spectator\u0027s camera as he goes for a walk outside Windsor Castle with his best man William          Prince Harry reaches into the crowd to greet well-wishers outside Windsor Castle hours before the royal wedding          The Duke of Edinburgh is to attend the royal wedding to see his grandson Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle, Buckingham Palace has said.Philip, 96, has been recovering after undergoing a hip operation.The Duke was spotted at the Royal Windsor Horse Show last week - the first public sighting of the Queen\u0027s consort since he left hospital last month. The Duke was taken to the private King Edward VII hospital in central London on April 3, for surgery to replace his joint with a prosthetic implant.He underwent the planned procedure the following day and left hospital on April 13.The duke, who retired from royal duties in August 2017, has since continued his recovery in Windsor.His appearance at tomorrow\u0027s wedding will please the royal fans, with whom he is extremely poplar.                                                     Last night royal fans were seen camping out outside the castle to ensure a good view of the planned procession, using sleeping bags and even folding chairs after local police banned tents. Yesterday they witnessed a full rehearsal in which a carriage and members of the armed forces paraded through the streets of Windsor. Meghan has pleaded for her 73-year-old father, who is recovering from heart surgery in Mexico after revelations about his alleged collusion with a paparazzi photographer, to be given \u0027space\u0027. In the statement, which she is said to have written herself, Miss Markle, 36, said: \u0027Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding.\u0027I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\u0027I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u0027 Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.  It was claimed yesterday that he was recovering after having three stents implanted in arteries following a heart attack at home in Mexico eight days ago, and that he had said it would \u0027take a long time to heal\u0027.In return, Miss Markle was said to have told him that she loved him and supported him, regardless of the paparazzi photograph debacle.            A man puts a flag up above a shop featuring Harry and Meghan decorations in Windsor ahead of the royal wedding           People with Canadian flags camp out in Windsor ahead of the wedding of Harry and Meghan tomorrow          A group of royal wedding enthusiasts hold up flags and Harry and Meghan memorabilia outside Windsor Castle  The Royal Standard flies over Windsor Castle showing the Queen is in residence with the tow below a sea of Union Flag bunting today          In the town huge crowds of people have gathered on the eve of Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding in the grounds of the castlePolice, the Army and the security services are forming a £30million ring of steel to protect the couple and the 100,000 people expected to visit the Berkshire town - but some armed officers took the time to pose with some Meghan fans  Royal fans from Britain, America and around the world are gathering outside Windsor Castle in huge numbers today with many wearing flags, costumes and hats          Sniffer dogs protect the huge numbers in Windsor today as part of the biggest security operation of recent times          One lucky bride, Vicky Compson, got to feel what it was like to be a princess for the day when she walked through the route Meghan and Harry will follow  to her own wedding today          Newlyweds Vicky and Aron Hallam then smiled after sharing a kiss during their reception at the Prince Harry pub in Windsor           Isabelle Sherlock and Charlie Twitchett, both ten, play Meghan Markle and Prince Harry for the day as they leave Fleetwood Methodist Church in Lancashire as  hundreds of primary school children staged their own version of the royal wedding today  Will Shepherd and Sienna Harrison, four-year-old cousins, played Harry and Meghan for the day at a nursery in Orrell, Wigan          School children wave flags on the Long Walk ahead of the wedding of the year tomorrow    Meghan and Harry will spend the evening apart this evening and the next time they will see each other again will be at the altar           Charles and Camilla were pictured leaving Kensington Palace by helicopter yesterday and this may have been when Meghan asked her future father-in-law if he would step in  This is how Meghan\u0027s entrance to St George\u0027s Chapel will unfold tomorrow and how Charles will meet her halfway          Kensington Palace has said that the Prince of Wales will accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel (pictured          Prince Charles said today he was \u0027pleased to welcome her to the royal family in this way\u0027, Kensington Palace revealed in a shock statement that also suggested Meghan could enter the church alone and meet Charles half way          Charles is said to be very fond of Meghan (pictured together on Christmas Day at Sandringham) and was happy to help her after her father caused a crisis ahead of her wedding            Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince Charles, but others have also said Meghan should have asked her mother Doria Meghan\u0027s mother Doria (pictured left in LA) was expected to give her daughter away.

They were also unable to say when Prince Harry would meet his new father-in-law. Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles.The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince.

A police boat cruises the Thames in Windsor today as part of the £30m operation to keep the event secure            Sniffer dogs are checking the streets while police are checking drains and removing bins to stop any attack on the royal wedding          The Quire in St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Charles will walk Meghan Markle down the aisle tomorrowThe prince and Ms Markle\u0027s reception will be held in the castle\u0027s 180ft (55m) long St George\u0027s Hall, traditionally used for glittering state banquets.The vast hall had to be restored following the devastating fire at the castle in 1992.The chapel, with its intricately carved stonework, magnificent fan vaulted ceiling and beautiful stained glass windows, has seen many royal weddings and funerals.The last royal wedding was for Harry\u0027s cousin, Peter Phillips, son of the Princess Royal, who married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008.Harry\u0027s father and stepmother, the Duchess of Cornwall, had their televised religious blessing there in 2005, after their civil ceremony down the road in Windsor\u0027s Town Hall.In 1999, Harry\u0027s uncle, the Earl of Wessex, married Sophie Rhys-Jones, now the Countess of Wessex, at St George\u0027s.Royal newlyweds and their families traditionally pose for photographs afterwards on the vast west steps, as Harry and his new bride are certain to do.It has been the setting for many historic funerals including the Queen Mother\u0027s private committal service following her Westminster Abbey funeral in 2002, and in the same year, Princess Margaret\u0027s small, private funeral.The funeral of the Queen\u0027s father, King George VI, took place at St George\u0027s in 1952.Like Westminster Abbey, the chapel is known as a Royal Peculiar, with the Dean of Windsor responsible only to the sovereign.The church, a place of worship for the Queen and her family, is often at the heart of royal events, with the Windsors gathering there each year for Easter services, and in the past for occasions such as the service to mark the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s 90th birthday.Within the chapel are the tombs of 10 sovereigns - as well as George VI, the remains of Edward IV, Henry VI, Henry VIII and his third wife Jane Seymour, the beheaded Charles I, George III, George IV, William IV, Edward VII and George V also rest there.                           \u0027Prince Charles doesn\u0027t have a daughter so he must be VERY happy\u0027: Social media overflows with praise for Meghan\u0027s \u0027touching\u0027 decision to ask her father-in-law to give her away... although feminists claim the decision is \u0027sexist\u0027Royal fans today spoke of their joy for Prince Charles after it was revealed he will step in for the father of the bride and walk Meghan Markle down the aisle.The Prince of Wales will give his soon-to-be daughter-in-law away when she marries Prince Harry tomorrow at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle.Meghan, 36, asked her future father-in-law to accompany her on the way to the altar after her father Thomas Markle had to pull out following heart surgery.Responding to the announcement by Kensington Palace this morning, royal fans praised the \u0027fantastic\u0027 decision and said they were delighted for Charles.             Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince CharlesOne said: \u0027What a lovely thing. Charles himself has no biological daughters but he will definitely be gaining one tomorrow. It will be a very touching moment.\u0027Another from New South Wales, Australia, tweeted: \u0027What a wonderful blessing for them both. Something Charles thought he would never be able to do.\u0027Her mother may not have been comfortable doing this. Whatever the reason, it is fantastic. Many blessings and prayers for both Harry and Meghan.\u0027And a third said: \u0027I knew it would be Prince Charles. I was hoping for her mum to do it, but I guess she wanted to keep things as traditional as possible. Great choice!\u0027However, not everyone was happy with the announcement. Aimee Day tweeted: \u0027No, it should have been her mum to do it. She brought her up and she should do it.             Others are not so impressed by the decision, with some claiming it is a \u0027sexist\u0027 move\u0027In general I think the mother\u0027s should do it anyway. After all, in most situations the mother does everything for their child over the father - in my experience.\u0027And Rachel Douce added: \u0027Disappointing that Prince Charles is walking Meghan down the aisle. Perfect opportunity for the royals to show how modern and not sexist they are and let Doria do it, but no.\u0027Mr Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.The actress\u0027s mother Doria Ragland had been tipped to perform the role. But Harry\u0027s father is far more experienced at appearing at big public events amid scrutiny.Wedding-watchers camped outside Windsor Castle in readiness for the festivities said they felt her soon-to-be father-in-law stepping in was a \u0027nice gesture\u0027.The announcement from Kensington Palace on Friday morning came with just 24 hours to go until the big day, with final preparations well under way in Windsor. Windsor visitor Leslie Haynes, from Washington, said: \u0027I was surprised actually. I knew that Prince Charles was in the running. I just assumed it would be her mother.\u0027But it was Meghan\u0027s approval and choice and so we support that, and, as we say, the next King of England is going to walk her down the aisle.\u0027The 58-year-old, who is camping  opposite the castle, said she was \u0027somewhat\u0027 disappointed that Miss Ragland would not accompany Meghan to the altar.She added: \u0027But I have to say that it\u0027s her choice so we\u0027re happy for her. She is going to be the happiest woman in the world tomorrow so how could we be disappointed about that?\u0027Margaret Phipps, 25, from Texas, said: \u0027She has such a close relationship with her mum, so I think it is surprising to some people. But I think it\u0027s a nice gesture. \u0027He (Charles) doesn\u0027t have a daughter that he\u0027d ever be able to walk down the aisle. And it just sort of shows her transition into the royal family.\u0027She\u0027s really becoming a part of that family with him kind of acting as the father figure in situations, so I personally think it\u0027s nice.\u0027Sylvia Horn, 61, from Nashville, said it is \u0027wonderful\u0027, adding: \u0027It\u0027s usually a gentleman that does it.\u0027 \u0027I fully approve since Charles is going to be her father-in-law,\u0027 she said.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/16/0BD397B600000578-5745449-image-a-58_1526657258571.jpg","title":"Royal Wedding dress code Prince Harry Meghan Markles big day revealed","story":"     Prince Harry and Meghan Markle seen here departing from Catalyst Inc, Northern Ireland\u0027s next generation science park  in Belfast, Nothern IrelandRoyal Wedding dress code for guestsDespite Meghan and Harry opting for a more low key affair, guests must remember that it is still a Royal Wedding and the invitations encourage men to wear military uniforms, morning coats or lounge suits and for women, a ‘day dress with hat’.Royal Wedding dress rulesEtiquette expert Myka Meier, who has trained in London under a former member of the royal household revealed that women should choose a dress that covers their shoulders, with a hemline no shorter than their longest finger, when their arms are at their side and no longer than mid-calf.‘You won’t see cleavage. You won’t see a lot of skin. At least you shouldn’t. It would be seen as disrespectful,’ Meier said. She continued to explain that dresses in black or white should not be worn, as white is for the bride and black is still associated with mourning.While light prints and patterns are welcome at a Spring wedding, big and block patterns are unacceptable but international guests will be permitted to wear their country’s equivalent.          Spain\u0027s Prince Felipe seen here flanked by Princess Letizia and Spain\u0027s Queen Sofia, outside of Westminster Abbey ahead of the wedding between Prince William and Kate MiddletonAccording to etiquette experts Debrett’s, Meghan Markle’s boundary-pushing style will allow for some leeway when it comes to traditional Royal Wedding protocol.It may be unusual to see women wearing trousers at a wedding, but Meghan’s own decision to wear a pantsuit at formal events may mean that covered legs could be welcomed on the big day, especially after jumpsuits were approved at Royal Ascot’s Royal Enclosure.Many invitees may also take a page out of Kate’s book and choose a piece by British labels such as Stella McCartney, Burberry, Emilia Wickstead, Erdem or even Marks and Spencer, as Meghan Markle has in the past.Will Royal Wedding guests be required to wear hats?Women often start with the hat when planning their outfits, as Meier explained and they are kept on during a wedding church service. ‘Hats are a sign of festivity for a British wedding. They are kept on inside the church, but people should be careful of the people sitting behind them. It\u0027s not the Kentucky Derby. No huge brims. Nothing too high.’Princess Beatrice’s hat at Prince William’s wedding was regarded ‘ridiculous in so many ways’ by Royal watcher Anne Chertoff.          Princess Beatrice seen here wearing the Philip Treacy hat she wore at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011When it comes to shoes, open toes, wedges and slingbacks are too informal. Meier said: ‘You want something that is about 4 inches maximum. \u0027The walk in is not going to be easy. There are lots of cobblestones even though there will be different types of carpeting.’In addition to this, handbags should be small as the seating in St. George’s Chapel is very tight, so clutches are recommended.What will men wear to the Royal Wedding?Those who have a military uniform are encouraged to wear it, but most men will opt for a morning suit in either grey, navy or black with coattails. Men will also be expected to wear a waistcoat and a regular tie.For lounge suits, the rule of thumb is the darker it is, the more formal it will look and that rules goes for morning suits too. In the same way, brown shoes are considered less formal than black ones.          Prince William and his wife Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, seen here coming out of Westminster Abbey in London, after their wedding service in 2011What will Meghan Markle wear?Despite the Royal Wedding dress designer being a closely-guarded secret, rumours have suggested that Ralph \u0026amp Russo is the British couturer that has been picked by Meghan Markle. The dress is expected to be a hand-stitched and heavily beaded gown with long sleeves.What will Prince Harry wear?Prince Harry will most likely wear his Household Cavalry British Army uniform and it has been rumoured that he will have to shave his beard because facial hair is frowned upon by the military circle, according to Elle.However, Harry may also go for a morning suit because the wedding is a much more low key affair than that of his brother, Prince William’s. Other rumours suggest that he will wear the Royal Marines ceremonial uniform as a mark of respect to the regiment he took over from Prince Philip.Dancing With The Stars finale: Date, time, finalists and moreThe French Open 2018: Roland Garros dates, schedule and tickets revealedBachelorette 2018: Chris Harrison reveals premiere will have \u0027most ridiculous fight ever\u0027Who was Stephanie Adams?

Her father was a struggling department-store buyer. Wildenstein moved to Paris when she was a teenager.During that time she was in a relationship with the filmmaker Sergio Gobbi. Before her marriage to Alec, she was also linked to Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi and Cyril Piguet.In 1977, at the age of 31, Wildenstein met Alec on a safari trip to Kenya. Alec was there to kill a lion and Wildenstein asked to accompany him. The pair eloped the following year in Las Vegas.It was a tempestuous marriage. The couple reportedly spent $1 million a month on average and went for his-and-hers eye-lifts a year into their marriage. This marked the beginning of a long list of plastic surgeries.‘I would always find out last. She was thinking that she could fix her face like a piece of furniture. Skin does not work that way. But she wouldn’t listen,’ Alec Wildenstein told Vanity Fair.\u0027I don’t think I’ve known her when she wasn’t healing from something,\u0027 said a friend of Jocelyn in 1998. Wildenstein has frequently denied she’s had work done, saying in 1998 that her looks, which led to her being branded ‘Catwoman’, were natural.          In February 2018, the 77-year-old socialite said that she hasn\u0027t had any plastic surgery done‘If I show you pictures of my grandmother,’ she says, ‘what you see is these eyes—cat eyes—and high cheekbones.’ Wildenstein went on to deny she ever had any work done on her nose.After the couple’s children left home, Alec and Wildenstein ended up having ‘constant’ fights.One night, Wildenstein says she walked in on her husband with another woman and alleges he pointed a gun at her and her bodyguards—something Alec disputed, saying Wildenstein was downstairs when he saw the bodyguards.Alec spent the night in jail after the police were called.The pair’s orce was highly public and messy, with Alec slowly cutting Wildenstein’s financial means.Jocelyn Wildenstein before and after plastic surgeryJocelyn Wildenstein reportedly had her first plastic surgery a year after marrying her husband, in 1978. The pair went in for eye-lifts and the surgery was reportedly the first of many.However, in February 2018, Wildenstein and her now second husband, Lloyd Klein both denied she had any work done.\u0027I don\u0027t understand the whole press and the Catwoman thing because Jocelyn always looked like that,\u0027 Klein told DailyMailTV.Jocelyn Wildenstein reportedly had her first plastic surgery, an eye-lift, with Alec in 1978\u0027She never really did anything to change her face. I have pictures from 16 years old where she looks exactly the same as today.\u0027 However, in April 2018, Wildenstein admitted to having surgeries but stopping for a time during her orce from Alec.\u0027In the beginning, it\u0027s why I stopped correcting my appearance because the articles were mean and would repeat the image that my ex-husband tried to paint of me,\u0027 she told Paper Magazine. What is Jocelyn Wildenstein’s net worth?Jocelyn Wildenstein’s net worth is $16,386,100, according to her Chapter 11 bankruptcy documentation.This is a far cry from the $2.5 billion she was awarded during her orce from Alec Wildenstein. The filing lists that the socialite receives a $900 check a month from Social Security, which it says is her only source of income.Jocelyn Wildenstein bankruptcyJocelyn Wildenstein filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2018, reportedly owing 16 creditors over $6 million. This includes hundreds of thousands of dollars to several building contractors, $70,000 to American Express, over $200,000 to two law firms, and $179,000 to Trump world Tower Condominium.Wildenstein also owes a staggering $4.6 million to Castellan Capital and $700,000 to a New York storage company.Dancing With The Stars finale: Date, time, finalists and moreThe French Open 2018: Roland Garros dates, schedule and tickets revealedBachelorette 2018: Chris Harrison reveals premiere will have \u0027most ridiculous fight ever\u0027Who was Stephanie Adams?

Doria, now 61, was 23 when she married TV lighting director Tom Markle in Sunset Boulevard\u0027s Self-Realization Fellowship Temple two days before Christmas 1979          Doria, meanwhile, despite her early promise, did not go to university but started work selling jewellery, almost certainly to help the family financesSo let us go back in time to when Doria Ragland (she now uses her maiden name) was a little girl.Her mother, Jeanette, grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, the daughter of a bellboy and a lift operator, both of whom worked at the smart, whites-only, five-star St Regis Hotel.Jeanette had been previously married to a professional roller-skater, by whom she had two children — Doria\u0027s half-brother and sister.When he skated out of her life, she was left to bring them up alone. After five years struggling as a single mother, Jeanette fell for snappy-dressing, smooth-talking Alvin Ragland and married again.    Barely had Charles and Diana returned from their honeymoon when, in Los Angeles, Doria was giving birth at West Park hospital in Canoga Park to a baby girlTheir only child, Doria, arrived in 1956 and it was soon after her birth that Alvin uprooted the family and set out to make a new life and better himself across country in California.He had relatives on the West Coast and for a time worked for a real estate business run by his aunt Lillie. Later, by the time Doria was five and he was setting up his modest bric-a-brac and antiques business in central Los Angeles, the marriage was crumbling.At around that time, in Norfolk, England, Diana Spencer was born — not yet Lady Diana, as her father, Viscount (\u0027Johnnie\u0027) Spencer, had not then succeeded to the ancient earldom.Spencer, a former officer in the Royal Scots Greys, had been equerry to both the Queen and her father, George VI, while Diana\u0027s mother, Frances, was the younger daughter of the 4th Baron Fermoy.          Meghan Markle and her mother Doria Ragland leave the Windsor Estate after tea with the Queen           Doria Ragland in the Range Rover which took her from tea with the Queen at Windsor to the hotel this evening          Royal fans took pictures of Harry as he greeted crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening They lived on the Queen\u0027s Sandringham estate in Park House, a lovely Victorian pile that is now a hotel for the disabled. Park House was, in fact, where Frances was born: her late father was a great friend of the King and her mother a confidante of the Queen, later the Queen Mother.The lives of the Spencer family and the royals were entwined and the children played together.Diana was the Spencers\u0027 third daughter but not, alas, the longed for son who would secure continuance of the title. When baby Charles arrived three years after Diana, it was an occasion for a firework display in celebration. As a result, although her mother always denied she was a \u0027disappointment\u0027, Diana carried doubts throughout her life.No such doubts, though, in Los Angeles for Doria, who got on well with her two older half-siblings, Joseph and Saundra, even though it wasn\u0027t long before her father abandoned the family home.Joseph recalls their mother, Jeanette, having to be \u0027both the mother and father of the family, bent on keeping them fed, clothed and together, and succeeding\u0027.Here was a woman whose determination is seen in the family as having been passed down to her daughter, Doria, as well as her actress granddaughter Meghan.For Diana, growing up meant a series of nannies as, by the time she was five, her mother was no longer at home, having fallen for wallpaper heir Peter Shand Kydd.Contrary to popular gossip, her mother wasn\u0027t a so-called \u0027bolter\u0027 but fought in court for custody of her children — only to lose, largely because of the infamous intervention of her own mother Ruth, who sided with her son-in-law.In Los Angeles, Doria\u0027s mother struggled on as a single parent, yet family life in her household was warm and stable.Doria was turning into a bright child who got a prized place at the formerly all-white Fairfax High School in West Hollywood. But in 1971, when she was 15, her education was disrupted by the San Fernando earthquake.The quake destroyed nearby Los Angeles High School, so the two schools had to merge. Doria\u0027s school day was rescheduled to begin at 7am and end at noon.Despite the disruption, she remained one of its brighter pupils, a member of the school\u0027s Apex Club for high achievers.No such academic high-flying for Diana. She was privately educated at boarding schools in Norfolk — and later in Kent — at a time when, even though the Queen Charlotte\u0027s Ball era of debutantes was over, little more was expected of girls from aristocratic families than to find a suitable husband.  Accompanied by his older brother, Harry was met with loud cheers from the crowd as he emerged from the castle wearing a grey jacket, white shirt and slacks          \u0027I just want to go to the pub!\u0027: Harry pointed at the Horse and Groom pub behind adoring fans and photographers in Windsor this evening           Harry and Meghan are pictured among a crowd of well-wishers in the groom\u0027s final public appearance as a single manDiana was not academically strong and left school with no O-levels. But she was far from being \u0027thick as two planks\u0027, as she later self-deprecatingly (and foolishly) described herself.The phrase stuck and was used to denigrate her later during the \u0027War of the Waleses\u0027.Doria, meanwhile, despite her early promise, did not go to university but started work selling jewellery, almost certainly to help the family finances.She also assisted in her father\u0027s store, called \u0027Twas New, and ran a bric-a-brac stall in a Sunday flea market. She even managed to work part-time in a travel agency.At this time, Diana was still at West Heath girls\u0027 school in Kent, excelling at swimming, ballet, tap-dancing and piano. For her, there was no question of having to start work when she left West Heath. Instead, it was finishing school in Rougemont, Switzerland, followed by a cordon bleu cookery course in London.In Los Angeles, Doria was deciding to become a showbusiness make-up artist.As with everything she put her hand to, she did well and found herself training on the set of ABC\u0027s TV drama General Hospital.Also there was the large, cheery figure of Tom Markle, the show\u0027s established lighting director, who was orced with two children.Before long she had moved in with him. But it wasn\u0027t all plain sailing, as his daughter Samantha was far from welcoming. To friends, she cruelly took great pleasure in referring to Doria as \u0027the maid\u0027 on account of her being black.Even in 1979, mixed marriages were not common in the U.S. But despite family uncertainty, Tom and Doria were married. The venue, the Self-Realization temple, was Doria\u0027s choice because she had started to follow the teachings of Yogananda, a Hindu yoga guru.          Harry holds a teddy bear with a red jumper as he and Prince William greet crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening  Prince Harry walks around in front of Windsor Castle as he greeted well-wishers on his last evening of bachelorhoodWithin 11 months, Doria was pregnant with Meghan. It was November 1980.Meanwhile, Diana was living in a flat in Earl\u0027s Court, West London, bought for her by her mother as an 18th birthday present, and sharing it with three other girls. She worked as a nanny and part-time nursery school assistant.In July 1980 she and Prince Charles spent a fateful afternoon together at a barbecue in Petworth, West Sussex. He was the most eligible bachelor on the planet, and within weeks he made it known to friends that he had found the woman he wanted to marry.Exactly a year later, theirs was a typically sumptuous royal wedding, with one sad similarity to today\u0027s event — the frailty of the father of the bride.Earl Spencer had suffered a stroke and almost died. But he was at St Paul\u0027s Cathedral to give his daughter away, though everyone knew she was largely supporting him on their walk up the aisle.And so the parallel lives of Diana and Doria continued.Barely had Charles and Diana returned from their honeymoon when, in Los Angeles, Doria was giving birth at West Park hospital in Canoga Park to a baby girl, whom the happy parents called Rachel Meghan. She was their only child. The date of her birth — August 4, 1981 — was a day the British royals were also celebrating: it was the Queen Mother\u0027s 81st birthday.Tom Markle had decorated baby Meghan\u0027s room with Disney characters and few would have thought then that the marriage would not last. He and Doria seemed happy. But Tom spent a long time at work, sometimes 90 hours a week, and eventually the strain began to tell.Meghan had just had her second birthday in 1983 when her parents split up, although they didn\u0027t orce for another five years.As for Charles and Diana, William had been born in June 1982 and Harry followed in September 1984. But already there were tensions in this royal marriage.Doria and Tom agreed to share custody of Meghan, still spent time with each other and even holidayed together.When Tom worked on a television programme, Doria let Meghan watch it with her, and loved it when their daughter rushed to kiss the screen as her father\u0027s name rolled by on the credits.Work would have been a big problem for Doria but for the help of her mother Jeanette, who stepped in to look after Meghan.As her older step-brother Joseph recalls: \u0027My mother babysat and when Doria finished work, she\u0027d go over to my mother\u0027s house to pick her up.\u0027Small wonder that in later years, after Jeanette suffered a stroke, Meghan would sit with her, talking to her granny, holding her hand and cooking for her. Jeanette died in 2000, aged 71.No such harmony at Kensington Palace. At around the time young Meghan was kissing the TV screen, Diana and Harry were watching a TV programme about Prince Charles which focused on Harry\u0027s father\u0027s affair with Camilla Parker Bowles. When her name was mentioned, Harry asked his mother: \u0027Who\u0027s Camilla?\u0027The split between Harry\u0027s parents when he was eight was the prelude to years of acrimony. When, finally, they were orced in 1996, Diana and Charles also shared custody of their two sons.Harry has subsequently said he doesn\u0027t remember much about it, but friends believe the pain of that time was eclipsed by the death of his mother the following year.In the last months of her life, Diana\u0027s relationship with her own mother also suffered. They were no longer speaking at the time of the Princess\u0027s death.For Diana, the unhappiness in her marriage pulled her towards finding consolation in helping others, from Aids and leprosy victims to those maimed by landmines. She was concerned for people at the margins of society.And in LA, Doria was moving in a similar direction — but hers was a switch in career, from make-up to training as a social worker.These days, she concentrates on the geriatric community, working for Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services in West Los Angeles.Such caring values also dictated Meghan\u0027s upbringing. As a child, Doria wanted to show her there was more to the world than the affluent neighbourhood of Woodland Hills, where they lived. So she took her daughter to see life in the slums of Jamaica and the backstreets of the Mexican city of Oaxaca, where Meghan recalls seeing children playing in dirt roads and hawking chewing gum.Diana took the same approach. As boys, William and Harry accompanied their mother to meet rough-sleepers on the streets of London and the charity staff helping them to survive.As Harry and Meghan say their vows today, who could deny that the linking of this couple from two very different worlds would not be quite so smooth were it not for their mothers."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/22/4C688EEE00000578-5746491-image-a-5_1526677266827.jpg","title":"DOMINIC SANDBROOK 20 years ago wedding inconceivable","story":"    Prince Harry and Meghan Markle seen leaving Kensington Palace the day before their weddingAnd after all the red-top tabloid headlines, all the traumas of his early life, all the girlfriends, the parties and the scandals, Prince Harry — seasoned in service to his country — has found happiness at last.Good for him. He deserves it.This being the Royal Family, of course, things are never straightforward. To Buckingham Palace, the events of the last week must have felt like an unfolding nightmare.Even by the soap opera standards to which the House of Windsor often descends, the chaotic shambles of Meghan’s semi-estranged father Thomas — who planned to walk her down the aisle, apparently staged pictures for a paparazzo, seemingly suffered a heart attack, decided to cry off, changed his mind and then cried off again so Prince Charles is now doing the honours — marks a tragi-comic low point.Still, even the smoothest wedding build-up is rarely free from moments of panic, and there can be few married couples in Britain unfamiliar with the phenomenon of embarrassing in-laws.In any case, the monarchy has long had a melodramatic dimension, in which calamitous weddings have played a particularly eye-catching part. And when compared with past royal nuptials, the excesses of the House of Markle look almost mundane. Although we typically like to think of royal weddings as fairytale occasions, the truth is that many were like something from an unusually horrific nightmare.No pampered public schoolboys or Corbyn crazed snowflakes: The Open University MUST be saved, says DOMINIC SANDBROOK DOMINIC SANDBROOK: We are one of the most prosperous, stable, literate, sophisticated and safest countries on Earth.

But to say our WWII troops were fighting for European values is insulting bunkum, writes DOMINIC SANDBROOK The era of hysteria! Historian DOMINIC SANDBROOK says Britain has become a nation of overgrown toddlers with a bigoted mob mentality, intolerance and a raging sense of grievance at every slight As two films are released about the man who united our nation, where is a Winston Churchill when we need one?Think, for example, of the marriage of Henry VIII and Anne of Cleves in 1540: the king an obese monstrosity with a stinking ulcer on his leg, his German bride a ‘Flanders mare’ who seemed completely out of her depth.Not surprisingly, it was never consummated: rather ungallantly, Henry claimed he had been put off by the ‘hanging of her breasts and looseness of her flesh’.The real soap opera stars, though, were the Hanoverians, who specialised in laughably catastrophic weddings. The marriage of Frederick, Prince of Wales, in 1736 is a case in point. Once again the bride was German. At just 16, Augusta of Saxe-Gotha did not speak a word of English and was patently terrified.As she shuffled down the aisle at St James’s Palace she was violently sick, not merely over her own dress, but over her new mother-in-law, Queen Caroline.The most spectacularly disastrous royal wedding of all, though, was that of the future George IV to Caroline of Brunswick in 1795.They first met only three days before the wedding, when George was so disgusted with his bride’s appearance that he immediately called for brandy.At the wedding itself, again at St James’s Palace, George arrived drunk, fell over on the steps of the altar and refused to recite his vows until his father, George III, ordered him to comply.          Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Ragland, arriving at Cliveden House Hotel on the National Trust\u0027s Cliveden Estate to spend the night before her wedding to Prince Harry    A fan of the Royal Family poses in a Union Jack outfit in Windsor ahead of the wedding Although we live in an age of risible hysteria about race and ‘ersity’, especially in the upper echelons of the BBC and in our major universities, most normal people see nothing sensational in the thought of the Queen’s grandson marrying a brown-skinned American. Most of us prefer to judge Ms Markle by her personality, not by her skin pigmentation.Ironically, the monarchy is much more in tune with the instincts of the nation than its chattering-class critics. After all, one in ten British couples now involve people with different ethnicities, while an estimated 833,000 British children are currently being raised by mixed-race couples.In this respect, one family — the Windsors — is the symbol of a bigger story. And that is precisely as it should be.The nation itself, after all, is nothing if it is not an extended family. And the appeal of the Royal Family, when you forget the palaces and pageantry, derives partly from the fact that when we look at them, we see ourselves.Few people embody that more than Harry himself. There cannot be many families who are unfamiliar with the younger son who struggled to find his niche, the party animal who found a serious side or the playboy who grew up.Indeed, one reason that Harry has such wide public appeal is that he is an immediately recognisable figure. Like a modern version of Shakespeare’s Prince Hal — the wayward prince who grew in stature to become Henry V, victor of Agincourt — he has evolved from the days of Nazi fancy-dress party costumes and Las Vegas stripping sessions to serving in Afghanistan and promoting the Invictus Games for injured military veterans.Harry’s is an impressive and inspirational story, not least since he lost his mother in such traumatic circumstances and had to grow up in the glare of the international spotlight.Indeed, I suspect that Harry’s spectacular public approval ratings — one poll recently found that 81 per cent of us have a positive view of him and only 11 per cent have a negative view — reflect the fact that many people still see him as the shell-shocked little boy walking behind his mother’s coffin.No politician could dream of matching such figures. And that, of course, points to another story. In an era when so many other great institutions, from Parliament to the BBC, seem tarnished and beleaguered, the Firm’s sheer resilience, its tenacious grip on our national imagination, remains enormously impressive.Twenty years ago, after the death of Diana, there was a brief burst of apocalyptic talk about the end of the monarchy. But no one is talking about that now. Indeed, when our national destiny seems so uncertain and our public figures inspire such little enthusiasm, the monarchy stands out as the one unchanging fixture, a bulwark of tradition, a beacon of stability in an age of dizzying change.At a time when the world’s most famous republican office is occupied by Donald Trump, the hereditary principle of monarchy looks in pretty robust health to me. After all, the Swedes, the Danes, the Norwegians, the Dutch and the Belgians all have monarchies, and they rank among the safest, richest, most developed and contented societies on earth. Even France’s President Emmanuel Macron — a would-be Napoleon if ever there was one — once remarked that his countrymen are ‘eternally nostalgic’ for their lost kings. ‘The French elect their president to be a monarch,’ he said. ‘Then they want to cut his head off.’In Britain, thankfully, we gave up beheading our kings in 1649. And although other monarchies, from Germany to Russia, have fallen by the wayside, ours remains the supreme symbol of Britishness both at home and abroad.Cynics sometimes like to present us as forelock-tugging lackeys, brainwashed into subservience.But this is nonsense. We know perfectly well that the Royal Family are all too human, with faults and foibles we can all immediately recognise.But the monarchy is the symbol of something bigger, the nation itself — which is why so many metropolitan liberals, the self-styled ‘citizens of nowhere’ who think themselves above the time-honoured loyalties of place and nation, are intellectually incapable of understanding its appeal.Its magic does not lie in the flags and carriages, although they are part of it.The real magic lies in the blend of the national and the inidual, the patriotic and the personal, the past and the present.Of course, the hard-Left can never understand this.Their minds twisted by extremism, their hearts coarsened by envy, they see only privilege where the rest of us see patriotism.Well, let the naysayers stew in their joyless misery. The rest of us, in our tens of millions, would raise a glass to an institution that has served Britain splendidly for centuries, and to two people who deserve a happy future together.For although this is a great national occasion, we should not forget that at its heart are two young people who are not so different, deep down, from thousands of others getting married this summer.So let’s hope today’s happy scenes banish the memories of the last week.And, if you’ll forgive the lèse-majesté, let’s hope the wedding night goes better than it did for Henry VIII. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/12/14/4C224B3700000578-0-image-m-29_1526132426322.jpg","title":"Marks Spencer plot home delivery service bring food drink door hour","story":"    Marks \u0026amp Spencer is rumoured to be looking at launching a home delivery service for food in response to a surge in online grocery shoppingTo date, M\u0026ampS has shied away from going ahead because the service is massively expensive to run and will seriously erode profit margins, despite the income from delivery charges.One problem that M\u0026ampS has is that people typically shop for a small basket of premium items, rather than doing a full weekly shop.

She and six other activists have been arrestedThe activists had persistently called for the right for women to drive, with the ban to be lifted in just six weeks.However, they stressed that this was only the first step toward full rights and for year also called for an end to less visible forms of discrimination.They campaigned for lifting guardianship laws that give male relatives final say on whether a woman can travel abroad, obtain a passport, or marry.Their movement was seen as part of a larger democratic and civil rights push in the kingdom, which remains an absolute monarchy where protests are illegal.All major decision-making rests with the king and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Some state-linked media outlets published the names of those detained, which include Loujain al-Hathloul, Aziza al-Yousef and Eman al-Najfan.          Pro-government media outlets splashed their photos online and in newspapers, accusing them of betrayal for their supposed crimesRights activists said Madeha al-Ajroush and Aisha al-Manae are also among the seven detained. Both took part in the first women\u0027s protest movement for the right to drive in 1990, in which 50 women were arrested for driving and lost their passports and their jobs.All five women are well-known activists who agitated for greater women\u0027s rights. Several of the women were professors at state-run universities and are mothers or grandmothers.The Interior Ministry on Saturday did not name those arrested, but said the group is being investigated for communicating with \u0027foreign entities\u0027. It said they were working to recruit people in sensitive government positions and giving money to foreign circles aiming to destabilise and harm the kingdom.The stunning arrests come just six weeks before Saudi Arabia is set to lift the world\u0027s only ban on women driving next month.Saudi police save three women from rapists - then arrest...Millions of Muslims around the world prepare for...Share this articleWhen the kingdom issued its royal decree last year announcing that women would be allowed to drive in 2018, women\u0027s rights activists were contacted by the royal court and warned against giving interviews to the media or speaking out on social media.Following the warnings, some women left the country for a period of time and others stopped voicing their opinions on Twitter.As activists were pressured into silence, Saudi Arabia\u0027s 32-year-old heir to the throne stepped forth, positioning himself as the force behind the kingdom\u0027s reforms.However, Human Rights Watch said the crown prince\u0027s so-called reform campaign \u0027has been a frenzy of fear for genuine Saudi reformers who dare to advocate publicly for human rights or women\u0027s empowerment\u0027.\u0027The message is clear that anyone expressing skepticism about the crown prince\u0027s rights agenda faces time in jail,\u0027 Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said  Loujain al-Hathloul was another of the seven activists branded \u0027traitors\u0027 who were working for \u0027foreign entities\u0027Last year, Prince Mohammed oversaw the arrests of dozens of writers, intellectuals and moderate clerics who were perceived as critics of his foreign policies. He also led an unprecedented shakedown of top princes and businessmen, forcing them to hand over significant portions of their wealth in exchange for their freedom as part of a purported anti-corruption campaign.In an interview with CBS in March, he said that he was \u0027absolutely\u0027 sending a message through these arrests that there was a new sheriff in town.Activists said writer Mohammed al-Rabea and lawyer Ibrahim al-Mudaimigh, two men who worked to support women\u0027s rights campaigners, are also among the seven detained. Al-Mudaimigh defended al-Hathloul in court when she was arrested in late 2014 for more than 70 days for her online criticism of the government and for attempting to bring attention to the driving ban by driving from neighboring United Arab Emirates into Saudi Arabia.Those familiar with the arrests said al-Hathloul was forcibly taken by security forces earlier this year from the UAE, where she was residing, and forced back to the kingdom.In recent weeks, activists said several women\u0027s rights campaigners were also banned from traveling abroad.  Their movement was seen as part of a larger democratic and civil rights push in the kingdom, which remains an absolute monarchy where protests are illegal and major decision-making rests with the king and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (pictured)Immediately after news of the arrests broke, pro-government Twitter accounts were branding the group as treasonous under an Arabic hashtag describing them as traitors for foreign embassies.The pro-government SaudiNews50 Twitter account, with its 11.5 million followers, splashed images of those arrested with red stamps over their face that read \u0027traitor\u0027 and saying that \u0027history spits in the face of the country\u0027s traitors.\u0027The state-linked Al-Jazirah newspaper published on its front-page a photo of al-Hathloul and al-Yousef under a headline describing them as citizens who betrayed the nation.Activists said some in the group were arrested on Tuesday and at least one person was arrested Thursday.They said the detainees were transferred from the capital, Riyadh, to the city of Jiddah for interrogations where the royal court has relocated for the month of Ramadan.Activists said it wasn\u0027t not clear why the seven were arrested now."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/13/4C6E005B00000578-5747477-image-a-332_1526732894449.jpg","title":"En route Prince Harry leaves Coworth Park hotel royal Wedding","story":"Be a beautiful bride like Meghan in Clare Waight Keller for GivenchyClare Waight Keller for Givenchy Haute CoutureHead to the Givenchy website herePrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s big day is finally here and we haven\u0026#39t been this excited for a dress since the Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s wedding back in 2011.

When you jump into Hollywood like that it demands so much of you it pulls you in every different direction, away from your family and away from contact.\u0027And that\u0027s completely understandable - that\u0027s Hollywood.

I don\u0027t think being that it\u0027s her second wedding dress has anything to do with it.\u0027I think this is the one that counts. This is the one that matters,\u0027 he said.  He added that their father, who has had his own share of embarrassment this week after it was revealed he had staged paparazzi photographs and taken money for it, backed out of the wedding at the last minute.           Also not there was the bride\u0027s father Thomas Markle Sr. who embarrassed himself this week by staging paparazzi photographs and taking a sum for it. He suffered a heart attack and said that was the reason he would not attend           Doria Ragland, Meghan\u0027s mother, was the only member of her family who was seen. She beamed with pride throughout her drive to the chapel with her daughter and during the emotional ceremony Thomas Markle Sr. said a recent heart attack, which he suffered days before he was due to walk his daughter down the aisle, kept him from the event.Markle Sr. said his father was happy Prince Charles stood in to accompany Meghan for some of her long walk down St. George\u0027s Chapel. \u0027I think my dad would be sad that he can\u0027t be here but if there was a choice he would be overjoyed Prince Charles is there,\u0027 he said. Markle Jr. added that he was sure Meghan and Harry would be eager to start their own family soon and painted her as a maternal figure who had long doted on his children.           Meghan, 36, is pictured in St George\u0027s Chapel on Saturday during her wedding to Prince Harry.

You would not normally expect the Israeli Ambassador to agree with a terrorist organisation guilty of murdering his people and committed to destroying his country. But it’s true, I do.I agree with Hamas when its founder Mahmoud Al-Zahar admitted publicly that its strategy of labelling events in Gaza as ‘peaceful protests’ was a deliberate ‘deception’.He is right, because there is nothing peaceful about knives, machetes, guns, pipe bombs, Molotov cocktails and improvised explosives: all of which the Palestinians used in their ‘peaceful protest’.I agree with Hamas’ leader, Yahya Sinwar, when he says that the purpose of the ongoing violence is to breach the frontier and indiscriminately murder Israelis living in communities nearby. Mr Sinwar proclaimed, ‘We will tear down the border’ and ‘tear out their hearts’.Video footage from last Monday shows a masked man who had just broken through the fence, carrying a machete while shouting: ‘O Jews, we’re coming to slaughter you!’ This was indeed Hamas’ goal.I also agree with Mr Sinwar when he revealed that Hamas operatives ‘took off their military uniforms’ in order to pose as innocent civilians. Unfortunately, all too many politicians and commentators in this country were successfully taken in by Hamas’ mendacious charade.          Some have accused Israel of a ‘calculated and deliberate policy to kill and maim unarmed protestors’. But I agree with Hamas politburo member Salah Bardawil, when he acknowledged that 50 of the 62 killed on Monday belonged to Hamas, said Mr Regev.

It’s also a way of thanking those who came here and helped make Britain strong by working on the railways or as nurses and doctors in the NHS.’ A model of the funnelled Windrush is the centrepiece of the £40,000, 30ft x 30ft floral display in the Grand Pavilion at the show, which opens to the public on Tuesday.Life in the Caribbean, the journey and the new life in Britain are depicted in the design, which features 3-D models of passengers playing dominoes and singing while crowded together on deck.A model train, bus, a nurse’s hat, keyboard letters and road signs represent jobs taken by the pioneers after settling here. The garden also features a reminder of Lady Benjamin’s past presenting Play School with the show’s famous square, round and arched windows hidden within a West Indian chapel house.Birmingham City Council’s Darren Share, who worked on the garden, said: ‘It’s bold and bright, with gold, yellow and orange provided by zinnias, celosias, marigolds for the Caribbean and antirrhinums, foxgloves, hydrangeas and gerberas for the British reds, whites and blues.’It will be recreated next month in Birmingham’s Handsworth Park.

The Duchesse ivory silk-satin creation took royal couturier Sir Norman and his team three months to finishWith a heart-shaped neckline with scalloped edge, the gown was decorated with 10,000 seed pearls, glittering crystals and featured an intricate 13ft star-patterned train. Embroidered with roses, star-shaped flowers and wheat in pearl, crystal and appliques of transparent tulle, its floral design was seen as a symbol of growth and regeneration after the hardships of the Second World War. On the day of the wedding at Westminster Cathedral, the seamstresses who worked tirelessly on the gown were given a prime spot outside Buckingham Palace as a reward.  The Queen, like all British brides in the post-war days, was given 200 extra clothing coupons from the Government towards her wedding trousseau.Women across the UK, keen to ensure Princess Elizabeth would have the dress of her dreams, sent their own coupons to the young royal to help out.But it was illegal to give coupons away and the gifts had to be returned.  However, The Crown gave a good idea of how much the dress might cost to make today as designers for the BBC programme created an identical gown for the wedding scene, which cost £30,000.

So I feel personally invested in this romance!)The large crowd whooped ecstatically with each celebrity sighting and the stars waved with as much faux regalness as they could muster.But as I watched, my mind kept going back to one uneasy question: how can you justify having NONE of your family at your own marriage when you’re filling the church with famous people whom you’ve known for a fraction of the time?It smacked of ruthless and rather distasteful social climbing by a woman who was absolutely delightful when we met in my pub, but whose life has been marked by a worrying tendency to ditch people when they cease to be of use to her. (Her first husband thought they had a happy marriage until the day that Meghan sent his rings back in the post.)          Piers Morgan has given his verdict on the ultimate showbiz weddingMy hackles were raised further when some of the actors strode to the front of the church quire, nestling opposite senior Royals in a clear thespian statement of intent from Ms Markle that screamed: ‘We’re just as big stars as you stuffy lot in tiaras.’They are not, of course. There are no bigger stars than the British Royals, no other human beings who can command 5,000 media people to their weddings, or a billion television viewers.But there’s no doubt Hollywood hijacked this Royal Wedding, both in personnel and in tone, in a carefully co-ordinated operation by an actress putting on the performance of her life, to celebrate the greatest day of her life.Meghan played it safe with her choice of elegant, stylish dress. For her choice of speaker, she played with fire. Literally.The Most Reverend Michael Curry let rip with surely the most memorable Royal Wedding speech ever heard. A sensational tour de force that cited slaves, quoted Dr Martin Luther King, and spoke repeatedly of the raging power of fire and love.At first, I was startled. What the hell was happening here? Then, I was amused. Was he ever going to stop? The cameras cut to a giggling William, Charles and Camilla, to a stern-faced Queen and Philip, and then to a completely baffled Sir Elton John.As Bishop Curry roused himself to ever-higher decibels, I found myself laughing out loud, as were all my family watching with me at home.Eventually, he finished, and my phone rang. It was my 17-year-old son Bertie, who was at school.‘Dad, did you see that?’ he exclaimed excitedly.‘Yes, hilarious wasn’t it…’  US chat show host Oprah Winfrey waved to cameras as she arrived, and Mumford \u0026amp Sons singer Marcus Mumford and actress wife Carey Mulligan arrived together          Sir Elton John, pictured, wore a pair of ominous rose-tinted spectacles at the wedding. Morgan says: \u0027I would think it’s hard to overstate the significance of the ceremony, beamed live around the world, to black people everywhere\u0027‘No! It was incredible!’ he replied. ‘Can you imagine what this must mean to a black American – seeing a black preacher make that kind of speech at a traditionally white British Royal Wedding? This was history happening right before our eyes. I love this wedding!’His youthful passion and excitement shamed my middle-aged cynicism. Bertie was right.Bishop Curry sent us all to church yesterday and reminded us that at its core this wedding was about race too: a biracial woman from America marrying into the world’s most famous white family.When he finally sat down, the cameras panned to the bride’s mother Doria, sitting alone, diamond nose stud glinting, tears rolling from her eyes.It was very obvious just what the speech meant to her.He was followed by a black gospel choir singing a brilliant version of Stand By Me and 19-year-old black musical genius Sheku Kanneh-Mason playing the cello so beautifully.I would think it’s hard to overstate the significance of the ceremony, beamed live around the world, to black people everywhere. To borrow the words of Dr King, this was a day when little black girls could watch TV and genuinely share little white girls’ long-held dreams of one day marrying a Prince.(And yes, before the tiresome radical feminists start raging, I know not all girls want to be princesses, and I know not all girls now identify as girls…)In the end, though, this was like the greatest Oscars ceremony of all time: just one hour long, with tub-thumpingly brilliant off-piste speeches, musical performances to melt the heart, comedy moments to make you cry with laughter, and raw emotion to just make you cry.I loved seeing Prince Philip, 96, march into the church without a stick just weeks after a hip operation. (Perhaps he should send Thomas Markle a guidebook on how to man-up for important family events?)I loved seeing Prince Charles chivalrously take Meghan’s arm halfway down the aisle and focus so intently on his brief but vital job in delivering her safely to his son.And I loved the bridesmaids and pageboys all desperately trying not to behave too badly and succeeding remarkably well.I also loved the fact that, in direct contrast to most awards ceremonies, the biggest winners were two superstars who the public clearly adore.  Actor Idris Elba arrived with his model fiancée Sabrina Dhowre, both wearing navy blue, and James Corden looked sharp alongside his elegant wife Julia CareyMeghan looked radiantly beautiful, supremely confident, and born to play the role of a princess, even if in fact she’s going to be the Duchess of Sussex, the county where I grew up.Harry looked madly in love, endearingly nervous (His ‘I’m ******** it!’ confession to his bride at the altar spoke for every man at every wedding ever) and carrying the weight of the world’s hopes on his shoulders.We all want this charming, sensitive young man to be happy. Not least because we all remember him trudging so sadly behind the coffin of his mother, Diana.Of course, we have no idea if this marriage will last.The recent matrimonial record of Royal couples is inarguably dreadful and palace life remains such a suffocating force for even the brightest of those, like Meghan and Diana before her, who enter its confines.So, we’ll just have to sit back and hope for the best.But what I do know is that their marriage ceremony was the most enjoyable and unpredictable Royal Wedding I’ve ever experienced.It mixed the best of traditional British pomp and majesty with large dollops of Markle Sparkle and the result was a biracial, Hollywood-fused union of very different cultures that worked magnificently well.As my Good Morning Britain co-presenter Susanna Reid, who only last week reaffirmed to me her lifelong phobia of all things marital, tweeted afterwards: ‘I may have just been converted to weddings.’Since I’m a orcee, I prefer not to give advice to newlyweds. But I can proffer one piece of uncontestable wisdom that is very easy to adopt.Meghan apparently insisted on lots of geraniums at her wedding. They’re one of her favourite flowers. By coincidence, my family motto is based on something that a Covent Garden flower seller once said to my grandmother: ‘Life ain’t much, but it’s all ya got, so stick a geranium in yer ’at and be ’appy.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/22/4C7384D100000578-0-image-a-4_1526765077031.jpg","title":"Oprah Winfrey arrives royal wedding mystery man Stella McCartney dress overnight","story":"    Who dat?: Oprah Winfrey arrived to the royal wedding without Stedman Graham and instead with a mystery man, entering behind Idris Elba          It\u0027s been real: She and the man did part ways however when Oprah went to find her much better seat in St George\u0027s Chapel      Think pink like Oprah in a Stella McCartney midi dressShop the current line here!Achieving best-dressed guest status is no easy feat when you\u0026#39re attending the most anticipated wedding of the year, but we think Oprah Winfrey might be a strong contender for the title!The talk show host donned a custom Stella McCartney midi dress for Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s big day, topping off her look with a bespoke Philip Treacy concertina lace hat with a feather plume.

She said that of those who have taken the exam this year, only four children have since indicated they will move closer to be eligible for a place. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/23/4C73E34700000578-5749117-There_was_something_of_a_carnival_atmosphere_in_the_gardens_of_t-a-10_1526769544644.jpg","title":"Harry Meghan enjoy wedding party naughty speeches Princes pals","story":"    There was something of a carnival atmosphere in the gardens of the 230-year-old stately home, which once belonged to King George III. These days it is used mainly for entertainingIn fact, their dinner party had more in common with a West End club night than a traditional wedding breakfast, with Harry’s favourite House tracks ‘curated’ by DJ Sam Totolee (who also performed at Pippa Middleton’s wedding), a ‘drinks of the world’ themed bar, and candyfloss and ‘dirty burgers’ as midnight snacks.One source reported a cocktail featuring ginger and rum was put on the menu as a cheeky nod to Harry’s red hair. It was named ‘When Harry Met Meghan’, a play on the film When Harry Met Sally.The party was a notably relaxed, more youthful occasion than the afternoon reception.The intimate guestlist of 200 meant there was no room for mere acquaintances, nor even many minor Royals. Pippa Middleton and Harry’s party-girl ex Chelsy Davy were expected to be absentees.There was something of a carnival atmosphere in the gardens of the 230-year-old stately home, which once belonged to King George III. These days it is used mainly for entertaining.The sit-down dinner was strictly organic, sourced at the request of Prince Charles, and the light-bite canapes were themed ‘spring meets summer’. The meal, paid for by the Prince of Wales, started at 7.30pm and finished at around 10pm.Its three courses were understood to have been peppered with ‘naughty’ speeches from Prince William and a joint effort from Tom Inskip, known as ‘Skippy’ and Tom Van Straubenzee. Any crude nods to Prince Harry’s playboy past were held back until the older guests had departed.Prince Harry took his new wife Meghan Markle out for a spin in a Jaguar that was hailed as \u0027the most beautiful electric car in the world\u0027          The revamped classic car\u0027s number plate read \u0027E190518\u0027 - a tribute to the newlywed\u0027s wedding date. It also had an EU stamp on the plate Inskip – Harry’s closest confidante – was also under strict instructions to downplay Prince Harry’s Las Vegas trips – all before he met Meghan.Guests are also understood to have returned to London late last night for an ‘after-after party’ at celebrity favourite Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone. Another party had been planned in a soundproofed private home in Chelsea.It was quite a contrast with the earlier ‘stand-up’ wedding breakfast in Windsor Castle’s St George’s Hall, which saw 600 guests enjoy ‘bowl food’ and canapes such as Scottish langoustines wrapped in smoked salmon, croquette of confit Windsor Lamb and champagne and pistachio macarons. Harry and his father then gave speeches. Suhani Jalota, the founder of the India-based Myna Mahila charity, said of Harry’s speech: ‘He was talking about his wife. Everybody was clapping because it was the first time he was using that term for Meghan so it was really nice.’She described a speech by the Prince of Wales as ‘lovely’, adding: ‘Essentially it was just about how Harry was as a child and growing up. And about the couple and how beautiful they are together.’Another guest said: ‘Charles nailed it in his speech. He talked about Harry being a baby needing bottles and diapers, then said: “Look how well he turned out.” ’    Guests are also understood to have returned to London late last night for an ‘after-after party’ at celebrity favourite Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone.

It became like a mini-concert in the reception area,’ said one guest. ‘Some people were even crying.’The reception included the cutting of the lemon and elderflower-flavoured wedding cake. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/23/4C7149E300000578-0-STYLE_REPLAY_The_brides_both_wore_ivory_while_William_and_Harry_-a-94_1526769439368.jpg","title":"Anything Kate Meghan Two familiar different Royal Weddings","story":"    STYLE REPLAY: The brides both wore ivory while William and Harry opted for dress uniformThe Only Way Is Sussex!

Harry and Meghan had already spoken in their engagement interview of their passion for the Commonwealth and their hopes for engaging with its young people.          Telling aides that they want to ‘hit the ground running’, Harry and Meghan will instead join the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall at his 70th Birthday Patronage Celebration in the gardens of Buckingham Palace on TuesdayIt is hoped the pair will join Charles and Camilla and William and Kate in helping to exercise ‘soft power’ diplomacy.Meghan has already seen a great deal since her engagement to Harry. Within a few months, the couple had visited every country in the United Kingdom and she appeared to take it all in her stride. Displaying characteristic confidence, she would often introduce herself without waiting for Harry to show her the way.Meghan will be 37 on August 4, so it is likely that starting a family will be a priority. It is something they would both like.Three years ago, after I revealed Harry was quitting the Army, I asked the Prince: ‘What are you going to do next?’ ‘You’ll probably know before me,’ he joked. But he soon became reflective, saying that he wanted to use his celebrity for the good of others.We spoke about his plans to focus on his charity work and a desire to spend ‘a significant period abroad’ on field projects in Africa, which he later did. But mostly he was driven to give back, especially to former military colleagues, as well as to continue his mother’s legacy in helping to eradicate AIDS.

In the hardest-hit areas of Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens, at least 325 acres of land has been covered by lava          The apocalyptic scene has resulted in more than 2000 evacuations from residential areas, and those remaining have been given gas masks to help protect them from the toxic fumes coming out of Kilauea          For the most part, the USGS reported the lava was moving at about 300 yards an hour on Saturday          At one point, lava from two cracks formed into one stream and traveled 1,000 feet in less than an hourThe USGS says the rate of lava eruption has increased, with fountaining at fissure 17 and fissures 16 and 20 \u0027forming a continuous line of spatter and fountaining\u0027.As of Saturday morning, wide flow lava from the consolidated fissure was moving at up to 300 yards an hour, with a separate stream of lava moving in another direction.  The USGS says new lava flows are likely given the increasing rate of activity seen at the rift zone. The Big Island volcano released a small explosion at its summit just before midnight Friday, sending an ash cloud 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) into the sky. The USGS’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said eruptions that create even minor amounts of ashfall could occur at any time. The new lava, which is flowing east underground from the sinking lava lake at Kilauea’s summit, is expected to create bigger flows that travel further, threatening homes and a coastal road that is a key exit route for about 2,000 residents.Scientists are so far unable to predict when the volcano will quiet, but a similar event in 1955 lasted 88 days.\u0027We have no way of knowing whether this is really the beginning or toward the end of this eruption,\u0027 Tom Shea, a volcanologist at the University of Hawaii told Associated Press on Friday.\u0027We\u0027re kind of all right now in this world of uncertainty.\u0027            New lava forming at the summit of Kilauea is expected to spread further and come out faster, which could threaten the homes of 2,000 people and close off key exit routes          Scientists are so far unable to predict when the volcano will quiet, but a similar event in 1955 lasted 88 days          With the intensity of Kilauea\u0027s eruption increasing, officials are warning residents to heed evacuation warnings          As of Friday, Hawaii County officials had distributed about 2,000 N95 gas masks to help protect locals from high levels of sulphur dioxide and ash in the air "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/00/4C740D8B00000578-0-image-a-31_1526771443014.jpg","title":"Apologise calling Andrea Leadsom stupid woman female MPs tell Speaker John Bercow","story":"    John Bercow faces a pincer movement from female MPs who are demanding he apologise over his alleged ‘stupid woman’ jibe at a senior Tory MinisterAnd last night, senior Labour MP Kate Hoey and Tory Vicky Ford both called on the Speaker to apologise.Ms Hoey, a former Labour Minister, contrasted Mr Bercow’s behaviour with that of Betty Boothroyd, the only woman who has so far been Speaker.

She and six other activists have been arrestedThe activists had persistently called for the right for women to drive, with the ban to be lifted in just six weeks.However, they stressed that this was only the first step toward full rights and for year also called for an end to less visible forms of discrimination.They campaigned for lifting guardianship laws that give male relatives final say on whether a woman can travel abroad, obtain a passport, or marry.Their movement was seen as part of a larger democratic and civil rights push in the kingdom, which remains an absolute monarchy where protests are illegal.All major decision-making rests with the king and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Some state-linked media outlets published the names of those detained, which include Loujain al-Hathloul, Aziza al-Yousef and Eman al-Najfan.          Pro-government media outlets splashed their photos online and in newspapers, accusing them of betrayal for their supposed crimesRights activists said Madeha al-Ajroush and Aisha al-Manae are also among the seven detained. Both took part in the first women\u0027s protest movement for the right to drive in 1990, in which 50 women were arrested for driving and lost their passports and their jobs.All five women are well-known activists who agitated for greater women\u0027s rights. Several of the women were professors at state-run universities and are mothers or grandmothers.The Interior Ministry on Saturday did not name those arrested, but said the group is being investigated for communicating with \u0027foreign entities\u0027. It said they were working to recruit people in sensitive government positions and giving money to foreign circles aiming to destabilise and harm the kingdom.The stunning arrests come just six weeks before Saudi Arabia is set to lift the world\u0027s only ban on women driving next month.Saudi police save three women from rapists - then arrest...Millions of Muslims around the world prepare for...Share this articleWhen the kingdom issued its royal decree last year announcing that women would be allowed to drive in 2018, women\u0027s rights activists were contacted by the royal court and warned against giving interviews to the media or speaking out on social media.Following the warnings, some women left the country for a period of time and others stopped voicing their opinions on Twitter.As activists were pressured into silence, Saudi Arabia\u0027s 32-year-old heir to the throne stepped forth, positioning himself as the force behind the kingdom\u0027s reforms.However, Human Rights Watch said the crown prince\u0027s so-called reform campaign \u0027has been a frenzy of fear for genuine Saudi reformers who dare to advocate publicly for human rights or women\u0027s empowerment\u0027.\u0027The message is clear that anyone expressing skepticism about the crown prince\u0027s rights agenda faces time in jail,\u0027 Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said  Loujain al-Hathloul was another of the seven activists branded \u0027traitors\u0027 who were working for \u0027foreign entities\u0027Last year, Prince Mohammed oversaw the arrests of dozens of writers, intellectuals and moderate clerics who were perceived as critics of his foreign policies. He also led an unprecedented shakedown of top princes and businessmen, forcing them to hand over significant portions of their wealth in exchange for their freedom as part of a purported anti-corruption campaign.In an interview with CBS in March, he said that he was \u0027absolutely\u0027 sending a message through these arrests that there was a new sheriff in town.Activists said writer Mohammed al-Rabea and lawyer Ibrahim al-Mudaimigh, two men who worked to support women\u0027s rights campaigners, are also among the seven detained. Al-Mudaimigh defended al-Hathloul in court when she was arrested in late 2014 for more than 70 days for her online criticism of the government and for attempting to bring attention to the driving ban by driving from neighboring United Arab Emirates into Saudi Arabia.Those familiar with the arrests said al-Hathloul was forcibly taken by security forces earlier this year from the UAE, where she was residing, and forced back to the kingdom.In recent weeks, activists said several women\u0027s rights campaigners were also banned from traveling abroad.  Their movement was seen as part of a larger democratic and civil rights push in the kingdom, which remains an absolute monarchy where protests are illegal and major decision-making rests with the king and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (pictured)Immediately after news of the arrests broke, pro-government Twitter accounts were branding the group as treasonous under an Arabic hashtag describing them as traitors for foreign embassies.The pro-government SaudiNews50 Twitter account, with its 11.5 million followers, splashed images of those arrested with red stamps over their face that read \u0027traitor\u0027 and saying that \u0027history spits in the face of the country\u0027s traitors.\u0027The state-linked Al-Jazirah newspaper published on its front-page a photo of al-Hathloul and al-Yousef under a headline describing them as citizens who betrayed the nation.Activists said some in the group were arrested on Tuesday and at least one person was arrested Thursday.They said the detainees were transferred from the capital, Riyadh, to the city of Jiddah for interrogations where the royal court has relocated for the month of Ramadan.Activists said it wasn\u0027t not clear why the seven were arrested now."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/12/4C6C339600000578-0-image-m-54_1526730200824.jpg","title":"Ex student 25 conned extreme explorers 500 000","story":"    The sister of Former Birmingham student Jesse Gordon, pictured centre at a cattle market in Darfur, told The Times he changed his name in 2014 to William Baekeland and claimed he was the great-grand son of the inventor of Bakelite           Baekeland is accused of charging £525,000 to a group of extreme travellers by receiving cash from them to arrange trips to obscure places which have not taken placeHe legally changed his name from Gordon to Baekeland in 2014.  According to Rolling Stone magazine, Baekeland introduced himself to a group of intrepid travellers on board a ship called the Ortelius in March 2015 which was en-route to a tiny Norwegian territory called Bouvet Island, which is located between Antarctica and South Africa.The uninhabited island is about 1,500 miles south of Cape Town.  Watch robbers who terrified their victims with a stun gun...Man, 36, appears in court charged with murdering \u0027gentle and...Share this articleWitnesses reportedly said Baekeland had wooed those on the voyage and soon began wiring him large amounts of cash to arrange other extreme trips.The young man, who was 22 at the time, was described by fellow travellers as \u0027a throwback to David Livingstone\u0027. Over the next two years, Baekeland allegedly convinced several of the group to hand over approximately £525,000 for future trips, only some of which actually took place.            Baekeland\u0027s sister Jasmine Gordon said her brother was alway interested in geographyAccording to The Times,  Baekeland had not left Britain until he was aged 15 when he went on a Scout camp to Canada.  His sister Jasmine Gordon revealed: \u0027Our parents are normal working-class people, we are not particularly wealthy.

So I feel personally invested in this romance!)The large crowd whooped ecstatically with each celebrity sighting and the stars waved with as much faux regalness as they could muster.But as I watched, my mind kept going back to one uneasy question: how can you justify having NONE of your family at your own marriage when you’re filling the church with famous people whom you’ve known for a fraction of the time?It smacked of ruthless and rather distasteful social climbing by a woman who was absolutely delightful when we met in my pub, but whose life has been marked by a worrying tendency to ditch people when they cease to be of use to her. (Her first husband thought they had a happy marriage until the day that Meghan sent his rings back in the post.)          Piers Morgan has given his verdict on the ultimate showbiz weddingMy hackles were raised further when some of the actors strode to the front of the church quire, nestling opposite senior Royals in a clear thespian statement of intent from Ms Markle that screamed: ‘We’re just as big stars as you stuffy lot in tiaras.’They are not, of course. There are no bigger stars than the British Royals, no other human beings who can command 5,000 media people to their weddings, or a billion television viewers.But there’s no doubt Hollywood hijacked this Royal Wedding, both in personnel and in tone, in a carefully co-ordinated operation by an actress putting on the performance of her life, to celebrate the greatest day of her life.Meghan played it safe with her choice of elegant, stylish dress. For her choice of speaker, she played with fire. Literally.The Most Reverend Michael Curry let rip with surely the most memorable Royal Wedding speech ever heard. A sensational tour de force that cited slaves, quoted Dr Martin Luther King, and spoke repeatedly of the raging power of fire and love.At first, I was startled. What the hell was happening here? Then, I was amused. Was he ever going to stop? The cameras cut to a giggling William, Charles and Camilla, to a stern-faced Queen and Philip, and then to a completely baffled Sir Elton John.As Bishop Curry roused himself to ever-higher decibels, I found myself laughing out loud, as were all my family watching with me at home.Eventually, he finished, and my phone rang. It was my 17-year-old son Bertie, who was at school.‘Dad, did you see that?’ he exclaimed excitedly.‘Yes, hilarious wasn’t it…’  US chat show host Oprah Winfrey waved to cameras as she arrived, and Mumford \u0026amp Sons singer Marcus Mumford and actress wife Carey Mulligan arrived together          Sir Elton John, pictured, wore a pair of ominous rose-tinted spectacles at the wedding. Morgan says: \u0027I would think it’s hard to overstate the significance of the ceremony, beamed live around the world, to black people everywhere\u0027‘No! It was incredible!’ he replied. ‘Can you imagine what this must mean to a black American – seeing a black preacher make that kind of speech at a traditionally white British Royal Wedding? This was history happening right before our eyes. I love this wedding!’His youthful passion and excitement shamed my middle-aged cynicism. Bertie was right.Bishop Curry sent us all to church yesterday and reminded us that at its core this wedding was about race too: a biracial woman from America marrying into the world’s most famous white family.When he finally sat down, the cameras panned to the bride’s mother Doria, sitting alone, diamond nose stud glinting, tears rolling from her eyes.It was very obvious just what the speech meant to her.He was followed by a black gospel choir singing a brilliant version of Stand By Me and 19-year-old black musical genius Sheku Kanneh-Mason playing the cello so beautifully.I would think it’s hard to overstate the significance of the ceremony, beamed live around the world, to black people everywhere. To borrow the words of Dr King, this was a day when little black girls could watch TV and genuinely share little white girls’ long-held dreams of one day marrying a Prince.(And yes, before the tiresome radical feminists start raging, I know not all girls want to be princesses, and I know not all girls now identify as girls…)In the end, though, this was like the greatest Oscars ceremony of all time: just one hour long, with tub-thumpingly brilliant off-piste speeches, musical performances to melt the heart, comedy moments to make you cry with laughter, and raw emotion to just make you cry.I loved seeing Prince Philip, 96, march into the church without a stick just weeks after a hip operation. (Perhaps he should send Thomas Markle a guidebook on how to man-up for important family events?)I loved seeing Prince Charles chivalrously take Meghan’s arm halfway down the aisle and focus so intently on his brief but vital job in delivering her safely to his son.And I loved the bridesmaids and pageboys all desperately trying not to behave too badly and succeeding remarkably well.I also loved the fact that, in direct contrast to most awards ceremonies, the biggest winners were two superstars who the public clearly adore.  Actor Idris Elba arrived with his model fiancée Sabrina Dhowre, both wearing navy blue, and James Corden looked sharp alongside his elegant wife Julia CareyMeghan looked radiantly beautiful, supremely confident, and born to play the role of a princess, even if in fact she’s going to be the Duchess of Sussex, the county where I grew up.Harry looked madly in love, endearingly nervous (His ‘I’m ******** it!’ confession to his bride at the altar spoke for every man at every wedding ever) and carrying the weight of the world’s hopes on his shoulders.We all want this charming, sensitive young man to be happy. Not least because we all remember him trudging so sadly behind the coffin of his mother, Diana.Of course, we have no idea if this marriage will last.The recent matrimonial record of Royal couples is inarguably dreadful and palace life remains such a suffocating force for even the brightest of those, like Meghan and Diana before her, who enter its confines.So, we’ll just have to sit back and hope for the best.But what I do know is that their marriage ceremony was the most enjoyable and unpredictable Royal Wedding I’ve ever experienced.It mixed the best of traditional British pomp and majesty with large dollops of Markle Sparkle and the result was a biracial, Hollywood-fused union of very different cultures that worked magnificently well.As my Good Morning Britain co-presenter Susanna Reid, who only last week reaffirmed to me her lifelong phobia of all things marital, tweeted afterwards: ‘I may have just been converted to weddings.’Since I’m a orcee, I prefer not to give advice to newlyweds. But I can proffer one piece of uncontestable wisdom that is very easy to adopt.Meghan apparently insisted on lots of geraniums at her wedding. They’re one of her favourite flowers. By coincidence, my family motto is based on something that a Covent Garden flower seller once said to my grandmother: ‘Life ain’t much, but it’s all ya got, so stick a geranium in yer ’at and be ’appy.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/05/4C72F5B900000578-5749333-Hawaii_s_Kilauea_volcano_has_been_erupting_for_more_than_two_wee-a-167_1526789404091.jpg","title":"Fresh lava Hawaiis Kilauea volcano consumes four homes begins travel faster","story":"    Pictured: Flames surround what remains of a home in Pahoa (left) after it was covered in lava, as the stream rushes towards another home          Hawaii\u0027s Kilauea volcano has been erupting for more than two weeks now, with locals subject to the sounds of near-constant explosions    Multiple fissures are actively spurting and fountaining out lava, which is moving faster now the older magma has been clearedThe volcano has been erupting for more than two weeks now, and has coated more than 325 hectares of Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens  in lava.More than 2,000 people have been evacuated from residential areas on Big Island and National Guard helicopters have been sent out to airlift at least four residents from Hawaii\u0027s lower Puna area. As of Friday, Hawaii County officials had distributed about 2,000 N95 gas masks to help protect locals from high levels of sulphur dioxide and ash in the air.Hawaii resident, 75, snaps incredible photos of volcano...Photographer behind iconic Hawaii photo of golfers playing...Fountains of lava spewing 200ft HIGH and bombs the size of...Share this articleThree people were initially trapped on Saturday, but eventually got out of a hazardous area, and one was evacuated by air, said Janet Snyder, spokeswoman for Hawaii County.\u0027They shouldn\u0027t be in that area,\u0027 said County Managing Director Wil Okabe.

The USGS’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said eruptions that create even minor amounts of ashfall could occur at any time. The new lava, which is flowing east underground from the sinking lava lake at Kilauea’s summit, is expected to create bigger flows that travel further, threatening homes and a coastal road that is a key exit route for about 2,000 residents.Scientists are so far unable to predict when the volcano will quiet, but a similar event in 1955 lasted 88 days.\u0027We have no way of knowing whether this is really the beginning or toward the end of this eruption,\u0027 Tom Shea, a volcanologist at the University of Hawaii told Associated Press on Friday.\u0027We\u0027re kind of all right now in this world of uncertainty.\u0027            New lava forming at the summit of Kilauea is expected to spread further and come out faster, which could threaten the homes of 2,000 people and close off key exit routes          Scientists are so far unable to predict when the volcano will quiet, but a similar event in 1955 lasted 88 days          With the intensity of Kilauea\u0027s eruption increasing, officials are warning residents to heed evacuation warnings          As of Friday, Hawaii County officials had distributed about 2,000 N95 gas masks to help protect locals from high levels of sulphur dioxide and ash in the air "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/00/4C743B1800000578-5749359-image-m-73_1526774319518.jpg","title":"Royal Wedding Harry bride dressed page boys bridesmaids match themselves","story":"    For all the four page boys and six bridesmaids who made up Meghan’s Mini Army, it was a triumph  Look chic in a yellow coat like the Duchess of Cambridge in Alexander McQueenClick to shop the brand!Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding must have taken the Duchess of Cambridge back to her own royal nuptials, so we weren\u0026#39t surprised to see she that she opted for another Alexander McQueen design.

It has long seemed so practical, so sensible and at the same time inspiringly progressive that the benefits that Henry Ford discovered in the production line – speed, efficiency, cheapness, quality – might be applied to the places where we live. Le Corbusier had a go in the 1920s. So did Buckminster Fuller, with the aluminium yurt he called the Dymaxion.Somehow, their machine-age nirvana keeps on not quite happening. The world is not covered with Dymaxia, nor the many other variations on the theme. The nearest Britain came to living the dream was with the postwar prefab – quick and cheap, for sure, but rationed in their comfort and beauty, modern nostalgic revisionism notwithstanding. In the 1960s, government promotion of factory-built housing tended to produce results that were not particularly cheap, or functional, or good-looking, but were at least numerous.Still, nil desperandum. Since the 1980s, office buildings have been built with extensive prefabrication, or modularisation, to use the preferred contemporary name – facade panels and toilet blocks built under cover, away from the wind, rain, muck and hazards of a building site, and craned into place with the satisfying simplicity of a child’s toy. If Britain’s housing shortages are seriously to be addressed, they will require not only land and funding, but also an expansion of the construction industry’s capacity to build. Which, if it is not to entail limitless supplies of labour coming to Brexit Britain from eastern Europe, will require the aid of factories.As in the 1960s, politicians are urging. Last year the London Assembly published a report arguing that off-site manufacturing (as they called it) would be essential to meeting London’s need for at least 50,000 new homes a year. And, possibly, there are at last signs that this holy grail of housing (or the philosopher’s stone, or Fermat’s last theorem, or theory of everything – take your pick among things and solutions that are legendarily hard to find) might be found.Among the reasons to be hopeful is Mapleton Cresent in Wandsworth, south London, a just-finishing 27-storey development wrapped in aqueous green-grey faience. Billed as “Europe’s tallest modular residential tower”, it is designed by the architects politan Workshop for the developer Pocket Living, who specialise in reducing the cost of housing by producing flats that are small but, they hope, perfectly formed. They aim to compensate for the reduced dimensions of their units through careful design and by adding such shared benefits as a roof terrace, cycle storage and a residents’ lounge.The tower stands on an awkward little site, in spirit part poetic and part functional. One side is the uncompromising flank of the Southside shopping centre, on another the fast-flowing river Wandle, one of those secondary London rivers that are sometimes mentioned and rarely seen. It’s an unlikely spot for a tall building, even in a city where they can now sprout almost anywhere, but with the help of modularisation the developers and architects found a way to do it.Mapleton Crescent is made up of storey-high units, each the size of half a flat, that arrived on site complete with plaster, paint, windows, doors, wiring, plumbing, bathrooms and tiles, and were then craned into place, one on the top of each other, at the rate of one storey per day. These boxes are structural too, meaning that they hold each other up without the need of an additional frame. The factory-made units, built in Bedfordshire by the contractor Donban, saved time – which, as developers like Pocket borrow to build, is money. By going up almost as soon as they arrive, they reduce the problems that come with a small site, which is that builders have nowhere to keep materials that are waiting to be erected.Where Mapleton Crescent differs from past visions of factory-made housing is that it feels no need to proclaim its futurism – indeed it’s all the better for making its mechanical DNA feel both domestic and urban. Early prophets such as Buckminster Fuller thought that a home built like a car should look like a car. Here the flats are of a type basically familiar from conventionally built homes. The exterior faience cladding, its precise shade developed by the ceramic artist Loraine Rutt, is itself a factory-made modular material, but one that has been commonplace on London buildings since the 19th century.The building has architectural qualities that are nothing in particular to do with the innovation in its construction. It has a pleasantly slender profile, with shifting rhythms and a nice balance of verticals and horizontals. There is a considered relationship to the river, and an entrance hall that, by bringing the external materials inside, has a durable and well-made feel. The textured surfaces of the faience give a sense of depth and liveliness you don’t get in most cladding systems. Mapleton Crescent is – and never mind that the bar is low – one of the best-looking examples to come out of London’s boom in residential towers.It is plausible because it doesn’t proselytise. Modular units are used not as prophecy but as the best available means in a given circumstance. It must be said that this project is singular. The cost and complexity of building a tower on this site means that Pocket have included 36 homes at full market price (£600,000-£730,000 for two- and three-bedroom flats) to subsidise its 53 cheaper units (at £225,000-£330,000 for a petite, 38 sq metres one-bed – cheapness in London being a strictly relative concept). The same techniques, however, are now being applied to other tall building projects, with a better proportion of affordability.Mapleton Crescent is not alone. The financial services company Legal \u0026amp General promise to “revolutionise” housing by investing in factory-built houses, the exact nature of which remains to be revealed. The developers Urban Splash have tried their hand at it in their New Islington development in Manchester. Some of the big housebuilding companies are also having a go.There is formidable inertia to be overcome. Most homes are realised by the big housebuilders, who have well-established ways of building involving fleets of sub-contractors, all of which would have to be reinvented to accommodate modular building. It also requires investment in factories and production lines, which require confidence that future demand will be at least steady, which in the booming-and-busting British housing market is hard to find.Building in factories is not a magic bullet. It will not solve the housing crisis, so long as bigger questions such as the supply of land and public investment remain unresolved. But it’s an eminently sane and beneficial way of constructing homes, with less waste and better quality, whose time might finally be coming."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f54ae1aa8451ce91195d539224e6fa3e099fad28/4_4_2507_1503/master/2507.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99c4595704d24f8971dc40a8df80aa05","title":"lady in blue the nudes of lisa brice in pictures","story":"South Africa-born artist Lisa Brice first began working on her series of blue female nudes in 2014. “The situations are imagined,” she says, “but based on real experience.” They’ve been all-consuming at times: “I painted a group of 60 continuously day and night for a month,” she says. “Eventually they grew into a small army of feminine figures.”Brice, who now lives in London after spells in Trinidad, partly chose the colour because of its associations, “from the glow of blue neon signs to the fleeting colour of twilight, to the Trinidadian ‘blue devil’ carnival character”.

As one of the original signatories of the treaty of Rome, Italy desperately wanted to be in monetary union’s first wave.But there was no real examination of whether a country like Italy – with its inflationary tendencies – could actually cope with the rigours of single-currency membership. There was no equivalent of Gordon Brown’s five tests that the then chancellor said had to be passed before Britain could join.On the contrary, when it became clear that Italy would not meet the criteria, the rules were bent to make sure it did. The result: two lost economic decades in which living standards have stagnated, which is why Italy has given up on mainstream politics. A coalition government of two populist and euro-sceptic parties – the Five Star Movement and the League – appears imminent. Although neither wing of the coalition has any love for the euro, they have already discovered the truth of Hague’s words. Their draft policy agreement included the proposal that the EU should establish a procedure for countries to leave the euro where there was “popular will” to do so, but this has now been dropped.It’s not hard to see why. Were the financial markets to think that the new populist government was serious about leaving the single currency, Italian government bonds would become riskier. Investors would demand a higher return for holding them and that would drive up market interest rates. The European Central Bank could help by buying Italian bonds, but would have little incentive to help a government in Rome intent on undermining – if not destroying – monetary union.A financial crisis would envelop the new government. Italy’s shaky banking system would collapse and the country would descend into a deep recession. Unemployment would rise and the Five Star Movement and the League would be blamed. The populists would quickly become unpopular.So the new Italian government is in the same position as all the other governments the country has had over the past two decades: membership of the single currency is a curse but trying to leave the euro would be even worse. Like Greece, Italy is discovering that it is a bit late to say that it would have been better to have constructed the euro with a few fire escapes. It is actually easier for Britain – with its own central bank and its own currency – to leave the EU than it is for Italy to leave the euro.The prospect of a marked loosening of policy scares the financial markets and won’t go down well in other European capitals either. But actually, the coalition’s fiscal policies make sense. The real problem lies with the eurozone’s absurdly deflationary fiscal rules.As Dhaval Joshi of BCA Research has pointed out, Italy is in some respects similar to Japan. Both countries faced difficulties because their zombie banks proved incapable of lending to the private sector. Japan solved this problem by getting the public sector to do the lending, even though this meant a big increase in its debt ratio. Italy is in a worse position because the eurozone’s fiscal rules mean it has not been allowed to run bigger budget deficits.Italy has lower total indebtedness – private and public combined – than Britain, France and Spain, but as far as the EU’s fiscal rules are concerned only public debt matters. Joshi notes: “Hence, the Italian government was prevented from recapitalising its banking system, and the Italian economy stagnated for a decade.”Those in charge of the single currency know that as it stands the euro is an unfinished project. It could be completed by the reform package proposed by the French president Emmanuel Macron, which would involve fiscal union as well as monetary union, presided over by a eurozone finance minister.There is not the remotest possibility that Macron could get the new government in Rome to sign up to his plan even if he could secure the full-throated backing of Germany.One alternative to Macron’s scheme is to allow members of the eurozone more freedom to run fiscal policies that meet their own needs, which is what Italy’s populist coalition is demanding. At present, the rules mean that any struggling country can only make itself more competitive through internal deflation – cost cutting and austerity. The other is to allow things to drift on as they are and hope for the best. This has seen the euro through one crisis – just – but would not see it through another. The risk is not that one country will jump out of the burning building but that the building will eventually collapse with everybody in it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446013b2d2bbf76ae9a2a5a09551c502369b63b6/0_0_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba933f6e47e93b4d9a2a7ee42517d4a6","title":"im worth more than what i put on my face","story":"Cook, food stylist and writer  Anna Jones reflects on how she discovered a signature look to suit her work and family worldsCook, food stylist and writer  Anna Jones reflects on how she discovered a signature look to suit her work and family worldsIn my life, I’ve inhabited many different worlds. I’ve been through phases of dressing like a goth, a hippy and a really girly girl. As a student, I read economics and philosophy, then worked for a PR company where everyone dressed in suits. Then, after reading an article that said you should follow your passion according to which part of the newspaper you read first, I pivoted into a career in food with an apprenticeship at Jamie Oliver’s Fifteen restaurant. I’ve worked hot shifts in busy kitchens, and now I spend my time testing recipes, going on food photoshoots and writing about cooking, alongside looking after my two-year-old son at home. But through it all, I’ve kept a very consistent look. I’ve always admired women who reinvent themselves dramatically, but that’s just never been my way. Happily, I’ve always been content in my own skin and I put that down to my mum.Looking back on myself as a little girl, I was so pretty and sweet but I didn’t always feel it. I wore glasses, which I hated, so I ditched them for contact lenses as soon as I could. However, at quite a young age I realised that despite what I looked like, my value came from my inside not my outside. That discovery was thanks to Mum. She really instilled in my sister, Laura, and me that makeup was there for us to use if we wanted it, but that it wasn’t something we should put on for anyone beyond ourselves. As a teenager I would play around with pink pearlescent lipsticks and questionable eyeshadows and it was always a fun part of dressing up – it never felt essential. As a proud feminist, Mum has only ever dressed for herself, and is naturally very beautiful. She has the most vibrant, glowing skin and has never worn a scrap of foundation. I carry her belief inside me, which is that I’m worth more than what I put on my face.Following my apprenticeship, I worked in restaurant kitchens in London and around the world. I’d swapped the corporate world of heels and power suits for a predominantly male environment. I’d still wear makeup in the kitchen but not too much – opening an oven door, for instance, can melt off your mascara. I’d wear chef’s whites, made for men, with my hair scraped back. The chef’s outfit was defeminising and sometimes that was useful, especially on the occasions where I’d have to bring out my inner alpha female. But I also wanted to feel like a woman – and to feel like myself – and a little makeup helped me mark myself out from the boys, even if it was just a lick of mascara, some blusher and a dot of concealer.When I left the kitchens to work for Jamie Oliver on his food team, helping him to write recipes, make his TV shows and make his food look good in pictures, I was introduced to a whole new world of photoshoots, lights and cameras.And, thanks to my work, I’ve had my eyes opened to the fact that there’s more than just one makeup setting – it doesn’t have to always be a natural base and a flick of eyeliner.This was brought home to me in the run up to my wedding, two years ago. John and I married in a beautiful church on an island in north Wales. It was an idyllic setting but I wasn’t sure I’d be able to get a makeup artist to take the trip, so my dear friend Ceri bought me a three-hour makeup lesson in London with an amazing woman called Sasha, so that I could do my own on the day. It was fantastic and so much better than watching a YouTube tutorial. Obviously I don’t often recreate the look I wore on my wedding day (although it was very natural), but thanks to that lesson, I have a few different “faces” that I can bring out, depending on the occasion. And while I’m often happy to embrace the day bare-faced, I do have a go-to look that suits me most days. Having never been a morning person – and now with my son Dylan, two, to look after – I can do the whole thing in seven minutes: light foundation, cream concealer, bronzer, peachy blusher, eyelash curlers, mascara and a smear of lip balm. I’ve done it on the tube and in the back of a taxi.There’s a definite synergy that connects the way I look and the ethos behind my style of cooking. My recipes are full of fresh, vibrant, earthy flavours and that’s reflected in how I present myself. I like clothes made from natural fabrics that feel good on my skin in colours that reflect nature – my love of things that come from the earth pervades every aspect of my life. With the food I make, I try to put joy at the centre of every plate, and that’s how I approach getting ready in the morning. Those seven minutes are probably the only time I spend on myself during the whole day. It’s a ritual that helps me to feel bright and ready to face the day.Photography: Brian Daly and Louisa Parry"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b27de34b8d7c65d8be9c00a32f22fa8517dec22/0_265_3488_2094/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac59336f13243d2470eea297c8e34027","title":"royal wedding prince harry meghan markle","story":"The royal wedding demonstrated great public affection for the monarchy, but it exists only so long as it keeps winning the popularity contestIn advance of the event, the campaign group Republic launched a petition demanding that no taxpayers’ money be spent on the royal wedding. These anti-monarchists managed to attract a grand total of 32,000 signatures from an adult population of more than 50 million people.I take no particular pleasure in saying this – I am not an enthusiast for hereditary monarchy – but the royals are in robust shape. A country that has become highly cynical about its other institutions makes an exception for monarchy. The crown has weathered the tumultuous decades of the Queen’s long reign more successfully than any of its competitors in the realm. The end of empire, the rise of meritocracy and the death of deference socialism and Thatcherism immigration, globalisation and populism wars and peace booms and busts: successive waves of great social and economic change have crashed over Britain and the anachronism of a hereditary head of state is still standing. To endure for so long in a democratic age is a feat that is both remarkable and rarely registered.Prince Philip calls them The Firm and it can be useful to think of the Windsors as a family business. Shareholder approval for the 92-year-old boss is high. The Queen enjoys public satisfaction ratings that politicians can only fantasise about and dare not quarrel with. The republican sympathies expressed by the Labour MP Emma Dent Coad are striking only because they are so unusual to hear from a parliamentarian. The daring radicals of the Scots Nats say they would keep the Queen as head of state of an independent Scotland. In Jeremy Corbyn, Labour has a leader who is a career-long republican, but the party’s last manifesto did not propose to retire the monarchy and he says he has no intention of getting rid of the Queen, with whom he has “nice chats”.Popular support for royalty can be partly explained by the power of contrasts. The Church of England still plays a role in national life, but attendance in its places of worship has been in long-term decline since the Queen acceded to the throne in 1952. The BBC, the monopoly broadcaster when it televised her coronation, now competes for the nation’s attention in a cacophonously digitised world. Other institutions that once rivalled the monarchy as magnets for national sentiment have lost their lustre. The military has been shriven by spending cuts and is still not recovered from the humiliations suffered in Afghanistan and Iraq. In the year that the Queen succeeded her father, someone published a book called The Glory of Parliament. No\u0026nbspone would commission that title today. In the 1980s, monarchists silenced republicans by asking: President Thatcher? In the 1990s, it was: President Blair? Now monarchists can mock: President Trump?The Firm survived a torrid stretch in the 1990s. If you are of an age to recall “squidgygate”, “Camillagate” and “toe-sucking”, you are old enough to remember when royal marriages were falling apart in front of a gawping nation’s eyes. As the House of Windsor rocked on what seemed to be crumbling foundations, the heir to the throne and his former wife publicly traded accusations of adultery. “The War of the Waleses” destroyed the claim to be an exemplar of family life. When Windsor Castle was ravaged by fire, many saw it as a doomy metaphor for monarchy and the Queen talked miserably about her “annus horribillis”.So royalty’s subsequent recovery after the death of Diana is also down to its capacity for reinvention. The Firm has been ruthless about sidelining products for which there is little public demand (Prince Andrew, Prince Edward) while introducing younger, more popular lines (William and Kate George, Charlotte and Louis Harry and Meghan). You do not have to buy into all the over-heated gush about Meghan Markle “modernising the monarchy” to see that she does inject something fresh into the royal collection that will extend its customer base.As millions witnessed yesterday, they have a genius for staging pageant that is both glamorous and populist. Marriages, along with births, are two of the signature products of the crown. The global TV audience for the wedding was big. None of the world’s other monarchies has such a potent international brand and this reflects back to Britain to help The Firm consolidate its standing with the domestic audience. During the opening ceremony of the London Olympics, nearly a billion viewers worldwide watched the Queen play herself in a comedic routine with Daniel Craig as James Bond before appearing to parachute with him into the Olympic stadium.Everything must change for everything to stay the same. Adapting to survive is a strategy that the British monarchy has been practising artfully for a long time. Kingsley Martin wrote about “the evolution of the popular monarchy” back in 1936. He disapproved of what he called an “irrational attitude” towards “the new cult of monarchy”. His mistake was to judge it in terms of rationality. Walter Bagehot, writing in the Victorian era, was more acute when he identified the “magic” of “theatrical show” as one of the essential attributes of a successful crown. If he were writing today, Bagehot might update himself by adding “celebrity” and “soap opera”. The job involves a lot of performance, as Meghan Markle, a thespian by profession, seems to have understood from the moment she joined the team.The Queen may have had no formal training in acting, but she is the majesty of royal image. She has consolidated her popularity by the faultless execution of her role as a stately emblem of continuity, stability and discretion. In 92 years of life, 66 of them on the throne, she has defied the fashion of the times by giving away very little of her self. We have to guess at her political opinions, because she has always comprehended that a constitutional monarch is not allowed to express any. She has never faced an election, but she understands that the House of Windsor can only be sustained so long as it has broad-based public support.It is silly to deny – and some republicans make themselves look foolish when they do so – that many people derive a lot of innocent enjoyment and pride from the royals. The endurance of the crown into the second decade of the 21st century does, though, come with costs. There is a symbolic potency to having a head of state who was born into the position. This institutionalisation of privilege and inequality at the pinnacle of the state doesn’t help Britain’s well-documented difficulties with social mobility. Royal shows are an escapist distraction for a fractious nation, but when the confetti is swept away and the bunting taken down, Britain is still left to wrestle with its deep isions. Another concern is that Britain’s monarchy is all that much of the world ever notices about our country and this entrenches an international image of these islands as a heritage park.For royalists, the worm in the bud is that the entire enterprise is anchored on the respect for the nonagenarian whose record time on the throne has defined monarchy for so many decades. Will Prince Charles, a much less popular figure than his mother, make a hash of it when it is his turn to take the helm of The Firm? Many who have interacted with him worry that an overeagerness to express his opinions will make him a isive king. A recent biography by Tom Bower portrayed the heir to the throne as whingeing, self-obsessed and grasping, a Prince Charmless. Mr Bower is never knowingly kind to his subjects, but if Charles is only half as awful as he is depicted in that book, he could be a risky occupant of the throne. This worries some royalists so much that they argue that Charles should renounce the succession in favour of his son. William and Kate, who say nothing interesting and say it awfully nicely, seem to have a firmer grasp of the rules of modern monarchy than he does. Polls report that a lot of voters agree that The Firm ought to skip a generation, which suggests that many of the public either do not understand the hereditary principle or don’t have any reverence for it.A lot has changed since the Queen’s distant ancestor crossed the Channel in 1066 to seize the throne, but one thing remains as true now as it was at the time of the Norman Conquest. The peculiarity of monarchy is that it is an institution embodied in a personality. Public consent for its continued existence is inextricably enmeshed with the country’s opinion of the head that wears the crown. It is the paradox of modern hereditary monarchy that it exists only for so long as it can keep winning an endless public popularity contest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c46cf13ced064e7342bf2bcee59b5e4a480d6e6/0_167_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6caf455c1e56e3cbb7aee39fefb49a37","title":"film director nora twomey interview new review q and a breadwinner","story":"The director on leaving school at 15, working with Angelina Jolie on her first solo feature The Breadwinner, and fighting cancerNora Twomey is a 46-year-old Irish animator and co-founder of the revered, Kilkenny-based Cartoon Saloon. She was co-director, with Tomm Moore, of 2009’s The Secret of Kells and head of story on Song of the Sea (2014), both of which were nominated for Academy Awards. Her first solo feature, The Breadwinner, is set in Kabul in 2001 and follows a young girl who disguises herself as a boy to support her family after her father is arrested by the Taliban. That, too, made this year’s shortlist for best animated film at the Oscars – not bad going for a woman who left school at 15 without\u0026nbspcompleting\u0026nbspher Leaving\u0026nbspCertificate.The Breadwinner was originally a 2000 novel by Deborah Ellis – you’ve said, after reading it, you felt\u0026nbspcompelled to make the film. What\u0026nbspwas it about the story that inspired that reaction? I’ve always been aware I have an incredibly privileged job, working in a small company that makes independent films. We’re not beholden to shareholders, we’re not trying to push merchandise, and that means we can tell stories that are a little bit different. So for me, reading the character of Parvana, it was so unusual to have a young girl at the heart of a story like this. And she was so full of love and passion, but she’s written in such a realistic way. She’s also very flawed, very human – she fights with her older sister, she gets grumpy. So I guess as a mother as well, I felt excited at the idea of being able to put that on to the screen.The Breadwinner is dominated by strong girls and women. Have you noticed a change in the film-making landscape in the light of new gender-equality movements in the industry?I hope it’s long term and not the latest branding exercise, basically. Nora Ephron was asked what question would she wish she was never asked again and it was about being a female film director – how many years ago was that? And here I am. But I hope that the next generation don’t have to answer those questions, or it’s not unusual for a woman to direct a film, or it’s not unusual to have a female character who’s not a male interpretation of a female.Angelina Jolie is an executive producer on The Breadwinner what was her involvement in the film? She became involved about five years ago and was just an incredible guiding force through the whole thing. She set up a girls’ school in Afghanistan over a decade ago, so her heart is very close to the subject matter of the film.And she helped set the tone and sensibility, so that the film was realistic but at the same time really hopeful. Also, just encouraging our cast and our crew. She would record video messages to make sure that people saw she was watching each milestone as we hit it – whether it was completing animation or recording the voice cast or whatever.\u0026nbspThat meant a lot.You worked in a factory after you left\u0026nbspschool. What were you doing? The factory cut up vegetables and processed dry and frozen vegetables. So I’d sit at a conveyor belt for 12 hours – I used to work the night shift – and you’d watch the conveyor belt go by with diced vegetables and pick out the black bits, basically. But you know what, it was an incredible training for my imagination. The machinery was very loud so I had to wear earplugs and then headphones on top of the earplugs and I couldn’t talk to anybody. And I’d just make up stories and entertain myself with beginnings, middles and ends in my head for those 12 hours. When I\u0026nbspsit at an edit machine\u0026nbspnow, it’s that\u0026nbspsame space that I enter.And now you get to go to the Oscars. Was it a big disappointment not to win\u0026nbspthis year? It wasn’t a surprise that Coco won it’s a really, really beautiful film. For us, the fact our film is up there, that’s it got a light shining on it, that’s the huge win. And honestly, the year I had preceding that, it puts\u0026nbspthings in perspective. I had a cancer diagnosis during the making\u0026nbspof the film, so if you get to finish a film, if you get to celebrate it\u0026nbspwith your crew and then you get to talk about it with the world’s press at the Academy Awards, if you\u0026nbspget to stand up as a female film-maker when Frances McDormand asks for\u0026nbspthe female nominees in the room\u0026nbspto stand\u0026nbspup, then that’s a pretty good\u0026nbspnight.Have you made a full recovery now?Yeah, I’m working away. People talk about cures, but once a doctor says the word “cancer” to you, there’s no going back. I read up on it quite a bit and I’m under no illusions about the sneakiness of cancer. But they bought me back time. My doctors gave me back my health, so for me that’s absolutely incredible that they managed to inject me with just the right amount of poison and zap me with the right amount of radiotherapy to give me back time. Time to be making films, time to be with my children, and for that I’m eternally grateful.The Breadwinner, a film with women’s\u0026nbsprights at its core, is being released in the UK and Ireland on the\u0026nbspsame day as the abortion referendum in Ireland. Which way will you vote? It’s a hugely emotional issue for all Irish people, but I’m in my mid-40s, I’ve had girlfriends go through all kinds of experiences in the last 30 years, so for me the choice has to be with the medical profession and with the women and the families who are faced with these decisions. We can’t keep exporting our problems. And that’s all that would happen. I’ve been to Argentina recently, where abortion isn’t allowed, and you realise it’s a class thing. The poorer people are left with backstreet solutions to the dilemmas they face in their lives.What’s next for you?I have a film in development called\u0026nbspMy Father’s Dragon. It’s based\u0026nbspon a book that’s over 50 years old by Ruth Stiles Gannett about a young boy who argues with his mum and he goes on this\u0026nbspadventure.\u0026nbspIt’s gorgeous – it\u0026nbspreminds me of Roald Dahl. You’re not quite sure if it’s real or not, but he meets a best friend and his best friend happens to be a dragon.The Breadwinner is out on 25 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/417fa4078e77ca1f7f875728c990aff0dbb7139e/0_0_2352_1411/master/2352.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c3dd176b76b45a07ea568e0acdc501b","title":"manchester united jose mourinho marcus rashford fa cup final","story":"Isolated outing for forward in the cup final was dismaying proof that skilful attackers are being left to regress at Old TraffordOn a sweaty, heavy, oddly gruelling Wembley day Manchester United’s sweaty, heavy, oddly gruelling season was finally euthanised to a close.It has been a good season in some ways, with obvious progress made in the Premier League. But it passed here without the garnish of a trophy as Eden Hazard’s first-half penalty settled a largely forgettable FA\u0026nbspCup final in Chelsea’s favour.Chelsea have had a mixed season, too. Victory at Wembley was a reflection not of a team finding its gears, but of the fact in Hazard they had the best player on the pitch, enough to make a difference even in just the briefest glimpse.For United this felt like something else, a dose of necessary medicine where the gleam of another trophy might have concealed the symptoms, hid the deeper snags and knots. Either way it seemed a fitting reflection of United’s status right now to end the season watching this sluggish red‑shirted machine spend 90\u0026nbspminutes trying and failing to score\u0026nbspa goal.This remains the single most interesting thing about this powerful, strangely burdened team. From Anfield to St\u0026nbspJames’ Park, from Andalucía to Ashton Gate, United’s season has been a heavy kind of thing,\u0026nbspwith a sense throughout of trapped energy, of cogs that refuse to click, of results wrung out of bloody‑minded will.Look back and this has been the one constant of the post‑Ferguson era. Through five years and three managers successive teams have shared this clogged aspect, lacking in the vital notes of grace and fluency. Against all expectations Manchester\u0026nbspUnited have somehow become the Daleks.Mourinho’s team has now ended the season with seven goals in their\u0026nbsplast eight games, with fewer away goals than Leicester in the league, with a single goal over 180 minutes against\u0026nbspSevilla, with four goals in a game just once since a fine scoring run in the autumn. Albeit, even in those most liberated moments there\u0026nbsphas been a clanking quality, like an android replicant making brief, sullen attempts to dance the Charleston.If any player embodied this struggle at Wembley it was probably the frantic figure of Marcus Rashford, who was never on his heels, who ran constantly, passed accurately but who seemed throughout to be playing through a kind of fog, blunt when he needed to be sharp, a player making all the right runs, just not necessarily in the right order.With Romelu Lukaku unfit for anything more than the bench this was a wonderful opportunity for Rashford to play as a starting centre-forward in a season-defining game. Not that his year to date had provided much significant preparation.Rashford did get a start as a centre-forward against Brighton just a couple of weeks ago, a game that inspired a pretty wretched piece of public politicking from Mourinho afterwards. “Why always Lukaku? Now you see why,” was the verdict of a man charged with building the confidence, self-esteem and general pastoral wellbeing of one of the brightest young attacking talents in England. Or not, as the case may be.Here Rashford lined up just ahead of Alexis Sánchez here in a vague, ungrooved, energetically incoherent impersonation of a two-man attack. After five minutes and 30 seconds someone in a red shirt finally passed to him. For a while he made runs: curving runs, runs across the back three, runs behind the full-backs. After all it’s good to keep yourself busy. Meanwhile a football match happened 30 yards away.Rashford is still only 20 and in the middle of one of those difficult seasons young players are allowed to have. The wider issue is the sense of a player drifting into a kind of dead zone where he seems unsure not just of his role but of his own basic skills.Mourinho’s keenest fans will be eager to excuse him from any part in this. But something is missing here. Rashford has talent and willing. There has simply been no development, just a sense of irritation that this young player is not a ready-made elite No\u0026nbsp9.Either way Rashford looks more like an over-promoted youth-team player now than when he actually was one. Certainly it is clearer than ever how important Lukaku is to José’s United. Second balls, bouncing off defenders, fighting for scrappy possession: this is the job now.United did surge after half-time, making concerted attempts to force the ball through Chelsea’s lines in a red-shirted bludgeon. With no obvious attacking plan, United went into blitz mode, midfield storming forward, the full‑backs battering in crosses. But they never really threatened to find the right forward\u0026nbspgear.There is nothing wrong with defensive football, which has its own kind of beauty. Mourinho has been the master of victory through constriction, and in the process has provided some of the most memorable and overachieving European teams of the last couple of decades.But the past tense is significant here. Reactive, strangulating football remains his base note, but it is hardly reflected in the wider world where the most successful teams tend to pour their energies and planning into moving forward, concentrating on the weaknesses not the strengths of an opponent.No goals: no trophy. The extent to which Mourinho is willing, never mind able, to regear this United team over the summer will surely be key to the immediate future of both."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b550e7fa1f5a9f270ff11e4fd4e7edd24336eab7/17_150_2974_1784/master/2974.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5babe0b5dbf2c0be25b67568250a8c54","title":"jurgen klopp liverpool real madrid champions league final everything possible","story":"The Liverpool manager still has raw memories of defeat in a Champions League final but he is undeterred as he prepares for another tilt at club football’s ultimate prizePicture the scene. A sunbed by a hotel swimming pool in Las Vegas in May 2014. A German holidaymaker is trying to relax, to clear his mind of everything involving work, but his repose keeps being disturbed by noises off.“There was a football match on television and a lot of people were watching it,” Jürgen Klopp says, taking up the story. “It was Real Madrid v Atlético in the Champions League final and everyone was shouting in Spanish. I was kind of annoyed by hearing the noise, because I had been trying to ignore the game. I didn’t want to watch it, I had no clue who had scored or who had won, because it was still painful to think of what had happened the year before.“What I learned from the game against Bayern Munich in 2013 is that when you are much better in the first part of the game you need to score. It helps a lot! I still haven’t watched the game back but the thing about finals is that someone has to suffer. All the people shouting in 2014 were Spanish, whereas the year before they had all been German, and that’s a good thing about football. That is absolutely OK but you must also learn that if something is really important to you, you have to be ready for suffering. That is how life is.”If it sounds as if the Liverpool manager would not have been much of a social butterfly on that holiday he would make considerably better company at the moment. Another final awaits, a chance at redemption against Real Madrid in Kiev, and despite finishing on the losing side in the two major European finals he has reached, the 50‑year-old is ready to go again.“Two weeks after a really nice season, we have a fantastic finish,” he says. “Coming in to work this morning I saw a car with two flags, Liverpool Champions League final Kiev, so it has started already. It’s really cool, we have the sort of smile on our face that you can pretty much only get from football, and one of the rules in sport is that the more you try the more likely you are to do it. But of course there are no guarantees. If guarantees are what you want then don’t qualify for a final. Stay at home or book a holiday.”Applying the same logic to Real Madrid – the more times you try the more likely you are to succeed – makes Liverpool clear underdogs. The Spanish side have featured in three of the last four finals, winning each time, and having already become the first club in the Champions League era to win back to back titles they are now going for three in a row.“To be honest, we like the role we are in. We like the situation and we are in a good moment. Real Madrid are a side of the highest quality going for three wins in three years, but we are Liverpool. That’s something not to forget.”With Mohamed Salah now touted as a potential Ballon d’Or winner after years of Cristiano Ronaldo‑Lionel Messi dominance, Saturday’s final is being trailed as the ultimate showdown between two of the leading inidual performers, though Klopp, unsurprisingly, does not see it quite like that. “We are a team in a team game,” he explains. “It is not about having the better inidual, usually it is about playing the better football, and for that to happen you need all the others as well.“Mo has played a fantastic season but even he would admit Cristiano has been performing at that level for years. His numbers are crazy, he has been 15 years at the top and scored about 47,000 goals, but I still don’t like making comparisons between players. At the time when Pelé was at his peak people didn’t go around comparing him to anyone else, they just thought he was the best and were glad to have him. Now we have Messi and Ronaldo. They have dominated football for such a long time even though there are so many other good players.Klopp is perfectly entitled to hope that teamwork, with the emphasis on work, holds the key to success, though it would be a mistake to categorise the present Real Madrid side as a collection of expensive iniduals without discipline.That idea belongs to the galáctico past, as does the suspicion that Ronaldo calls all the shots or that Real’s defending does not stand up to close scrutiny. Marcelo might be having sleepless nights over the difficulty of facing Salah but his side’s recent record in Europe speaks for itself. Time and again Real have gone up against the biggest names and come out on top, sometimes through inidual brilliance but just as often through collective determination.At their best they can summon an intensity few can live with, though the same could be said of Klopp’s Liverpool in their run to this year’s final. History beckons for one side or the other, but which side will it be? The one with winning experience from the last two finals or the one with the growing conviction that this is their stage and their year?“In the end it will be a test of whose desire is bigger,” Klopp says. “Real have almost exactly the same lineup from winning it before, and that’s really rare. They will want to do it again but we will try to stop them. In a final, thank God, everything is possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab108ce74d341b114cc732f94dc15ac62a44fabb/0_0_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6038f2d520f70a0aba7d4d4d9e5d8e43","title":"suso milan interview what i can achieve liverpool","story":"When Suso arrived in Italy to sign for Milan, in January 2015, there were no fans or journalists at Malpensa airport to greet him. He was a virtual stranger, a low-key signing for a club that were no longer able to reach the heights of previous decades.The Spaniard cost Milan £1m and arrived in Italy having spent the previous four and a half years at Liverpool, a spell that included 21 first-team appearances and one goal, as well as a loan spell at Almería.It was not the signing the Milan fans had hoped for but three years later the Spaniard, now 24, is someone they do not want to lose. Suso has developed into an outstanding player, one of the best in Serie A, and he has hopes of going to the World Cup.He is a different player – and a different person – to the one that arrived in Italy and the transformation has been such that even he sometimes needs to stop to take it all in. “So much has changed. When I arrived here it wasn’t easy: I didn’t play a lot and I had to go to Genoa on loan in order to play.“Milan was always my dream: when I was a kid I watched the great players who wore the shirt and now to be playing here is incredible. I am proud to be able to play for Milan and one day I’ll be able to tell my son: ‘Your father played for Milan.’”The Rossoneri have undergone huge changes in the past few years, being taken over by Li Yonghong in April last year and investing €230m in players last summer. Despite that, they struggled initially and it was only after Gennaro Gattuso took over from Vincenzo Montella as manager in November that the team climbed the table.They are now sixth in Serie A, 11 points behind fourth-placed Lazio. They lost the Coppa Italia final against Juventus 4-0 but at last there are signs that they are about to recapture their former glories.“It hasn’t been an easy season,” Suso says. “There were a lot of expectations on us but we did not start well. After Gattuso took over everything improved and we are working hard to qualify for Europe.“The club changed a lot in the last year and invested heavily in players. It’s never easy when there is such a big change. Compared with the start of the year we have improved a lot. And, importantly, there are a lot of young players at Milan at the moment, which is another reason we need time. But we are on the right path.”Suso and his team-mates have benefited from working with Gattuso, a fiery character who had mixed results as a manager before taking charge of Milan’s first team. The former Milan, Rangers and Italy midfielder had been in charge of Sion (as player-manager), Palermo, Crete and Pisa before returning to Milan to take over the primavera side, as Italian youth teams are known.Partly because of the kind of player he was, Gattuso has earned a reputation for being a great motivator but there have been questions about his tactical nous. Suso, however, paints a picture of a manager who is able to motivate, challenge and improve players.“He is very impressive,” he says. “He works 24 hours a day and only thinks about football. He likes the work, he likes all of it: after many years without playing in Europe we see the light with him. I’m certain he will be a great manager.“He has not been with us for a long time but he has already left a significant mark. Also, his charisma isn’t everything. He is good tactically, in attack and defence. He also knows how to talk to players, he always gets his point across and how a manager communicates with his players is fundamental.”Suso, born in Cádiz in south-west Spain, was scouted by Liverpool when on international duty for Spain Under-17s and left home for England as a 16-year-old. Although he was happy at Anfield, he admits that it was a big step to take at such a young age. “In a sense I became a man before I became a footballer. It was very hard with the lifestyle and language.“But to this day I remember everything.

In 1958, the free-scoring team of Just Fontaine and Raymond Kopa were more than holding their own against Brazil until Vavá clattered into the captain Robert Jonquet as the defender’s leg sailed in an arc across the Stockholm sky, France’s hopes and dreams, in those days before substitutes, departed with it. In 1986, Les Bleus faced West Germany with star man Michel Platini only half-fit the rest of the team failed to turn up until the last 10 minutes or so, by which time it was far too late. Even when the French finally won a semi, against Croatia in 1998, the popular defensive lynchpin Laurent Blanc got himself suspended for the final – unluckily and yet foolishly – by needlessly waving his arms near the face of Slaven Bilic, asking for the trouble that would soon be delivered to him in spades.But nothing comes close to 1982. Nothing will ever come close to 1982.The 1982 World Cup semi-final between France and West Germany at Sevilla’s Estadio Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán is remembered – not solely, but mainly – for the most outrageous and notorious foul in World Cup history. Forget Werner Liebrich on Ferenc Puskas, Mario David on Leonel Sánchez, Luís Pereira on Johan Neeskens, Benjamin Massing on Claudio Caniggia, Mauro Tassotti on Luis Enrique, or even Zinedine Zidane on Marco Materazzi. In the 57th minute of this match, French captain Platini noticed a sizable gap between the West German defenders Manni Kaltz and Uli Stielike, with Patrick Battiston racing into it, and stroked a pass of insouciant majesty into his team-mate’s path. Battiston, clear on goal with only the outrushing German keeper Toni Schumacher to beat, was first to a ball that was sitting up almost perfectly. At which point …… well, more of that anon. Perhaps the most unfortunate aspect of what was about to unfold – though Battiston and his dental surgeon will doubtless disagree – is that an infamous act of brutal cynicism to this day casts a long, dark shadow across a match which really should be principally remembered as one of the greatest, most dramatic and entertaining World Cup encounters of all time. A back-and-forth, six-goal, bona fide thriller between two teams packed with top-drawer talent performing at full pelt, it’s right up there with a select bunch of Coupe du Monde classics: arguably only the 1950 Maracanaço “final”, the 1954 Hungary-Uruguay semi, and the sun-kissed stunner served up by Italy and Brazil in Barcelona a mere three days before this fixture have ever bettered it. And yet. “We had played one of the two best games in the tournament,” recalled the hugely likeable West German winger Pierre Littbarski long after the dust had settled, “and it was very good publicity for German football.” Cue deep sigh. “Or it would have been.”The way most of it panned out, it certainly should have been. Not that a story for the ages was guaranteed to be told. Easy to forget now, but neither team had particularly impressed en route to the semis. France were 33-1 outsiders at the start of the competition, and for a while it looked like the bookies knew exactly what they were talking about. Michel Hidalgo’s side could hardly have begun their campaign in a more abject fashion, falling a goal behind after 27 seconds to an England side which had only just scraped through qualifying and were notoriously goal-shy. That match was comprehensively lost 3-1, and France only scraped through the first group stage after beating the minnows of Kuwait 4-1, then drawing 1-1 with Czechoslovakia – the latter result only secured thanks to a last-minute clearance off the line by Manuel Amoros. (Czechoslovakia’s goal, incidentally, was scored by Antonin Panenka, in what would be his last international match. Could it have been anything other than a penalty?) France then found themselves in the easiest of the four second-round groups, lumped in with Austria and Northern Ireland, but even then the meal they made of progress would have put Auguste Escoffier to shame. Despite thoroughly dominating the Austrians, they could only win by a single goal, and while they rolled over the Northern Irish 4-1 to make the last four, things may have panned out differently had Martin O’Neill’s early strike not been preposterously disallowed.West Germany, second favourites from the outset behind Brazil, had somehow managed to be even worse. The first group stage was a heady cocktail of debacle and disgrace: a hubristic defeat to Algeria after promising to dedicate “the seventh goal to our wives and the eighth to our dogs”, followed swiftly by the shameful and depressing “Anschluss” pact with Austria. German efforts in the second group stage didn’t particularly win over the crowds either: a goalless grind with England, then the clinical win over the hosts Spain. But there was world-class talent in their team – Littbarski, European footballer of the year Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Klaus Fischer, Paul Breitner – and someone surely had to deliver at some point. Ditto the French, who might have been no great shakes at the back, but had a midfield – Platini, Jean Tigana, Alain Giresse – wondrous enough to paper over any cracks, and were perhaps hitting their stride at exactly the right time. (Hidalgo had cited the response to the O’Neill warning shot against Northern Ireland as the best performance of his six-year reign as coach to date.)The form book didn’t promise a great deal, but never mind that, because the match would deliver pretty much everything. West Germany came flying out of the blocks. The tricksy Littbarski had been the star turn against Spain, scoring one and setting up another, and he continued where he left off, embarking on a dangerous slalom into the French area in the first couple of minutes. Then on the quarter hour, he battered a free kick off the crossbar with such force that the ball whistled straight back outside the box. Three minutes later he had scored the opening goal, firing low and hard through a thicket of legs after good work from Breitner and Fischer had caused bedlam in the French penalty area. It was Littbarski’s eighth goal in 13 appearances since debuting the previous autumn the 22-year-old was wasting no time in announcing his talent.France took less than 10 minutes to attain parity, Bernd Forster grappling with Dominique Rocheteau in the area, Platini slotting the penalty by sending Schumacher the wrong way with a confident sidefoot. At which point the game developed something of an edge, a harbinger of things to come. Kaltz and Bernard Genghini had already traded petty hacks, and Giresse was booked for kicking the ball away in a petulant manner after conceding a free kick. It was Schumacher, though, who really raised the temperature. On 35 minutes, he gathered a backpass and pointlessly rolled forward into Platini, making an impression on the French captain’s thigh. Four minutes later, mopping up a Tigana cross, Schumacher happily allowed his forward momentum to pin a hapless Didier Six to the floor, held him down a tad longer than was strictly necessary, just to make a point, then shoved the striker away as the pair finally disentangled. Platini entreated the keeper to simmer down, but Schumacher’s laser eyes were trained only on the entirely innocent Six, lost in a sociopathic reverie.The game was turning sour. The Germans went straight down the other end of the pitch, Kaltz romping along the right wing in acres. He was scythed down by the cheesewire leg of Genghini, who earned himself a booking. But there were too many artists in residence for the match to totally degenerate into thuggish nonsense. From the resulting free kick, Giresse and Tigana triangulated majestically in their own area to play their way out of trouble – the sort of audacious risk-taking escape likely to give Brendan Rodgers warm, tender, wobbly feelings in his dreams – allowing Six and Rocheteau to stream upfield with extreme prejudice. The pitch-length move ended with Platini, on the left-hand corner of the German box, whistling a forensic strike inches wide of the top-right corner. It would have been the goal of the tournament. Up to that point, anyway.All square at half time, after 45 minutes in which beauty had smothered brutality. But there was an abrupt shift in tone after the restart. A mere 34 seconds of the second half had elapsed when Forster highkicked Rocheteau in the back, an absurd kung-fu assault which elicited a deliciously Gallic “Oh la la!” from the commentary team on French television. Yellow card.On 50 minutes, Battiston came on for the injured Genghini. Within 60 seconds, he’d romped down the inside-left channel and sent a long-distance shot wide left of goal. He looked in the mood.As did France, who were gaining the upper hand. In quick succession, they had three golden chances to take the lead. First Kaltz played a ludicrous blind square pass through the centre circle, allowing Tigana to romp downfield with the ball. He slipped Platini free down the middle, only for the flag to go up for offside. Tigana and Platini exchanged dagger glances, throwing arms, rolling eyes and mouthing insults in the stereotypical expressive style. Then Rocheteau had a goal harshly disallowed having won a fairly innocuous aerial battle with Forster. Finally Platini, carving out a chance for himself with a skitter down the left, shot high from the edge of the area, the ball sailing deep into the crowd.Platini’s shot was the catalyst for the moment which would come to define and overshadow this match, the reputation of the West German team throughout the 1980s, and the entire careers of two of European football’s top talents. The French fans behind Schumacher’s goal took an age to return the ball. When it was finally dispatched back on to the field of play, the German keeper – barely calmer since the incident with Six in the first half, his lid still clattering away under pressure from internal steam – shaped to throw the ball with force back into the Gallic throng, but aborted mid-fling and placed it down for a goal kick instead. Almost exactly one minute later, give or take a second, Platini’s gorgeous pass was bouncing towards his area with Battiston sure to meet it first. The Frenchman guided a first-time shot past the outrushing Schumacher and inches wide of the right-hand post. Most eyes, including the referee and the lens of the main TV camera, followed the ball as it made its way into touch. One member of the French commentary team, however, had kept his gaze on Battiston.Battiston had made contact with the ball just inside the D. At this point, Schumacher was still a good four yards inside his area, scampering off his line in a futile chase. The keeper had plenty of time to change direction, or stop dead in his tracks, but instead chose to plough on, leaping into Battiston and turning his body in mid air. His hip clattered into Battiston’s face, knocking the French midfielder out instantly and sending him crashing to the turf. As Battiston lay motionless, surrounded by frantic team-mates, Schumacher calmly placed the ball on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box and hung around nonchalantly, chewing gum, waiting to take the goal kick.He would have a four-minute wait. Battiston, minus three teeth, was loaded on to a stretcher and carried off the field, where he would be given oxygen before being taken to hospital. Platini held his fallen comrade’s limp hand as he was carted off. It should have been a penalty to France, and a red card for Schumacher, but there would be no punishment. The keeper restarted the game with the goal kick.Much opprobrium was heaped on to Dutch referee Charles Corver for his lack of action, though our man David Lacey was sympathetic to the official: “To be fair, the quality of Platini’s pass to Battiston was such that Corver was as much taken by surprise as the defence and could not have had a clear view of the incident. In fact, the severity of Schumacher’s assault only became fully apparent when seen from behind the French goal.”Still, it was one of the great outrages in World Cup history – “The nearest linesman should not have missed it,” was Lacey’s caveat – and what’s worse, there would be no karmic payback. To the contrary.France dominated the remainder of the second half, but while Schumacher might have been the villain of the piece, he was no charlatan. He smothered Six’s shot, then denied Rocheteau, both from close range. Young Amoros, who had only won his first cap five months earlier, cut inside from the left and rattled the bar in injury time (“Ay ay ay ay ay!”) and while there was still time for Breitner and Fischer to force an heroic double save from Jean-Luc Ettori, there was no doubt who had been the better side as the referee blew for full-time. Which was something France set about proving at the start of extra time: within nine minutes they were 3-1 up, Marius Trésor spinning and roofing a spectacular volley, Giresse battering another in off the left-hand post from the edge of the area. France were surely through to their first World Cup final.The French started pinging the ball around in a most aesthetically pleasing manner, the majority of the stadium responding, appropriately, with a series of olé!s. Justice is one thing hubris quite another. Giresse was dispossessed with a crunching tackle, West Germany flooded upfield, Littbarski made room for himself down the left, and sent a cross to the near post which was flicked home adroitly by the substitute Rummenigge who, half-fit, had only come on to the pitch five minutes previously with the game slipping away from the Germans. Suddenly, the momentum had shifted. For West Germany, it was back on.In the remaining two minutes before the turnaround, Breitner and Littbarski took turns to fire low, dangerous crosses through the French six-yard box from the right. The tide had turned, and within three minutes of the start of the second period of extra time, West Germany equalised with one of the most spectacular and exquisite finishes in World Cup history. The astonishing Littbarski made good down the left and hoicked a cross to the far post for Horst Hrubesch, who headed back into the centre. Fischer, his back to goal, stuck out his right peg and guided a glorious overhead kick into the top right. Gymnastic brilliance allied to deadly precision, an outstanding effort in the circumstances.West Germany spent the remainder of the match coming at France, but couldn’t make the breakthrough. France meanwhile were spent the nearest they came to scoring was into their own net, Tresor breaking up a German attack by flicking a ball towards the bottom-left corner of the French goal, a panicked backpass which was thankfully close enough to Ettori for the keeper to smother. A dramatic classic simply couldn’t end in high farce.The resulting penalty shoot-out – the first in any World Cup – was only ever going to end one way: with Schumacher the hero. The German keeper made two fine saves, from Six and Bossis, to Ettori’s one from Stielike. West Germany were through to the final, while France, and viewers from the 107 other Fifa nations who had entered the 1982 World Cup, were heartbroken. No happy ending.A sporting catastrophe for the French, although in some ways also for the Germans, who had more than played their part in a stone-cold classic, launched one of the greatest comebacks in World Cup history with two stunning goals in the most pressurised of situations, and (whisper it) were probably the better team, both on the night and overall. Yet none of that would be remembered, Schumacher having done what Schumacher did. Sympathy for West Germany was, and still is, in short supply. Understandably so, though it takes a hard heart not to feel sorry for the wholly innocent Littbarski, whose man-of-the-match performance is nowadays all but forgotten, blotted from the memory by his goalkeeper’s crass hoodlummery.Poor Battiston was discharged from hospital the day after, having broken two of his teeth. Schumacher – “hopefully not being too cruel,” wished this newspaper’s World Cup diarist – immediately offered to pay for both of them to be capped. Four years later, the two teams, and the two players, met again at the same stage in Guadalajara. With France a goal down and battling to salvage a draw, Battiston hit a late shot straight at Schumacher. The fairytale narrative would have seen the keeper fumble the ball into his own net, France going on to reach the final. But Schumacher saved well, his effigy, hung by the French support behind his goal, clearly bereft of voodoo properties. The Germans then scampered upfield, where Rudi Völler sealed the deal. West Germany 2-0 France, in more ways than one.No redemption for the French, then, who had to make do with the knowledge that the Germans went on to lose both the 1982 and 1986 finals. But schadenfreude only soothes the soul so much, when your own hopes and dreams have been dashed so cruelly. So yes, the World Cup semi-finals have not particularly kind to France. But they’ve been downright cruel to poor old Patrick Battiston.

Perish the thought. But when it comes to self-checkout tills anyone can make a ‘mistake’A couple of Tuesdays ago, after a difficult day at work, a thing that happens to me more often than I’d usually care to admit happened once again. At a supermarket self-checkout machine a frozen pizza I tried to swipe wouldn’t register, leaving me irked and full of spite. As a kind of reproach, I prepared to bag the item in any case, but a pang of weary guilt set in. Two choices sprung to mind. Carry on as though nothing untoward had happened, and knowingly steal. Or hail the cashier, who at the time was busy at another till, to fix the machine and right the wrong.I picked the second option, eventually. Though, to be honest, on another day I might have swayed the other way. Plenty of us do. Need proof? Look online, perhaps at a Reddit thread, and you’ll find anecdotes of petty self-checkout theft delivered with something like a stick-it-to-the-man pride. Expensive grapes are scanned as inexpensive carrots. Prime steaks are swiped as potatoes. The barcodes of pricey objects – wine, beer, spirits, cosmetics – are deliberately obscured by stickers removed from significantly cheaper on-sale items. Some scams have names – “the banana trick” (steaks as potatoes), “the switcheroo” (cheap barcodes for pricey ones), “sweethearting” (when a checkout supervisor only pretends to scan an object before handing it to a loved one, gratis) – though there are so many techniques not all of them do.For an idea of how close to home the issue really is, try mentioning it to your friends, like I did. Several of mine confessed to pilfering something from a self-checkout machine at some point, though nearly all of those added a caveat: only small stuff. One recently got away with an umbrella. “Must have forgotten to swipe it through,” she said. Another regularly declares chocolate croissants as bread rolls. And more than a few said they bagged items that failed to scan, half-shifting the blame on to a faulty machine. “A couple of times I tried exotic fruits as potatoes,” a friend wrote in a text one morning. “But a checkout lady once caught me with mangoes, very embarrassing, and I didn’t do it much after that.” He ended the message with an Emoji of a face beneath a halo. “Now I’m a saint, although sometimes I’ll take a five-pence bag if I’ve already paid and realise I need extra.” In a WhatsApp message, one friend confessed to regularly placing a single banana on the scales while nabbing an entire bunch, though that wasn’t all. Sometimes he fills the bagging area “so there’s no room left for more shopping and I’m forced to put items on the floor,” which circumvents the “unexpected item” message we all dread. “I really like the game,” he said. “It’s about being crafty, sneaky – and outwitting them.”When they turned up last decade, self-checkout machines were supposed to represent a new dawn in minimum-fuss shopping, though they’d been around since 1984. The till’s inventor, David R Humble, had introduced the technology at an LA trade convention, describing it at the time as “a revolutionary product” that “will sweep all of retail”. (To hammer home the point, he had an 11-year-old provide a demonstration. “Many marvelled,” the Los Angeles Times reported.) When they reached stores, the machines offered customers unexpected levels of autonomy, and the opportunity to avoid long queues at traditional checkout tills. And though the machines were outwardly advertised as being strictly beneficial for the customer, they offered retailers perks, too, notably the freedom to slash labour costs. The more self-checkout machines a supermarket had, the fewer cashiers it required. There were savings to be made.But any financial gains now appear to be marginal, at least in part due to unforeseen spikes in self-scanning theft. In a recent study a team at Voucher Codes Pro, a sales coupon website, quizzed 2,532 shoppers about their supermarket habits and found that close to a quarter had committed theft at a self-checkout machine at least once. (A figure from the same report suggested that the total cost of items stolen through self-checkout machines in 2017 came in at more than £3bn, up from £1.6bn in 2014, though the numbers are speculative.) Some steal by accident, the study found, perhaps on account of a scanning error – honest mistakes. But many perpetrators know exactly what they’re doing.In 2016, criminologists at the University of Leicester published a paper that reported on the impact of recent developments in mobile-scanning technology. The study was led by Adrian Beck, an emeritus professor of criminology, who has spent more than 25 years researching losses in the retail industry. In the report, he’d suggested that retailers who rely on self-scanning technology inadvertently create environments that encourage theft. In the self-checkout aisle, for example, human interaction is often pared back to a minimum, which reduces the perception of risk on the part of a potential perpetrator. “It’s about the degree of opportunity it provides people who wouldn’t normally do something deviant,” explains Beck. “It presents them with opportunities they wouldn’t normally have.”As Beck sees it, the customer who reaches the self-checkout machine and knowingly bags a frozen pizza after it fails to register isn’t a typical thief. “This guy didn’t get out of bed that morning and say, ‘I can’t wait to be a shoplifter today,’” Beck told me. “And he didn’t walk down an aisle and put something in his pocket.” In most cases, perpetrators are otherwise honest. They tend not to employ traditional shoplifting techniques, and are unlikely to steal in circumstances in which an opportunity is not presented to them. Psychologists call this Opportunity Theory – when an offender consciously decides to take advantage of an opportunity for crime that has appeared in his normal routine. But there is other psychology at play, too. Often, perpetrators will construct what they perceive as legitimate excuses for theft. Some feel justified in taking items when the checkout machine they’re using doesn’t operate smoothly (it’s the machine’s fault). Others consider the items they steal as a kind of payment for work they’re completing on the supermarket’s behalf.Still more reach the self-checkout machine, look around, and see nothing but the inhuman trappings of a faceless corporation. Few would steal from an inidual grocer. But from a multinational conglomerate? What difference does it make? “There’s a mountain of good socio-cognitive criminological research that explains this under the heading of Neutralisation Theory,” says Shadd Maruna, a criminology professor at the University of Manchester. I’d asked him to take me through the psychology of self-checkout theft, to help me get to grips with the “why”. “Iniduals can neutralise guilt they might otherwise feel when stealing by telling themselves that there are no victims of the crime, no human being is actually being hurt by this, only some mega-corporation that can surely afford the loss of a few quid. In fact, the corporation has saved so much money by laying off all its cashiers that it is almost morally necessary to steal from them.”Maruna offered a personal example to illustrate the point. “Twice in the past month I have handed back change to a cashier when I was given too much,” he said. “I did this because I was worried that the inidual, working for minimum wage, would have the money taken out of their own pocket if the cash till was short at the end of the workday. Had the same thing happened and a machine gave me the wrong change, there’s no question I would have pocketed it.” He finished with a flourish: “Screw them!”When I asked several supermarkets to comment on this story, they all declined. Later, when I visited a few of my local stores and asked cashiers about their experiences, most seemed initially open to revealing all before loyalty (or self-preservation) led them to pass the request up the chain to their shift managers, who each delivered a variant of the same message: “Ask head office.” Supermarkets, it seems, would prefer not to spill the beans.Which isn’t unwise. The subject is fraught with uncertainty. Often it is difficult for retailers to discern between malicious actions and honest mistakes – was the customer absent-minded or consciously fraudulent? – and proving intent can be perilous. Charge an honest shopper with theft and lose their business. Let a perpetrator off the hook and suffer a reduction in profit. Beck describes the scenario as “a legal and customer relations minefield”.Still, supermarkets are persevering with self-checkouts. According to a BBC report, by 2021 there will be 468,000 around the world, up from some 240,000 in 2016. And retailers aren’t stopping there. Amazon is pursuing plans to create stores in which checkouts are eradicated entirely. Computer vision and artificial intelligence will align to keep track of the items in a shopper’s basket, allow them to walk in and out of the store without any human interaction, and later email them a receipt and charge their account. Chinese retailers aren’t far behind.Soon, supermarkets might be entirely human-free – what they refer to in the industry as “frictionless”.Where will that leave us? Customer convenience will rise. The conflicts we sometimes face on a shopping run will reduce to faded memories, and long till queues will be vanquished. So, too, will staff. Cashiers will be erted to different sections of our stores, ostensibly to better help customers mid-shop, until they will disappear altogether, along with human interaction, the one thing that seems to keep us on the straight and narrow.

They carry with them a sense of ease, allowing them to be eaten at our pace rather than theirs. So you can pounce on them the moment they are made (that spirit of urgency to tuck in), but they are also happy to sit for a little while without losing anything in terms of flavour or, perhaps more essentially, texture.I made two salads this week that fitted neatly around the sort of day we were having, where people came to the table at different times. Early birds got warm chicken fresh from the oven, tossed with a bright and citrussy dressing and fresh herbs the late arrivals got chicken that had time to rest with the shredded ginger, finely chopped chillies, lime and mint. The second salad was more calming: a collection of brassicas with a balm of goat’s curd and shallots, spiked with sweet-sour onions.The chicken salad was eaten outdoors, to be followed by a platter of piled-up vanilla ice cream with halved passion fruit tucked among it – little cups of apricot-coloured juice and black seeds to tip over the vanilla ice. There were sweet biscuits on the table, too, to crush at will and scatter over in a shower of sweet crumbs. A sort of last-minute assembly that can be made as someone decides to come to the table.The roasting juices form part of the dressing, but you could easily use cold chicken left from a Sunday roast, adding a little more dressing as necessary. If you are not eating this immediately, I would be tempted to add the coriander at the last minute.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Put the thighs into a roasting tin, rub them generously with olive oil, season with salt and pepper and roast for 45 minutes or until the skin is crisp and the thighs’ juices run clear when pierced with a skewer.Peel the ginger and slice into matchsticks. Halve the chillies lengthways, de-seed if you wish, then slice finely. Peel and finely slice the garlic.Take the chicken from the oven, remove from the tin, then leave to rest for 10 minutes before tearing the flesh from the bones in large pieces and dropping them into a mixing bowl. Place the cooking juices in the tin over a moderate heat, add the ginger and garlic and let them colour to a warm, nutty brown. Add the sliced chilli for the last minute or so, then remove all from the heat.Stir the sesame oil into the ginger and chilli dressing, the Thai fish sauce and the rice wine vinegar. Squeeze the limes, stir the juice into the dressing then check the seasoning.In a dry, shallow pan, toast the sesame seeds until golden then add them to the dressing. Roughly tear the mint and coriander leaves and mix them with the chicken, then carefully fold together the chicken and the ginger dressing.If romanesco evades you, use the thin-stalked tenderstem or purple sprouting rather than double up on either of the others. The salad is best with an assortment of textures. As you lightly cook them, try not to overcrowd the pan.For the pickle:white wine vinegar coriander seeds 1 tspblack peppercorns 1 tsplemon juice of halfsalt 1 tspcaster sugar 1 tspred onion 1, medium romanesco 400gcauliflower 400gbroccoli 400golive oil 3 tbspFor the goat’s curd:banana shallot 1tarragon 30g of bushy stemsgoat’s curd 250gPour the vinegar into a pan and place over a moderate heat, then stir in the coriander seeds, peppercorns, lemon juice, salt and sugar. Peel the onion, then slice in half from root to tip. Separate the layers, then put them in a jar. As soon as the vinegar has come to the boil and the salt and sugar have dissolved, pour over the onion and tighten the lid. Set aside for 4 hours, turning the jar upside down from time to time.Bring a pan of water to the boil and salt it. Cut the brassicas into florets, discarding any thick stalks as you go. Cook the florets in the water for 3 or 4 minutes until they are just tender. Drain and refresh in a large bowl of iced water.Transfer the onions and their pickling liquor into a large serving bowl, then stir in the olive oil. Drain the brassicas, then add them to the bowl. Leave to settle for an hour.Peel the shallot, cut it in half from root to tip, then dice very finely and transfer to a small mixing bowl.

For those too twitchy to sit still and focus on breathing, the ubiquitous mindfulness apps, self-help sheets and courses in schools and workplaces are little more than totems of uselessness. But you wouldn’t have this problem if you lived in France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland or Portugal, because you’d be doing sophrology instead. It’s the dynamic mindfulness alternative, popular on the continent. The French rugby team and media-magnate-turned-wellbeing-guru Arianna Huffington swear by this westernised amalgamation of yoga, Tibetan Buddhism, Japanese Zen, hypnosis, psychology and neurology. And it’s becoming increasingly accessible in the UK, through group (or more costly one-to-one) sessions, and now via a new book with accompanying online audio guides.Sophrology isn’t dynamic enough to warrant a shower afterwards, but even closing your eyes to start a session comes with an action that zaps you into relaxation mode and zooms your attention into the body. At my first appointment with the Swiss-British sophrologist and author of The Life-Changing Power of Sophrology, Dominique Antiglio, she tells me to hold a thumb at arm’s length in front of my face, inhale and look at it as I slowly draw it to between my eyebrows, at which point my eyes involuntarily close as I audibly exhale, as though to blow my mental cobwebs away. “It’s quite funny,” she warned me before she demonstrated it, her eyes crossing as they tracked her thumb, but it’s also a surprisingly powerful start to the 15-minute guided practice.Sophrology was devised by Alfonso Caycedo, a Colombian doctor working in Spain in the early 1960s, almost two decades before the American professor of medicine and godfather of mindfulness, Jon Kabat-Zinn, reimagined Buddhist meditation for modern life in the late 1970s. Caycedo drew together his research in India and Japan as well as the work of western thinkers, including the Swiss existential psychologist Ludwig Binswanger.All you need to do sophrologly is an upright chair. I begin seated for a “body scan” as Antiglio invites me to relax different zones in my body, which the method ides into five “systems”. But you can stand if you prefer. “Some people don’t want to sit because they’re so agitated,” Antiglio tells me afterwards. I’m a veteran of yoga and mindfulness body scans. I often find them boring and, occasionally, actively unrelaxing, but sitting rather than reclining, and visualising the five systems, makes it sink in more somehow. That said, by the end of a week of home practice, I have to resist the urge to skip the body scan to get to the good stuff. The scan is still effective, though, and probably essential.There are 12 levels in sophrology – and the first is about releasing tension, then pausing to “listen” for subtle sensations or changes in the body. Still seated, I put my fingertips at the centre of each system in turn, starting with the forehead, while I inhale, tense the area, and then relax with a blowy exhalation. I notice how difficult it is to hold the tension in one zone without it affecting other body parts. Because I’m prone to shoulder and neck strain, I’m also given a standing exercise in which I pump my shoulders up and down with clenched fists like an angry cartoon character, while holding my breath and picturing a source of agitation. Afterwards, warmth spreads across my shoulders and I feel a quiet, kinetic buzz. It’s engaging to have something physical to react to, rather than just being still – as in traditional meditation.It’s not that sophrology is better than mindfulness, but while the stillness of meditation takes getting used to, and can create space for fretful thoughts about whether you’re in the zone or not, there’s an easily won satisfaction in being active and occupied. And there’s the promise of mastering positive thinking techniques, walking meditations (with open eyes), and doing some navel gazing in the name of making life feel meaningful.Everyone has different needs, she says. “Some people want to take home a five-minute quick fix, others want more meditation because they’re used to it, and there is a wide variety of exercises for different purposes.” Rushing towards level 12 as an end goal isn’t the way to view it. The first level alone, says Antiglio, can make a “phenomenal transformation”. Level two switches focus from the body to the mind, with visualisation exercises that are particularly useful if you’re preparing for an event or exams. Three brings awareness of the body and the mind together, while the fourth level is about identifying your personal values.Antiglio hadn’t heard of sophrology until she was an unhappy 15-year-old with fatigue. Her doctor ran tests and tried her on some drugs for low blood pressure, but while her symptoms persisted, he could find nothing else physically wrong. He suggested she try sophrology. Looking back, she doesn’t think she was depressed, but she didn’t feel she fitted in at school and was putting too much pressure on herself. “Emotionally,” she says, “I hadn’t been given the tools to manage my feelings as a younger child and when you’re a teenager you’re faced with new challenges of identity, and I think sophrology brought me the tools to know myself and trust myself and find my own way of dealing with things.” Now 41. with a young child, she says she never gets bored of the method because life is always shifting.Antiglio’s first career was in osteopathy, most commonly used to treat back pain through massage, but she suspected that some of her clients would benefit more from learning sophrology. “When I was treating in osteopathy,” she says, “I had great results and people were feeling better, but for the chronic cases, or people who had a more complicated pattern in their body, there was always something else going on in their life and sometimes I felt that while osteopathy would support them, they needed to change their awareness so they could really overcome their issue and move forwards.”These days, as well as running private and group sophrology sessions and corporate assignments, Antiglio regularly visits stressed-out staff at a private school in the northwest, and has worked with pupils at Richmond upon Thames college in London. The 16 to 18-year-olds were initially self-conscious, but their headteacher reported they soon felt more relaxed, energetic and confident after their sessions. In France, the method is used to help with birth preparation and she sees pregnant women in the UK, along with teenagers before exams and people with burn-out, fibromyalgia and chronic pain.After my first week of sophrology, there’s no doubt I feel calmer, perkier, less in my own head and less likely to grope for the wine bottle after sundown, so I feel inclined to carry on and see where it takes me.Sophrology is based on yoga, Tibetan Buddhism, Japanese Zen Buddhism, hypnosis, psychology and neurology. Mindfulness is based on Buddhism.Sophrology uses “dynamic relaxation”, with seated and standing tension-releasing exercises such as pumping the shoulders, head rotations or windmilling bent arms, along with walking meditations. Mindfulness meditation usually involves sitting still and focusing on your breathing, although there are eyes-open exercises, including walking meditations and, to acclimatise newcomers, “the raisin meditation” for which you spend five minutes studying a raisin with all your senses, eventually eating it.Sophrology has 12 levels, starting with simple mind-and-body “awareness”, building to self-discovery exercises. Mindfulness has no graded levels – the self-knowledge comes progressively from meditating.Sophrology includes positive visualisations and is often used for exam or birth preparation and phobias. Mindfulness doesn’t go in for this sort of thing, although the many mindfulness-based offshoots, such as Headspace, do.The Life-Changing Power of Sophrology: Breathe and Connect with the Calm and Happy You by Dominique Antiglio is published by Yellow Kite at £14.99"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbca4eb44d53daa51275704820205a652fb74f38/0_1977_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e3f203d945756841760f8cbf23c7f45","title":"the dilapidated victorian house thats now indestructible","story":"Rebuilt and filled with reclaimed pieces, this family home in north-west London has been given a new lease of lifeFlora Bathurst is surveying her back garden with dismay: scattered on the lawn are a bright red robot, a Nerf gun, a toy trolley and a large plastic cash register. “I have tried to do my best to keep it under control,” she says. “But there is an inevitability to small people’s stuff.” Bathurst has lived with her husband and two young children in this terraced house in north-west London for just two and a half years, and already she feels the place is “silting up”.To the outsider, Bathurst’s home is an exquisite assemblage of design classics set against a considered selection of reclaimed materials, but at heart – both literally and figuratively – it’s a hard-working family home. Bathurst, who is a director of photography (and Elle Decoration alumnus), worked with the architect Anthi Grapsa to conquer and corral the toys. The solution is twofold: a corridor of cupboards and a handsome utility room. “I had to fight my husband, Andrew, for the utility room,” says Bathurst. “But knowing how much time I would end up in there doing washing. I wanted a proper space for that.”The four-bedroom, mid-Victorian property was in a dilapidated state when Bathurst received the keys. “It was like a dog that had been really badly beaten,” she recalls, “but I wasn’t going to take on anything that couldn’t be completely done over.” At one point, Bathurst was standing in the living room looking at the roof. “Eventually, the roof, the back and the side all had to come off. We were truly left with a shell.” Undaunted, she discovered the power of rolled steel joists and sliding pocket doors and, after 10 months’ planning and a 10-month build, a new floorplan emerged.The typical Victorian structure was reconfigured. Now, on entering the front door, a 2m-wide sliding door takes you into the living space and adjoining office. Along the right-hand side of the living room, the once gloomy corridor and staircase have been boxed in, creating a vast run of built-in storage that conceals “untold amounts of crap”. There’s also a downstairs loo, the walls covered in Fornasetti wallpaper (a perk from her Elle Deco days).Beyond the office space, another sliding door to the left leads to a beautiful utility room clad in reclaimed Welsh slate. Straight ahead is the open-plan kitchen and dining room, which can be shut off from the rest of the house by another pocket door. (“Useful if you’re having a late one with friends.”) On the first floor are three bedrooms, while the Farrow \u0026amp Ball Inchyra blue master bedroom – with an adjoining iroko and marble ensuite bathroom – was built into the eaves.Having reinvented the floorplan and rebuilt the framework of the house, Bathurst drew on the creativity of the wider Bathurst family for the interiors. (Her late mother was an interior designer, her elder sister, Bella, is an author, photographer and furniture maker, and her middle sister, Lucy, creates bespoke textiles.) Her own professional experience also guided the process. As photography director for Elle Deco, she spent her days editing images of exquisite homes. “What looked like me working hard was actually me doing research for my own house,” she says, wryly. “I was endlessly inspired by those houses and able to pinpoint what I liked and what I didn’t like.”Pinterest became a crucial resource for Bathurst, who accumulated hundreds of images, organising them by room. “You’ll notice that you keep referring back to the same one or two images – that becomes your edit,” she says. “Eventually, you’ll find something that is very applicable to yourself.”For Bathurst, specific material combinations began to emerge, such as slate with brass, and iroko with concrete. All along, the brief was to be “bullet proof”. The reclaimed pitch-pine floorboards that run throughout the ground floor have been treated with soap and lye, and coated in an impenetrable layer of matt varnish. Likewise, the reclaimed iroko tops in the kitchen and utility room are indestructible. The laminated birch-ply cupboards in the kitchen are wipe-downable, as is the black walnut dining table, which was made by her sister Bella, “and given about 20 coats of varnish”.The cushion covers that top the benches in the dining area were designed by Flora and her sister Lucy. The pattern represents the contours of the hills in Scotland where the sisters grew up. Since “small people don’t understand the concept of napkins until they are at least past six”, the cushion covers are removable and washable.Layered against this backdrop is Bathurst’s collection of black and white photography, which she has built up over the years. Above the fireplace is an image from Joseph Szabo’s Teenage series – a housewarming present to herself. “I have a Terry O’Neill of Pete and Dud that I’m very fond of, a Todd Hido, a Matt Black… And my mum was very generous and gave me a couple of pictures from the Atlas gallery. She had a pretty good idea about that sort of thing.”As for furniture, the only new items in the house are the beds everything else has been “resurrected”. The circular vintage Saarinen table was a gift from her sisters, while the matching Tulip chair came from her mother. The sheepskin rug in the living room was an eBay find, and both of the sofas are heirlooms that have been reupholstered.“I’m not a fan of the throwaway culture,” says Bathurst. “And I don’t mind if things are a bit baggy around the edges. You buy something, you wear the shit out of it, you patch it up, and wear the shit out of it again.”It’s a no-nonsense maxim that makes living with a combination of design classics and small people possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb5695fcbfec4b207bfa643336306115011f956a/0_678_2690_1615/master/2690.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6fea1f80fb37e69344620bdf0e5844c4","title":"les hinton memoir rupert murdoch very fond of him","story":"Hinton was Rupert Murdoch’s right-hand man at the height of the phone-hacking scandal. He resigned over it and feels he was made a scapegoat, but remains an admirer of the tycoonLes Hinton used to insist he would never write a memoir. The idea of adding his own title to volumes already devoted to his former boss, Rupert Murdoch, filled him with, if not foreboding exactly, then a certain feeling of futility. “I knew a lot of any such book would have to be about Rupert,” says the man who was for a long time known as Murdoch’s henchman. “But if you’re not joining the chorus of disapproval, how do you write about him in a way that doesn’t sound sycophantic? Who wants to sound like they’re the victim of a personality cult?” He runs a hand over his beard. “He deserves a lot of the criticism, by the way. There are no men who have achieved the kind of success he has who have not bruised a lot of people. He earned a lot of his enemies. But he’s also misunderstood. If I was going to write about him, I wanted to try and do it straight down the middle and for a long time I couldn’t really see how to do that.”But perhaps there was another way. What if the Murdoch years – he worked for the Australian-born tycoon for the vast majority of his 50-year career – were only a part of his book? What if Hinton began instead by describing his childhood in postwar Bootle, on Merseyside? This idea began to take hold even before his traumatic departure as chief executive of Dow Jones, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, in July 2011, shortly after the full scale of the phone-hacking scandal had been revealed to the world (the hacking had taken place in the years when he was executive chairman of News International, the publisher of Murdoch’s British newspapers, now called News UK). “I was going to the Labour party conference in Blackpool,” he says. “I was in a chauffeur-driven car, as I always was in those days, and we went past this kid looking out of the window of a bus. A working-class kid. I felt this weird connection: that’s me, I thought.”In the end, then, he did settle down to write a book: The Bootle Boy, in which Rupert Murdoch does not appear at all until page 89, when he happens to enter the room that houses the only television at the News, the Adelaide tabloid where Hinton began work as a copy boy at the age of 15. On this occasion, the two do not speak. Hinton is so scared that he hides behind a sofa until Murdoch leaves. Some days later, in the reporters’ room, there comes another encounter: Murdoch, “plump-cheeked” and smoking a cigarette, asks Hinton to get him a ham sandwich. It would, he writes, be another 15 years before the two men discussed anything more elevated than this.The Bootle bits of Hinton’s book are undeniably charming, if a touch Hovis ad: he conjures up with some vividness the cobbles and the antimacassars, the outside lavatory at his grandmother’s house where torn squares of the Daily Mirror did for loo roll (was this, he speculates, how newsprint first entered his blood?). So, too, are the chapters devoted to the years when his family, before his parents finally emigrated to Australia, travelled the world, following his father, an army chef, from posting to posting: Egypt, Eritrea, Libya, Germany. But of course it’s Murdoch you’re waiting for. Hinton worked on the Sun when Murdoch first bought it he had a ringside seat for its ruthless reinvention under its pugnacious editor, Larry Lamb, and for much else besides, up to and including the earliest stages of the phone-hacking scandal. Interesting as it is that he was named for the actor Leslie Howard, and that some of his relatives had a pathological dislike of Catholics, it is on his career and the powerful men for whom he worked that you really want to read him.Is Murdoch content? Would he describe him as happy? “Well, contentment is not the same as happiness. He has had a lot of happiness in his life. But his best friend is the business. A lot of the people he spends time with work for him. He doesn’t have a lot of childhood friends. The business is more important than anything except for his immediate family.” Does he still see him? “I do, but not often. I usually go along to his Christmas party.”Even at the height of the hacking scandal, in the days after Murdoch closed the News of the World, a decision Hinton regards as the result of a collective “nervous breakdown” and as having been wholly wrong, he always thought the newspapers would survive. “It never occurred to me that they wouldn’t. Why should it have been otherwise?” But this isn’t to say that when Murdoch told the parliamentary committee before which he appeared in July 2011 to answer questions about phone hacking that this was “the most humbling day of my life”, his words, as they might have appeared to some, were simply expedient, just another sly business move. In his book, he describes going to see Murdoch at his London flat shortly after the  broke the news that the phone of the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler had been hacked. “He was slumped forward in a chair,” he writes. “His head was drooped and still… His heavy glasses had slipped down his nose his jaw was slack and his mouth slightly open. The familiar intensity in his eyes had given way to an empty gaze. ‘This is the worst day of my life,’ he said.”As a copy boy, one of his jobs was to fold edited pages into a metal cylinder, which he would then push into a thick pipe – the tube (whoosh) that delivered the copy to the men who would turn it into hot type. Hardworking and smart, he soon landed a cadetship, and four years after that, in 1965, he left for London with 50 quid in his pocket, plus his passage back home should things go badly wrong. But they didn’t, of course. He joined the Sun, then in its slightly whimsical pre-Murdoch incarnation, a paper that was pretty much annihilated every morning by the Daily Mirror, and returned to it after accompanying his first wife, Mary, home to Australia (they have five children), after Murdoch had bought it, when long, boozy lunches were suddenly a thing of the past, and its sales began to soar.He reported from Northern Ireland and from Cyprus during Turkey’s invasion and then – a long-held dream finally coming true – he managed to get a berth in New York where, among other things, he was the first reporter to arrive at the Chelsea hotel in 1978 after the body of Nancy Spungen, the girlfriend of Sex Pistol Sid Vicious, was found in the bathroom of Room 100 (as he writes in his book, this did not please his rival Paul Dacre, the future editor of the Daily Mail, who swore at him in typically creative fashion).His storytelling days, however, were now numbered. A series of editing jobs followed – eventually, he was appointed editor of a Murdoch-owned supermarket tabloid magazine, Star – until, somewhat to his surprise, Murdoch appointed him to run first his ill-fated magazine empire, and then Fox (he moved to LA, where his neighbour was OJ Simpson). Why was he chosen? In his book, he never quite makes this clear. He doesn’t particularly seem like a brown nose to me. So what was it? “Ha. Well, I’m not innocent of that,” he says. “I don’t know. Rupert has a history of giving journalists jobs on the business side. They’re quicker than MBA types and he has more empathy with them.” But if he wanted so badly to be a writer, why didn’t he simply say no? “I resisted editing the Star, but Rupert put his arm round me and thanked me and I just quaked. When I became executive vice-president of the magazines, I was happy about it, but I would have done anything to get out of staying at the Star.” Thanks to these promotions, his contact with Murdoch was now more frequent and more frequently alarming. For years, he kept a toy GI’s helmet in his office, which he would put on when he knew Murdoch was calling in a bad mood.Hinton loved the 12 years he spent at Wapping. His last job, which he took up in 2007, would be as chief executive of Dow Jones, after it, too, was bought by Murdoch. But in its beginning was its end, for it was while he was in charge that the News of the World’s royal reporter, Clive Goodman, and his co-conspirator, Glenn Mulcaire, were illegally intercepting phone messages from Clarence House, crimes for which, in 2007, they received prison sentences. In 2011, when the new revelations of phone hacking broke, Hinton offered his resignation and it was accepted. After this, there followed an extremely difficult period. In May 2012, the Commons culture select committee accused Hinton of misleading it during its inquiries into the phone-hacking scandal. It wasn’t until September 2016 that parliament’s committee of privileges published its own report, saying that there was no evidence that he had done so.In his book, he gives a highly detailed account of this time, in which he states, not without some anger, that people at News Corp briefed against him. He was offered up as a kind of sacrifice, he thinks now. But what he doesn’t give is any sense of his deeper feelings. How frightened was he? And how stupid did he feel, having seemingly believed that Goodman was a sole bad apple? On the second point, he says he never thought to question the paper’s many scoops: “No, no, no, no, no, I didn’t. The News of the World won newspaper of the year at the London Press Club three years in a row. Should I have said: is this too good to be true? Probably.” Does he feel an idiot about that now? He laughs. “I don’t feel smart about it, no.” On the first question, he’s frank enough to admit that he was very frightened indeed. This was a time of sleeping pills and medication for high blood pressure. But he also thinks that he was stupid to appear before the Commons culture select committee in the first place.He then talks about the dawn raids, all those journalists who were arrested, charged and, in the end, not convicted. Brooks’s trial, in his eyes, was nothing more than a show. “It was like the air catching fire,” he says. “The police accused of being too close to News International, the police then overreacting to everything, the baying of the politicians.” Amazingly – shockingly, perhaps – he thinks Goodman should not have been sent to prison for his crimes, a “guy who’s got no other blemish on his record”. Does he feel the same about Andy Coulson, the former editor of the News of the World and adviser to David Cameron who was sentenced to 18 months in prison for phone hacking? “I thought prison was… a bit rough. He is a very talented man. This bit of wrongdoing didn’t make him a bad newspaperman or for that matter an evil person.”Didn’t make him a bad newspaperman. As a newspaperwoman who began her own career at News International (I used to avoid meeting Hinton’s eye in the lift on the way to the canteen), this statement strikes me as hollow and wilfully blind and it stays with me long after I leave him. Good newspaper people need, in Nick Tomalin’s peerless phrase, a certain amount of ratlike cunning. But there are reporters everywhere who deliver important stories without resorting to breaking the law. They are the good newspapermen and women. When Hinton talks of the importance of the freedom of the press, describing, for instance, the way the famous condemnation of the hanging of Ruth Ellis by Cassandra in the Daily Mirror worked on him as a boy of 11, I’m with him all the way. But this stuff makes me feel more equivocally about him, which is a shame, because he is smart, nice and fun – and just like him, I do love to gossip about inky old times.• Bootle Boy by Les Hinton is published by Scribe (£20).

Until now there’s been this argument: work with the companies, do it on a voluntary basis, you’ll do more that way because the lawyers won’t be involved.”Speaking on BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show, hosted by Emma Barnett in Marr’s absence, Hancock said: “Having a level playing field is important. There’s no other field of life in the UK where we say these are international companies so we can’t legislate – so we will.”He said the new legislation would have the same scale of fines for failing to enforce anti-bullying or harassment rules as those in the data protection bill, which is due to become law in the next few weeks. For Google or Facebook that could mean fines of many millions of pounds.Hancock also wants to fine social media companies that fail to prevent under-13s from signing up for accounts. It is estimated that half of all 11- to 13-year-olds are on Facebook or another social media platform.Challenged to explain how lower age limits could be enforced and what would trigger a fine, Hancock said it was a matter for broad consultation. In an interview with ITV’s Peston on Sunday, he suggested a parent might be required to verify a child’s age. “Asking for a parent to verify if someone is old enough is one of the things we are looking at,” he said.The government said last year it would introduce an internet-wide levy to fund measures to tackle online abuse. However, it now seems there will be a further round of consultation with the sector and charities before any decision is made on how to proceed.The difficulties of legislating in this field have been illustrated in Germany, where tough new laws on taking down hate speech have had to be reconsidered after complaints that too much content was being removed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2abf5507509b6b3d3f5516e5afa76c45842ee752/0_113_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a86d6a3514a1b78287e85d690218ca8e","title":"royal wedding monarchy press newspapers","story":"The princes may have outsmarted the media, but they will need its support in futureThe extraordinary scenes on Saturday as the Queen welcomed an American actor into her family cloaked an uncomfortable reality. Despite the apparent public appreciation of the pomp and pageantry, the monarchy’s hold on its position is nothing like as stable as the hysteria might suggest.Nor should the 230 pages of coverage of the event in Sunday’s national newspapers blind us to the fact that the days of newsprint are numbered too. Without denying that there was an intense and genuine public interest in the marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, we need to remove the blinkers to view it for what it is: a turning point in Britain’s history.In truth, two institutions, monarchy and the press, are walking hand in hand towards their doom after 400 years of interdependence. Viewed rationally, we can see how popular newspapers – which is an oxymoronic term nowadays – spent months manufacturing synthetic public excitement about the marriage. Their coverage, far from reflecting modernity, was marked by all the old tropes: fawning fascination, carping criticism, preposterous speculation and the elevation of the trivial to an implausible level of significance.It culminated in a televised spectacle where many thousands of people turned out to witness the wedding in Windsor along with, so breathless TV commentators told us, “millions across the world”. But if we stand back from the hype and the superficial glamour to see beyond the surfeit of royal coverage, in print and on screen, there is a larger question to ask. Do Britons really care about the existence of the crown?We should see this for what it really was: a media-confected event played out over many months. Who did the Daily Mail think were craving to read the 42 pages it published about the couple on the November day last year when their engagement was announced? Can editors who filled Sunday’s newspapers with hundreds of pictures be certain they were fulfilling some kind of public demand? Surely they played a leading role in stimulating it?Although editors lay claim to “the public interest” as justification for their disproportionate coverage of the Windsors, they can hardly point to readership figures as proof they are satisfying people’s appetites. Circulations fall by the week and, unlike those days when Diana was the Princess of Sales, there has not been, until this weekend, the least sign of a similar Markle sparkle. And it will pass as quickly as it arrived.In truth, it can be seen that tabloid editors’ choice of material continues to play to a gallery of generations past. The baby boomers got off their knees in the 1960s and their children and grandchildren have shown no inclination to return to the age of deference. In fairness, some young people were attracted by the ballyhoo, in part because protocol was being overturned. A prince, sixth in line to the throne, was “allowed” to marry a orced, non-British TV actor of mixed race. Even republicans could see positive virtues in blue blood being mixed with red black skin being matched with white royalty being conjoined with commoner. As for tabloid editors, they played their usual hypocritical game. They lauded the inclusiveness of the royal family. Well done, Harry, said the Mail, for bringing us “a hint of the ersity that characterises contemporary Britain”. Terrific stuff, Harry, for the choice of “charming, confident and articulate Meghan”, said the Sun. “We praise him for his choice of bride,” enthused the .The sycophancy masked a covert reality, because editors had unleashed their reporters to hunt for skeletons in the Markle closet. In digging for dirt on her past they were delighted to come up with a motley collection of embarrassing relatives. Surely, one hears them say to themselves, it is the public’s right to know about these people, even if they have played little or no part in Markle’s life. These “discoveries” were probably factored in by the prince’s advisers well before the couple’s engagement. Harry and Meghan would have understood that they would just have to grin and bear it.Nor should all the sins be laid at the doors of the press. Broadcasters have, as so often, followed an agenda set by newspapers. Channel 4’s “documentary” last week, Meet the Markles, plumbed new depths of superficiality in its specious mission to show what papers had previously revealed: the prince’s wife has a dysfunctional family. The unsubtle message: look at them and laugh.But there is another side to this story. Despite the intensity of the press interest in Markle, there has not been a return to anything like the intrusiveness of the 1990s. That is entirely due to the way in which the royal family has dealt with the media in the post-Diana era. More particularly, it is about how Charles’s two sons were sheltered from the press after the death of their mother and then, in their adult years, have sought to protect themselves.The princes have not attempted to conceal their disdain for newspapers. Their antagonism may be understandable, given the treatment suffered by their mother, which culminated in the paparazzi pursuit that resulted in her death. Their hostility was further fed by the revelation that, during their teenage years, reporters were prepared to break the law to discover details of their private lives by hacking into the phones of their aides.Ever since, they and their advisers – with the blessing of Prince Charles – have employed an arm’s-length strategy with the press. The castle drawbridge was raised to minimise access to the princes’ lives with a surprisingly successful exercise of news management. In the process, by calling the shots, they have redefined the relationship between the royal family and the media. Aggression has been met with aggression. The princes have taken legal action to protect their privacy and used Ipso, the press regulator, to restrain the activities of audacious reporters and photographers.Editors have had to come to terms with the unpalatable fact that William and Harry have gained a victory over them. There is no longer a market in Britain for sneak photographs. Indeed, the papers now have to rely on William’s wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, to provide intimate pictures of their children. Clearly, editors are still hoping to wrestle back control from the Kensington Palace news managers, as illustrated by the shenanigans over Markle’s father and the opening of chequebooks to gain interviews with the Markle relatives not invited to the wedding. It was the first leak in the princes’ press dyke, but it was a one-off and its only result will be to reinforce their determination to keep the media at bay.Outsmarting the press is all very well, but there is a considerable risk for the future of the royal family in a post-Elizabethan Britain, where monarchy’s hold on the affections of the people, especially among the young, is anything but assured. Much of today’s loyalty towards the crown rests on respect for the Queen. By contrast, neither Charles nor William appear likely to generate the same popularity as the current monarch. It is not at all far-fetched to suggest that the coming generation will find it increasingly incongruous to have an unelected head of state.And there is the paradox. If the princes wish to create a better relationship with their hostile or apathetic “subjects”, they will need to rely on the loyalty and support of the media, including the loathed press. Papers may be heading for the dustbin of history but they have a way to go yet and while they exist, experience suggests they will still be calling the shots.Or perhaps there could be a very radical, even revolutionary, outcome on the distant horizon. Dare we imagine a Britain in, say, 2040, in which there is no national newsprint press and no monarchy?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53906c7f11b234945546b5664ae1eb5a3b2ec5a8/0_104_3638_2182/master/3638.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7331a6b60e8240a5cf0bb802982857a0","title":"theresa may brexit realists jacob rees mogg","story":"It was the moment that pro-Remain Conservative MPs had been longing for, but feared would never happen – when the prime minister cut the arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg down to size. One MP who witnessed Theresa May’s newfound assertiveness likened it to a long-suffering teacher finally losing patience with the class know-all. “She just slapped him down, decisively. She showed she can do it. She was brilliant.”Five groups of about 30 Tory MPs at a time had been asked into the chief whip’s office in No 9 Downing Street last Monday. May’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, had been told to brief them on the two options for solving the seemingly intractable Irish border problem that threatens the Brexit process.After Barwell had done his bit, May made herself available for questions. By chance, Rees-Mogg’s batch of MPs included leading names from the parliamentary party’s voluble Europhile wing. Kenneth Clarke, Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve were there representing Remainers.When Rees-Mogg got his chance he was quick to ask the prime minister why she could not do what seemed the obvious thing for a hard Brexiter like him – forget any deal and just keep open the border after Brexit. “He was basically calling for a no-deal,” said another who attended.May has often been accused of sitting on the fence on Brexit, of failing to give a lead and ducking out of confrontations with either side in her split party. On this occasion, however, she broke that habit and gave Rees-Mogg a piece of her mind. According to several sources, she spelled out in no uncertain terms the serious problems and costs that would result from having to resort to World Trade Organisation rules, while also stressing the potentially grave security dangers that would follow if and when the Republic of Ireland had to reimpose border controls on the orders of the EU in order to preserve the integrity of the single\u0026nbspmarket.A hard Brexit would take Britain out of the EU’s single market and customs union and ends its obligations to respect the four freedoms, make big EU budget payments and accept the jurisdiction of the ECJ: what Brexiters mean by “taking back control” of Britain’s borders, laws and money. It would mean a return of trade tariffs, depending on what (if any) FTA was agreed.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.“It was the most amazing moment when the Rees-Mogg claptrap finally met cold reality,” said one Remain MP who attended. “She became animated in a way she doesn’t normally, she was completely engaged, not robotic at all. She was really concerned about the security issue and she showed she really meant every word she said.”For several weeks May and her cabinet had failed to agree what to do about the customs issue – how to avoid a hard border in Ireland without remaining inside the EU customs union and possibly the single market too.For a long time May had pushed a “customs partnership”, under which the UK would collect tariffs for the EU, post-Brexit – an idea vetoed by the Brexiters in cabinet, led by Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, on the grounds that the UK would in effect still be tied in with a key pillar of EU bureaucracy and the Brussels economic model. Instead, the Brexiters favoured relying on as yet unproven technological solutions to track cross-border trade. Neither Brussels nor most experts in the field believed either option was really workable.No one could see a way forward. Then with the clock ticking towards a Brussels summit next month, at which the UK is expected to have its plan for the Irish border agreed, and with the Irish warning that unless the UK puts forward some solutions it could leave the EU without any deal, May shifted her approach, as the extent of as yet unresolved problems piled up around her.A senior government source close to the Brexit talks said that had she not done so she could have been submerged: “It is not just the Irish problem that there is no agreement on. Almost everything needs to be sorted out and we are running out of time. You name it, we have not agreed it. We cannot be held up by these few hardliners for ever.”The day after (Tuesday) there were further signs of May’s newfound pragmatism and willingness to face down the likes of Johnson and Gove inside the cabinet, and Rees-Mogg and the 20 or so Brexit ultras from the backbenches.At a meeting of the cabinet Brexit subcommittee, a report from the Cabinet Office secretariat proposed a compromise on the Irish question that would, if need be, offer a so-called “backstop” option under which the UK could remain tied to an EU customs union for an unspecified period after the two-year post-Brexit transition deal ends in\u0026nbsp2021. Under such a scheme, the whole of the UK would be covered by the EU external tariff during that as yet unlimited period, thereby removing any requirement for a border either between the republic and Northern Ireland or between Ireland and the\u0026nbspUK.“That is a big deal, a big move, a big acceptance of reality,” said one pro-Remain Tory MP last Thursday. “That is why the Brexiters hate it.”The Brexiters knew that, assuming the plan is acceptable to Brussels (which it may well not be), it would mean them accepting that the UK would remain subject to customs union and single-market arrangements (in so far as either affects border issues) for more than two years after Brexit day on 29 March 2019. It was yet more slippage.Government sources said most cabinet ministers at the meeting received little or no notice of the proposals, suggesting that May presented them as a fait accompli. Gove and Johnson, say insiders, suggested putting time limits on the number of months (or years) the backstop could apply for after March 2021. But no limit was agreed. No 10 did not want one. “There were plenty of time limits which were not agreed,” said an insider. “She called their bluff and it worked.”The change of approach was clear, and significant – but in a sense it was all May could do if multiple Brexit crises were not to completely consume her government. As well as negotiating with Brussels, she still has to steer heavily amended and contentious Brexit legislation through parliament without a working majority behind her. Tory Remainers believe they have the numbers to defeat the government on several key votes in order to deliver the soft Brexit they want.On all sides, though, there are now more signs of realism entering the debate. Tory Remainers are busy trying to find what they call “pragmatic Brexiters” with whom they can make common cause to avoid too much deadlock. The fear of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party exploiting Tory chaos has brought some Conservatives to their senses.Plenty of Tory Brexiters are also aware more time may be needed to ensure that their preferred option of breaking free from Brussels customs rules, known as “maximum facilitation” or “max fac”, is\u0026nbspviable.Nick Boles, the modernising Tory MP, proposed extending Britain’s membership of the customs union until just before the next election in 2022. Former Tory and Ukip MP Douglas Carswell said it was a “sensible” move. Boles is keen to push the idea and is prepared to submit it as an amendment to Brexit legislation.Extending membership of the customs union could appeal to some Tory MPs in both the Remain and Leave camps, as it would in effect delay a number of key decisions about the longer-term relationship with the EU, and keep options open. At the same time, however, some Remainers are growing more confident that they can win a vote on a plan that keeps Britain close to a customs union for the long term."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b604443dd948c0fd7953a05efc96f99bc43fa57/174_0_3905_2343/master/3905.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14bf1517031ef2118ebff66ba946f8c6","title":"vote leave scrutiny facebook data football contest brexit","story":"A data-harvesting competition that offered football fans the chance to win £50m is at the centre of new questions about pro-Brexit campaigning before the 2016 EU referendum.Last week the select committee for digital, culture, media and sport released a letter Facebook sent to the Electoral Commission in which it said that two campaigns, Vote Leave and BeLeave, used three sets of data to target audiences, noting that they covered “the exact same\u0026nbspaudiences”.The two campaign groups are under investigation over whether there was collusion and coordination during the referendum campaign, circumventing spending limits. Under British electoral law, it is illegal for campaigns to work together in any way unless they declare their spending jointly, which Vote Leave and BeLeave did not. Both organisations deny any collusion.BeLeave created 16 adverts using targeting criteria from one or more of the three common audiences on 15 June 2016, but did not ultimately run any of the adverts. Vote Leave created 2,189 adverts based on the same common audiences, and ran about half of them.Now it has emerged that a data set referred to by Facebook, called “50million_remains”, is likely to be a competition that Vote Leave ran, in which it offered fans the chance to win £50m if they correctly predicted the outcome of every game in the European Championships that year.On a blog written after the referendum, Dominic Cummings, Vote Leave’s campaign director, admitted that the competition to win £50m was a data-harvesting exercise. Talking about the necessity of data in targeting voters, he said: “Data flowed in on the ground and was then analysed by the data science team and integrated with all the other data streaming in. This was the point of our £50m prize for predicting the results of the European football championships, which gathered data from people who usually ignore politics.”The MPs’ committee announced on Friday that it would be reporting Cummings for contempt of parliament for refusing to appear and answer MPs questions.To enter the competition, fans had to input their name, address, email and telephone number, and also how they intended to vote in the referendum. Last year, Martin Moore, director of the centre for the study of media, communication and power at King’s College, London, and the author of an upcoming book, Democracy Hacked, told the Observer that he’d tried to find details of the quiz and exactly what information it had gathered but that the site had been taken down and he could find no trace of it on the internet. “I saw an advert for it at the time. And I couldn’t figure out why it was being done or for what purpose and it was only afterwards that I read Dom Cummings’s blog and I realised that actually it was very clever. Data is very difficult to collect in the UK and they were starting with nothing. But working out what to send what message to what audience was absolutely crucial.“What’s clear from the ad is that they had identified a particular group of people who are really hard to reach. Working-class young men who actively ignore and reject politics. It’s hard to get their contact details and hard to get them to turn out to vote but this was central to Project Waterloo – increasing turnout among particular demographics, especially young working-class males by sending them messages that Leave knew would provoke a response.”Adverts for the competition are still online and show two men in hi-viz jackets – “Gary and Kev” – sitting in a pub drinking beer and talking about football. The prize is £50m, one of them says, because “that’s how much Britain gives the EU every day”. Though no one won the £50m prize, Vote Leave said £50,000 was awarded to one entrant.In a letter published on the Electoral Commission’s website about the competition, a Vote Leave spokesperson said: “Vote Leave’s football score predictor competition raised awareness of the UK’s daily budget contributions to the EU. Facebook confirmed to the DCMS committee that BeLeave did not run any adverts using data sets resulting from this competition or from any other Vote Leave data in its digital advertising campaign. Claims to the contrary are completely incorrect and typical of the sloppy journalism and lies being spread by the  and Observer in their attempt to delegitimise and overturn the referendum result.”Darren Grimes of BeLeave did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c6199b9329e240a623f4b0e9e2d3170003d2df5/0_278_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a409f527b27e151a33079f7adf2d54ba","title":"elina svitolina simona halep rome open final","story":"On an otherwise perfect day, the world No1 Simona Halep collapsed spectacularly in her rematch with Elina Svitolina to gift the Ukrainian a second Italian Open title.It took the fourth seed just over an hour to dispose of her wounded foe, 6-0, 6-4, her fourth win over Halep in six meetings. Last year, they battled for more than two hours and three sets in the final, before Svitolina overpowered Halep in the third set. This time the one-way traffic started early.They head for Roland Garros encouraged by solid performances during the week here, but Halep has cause for concern if, as seems likely, she has a back problem. The Romanian was not remotely in the contest in an opening set that sped by in 19 minutes and, after taking a medical timeout in the second, managed to make something of a fight of it.However, it was a disappointing spectacle for a showpiece event on Campo Centrale, which is normally a bearpit in big matches, with the Roman crowd craning forward from the steep seats baying for action as if it were the coliseum. The gladiatorial content was minimal on Sunday.Halep looked to be restricted in her sideways movement, although she was all smiles during the presentation, regretting that she could not have performed better when it mattered. Both finalists had reached the decider having dropped just one set.In the first frame, Halep’s attack lacked all potency as she took just two points from 15 first serves, and she was constantly on the back foot in rallies, yet still managed to save two of five break points before succumbing. Svitolina dominated her with ball in hand, winning a phenomenal 86 per cent of first serves.Halep left the court for a medical time out at 2-3 in the second and returned to engage in a fightback that finally spluttered into life in the seventh game, when she saved two break points to hold with an ace for 3-4. She threatened to break serve in the eighth game but Svitolina held her composure.Clearly still not properly co-ordinated in her movement, Halep struggled to stay in the contest, with the sympathy of the crowd countermanding the determination of her opponent. She fought to deuce, thrashing her forehand as hard as she could into the corners, and held with a scorching backhand down the line. But she looked far from happy as Svitolina stepped up to serve for the match just past the hour.Svitolina calmly worked the ball to either side, setting up two championship points with a forehand to the deuce corner, but slugged a backhand into the tramlines. Halep did the job for her though, by dumping a tired backhand into the net.The champion’s celebrations were as low-key as the loser’s resignation was complete. It was not a great final.“It’s the second time, so I wish I will be in the final again next year and maybe win it,” Halep said.For Svitolina it was just, “a very, very special day” to retain her trophy. She thanked the fans wholeheartedly, in the worn tradition of such gestures, but there will not have been many in the crowd who went away with fond memories of this one-sided affair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f8e134e79ae314d3329d80822f67931253fb7d5/6_193_3468_2081/master/3468.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d74610afdca1fc676534ee902cc7bda5","title":"england pakistan ecb test series","story":"English cricket may be in a state of flux (or crisis), but the visits of Pakistan, India and Australia should provide genuine exhilaration on the international stage this summerCome Thursday there will be that unique hum of excited conversation around the stands at Lord’s. The ground will look a picture, the sun should be shining and when the two decorously blazered captains make their way to the middle for the toss all will seem well with the cricketing world. This may be a veneer of contentment and calm since the game in this country is in a state of flux (say the optimists) or crisis (say the pessimists).Still, as the umpires make their way through the Long Room there will be a ripple of applause and another international summer of cricket will be under way.It begins with two Tests against Pakistan, followed by white-ball matches against Scotland, Australia and India and then there is a five‑Test series against India, which is due to come to a conclusion on 11 September at the Oval.On the radar this summer we note the arrival of the Australians, minus nearly all of their pantomime villains – and their best players – a squad that will have to silently endure a few jibes along the way. At the same time Virat Kohli will be playing Championship cricket for Surrey, which is quite an event.Like Cheteshwar Pujara at Yorkshire and Matt Renshaw at Somerset, there is a major element of self‑interest here as these players seek to gain experience before playing Test cricket in England. But their presence does suggest that Championship cricket is not as moribund or unattractive as some suggest. In August Ben Stokes will miss the Lord’s Test against India because he will be in court.But the radar is not always reliable. We all turned up for the Tests in New Zealand in March expecting Stokes to be the focus of our attention but he barely warranted a mention as we ended up concentrating on ball-tampering in Cape Town and a nation in shock on the other side of the Tasman. Something will surprise us.The international season starts against a backdrop of uncertainty about the English game and the ability of the England and Wales Cricket Board to look after it. I have yet to meet anyone not employed by the ECB who approves of The Hundred, even though it is, according to Colin Graves (if not his chief executive), “set in stone”.Having sleepwalked this far, the counties not hosting the new competition are keeping their heads down, awaiting their annual boost of £1.3m and hoping to ensure that the T20 Blast is not too damaged.Only the players can apply the brake now so expect them to be lured by the prospect of additional riches by the ECB. Sacrificed along the way is the burgeoning Kia Super League, the women’s T20 competition, which has been deemed such a success, especially in the shires. They must play The Hundred in the cities as well.A working group has been set up to look at the game’s domestic structure to be chaired by Wasim Khan, the CEO of Leicestershire, and including Hugh Morris, the CEO of Glamorgan, whose club did or did not receive £2.5m from the ECB, depending on whether you believe the club’s accounts or the ECB’s chairman. Meanwhile, Barry O’Brien resigned as Glamorgan’s chairman 10 days ago so that he could take up a position on the ECB’s executive board, even though “an external review” of that payment is still under way. All this fails to inspire much confidence.No wonder the ECB is looking for a healthy ersion in the form of some exhilarating international cricket. It is hard to argue that England against Pakistan represents the pinnacle of Test cricket at the moment. England, after their five defeats in seven Test matches in the winter, are ranked No 5 in the world Pakistan won in Ireland last week but they lost their previous series, against Sri Lanka in the United Arab Emirates, last autumn and they are ranked seventh. But on a good day at Lord’s those rankings can seem an irrelevance the occasion takes over.Ed Smith has surprised us with the inclusion of Jos Buttler as a specialist No 7, not an unprecedented move since Derek Randall and Mike Gatting batted there occasionally in the distant past, but an unusual one. If Buttler succeeds, which would be quite an achievement given that he has not faced a red ball since September last year, and others fail up the order that situation may change. It does not feel like a permanent role.Meanwhile Somerset’s fresh-faced Dom Bess, as a consequence of the injury to his club-mate Jack Leach and the off-spinner’s own stunning start to first-class cricket, will make his debut if the forecast for sunshine is correct.The logic of elevating Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow in the order is hard to fault. Perhaps they can now impose upon the opposition rather than be compelled to launch the rescue act. Under greatest scrutiny among the batsmen are the openers. Alastair Cook’s winter problems were masked by a monumental innings in Melbourne, while there was little sign of Mark Stoneman improving as a Test player. Among the bowlers England must decide whether Chris Woakes, who has been far more potent at home than away in his Test career, or Mark Wood should be included in the final XI.Pakistan are rebuilding under the captaincy of Sarfraz Ahmed, their inspirational little keeper. If fully fit, Mohammad Amir provides the greatest threat with the ball. Since the retirements of Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq, Azhar Ali is the senior batsman and the one with the best pedigree is the 22-year-old Imam-ul-Haq, who is Inzamam’s nephew – although I doubt whether he yet retires to a wicker chair on the outfield once he has completed his net."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdf0924b2bc63cddd8df9dbd5a47f7b9769cc6ac/0_269_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6259c958647a39683830e408a470eb00","title":"giro ditalia 2018 stage 15 live","story":"Chris Lloyd emails in with a brainteaser. Hypothetically, if the worst were to happen for Chris Froome and his results in this Giro were to be expunged from the records, would that include each inidual stage’s results, such as yesterday? Therefore, could Simon Yates find himself promoted retrospectively to stage winner on the Zoncolan, granted an increased number of bonus seconds which could make all the difference in a tight race for the Maglia Rosa?Only in cycling, eh? Memories perhaps of Andy Schleck “winning” the 2010 Tour de France after Contador was banned. In February 2012. The leading group comes over the top, and Woods is in touch. Giulio Ciccone (related to Madonna?) took the mountain points. There is a chasing group 40 seconds off the leaders, with the peloton around two minutes back. The peloton has thinned out again. Some tired legs after yesterday and plenty yearning for the rest day on Monday. Woods is chasing those at the front of the breakaway, but is 51 seconds off them. His mercy mission looks to be have fallen short. The descent will probably bring everybody back together. The summit of this climb is not far off, before a long descent preludes the final climbs of the day. Michael Woods, who tried a burst yesterday on the Zoncolan, has launched himself from the peloton and strung out the field by doing so. Fabio Aru is back in the pack again and doesn’t look too clever. Not a good sign with so much more climbing to come. 70km to go now, and the leading group are making their way up some soggy roads. The breakaway group, now barely 1 minute 30 seconds ahead, is now on the climb and splintering into smaller groups. And the weather is inclement with jackets being donned in the peloton ahead of the Tre Croci climb. Talking of Stephen Roche, his son Nico is reported to have abandoned today. There will be no father-son Sappada celebration. This being 2018, we are twenty years on from Marco Pantani’s Giro-Tour double. Of course, Pantani’s tale ended in desperate, wasteful tragedy. Here’s something from the archives on “Il Pirata”. Yates looking relaxed in the bunch, though he has dropped back to chat to his team car and team manager Matt White. Nothing drastic, just routine stuff by the sounds of it, and grabbing a rain bag. Yates has been so cool through this tour. He knows, though, that he needs to get time today, or this could be his penultimate day in pink. Simon Yates yesterday was either pessimistic, realistic or pragmatic about his chances of overall victory. Or all three. It’s not enough for me to win the Giro either. The gap is not that big. It’s not a lot. I fully expect him to take that back easily in the TT. We don’t know if I can take back time on each climb, that’s a big statement. For sure he will gain time on me very easily. So I’ll keep trying. The gap is now around 2 minutes and 30 seconds, which means the peloton are not letting it get too far away. This is something of a lull, with the incline gentle enough. Ahead of them are some fearsome mountains, the Dolomites. Today is the first and only time this tour will visit that mountain range. The gap is two minutes and 54 seconds. This breakaway is big enough to last a while, perhaps until the end of the stage. None of its members are GC contenders so there may be two races taking place but there is still 95 km to go. More on that Stephen Roche 1987 Giro, here from his 2012 interview with Donald McRae. Today I wouldn’t have been able to stand what happened to me in the Giro,” Roche says after he was threatened and vilified by irate Italian fans of his team-mate Roberto Visentini. Roche took the race-leader’s pink jersey from Visentini when, while disobeying team orders, he broke away in a dramatic example of his iniduality. “For the rest of the Giro I had people spitting rice and wine in my face, and Visentini plotting revenge. Back in 87 I said: ‘Do what you want. I ain’t going home.’ That’s a tough statement and maybe it comes from this hard streak in me. I wasn’t giving in.Actually, the breakaway group, pretty sizeable, made up of 25-30 riders, is away from the peloton. Seems there are some ghosts in the timing machine. Those riders won’t be away for long the gap to the peloton is down to 16 seconds. The breakaway group now up to nine riders with Sacha Modolo, Alexey Lutsenko, Niccolo Bonifazio, Gianluca Brambilla and Davide Ballerini joining the party. Some spots of rain on the overhead camera shot. The rain stayed off yesterday, but could be a factor on those closing climbs. Estimable cycling journalist Daniel Friebe has located an interesting take on one of the places today’s Giro is heading through.Roche was the first English speaker to win the Tour and there have only been two since, with American Andy Hampsten following up the next year. Ryder Hesjedal won the 2012 edition, and the likes of Lance Armstrong, Cadel Evans, Bradley Wiggins have all failed to land the Giro. Froome is attempting it this year but needs an amazing turnaround to win it this year. Next year? That may depend on his salbutamol case. Simon Yates may get there before him. Today’s summit finish at Sappada brings back memories of the 1987 Giro, where Ireland’s Stephen Roche went against team orders and blindsided Roberto Visentini to win the first half of his Giro-Tour double of that year. Krists Neilands, Dayer Quintana, Nico Denz and Quentin Jauregui are in this break. None of them a GC contender so they will be allowed - for now - to have their fun for a while. Back to today’s race and there has been a small breakaway, with the peloton, having been well in control so far, allowing it to escape. Previously, Fabio Aru, who had a stinker yesterday, was not allowed such a flight of fancy. Ireland’s Sam Bennett, winner of two sprint stages in this Giro, has annoyed a few people. He finished dead last on the Zoncolan, and wheelied his way up the climb. Top banter or disrespectful? Here’s William Fotheringham’s report from yesterday. After the thrills and spills of the Zoncolan, here comes the prospect of another four climbs and a summit finish. Lower key, but maybe just as important. Saturday was spectacular but this could be just as grinding. The category 2 climbs at the Giro, of which there are three today, would probably be regarded as hors catégorie in Le Tour, say the shrewdies the Giro and Vuelta are often tougher tests of the climbers than the daddy of the Grand Tours.Yesterday shook things up as expected, with Simon Yates gaining extra seconds on Tom Dumoulin and Thibaut Pinot, but maybe not enough with Tuesday’s time trial in mind. Yates needs to take more out of his rivals, as he admitted in the aftermath. Of course, the story of the day was Chris Froome’s stage win, and his climb to fifth in GC. Listening to Sir Dave Brailsford last night, it seems the Sky Train is not yet decommissioned. Sir Dave was in bullish mode, and Froome’s confidence levels were just as high. Expect to see Froome on the attack again. For him, anything but first is nothing, and he looked like his form had returned. That could make for an exciting day, with the added sight of defending Dumoulin, with his Mourinho-esque defensive tactics, holding on and refusing to break, even when he gets dropped.

The Daily Show host dedicates a full 10 minutes to the event at the start of his set, and it’s high quality material given its presumably hasty composition. But then the nuptials of a mixed-race American and a member of the British royal family is meat and drink to Noah, a comic who majors in race and social mores across borders and who, as a South African, is no slouch on the imperial self-regard of Britain’s ruling class.His wedding material certainly delights the locals – even those of us who’ve spent the day in a republican huff. He delivers a great line about the event’s supposed ersity (“Let me tell you something: a black cellist cancels itself out”), before imagining how it would have unfolded had it really been “a black wedding”. Yes, these jokes trade in broad stereotypes, and midway through Noah’s show I began to weary of his “white people do this, black people do that” shtick. But, for now, his cheerful ribbing of the claims being made for this establishment beanfeast were a pleasure to submit to.It all serves as a fine launchpad for the section in which Noah teases Brits for saying “sorry” all the time (see what I mean about stereotypes?), then imagines whether we did so while colonising Africa. From there, he weighs different perspectives on the “battles” waged between Brits and Zulus, and roleplays the anxious moment when a freed slave is offered passage to his new life – but on a boat. The subject matter is gratifyingly substantial but scarcely seems so, such is the easy swing of Noah’s smiling comedy.Sometimes, it’s too smiling – or, at least, too slick. I found the middle section harder to love. There’s an extended routine about hitting children (ground well trodden by black standups), as Noah recalls beatings at his mother’s hands and the African practice (as he describes it) of blithely whacking other people’s kids, too. It has its moments, but I found Noah’s evident amusement at the practice a little offputting. Then there’s a long story about an “authentic Balinese experience” Noah had on a recent holiday. Not for the last time tonight, his story – about exploitative tourism and a snake-charming act gone wrong – is brilliantly told and completely unconvincing.Of course every word may be true, but there’s something about Noah’s smooth style and the neatness of the incidents he describes that ring a little inauthentic. The political material – there’s less than you might expect – can also feel trite. There’s a routine that’s starry-eyed about Barack Obama. Another, on gun control, takes potshots at an easy target – Trump’s proposal that teachers be armed. The jokes about the president’s border wall are better, particularly the emperor’s-new-clothes payoff, featuring a droll cameo from a troupe of Mexican mime artists.He ends strongly, with a section declaring sympathy for old racists and positing a novel relief strategy for them and another addressing the N-word and what it connotes to speakers of the Xhosa language. At his best – which is where he spends about half of tonight’s show – Noah’s laid-back optimism can take heavyweight subjects seriously, and still render them momentarily lighter than air."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfe01522be353aa84561e96379ae9715b03fc71c/0_62_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=263530ced2b5743550079a46cde3951f","title":"uk government plans new laws tackle internet wild west","story":"New laws will make Britain ‘safest place in the world’ to be online, culture secretary saysNew laws will be introduced to tackle the internet’s “wild west” that will make Britain the “safest place in the world” to be online, the culture secretary has said.Social media companies have already taken some positive steps to protect users, but the performance of the industry overall has been mixed, according to Matt Hancock.The government outlined proposals last year to impose an industry-wide levy on social media firms like Facebook and Twitter to fund measures to tackle online harm. It is understood the move will be subject to a further round of consultation with the sector and charities before any decision is made on pushing ahead.A new code of practice to tackle bullying, intimidating or humiliating online content and a regular internet safety transparency report to keep tabs on online abuse could be included in new legislation.Hancock said: “Digital technology is overwhelmingly a force for good across the world and we must always champion innovation and change for the better. At the same time, I have been clear that we have to address the ‘wild west’ elements of the internet through legislation in a way that supports innovation. “We strongly support technology companies to start up and grow, and we want to work with them to keep our citizens safe. People increasingly live their lives through online platforms, so it’s more important than ever that people are safe and parents can have confidence they can keep their children from harm.“The measures we’re taking forward today will help make sure children are protected online and balance the need for safety with the great freedoms the internet brings, just as we have to strike this balance offline.”The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and the Home Office are jointly working on a white paper that is expected to be published in the autumn.The home secretary, Sajid Javid, said: “Criminals are using the internet to further their exploitation and abuse of children while terrorists are abusing these platforms to recruit people and incite atrocities. We need to protect our communities from these heinous crimes and vile propaganda, and that is why this government has been taking the lead on this issue.“But more needs to be done, and this is why we will continue to work with the companies and the public to do everything we can to stop the misuse of these platforms. Only by working together can we defeat those who seek to do us harm.”Alex Holmes, deputy chief executive at young people’s charity the Diana Award, said: “We look forward to seeing government, industry, businesses, schools and the wider children and charity sector workforce continue to work together to make the internet a safer place for all.”“We urge government in the white paper to consider legislation that ends the era of technology self-regulation and puts children’s safety at the heart of the online world. Taking action now is vital to protect the next generation of children.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/044ec2e6d6a599e9f6b56b53a0cfe9e465341bb4/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c81ee0a2369d3152c2b4f5df148ccce","title":"the star quality of new zealands great barrier island","story":"The off-grid island 90km off the coast of Auckland is a Dark Sky Sanctuary ideal for star gazing – and the views by day are heavenly tooI was glad I had such terrible jet lag. Wide awake at 3.30am with my nine-year-old daughter on our lodge balcony, I stared for hours at the most incredible night sky I’ve ever seen before the dawn slowly started to rub out the stars on the horizon and the multiple shooting stars faded away.We were going to my girlfriend’s big family reunion in Auckland, New Zealand, but when we found out that Great Barrier Island, just off the coast, had been recently awarded Dark Sky Sanctuary status – a typically remote area that has an “exceptional or distinguished quality of starry nights” – we thought it would be the perfect place to unwind before our busy schedule. It’s the first island and only the fourth location in the world to achieve this (along with Chile’s Gabriela Mistral, the Cosmic Campground in New Mexico and Rainbow Bridge National Monument in Utah).After a 28-hour flight with two travel-sick children, our hearts sank when we saw the tiny twin engine 10-seater that was to take us the 90km across the Hauraki Gulf to Great Barrier. But we needn’t have worried. Whether it was the g-force of the ascent or the noise of the plane (we had to wear headsets), it put our three-year-old daughter instantly to sleep until we bumped down on the grass at Claris airport. Our first empty sick bag against all the odds… Things were looking up.Great Barrier is off-grid and the 950 people living there (though only about half permanently) rely on solar and wind energy, and bottled gas for cooking. There are no streetlights. There are no cash machines or banks. The police force comprises a husband and wife, and there’s one postie. It’s not just the lack of light but the lack of noise that’s so blissful on this unique and stunning little idyll. It was first discovered by East Polynesians about 700 years ago and the Maori name for the island is Aotea (canoe). Captain Cook gave the island its European name, because it acts as a barrier between the Pacific and the Hauraki Gulf.The climate here is subtropical like Auckland’s, but it’s windier and more rugged a beautiful wilderness with lush forests, glorious, unspoilt sandy beaches and plenty of bays and a few mountainous areas where there are good walking tracks among the wetlands and gorges, including the three-day Aotea Track. You can birdwatch, snorkel, surf and kayak. The best beaches are on the eastern side of the island where the surf is better, too. The sheltered western side is where you’ll find the best ing and boating. Lots of people come here for the fantastic fishing spots around the island – snapper, squid, cod. Like a lot of spots in New Zealand, there are dolphin and whale-watching trips and you might just catch sight of hammerhead sharks.It’s rare to find an island that really does feel undiscovered – but this is it. When one of my girlfriend’s relations, who comes here regularly, found out that we’d been, he whispered to us, only half-joking: “Shh – don’t tell anyone!” (He’s a former All Black, so I might be in a bit of bother.) The locals are a relaxed and friendly bunch – a lot of them told us that it’s like Waiheke Island (now in effect a suburb of Auckland) was in the 70s when it was a hippy commune and full of artists and people wanting to escape the city. Killing Joke’s Jaz Coleman lives on Great Barrier and Veronica Lake’s daughter, the artist Anae Swan, also lives here.Our guide for some of our stay was the inestimable Hilde Hoven, a dark sky ambassador who runs Good Heavens with Deborah Kilgallon and Orla Cumisky. They bring their 8in Dobsonian telescope, binoculars and beanbags (it’s hard work staring up wide-eyed in wonder without neck support) and, my elder daughter was glad to hear, hot chocolate to wherever you are on the island. “It’s odd but when the light readings were done,” said Hilde, explaining how the island was awarded its special status, “they found there was more light pollution on the northern side coming from Fiji, which is about 3,000km away, than Auckland to the south. It’s pretty dark!”Beginning their celestial PowerPoint demonstration using a green laser pointer, Hilda and Orla showed us the Messier 4 globular cluster with white dwarf stars, Saturn and its rings, the Southern Cross and the Milky Way, which stretched across the sky. My daughter was especially taken with Hilde’s recounting of the Maori myth of Māui’s fish hook to explain the shape of Scorpius. In the fable, Māui hauled the North Island of New Zealand (Te Ika-a-Māui, which means the Fish of Māui) from the bottom of the ocean with his hook.We stayed at Mount St Paul’s Estate, a luxurious lodge run by the genial Chris and Teara, both from Canada. Teara used to be a chef at the Langham in Auckland and so dinner, eaten around a huge circular kauri table (made of one of the most ancient trees in the world), was every bit as mouth-watering as you’d expect seared scallops with a wasabi pea purée and braised lamb shanks with a garlic and maple reduction. Tucking into pancakes on the wraparound verandah overlooking the pristine white sandy beach was a great way to start the day.Another highlight was an hour-long walk to Kaitoke hot pools in the centre of the island, through wetlands and a kānuka forest, where we spotted fern birds and fantails and whiled away a good hour sitting in the pools shaded from the heat by layers of delicate umbrella ferns.We also loved visiting the potter Sarah Harrison, who showed us round her studio at Shoal Bay harbour, and her many pots and jugs, plates and bowls and colourful mosaics. She also uses a lot of found materials in her work, such as her driftwood chairs. My elder daughter loved the gorgeous hidden mermaid pool at Medlands beach where the water is separated from the sea in a secluded rock pool. Other high points were the gnarly, ancient pohutukawa trees and the stunning panoramic views of Okiwi Basin and Whangapoua beach from the top of Windy Canyon, just a 10-minute hike through a gorge up some steep wooden steps on the eastern side of the island. Apparently the island council turned down Paul McCartney’s application to buy a property at Great Barrier because of the unwelcome attention he would have brought. You can see why he wanted to come here equally, the island knows exactly what kind of star watching it prefers.Chris and his family stayed at mountstpaulestate.co.nz, Great Barrier Island.

McGrath, a Democrat who hopes to emerge as the party’s nominee from a six-way primary on Tuesday, is part of a trailblazing crop of women running for Congress this year, especially in the House.There are 408 Democratic and Republican women still in the running for the US House of Representatives, compared with 167 in 2016 and 159 in 2014, according to Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics (CAWP), which tracks women in elective office.The wave of women running also have more erse backgrounds and résumés. Many are political newcomers, spurred by the rage of losing a presidential election to a candidate with a history of berating women and the #MeToo reckoning against sexual assault and workplace harassment.“For years, women have had to walk this fine line between being capable and being likable,” said Erin Loos Cutraro, the CEO and co-founder of She Should Run, a nonpartisan organization that seeks to increase the number of women in elective office. “But with this massive groundswell we’re seeing women from all backgrounds run as themselves.”At least two women running for governor – Kelda Roys in Wisconsin and Krish Vignarajah in Maryland – have run ads featuring them breastfeeding their babies while discussing their political platforms. Nadia Hashimi, who is running for Congress in Maryland, promised voters less “mansplaining”. And Sol Flores, who lost her bid for Congress in Illinois, shared her story of sexual abuse in a campaign ad, promising: “I’ll fight as hard for you in Congress as I did to protect myself.”“It feels like we have this support system in women running across the country,” said Liuba Grechen Shirley, a first-time Democratic candidate for Congress in New York.This month, Grechen Shirley, the mother of two young children, won approval from the Federal Election Commission to use campaign funds for childcare. Two dozen members of Congress and Hillary Clinton sent letters of support for her request.“This ruling will allow more women – and men – to run for office,” she said, adding: “Our babysitter is a staff member in the same way that our field director and finance manager are staff members.”As women storm the ramparts of the Democratic party, female Republican candidates are fewer in number. Of the 408 women still running for the House, 305 are Democrats and 103 are Republicans, according to CAWP.Still, Republicans boast an impressive and unusually large crop of female hopefuls, said Andrea Bozek, a spokeswoman for Winning for Women, a new political organization that aims to be the conservative counterweight to Emily’s List.“Our goal is to build a lasting momentum that’s not just contained to a year,” Bozek said. “We want a lot of ‘years of the woman’.”She noted that the top two Republican fundraisers last quarter were women: Marsha Blackburn, who is running for Senate in Tennessee, and Martha McSally, who is running for Senate in Arizona. And the only two women elected to Congress since Donald Trump took office have been Republicans: Karen Handel in Georgia and Debbie Lesko in Arizona.“Let’s absolutely celebrate the women who are on the ballot but let’s also look at who’s not there,” Cutraro said. “This is just the beginning – we still have so much more work to do.”The results of the early primaries show that women aren’t just running – they’re winning.More than 50 women filed to run in Texas. Nearly half of the candidates who finished first in the Democratic primaries were women, including two Latinas who are likely to head to Congress in November. In Nebraska, Kara Eastman bested a former congressman to win a primary to represent a congressional district in Omaha. Meanwhile, the Democrat Jane Raybould will face off against the Republican senator Deb Fischer, in one of several general election races featuring or likely to feature two women.Pennsylvania, a state with an all-male Congressional delegation of 20, stands out as a particularly bright spot for women this year. Last Tuesday, voters selected female candidates in seven primaries held in the state’s newly redrawn congressional map, three of whom are running in districts favorable to Democrats.But for all the enthusiasm and energy, political observers warn it is too early to declare 2018 a “year of the woman”. “We’re really hopeful that we’ll see gains for women in November,” said Kelly Dittmar, a political scientist at CAWP.“But we’re being careful about the extent to which this wave of women running will translate into a tsunami of women winning in November.” The route to Washington is complicated by several factors, Dittmar explains. More Democratic men are running, too, which means primary races are crowded. Plenty of Democratic women are running in the same districts as each other, such as in Texas, where a handful of races featured as many as three female candidates. This means that women will be eliminated in the primaries. Perhaps the biggest hurdle for women this election cycle is that many are running against incumbents, who almost always win re-election. More than half of the female candidates running for House and Senate hope to unseat sitting members of Congress. Ten states have held primaries so far this election cycle. Of the 125 women running for the House of Representatives in those races, nearly half – 60 – have won, according to CAWP. But a large number of the Democratic primary winners will go on to face incumbents in safely Republican districts. Even if 2018 falls short of being a historic “year of the woman”, the wave of female candidates has already changed attitudes to running, organizers say. For decades, organizations like Emily’s List, the fundraising juggernaut dedicated to electing Democratic women who support abortion rights, have tried to narrow a so-called ambition gap by encouraging women to run for office and providing them with the resources to do it. Traditionally, those conversations require a degree of coaxing. But since the 2016 election, the phones have been ringing with women putting themselves forward. “What’s so inspiring is that we have so many women who have crossed over that first obstacle: desire to run,” Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily’s List, told reporters at the group’s national conference earlier this month. “Once that seed is planted, it doesn’t stop growing.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cd28d6550f3e5e8ff82221f0e2f8f561f2328fd/0_71_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb16c63ce1007d16f025605e5f67f041","title":"hawaii kilauea volcano lava flows","story":"Lava flows from the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii have grown more vigorous in recent days and there is concern more homes may burn and more evacuations may be ordered. Scientists cannot say if lava flows from nearly two dozen fissures will continue to advance, or stop. In the weeks since Kilauea began erupting, dozens of homes have burned, people have fled and plumes of steam from the summit have shot skyward, prompting officials to distribute face masks. “We have no way of knowing whether this is really the beginning or toward the end of this eruption,” said Tom Shea, a volcanologist at the University of Hawaii. “We’re kind of all right now in this world of uncertainty.” In addition to ash fallout from explosions and the threat of lava crossing main highways, officials warned of another hazard Saturday as a flow advanced south-east to the ocean.“Laze is when hot lava hits the ocean, sending hydrochloric acid and steam with fine glass particles in the air,” the Hawaii County Civil Defense agency said in an update to the public. Evacuation orders for two neighborhoods with nearly 2,000 people were given after a first fissure opened on 3 May. Officials have been warning neighboring communities to be prepared to evacuate. A handful of people were trapped when a flow crossed a road on Friday. Some had to be airlifted to safety. “They shouldn’t be in that area,” said county managing director Wil Okabe. Civil defense administrator Talmadge Magno said a man suffered a “serious” leg injury on Saturday when he was hit with a lava spatter while sitting on his porch near the Lanipuna Garden subision, the Star-Advertiser reported. Lava flows have become faster new magma mixes with 1955-era magma in the ground, creating hotter and more fluid flows, scientists said. By Saturday morning, two of 22 fissures had merged, creating a wide flow advancing at rates of up to 300 yards per hour. Aerial footage from the USGS showed fast-moving lava advancing to the south-east. The flow was 1.5 miles from the ocean, scientists said. In the background, the footage showed lava fountaining 328ft at one of the fissures. Fountains are created by vents closing, forcing magma to burst through a single outpoint, geologists said. Edwin Montoya, who lives with his daughter on her farm near the site where lava crossed the road and cut off access, said the fissure opened and grew quickly. “It was just a little crack in the ground, with a little lava coming out,” he said. “Now it’s a big crater that opened up where the small little crack in the ground was.” The Big Island volcano released a small explosion at its summit just before midnight on Friday, sending an ash cloud 10,000ft into the sky. The USGS’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said eruptions that create even minor amounts of ashfall could occur at any time. That followed a more explosive eruption on Thursday, which sent ash and rocks thousands of feet into the sky. No one was injured and there were no reports of damaged property.The area affected by lava and ash is small compared to the Big Island, which is about 4,000 sq miles. Most of the island and the rest of the Hawaiian chain is unaffected. State and local officials have been reminding tourists that flights in and out of the entire state, including the Big Island, have not been affected. Even on the Big Island, most tourist activities are still available and businesses are open."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9f4473b8e154bb3a9bde5e504c26561efa6b172/0_151_4541_2724/master/4541.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5127ee7bd8754f9b5d731bcfae4c1275","title":"pope juan carlos cruz","story":"Juan Carlos Cruz, who was sexually abused, says pontiff told him God did not mind that he was gayA survivor of clerical sexual abuse has said Pope Francis told him that God had made him gay and loved him, in arguably the most strikingly accepting comments about homosexuality to be uttered by the leader of the Roman Catholic church.Juan Carlos Cruz, who spoke privately with the pope last week about the abuse he suffered at the hands of one of Chile’s most notorious paedophiles, said the issue of his sexuality had arisen because some of the Latin American country’s bishops had sought to depict him as a pervert as they accused him of lying about the abuse.“He told me, ‘Juan Carlos, that you are gay does not matter. God made you like this and loves you like this and I don’t care. The pope loves you like this. You have to be happy with who you are,’” Cruz told Spanish newspaper El País. Now 87, Fernando Karadima, the man who abused Cruz, was found guilty of abuse by the Vatican in 2011.Greg Burke, the Vatican’s chief spokesman, did not immediately respond to questions about whether Cruz’s statement accurately reflected his conversation with the pope.It is not the first time it has been suggested Francis has an open and tolerant attitude toward homosexuality, despite the Catholic church’s teaching that gay sex – and all sex outside of heterosexual marriage – is a sin. In July 2013, in response to a reporter’s question about the existence of an alleged “gay lobby” within the Vatican, Francis said: “Who am I to judge?”The new remarks appear to go much further in embracing homosexuality as a sexual orientation that is designed and bestowed by God. It suggests that Francis does not believe that iniduals choose to be gay or lesbian, as some religious conservatives argue.Austen Ivereigh, who has written a biography of the pope, said Francis had likely made similar comments in private in the past, when he served as a spiritual director to gay people in Buenos Aires, but that Cruz’s public discussion of his conversation with Francis represented the most “forceful” remarks on the subject since 2013.It did not, however, represent a shift in church teaching, Ivereigh said, since the church had never formally made any pronouncements on why iniduals were gay.Christopher Lamb, the Vatican correspondent for the Tablet, said the comments were remarkable and a sign of a shift in attitudes taking place. “It goes beyond ‘who am I to judge?’ to ‘you are loved by God,’” said Lamb. “I don’t think he has changed church teaching but he’s demonstrating an affirmation of gay Catholics, something that has been missing over the years in Rome.”The remarks come as several high profile members of the clergy have sought to publicly make inroads with gay Catholics, many of whom have felt shunned and unwelcome in the church and have been ostracised. Father James Martin, a Jesuit priest in New York who has nearly 200,000 Twitter followers, has led the outreach effort and was chosen last month to serve as a consultor to the Vatican’s secretariat for communications.Martin has argued in his book Building a Bridge that the onus is on the church to make LGBT Catholics feel welcome in the church and to stop discriminating against people based on their “sexual morality”.

Relations between Moscow and London are at their coolest since the cold war and the recent events in Salisbury even led to brief speculation (aided by Boris Johnson) that England could skip the tournament, recalling the Olympics boycotts of the 1980s.While inidual matches such as the United States and Iran’s face-off in 1998 were political lightning rods in their time, the host country has not faced such heated criticism perhaps since the 1978 World Cup in Argentina, held just two years after a right-wing military coup backed by the United States.Last week Human Rights Watch released a 44-page guide detailing repression and discrimination in Russia, targeted at the thousands of journalists expected to arrive in the country for the tournament.“Fifa still has time to show that it is ready to use its leverage with the Russian government to fulfil its own human rights policies,” Hugh Williamson of Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.Russia’s aspirations have changed since it was awarded the World Cup back in 2010. Then, it still appeared set on wooing the international community by holding prestige tournaments. Dmitry Medvedev was president and the reset in relations initiated by President Obama was still on track, with the goal of repairing relations after the war in Georgia. But even then, long before Salisbury, the war in Ukraine, laws against “gay propaganda” and hooligan violence in Marseilles, racist incidents in Russian football were a clear concern.Russian officials, as well as some players and journalists, insist that while the country has a problem with rightwing fans, the situation has been blown out of proportion by the press and is no worse than elsewhere in eastern Europe. The government says it has made advances in anti-racism monitoring at matches data from independent organisations appears to support that conclusion.But with monkey chants heard at three matches since March, the spotlight will remain on the hooligan culture, largely modelled on English fans, that has grown around post-Soviet football.A critical moment in that history came just four days after Russia was awarded the World Cup in 2010, when a Spartak Moscow fan named Egor Sviridov was killed by a rubber bullet during a brawl that pitted young, ethnically Russian football fans against youths from the country’s North Caucasus. The release of the suspected killer, Aslan Cherkesov, angered nationalists. Within days, thousands of football hooligans and far-right groups were rioting on Manezh square, beside the Kremlin, in nationalist-tinged protests that took nearly everyone by surprise.Vladimir Putin laid flowers at Sviridov’s grave later that month in what was interpreted as a sign of deference to nationalists. “It was one of the showcase events where everyone saw the numbers, the power the fans have, and the prevalence of the far-right ideology among the fans,” said Pavel Klymenko, who helps monitor instances of fan discrimination for the Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare) network. “There was a political importance too. Putin did not condemn them. He gave in to some of the xenophobic demands of the fans. His concern was for the fans not to turn against him.”The following years saw a number of ugly incidents. Several black players, including Emmanuel Frimpong and Christopher Samba, were punished by the Russian Football Union after reacting to racist slurs hurled by fans. Ultras in St Petersburg in 2012 released a manifesto demanding their team refuse to sign non-white and gay players. And CSKA Moscow were forced to play two games in an empty stadium after hooligans set off flares and unfurled racist banners during a Champions League fixture against Roma in 2014.The ban was “the point of no return” for Robert Ustian, a 34-year-old political analyst and CSKA fan, who founded a group called CSKA Fans Against Racism.The volunteer organisation seeks to change the club’s fan culture through better education and self-policing, and Ustian believes it has helped reduce racist behaviour at matches. He helps to organise monitoring of extremist slogans and banners, including swastikas, at matches. He has received threats, he said. Many other volunteers choose to remain anonymous. “Somebody has to stand up and raise his voice against this,” he said.Russian football has taken some important steps to combat racism, Klymenko said, including the appointment of the retired Chelsea and Fulham midfielder Alexei Smertin as a dedicated envoy against discrimination in Russian football, and improved monitoring at matches. In contrast, the government in 2013 passed new legislation outlawing “gay propaganda,” including gay pride parades or support groups for young people, which led to an upsurge in homophobic attacks. The new laws were a source of controversy before the 2014 Sochi Olympics and Klymenko said that homophobic language has been used at Russian football stadiums this season but little has been done to combat it. “Homosexuality is such a taboo in Russian society that nobody really dares to address it,” he said.Of criticism over race incidents, Igor Rabiner, one of the country’s best-known football writers said, “Sometimes it’s fair, sometimes it’s much exaggerated. Much work has been done to stop it, but you couldn’t eliminate it all. First, it takes time. Second, football just reflects what happens in society in general.”In a report in 2015, Fare and the anti-extremist Sova centre in Moscow documented 99 racist and far-right displays and 21 racially motivated attacks by fans during the 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons.In a report to be released this week, Klymenko said Fare will announce a reduced incidence of racist symbols at matches, continuing a trend over the past several years. He said incidents of recorded racist slogans, such as monkey chants, have risen, but that is likely due to the increased monitoring at matches.But incidents have still come at critical moments. In March, France’s Ousmane Dembélé, N’Golo Kanté and Paul Pogba were targeted with monkey chants during a friendly in St Petersburg. Fifa this month fined the Russian Football Union more than £22,000 for the incident.Klymenko said the audience for that match would likely reflect that for the World Cup. “The problem is that young people come and see the dominance of the far-right chants, and anyone who tries to challenge has a significant threat of violence,” he said. “They’re soaking in the culture around them.”At the Russian Cup final in Volgograd this month, officials said violent fan behaviour would not be tolerated. Andrey Bocharov, the region’s governor, said that “all measures necessary are being taken” to protect fans, including banning fans known for violent or racist behaviour from the stadiums.Most attention appears focused on preventing fan violence or a terrorist attack: during the match, streets and public transport were blocked off for kilometres around Volgograd’s stadium.Hanging out at the game were players from Germany’s under-18 squad. “They’ve all wanted to take pictures with us,” German defender Yann-Aurel Bisseck, who is black, said, adding that many Russians around town even recognised him. That had followed an emotional game against the Russian under-18 squad held around the anniversary of the Nazi surrender in 1945. “Our coaching staff told us ‘you’re not only here for football.’ We were very happy to represent Germany.”Meanwhile, fans of the clubs Avangard and Tosno streamed into the stadium. A Tosno fan named Andrey Rylkov told the Observer that concerns over monkey chants were overblown: “It’s just some of the guys having a bit of fun,” he said. “I know people where you are from tend to take everything seriously, it’s a different culture… but we don’t believe in political correctness like that here.” Andrew RothAndrew Roth is the Observer Russia correspondentWe should be used to the revolving biennial spectacle of the stadium-building binges that accompany global sporting events – Olympics, World Cup, Olympics, World Cup, with the Winter Olympics thrown in for added drama. With them come recurring stories: geometrically increasing budgets, the suspenseful fear that they won’t be finished on time, picturesque malfunctions, the endless promise of “legacy”. This time, we are promised, the event won’t bequeath rattling, crowd-starved behemoths. Almost always, it does. Russia, where several of the grounds will go on to serve lower-league clubs in small-ish cities, doesn’t seem likely to buck the trend.There tends in these sporting extravaganzas to be a scent of corruption ranging from the faint whiff of distant flatulence to the rank, ripe stench of sharing a Dutch oven with a bean-eating petomane. Russia, to no one’s surprise, is at the latter end of the scale: according to Transparency International the cost overruns of this year’s World Cup – twice the cost per spectator of Brazil in 2014 – are at a scale that can only be explained by corruption. To which sorry tales can be added the dark stories that Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022 have brought to prominence, of the use of near-slaves (from North Korea in Russia’s case) to build the stadiums.All of which might make the mere look of these structures seem secondary. But, given the money, energy, materials and labour that have gone into them, the fact that they will be landmarks in their cities for decades and that billions will see them on TV, it is not insignificant.There is a limited range of known ways of designing stadiums, as their basic shapes tend to be pushed towards uniformity by consistent and demanding parameters. There is the swooping roof, often hung on wires and masts, as in Frei Otto’s tent-like stadium for the 1972 Munich Olympics. There is the backlit cushion of the Allianz Arena, also in the Bavarian capital, home of Bayern Munich and TSV 1860 Munich and a venue for the 2006 World Cup. There is the stadium-that-looks-like-a-portable-object, of which Beijing’s 2008 “Bird’s Nest” is the best known.Russia 2018 is trying most of these approaches. The St Petersburg stadium, designed by the late Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa some time before Russia won its World Cup bid but which only opened last year after epic delays and cost overruns, goes for the mast-hung roof look. So in somewhat shrivelled form do the stadiums in Kaliningrad and Rostov. Kazan’s roof swoops but without wires. The Spartak Stadium in Moscow, completed in 2014, and the barely finished Mordovia Arena in Saransk are homages to the Allianz Arena, big cushions with variegated colours.The Fisht Stadium in Sochi, built for the 2014 Winter Olympics and repurposed for football, goes for the portable-object conceit: its architects Populous, the multi-national sports specialists who also designed the stadiums in Kazan, Rostov and Saransk, said it was inspired by a Fabergé egg. Volgograd, overlooked by the 85-metre high statue that commemorates the battle of Stalingrad, has a woven basket-like look with hints of the Bird’s Nest.Russia has its own contribution to the styling of stadiums, in the Soviet tradition of building tributes to the space age, flightless saucers at once cosmonautic and massive. The Cosmos Arena for the pleasant southern city of Samara bets heavily on this look – appropriately, arguably, as the city was once a centre of the Soviet space programme. At the same time, mixed metaphors being permissible in the world of iconic architecture, it is said to look like a flower.It is beyond the scope of this article to tour all 12 venues for the 2018 World Cup, so I may be missing something, but from a distance it doesn’t look like being a classic, architecturally speaking. There are no gamechangers, designs that future stadium builders can plunder for inspiration, such as the two Munich venues or Renzo Piano’s splendid Bari stadium for Italia 90 (which, it has to be said, never attained a capacity crowd until 2014).Rather we are offered weary lash-ups in which well-known themes are mixed with a further, oddly widespread, approach to stadium design – the cladding car crash, in which for no apparent reason disparate bits of surface, shape and truss are hurled together. Sochi is one of several venues with this collisional aesthetic. If you truly think it looks like a Fabergé egg then you have failed to notice something fundamental – exquisite craftsmanship, perhaps – about the original.The stadiums are mostly lumpy, their soaring ambitions grounded, some bearing too obviously the scars of budget cuts, the fabulous expenditure of the 2018 World Cup having gone to some other place than good architecture. The mottled surfaces of the Spartak and Mordovia grounds are more psoriatic than anything else. Nizhny Novgorod has a classic simplicity that puts it a cut above some others, but spoils it with a sort of giant whirlpool-patterned blue-and-white shower curtain behind its outer colonnade. This is “closely inspired,” it is alleged, “by elements from the Volga countryside”. Please.Samara, by the German practice GMP Architeken, is in its appearance the pick of the bunch. It is one of the most troubled in terms of delivery, but it has a mad kitschy oomph, which will inspire affection over time. The Ekaterinburg Arena provokes mixed feelings. Its plain bowl shape is handsome enough, but it deals extraordinarily clumsily (as did the Aquatic Centre at London 2012) with two temporary banks of seating, to be removed after the World Cup is over. It also struggles with the retained fragment of an older building incorporated into the new. The effect is weird but endearing.Almost always, after last-minute panics, the venues for these sporting extravaganzas are just about finished on time. Almost always they are both over budget and flawed in their legacy. Sometimes they throw up an architectural marvel to treasure in times to come. With the possible exceptio n of Samara the billions of the 2018 World Cup are not going to buy Russia’s cities such gems. Rowan MooreArchitecture critic, the ObserverMaria Alyokhina, 29, is a Moscow-based artist, political activist and member of punk provocateurs Pussy Riot. In 2012, she and two other members of Pussy Riot were arrested after a performance in Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Saviour and sentenced to two years in prison on a charge of “hooliganism motivated by religious hatred”. Since her release she has continued to agitate against the Putin administration, while the fame of Pussy Riot gave her a platform to perform around the world. A record of her experiences can be found in her book Riot Days (Allen Lane).Do you think the government sees the World Cup as an opportunity to present a better image of itself to the\u0026nbspworld?We were released two months before the end of our prison term because of the Sochi Olympics. Of course we went to Sochi, where the cossacks made their first appearance with whips, so I have no illusions about saving face or making a good impression for the west.You were arrested last month for protesting outside the Moscow headquarters of the FSB, the internal security services. What happened?The FSB blocked the messaging app Telegram in the Russian territory, because Telegram refused to give the keys for reading messages to the security services. We went with paper planes, which is the symbol of Telegram, and started throwing them at the building. We got arrested and spent 48 hours in the cage. For me that was quite frightening, because when you hear that it’s illegal to throw paper planes in your city it’s quite… strange.You have spent two years in prison and have suffered hardship. Has it affected your desire to protest at all?No.You mentioned that you were able to protest inside prison. Could you explain that?The Russian prison system is actually post-gulag, the feel of these prisons is the same. We have labour camps, all the prisoners are made to work and they are paid almost nothing, about $5 per month. There’s almost no medicine there, and conditions are really terrible. I went to court against the prison administration. It started a revolution, because they started to put up salaries, some prison guards were fired, and so on. For this world, it’s a big change. I believe that every gesture makes a change, a big change to the whole system.So protesting in Russia does have an effect, you think? Of course it does. For some people, it’s a question of their lives.What protest methods have you learned are effective?To not lose your sense of humour. In Russia, without it, something bad will happen. Actually how do you not make fun of a system that is afraid of paper planes?Is the Putin administration genuinely afraid of protesters like you?Well, if they repress people, put people in jail, start to call them enemies of the state, beat them, sometimes kill them – what does it mean? It means they’re afraid to lose their position, to lose their options to steal money till for ever.Are you optimistic about the future of Russia?The future is now. And now I’m not crying, so maybe it’s good.Interview by Killian Fox“It’s only going to get worse!” is the hashtag and rallying cry – snappy and monosyllabic in Russian – of Mediazona, an independent, crowdfunded news outlet in Moscow. Journalists in Russia are facing increasing violence, open and unpunished, and there are few legal safeguards for reporters. State censorship and intimidation, both physical and digital, is intensifying, while western IT giants are doing little to deter the bot and troll infestations targeting independent media outlets.Mediazona is a tiny outfit with a handful of reporters, which focuses on just one topic: Russia’s political trials and the manifold abuses inside its justice system. “There’s no public politics left in Russia, it’s just these criminal cases,” says its editor-in-chief Sergey Smirnov. Most of Mediazona’s content is just straight-up courtroom stenography: minutes of sessions where anti-fascists who have been tortured by security services to extract false confessions are denied bail or an independent media outlet is fined by the state regulator for embedding on its website a YouTube clip containing a single profane expression.In March 2016 a Mediazona reporter, with a team of other journalists, including two foreign ones, was attacked on the border between Chechnya and Ingushetia, two republics in the south of Russia with a long history of bloody insurgencies, counter-terrorism operations and oppression. Their bus was torched and they were beaten by unknown assailants. Some were badly injured. The investigation is stalling - there have been no arrests or even suspects in the case.Censorship and intimidation comes in many forms, such as denying access to conflict areas. It’s next to impossible, for example, for an independent journalist to report from Syria unless he or she is accredited with the ministry of defence, sequestered on the Russian military base in Hmeymim and writing glowing reports about the heroism of Russian servicemen or puff pieces about buckwheat porridge in the mess hall.Smirnov says western IT giants also play a role in censorship. Many independent outlets rely on YouTube as a platform for their video content, which gets swarmed immediately after posting with thousands of dislikes (disliked videos then sink down in ratings) and trolls in the comments. Activists and reporters have complained about this to Google, to little effect.“And it’s only going to get worse,” Smirnov concludes. Alexey KovalevAlexey Kovalev is managing editor of codastory, a non-profit news outletThere’s a club in Moscow called Petrovich, which was hugely popular when it opened in 1997, back when Russians were only too glad the Soviet Union was gone. According to the club’s website, it was inspired by “the ironic nostalgic feeling for the good old Soviet times” and, appropriately enough, it is Five minutes’ walk from the Lubyanka, the prison building where the KGB conducted mass interrogations and a post-Soviet celebration of all things USSR, from cartoons (depicted on the restaurant’s plates) and music (Buratino, the theme song from a 1976 children’s film) to food (dumplings) and drink (bad vodka), its nostalgia was close to sarcastic.When I went back this year it was exactly the same and yet entirely transformed. Because there was no longer any irony. Now the nostalgia is real: people want the good old Soviet times back. Men in nylon suits and women with gigantic hair were partying joyously like it really was 1983.A complicated form of nostalgia is now the driving force of the high Putin era – an attempt to reclaim the best bits of imperial Russia (strength, power and unity) and the Soviet Union (predictability and simplicity and the cheap, sweet shampanskoye that fuelled the post-Stalin era). The Battle for Berlin knock-off Lego sets are on sale in the Museum of the Great Patriotic War. Russia Today, the Kremlin-backed English language television network, is running a #Romanovs100 series (“4,000 photos, 4 social networks, 1 family”) to mark the centenary of the death of the Russian royal family. The popular standup comedian Igor Meerson bases his latest set around what it was like to learn English during the Soviet era, when you knew your teacher had never met a real foreigner and you would never be required to speak it. Fashion designers and influencers such as Ulyana Sergeenko (417k followers on Instagram) and Miroslava Duma (1.6m followers) are both known for looks that fuse Soviet retro and imperial luxury. Moscow’s restaurant du jour, White Rabbit, serves traditional dishes including baked beetroot, porridge and cabbage soup (on a set tasting menu for 9,500 roubles or £110).This was almost what the historian Svetlana Boym predicted in her 2001 book, The Future of Nostalgia: “reflective nostalgia” (contemplative and wistful, possibly cathartic) is replaced by “restorative nostalgia” (where others are blamed for having destroyed the homeland). What Russia is living through is somewhere between the two.One of the biggest obstacles Vladimir Putin (and any putative successor) faces is what to do with Russia’s feelings for her past. The presence of nostalgia – real, manufactured and a curious mix of both – is key to understanding contemporary Russian culture.The 100th anniversary of the Russian Revolution passed largely without comment last year. (As Russian friends joked to me, Russia hardly needed to mark it because Radio 4 did such an obsessively comprehensive job.) This is understandable: what do you say about a revolution, supposedly overturned but whose heirs are still in power? To examine the legacy of 1917 is necessary but torturous for Russia. People murmur about legacy, what happened in Germany and South Africa, about commissions for truth and reconciliation. But these things are not taken seriously in Russia.The criminal case into the royal family’s death, reopened in 2015 at the request of the church, is ongoing. Now officially known as “the royal martyrs”, the family were canonised in 2000. The British royal family has been invited to July’s processions in Ekaterinburg, to honour the memory of the tsar and his family. (Strangely, they don’t seem to have replied.) The “All-Russian pilgrimage route” to the Church on Blood in Ekaterinburg, built over the site of the house where the family was killed, has been reopened.You couldn’t make this up, especially as Putin is a lifelong KGB man and one-time card-carrying communist. But never mind all that. It is expedient for him to co-opt any feelings of longing towards empire. And it’s extremely useful to harness the 19th-century view of the tsar’s rule: God-given, unquestionable, unbreakable. 1917 is an inconvenient contradiction so we don’t talk about that. Instead we talk about how sad it was that the tsar’s family were shown no mercy in 1918.The funny thing is, not only is this project working well at home but it has become a cultural export. Angelina Jolie has bought the film rights to Simon Sebag Montefiore’s book about Catherine the Great (full name: Catherine Alexeievna Romanova). The team behind Mad Men is working on a lavish series on the Romanovs for Amazon, starring Christina Hendricks and John Slattery.Meanwhile Putin appears to be cultivating a sort of nostalgia for his own rule even while he is ruling. Last week he once again nominated Dmitry Medvedev as his prime minister, the continuation of a power relationship that has lasted almost 20 years. Medvedev is well known for his love of Deep Purple, Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, which are hugely evocative for Russians who were young in the 1960s and 1970s. But why change the soundtrack when it’s working so well for you? Viv GroskopViv Groskop’s The Anna Karenina Fix: Life Lessons from Russian Literature is out in paperback next month (Fig Tree, £9.99)Russia continues to be regarded as, in the words of a 16th-century English traveller, a “rude and barbarous kingdom”. Along with seductive honeytrap spies and hyper-violent “ultra” football fans, one of the concerns facing visitors to the World Cup has been the infamous Russian mafia. Here’s the irony, though: the close relationship between the Kremlin and crooks probably helps ensure the games will take place in completed stadiums, and in a calm, safe environment.One of the core themes of my new book, The Vory: Russia’s Super Mafia, has been the long, bloody embrace between Russia’s rulers and its gangsters, and especially the professional criminal subculture known as the vory, the “thieves”. This predated him, but it was under Stalin – who had organised bank robberies and even pirate raids when he was a revolutionary – that this alliance was truly consummated. Stalin relied on collaborators recruited from the vory to keep the millions of political prisoners and slave labourers in the gulag camps in line, creating a new generation of gangsters who realised that there was money, power and security in working with the state.After Stalin died and the gulags largely closed down, the vory found ample new opportunities helping an increasingly corrupt Communist party elite loot their own state. In the decade of near-anarchy that followed the collapse of the Soviet system in 1991, the criminals came out of the shadows. Instead of being the friends of officials, they increasingly became their paymasters, or even indistinguishable from them. The iding lines between crime, business and politics became increasingly, dangerously blurred.Sport played a central role in this. A generation of wrestlers, boxers and martial artists, once the darlings of the state, became the hired mafia muscle of choice. Some went further: a former wrestler turned racketeer, Otari Kvantrishvili, persuaded president Boris Yeltsin to grant his “Sports Academy” freedom from import and export taxes, for example. Instead of sports training, it became a smuggler’s front, selling hundreds of thousands of tonnes of Russian aluminium, cement and titanium abroad, tax free, to line Kvantrishvili’s pockets.When Vladimir Putin became president in 2000, he offered the vory a new social contract. He would not crack down on them, as they had feared – but only so long as they refrained from doing anything that looked like a direct challenge to the state, such as continuing the kind of indiscriminate street violence that had been such a fixture of the 1990s, or supporting the rebellious southern region of Chechnya. If they did, they would be treated as enemies of the state and suppressed accordingly. Realising that the state was back, the godfathers accepted Putin’s deal.So organised crime is alive and well, but house-trained. The state is the biggest gang in town, the biggest crooks are the officials and business tycoons plundering the assets of the country. The descendants of the vory survive by working once again in alliance with, even for, corrupt bureaucrats. The days when thugs and politicians openly socialised together – Kvantrishvili was famously once photographed watching a tennis match with Yeltsin – may be over, but the links are strong. Vory can be useful, whether beating up an impertinent investigative journalist here, or smuggling in scarce western luxury items there. It is their usefulness to the state and the elite that continues to earn them their freedom of manoeuvre.That usefulness has regularly to be demonstrated and reaffirmed, though. The 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics were a particular case in point. They were a bonanza for the gangsters. One, the Georgian-born godfather Aslan Usoyan, known as “Grandfather Hassan”, got in first even as the venue was being mooted in 2007. With open wallets and other threats, his henchmen snapped up land and hotels, knowing they would appreciate dramatically in value. The struggle to corner the market led to a spate of killings, with murders in Moscow and Sochi. Usoyan himself was killed in 2013, perhaps in part because of these disputes. But by the first day of the Games, all was quiet.After all, there was too much at stake. The Games cost an estimated $50bn, making them the most expensive on record. According to Transparency International, perhaps $15bn of that was embezzled. Of course, most was stolen by the oligarchs – typically from Putin’s inner circle of friends – granted the major construction and management contracts. Even so, the gangsters played their part, especially in subcontracted work such as providing labour-ganged workers for the construction, often in effect trafficked from Central Asia and forcibly returned once the job was done.But despite the last-minute building and occasional glitch, the Games were strikingly successful. The expected crime-related problems, from theft and prostitution to match fixing and illegal gambling, never materialised. In part this can be explained by the army of police and security officers deployed to what was, after all, a personal vanity project for President Putin. To a large degree, though, it reflected, the extent to which, precisely because of the importance of the event to the Kremlin, the godfathers themselves collaborated to make things go well.One middle-ranking police officer with whom I spoke afterwards admitted this. Of course, petty crooks flocked to “iron the firm” as Russian gangsters call fleecing foreigners. In his words, though: “The lads were under no illusions: if they crossed the line, then we police were the last thing they had to worry about.” So the pimps had to stay honest, the drug dealers sell smaller amounts, and of bona fide product. Pickpockets were warned off, and hotel staff advised not to take the opportunity to help themselves from guests’ luggage.The spectacle of using organised crime to control disorganised crime is not unique to Russia, but what is striking is the extent to which the gangsters are proactive. Instead of awaiting orders, they seek to predict and satisfy the whims of a powerful and often vindictive state.Which is why the gangsters are also eager to see the World Cup go smoothly. They have already made money on construction projects, and will make more catering to the less savoury tastes of the anticipated half million-plus foreign visitors. But this is another project regarded as essential to Russian soft power – when it needs all the good publicity it can get – and also close to the heart of a president consumed with his image and historic legacy.While there may not be that much the vory can do about racists and hooligans among the ultras – although there are certainly links with some of these fanaty gangs – it is already clear that once again the word is going out: the underworld powers expect everyone to be on their best behaviour.The underworld is facing internal tensions and challenges of its own. From tussles over control of heroin routes (almost a third of all drugs from Afghanistan now pass through Russia) to generational tensions as hungry young men impatiently await their chance at the top, these risk disrupting the status quo. The World Cup not only represents a test of the organisational capacities of “upperworld” Russia, it will also tell us how well the Kremlin is able to control its underworld, and the authority the existing godfathers can assert over their unruly minions.

Photograph: Steve Parsons - WPA PoolGetty ImagesA orced, self-made, self-declared feminist, biracial American woman, and a descendant of slaves, has married the son of the heir to the British throne, accompanied by a gospel choir and the trailblazing, improvised sermon of an African-American bishop. And in Windsor on Saturday, no-one batted an eyelid, other than the ones who had to blink away a surge of emotion when the choir broke into a rousing rendition of Ben E King’s Stand By Me.That such a thing is even conceivable shows how far the monarchy, and British society – which is not always quick to allow people to move on from their past – has come.The sense that the marriage of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, was elbowing the royal family into a new era was reflected in the make-up of the throngs gathered outside St George’s chapel on Saturday.The crowd was markedly more erse than might have been expected had he married from the pool of pale-skinned, public school educated Sloane types from which royal brides have traditionally been chosen.Several distinct tribes were in evidence: there were the families on a day out, slightly harassed parents issuing suncream and safety instructions to small children with painted faces and flags.They were equalled in number by the tribes of young, smartly-dressed, urban professionals congregating in couples and small groups on picnic blankets with wicker baskets, packed tight with ingredients for plastic jugs of Pimms, prawns salad and pesto and crackers.There were the professional royal watchers, of course, who often came in all-female groups, and were sometimes squeezed into the same bandage-style union jack dresses they wore for Kate and Will’s wedding, and wearing the same straw hats customised with fresh miniature flags.Some of them were here for Charles and Camilla too, and a handful were even in London for the wedding of Charles and Diana. For them, this was mostly about tradition, and a reflection of the fact that there isn’t likely to be another royal wedding this generation. Or so everyone hopes.But there were also large numbers of African Americans who had flown in from places like North Carolina, Ohio and California, the men in jackets and open necked shirts, and the women often dressed up with fascinators and heels, as though they were planning to observe from inside the chapel itself instead of the amidst the heat of the crowds on the Long Walk.Carolyn Miller from North Carolina said she booked flights practically “as soon as the ring went on her finger”.Canadians, too, had come in their droves, feeling a connection to Markle because the drama series for which she became known, Suits, was shot in Canada. Carole Porter, dressed in a blue lace dress with a matching fascinator said she was here for “the thrill of being at a royal wedding, and because it’s going to be the last one for a long time.”For the younger ones and the African Americans, the appeal was unquestionably the Meghan factor.Meghan Markle has, whether she likes it or not, come to stand for something much more than the woman with whom the affable Prince Harry happened to fall in love. “She is a symbol for the other side of America, a more progressive America,” Aaron Endré said, who had flown in from San Francisco with his friend Alex Conlan. Both were wearing long white gowns, wigs and long, curling fake lashes.Carole Porter said the royal family “will have to get used to her. She will have a voice, and they’re going to have to get used to hearing it.”As pictures emerged from inside the church onto the large screens set up along the Long Walk showing the Queen and Meghan Markle’s mother, Doria Ragland, sitting opposite one another, both wearing shades of lime green (Ragland’s the paler, of course), ripples of approval ran through the crowd outside. There was a cheer when the camera settled on Ragland, who sat alone looking proud, stoic, and at the same time, terribly solitary.The cheer might just have been a swell of affection for a mother-of-the-bride on her only daughter’s wedding day. But it might also have been a reflection of what a historic sight it was: there was the granddaughter of slaves, sitting opposite the Queen of the British empire, equal at least in the bond of affection they share for two young people in love.Three international students waiting at one of the food trucks spoke of their admiration for Markle’s independence and feminism, and the fact that she has worked hard for everything she has. “I love her,” Clarissa Fehr from Canada said, who met Markle once in Canada when she was filming Suits.“She’s not someone to conform. She’s strong. She’s got a voice and she’s not afraid to use it. And she’s normal, an everyday person marrying a prince. So that gives hope to the rest of us.”Many cited Meghan Markle’s decision to walk alone part of the way down the aisle, wearing a strikingly demure, snow white, dress designed by Briton Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy as a symbol of how she intends to remain her own person.They didn’t see Prince Charles joining her halfway along and accompanying her to the top of the altar so much as a sign of his acceptance her, so much as a symbol of her acceptance of the royal family.Sonny and Bernice Bryant, and Sonny’s twin sister Barbara Johnson, had flown in from Ohio for the wedding. “We never thought from the bottom of our hearts we’d have one of our own in the castle. It’s all changed now.” Bernice said.That point couldn’t have been made more empathically than when the voice of the Most Rev Michael Curry, the Chicago-born bishop of the Episcopal Church, came booming out across the manicured lawns of the Long Walk, speaking of the transformative power of love and the resilience of faith and slavery and even, to titters, sexual union.Inside the church, Zara Tindall - who always seems to enjoy a good laugh - was failing miserably to stifle her amusement, providing the internet with a rich new vein of instant memes. And even the terminally uptight Victoria Beckham broke into a rare half-smile.Outside, the crowd was, by turns, restless and entertained. “He has the floor and he’s going to make the most of it,” Jackie Torrance said, who had come from DorsetFor the more traditional royal watchers, the chief appeal was the Harry factor. Several people evoked memories of the solemn figure on the day of his mother’s funeral, all those years ago. The poor boy following that coffin, they said, over and over, on Saturday.Nicki Yucal, who was dressed up in union jack colours and sipping Pimms, said it was all about Harry for her. “He’s so normal. He’s the people’s prince,” she said.Her friend, Eillie Wood, got married on Diana’s funeral, and Yucal was her bridesmaid, and the sadness shot through her own celebration, so for them there was a sense of closure in seeing him so happy.Dawn Wilson, from Belfast, who camped out all night on the Long Walk to be here, agreed this wedding feels like a mending of the heartbreak. “We all remember that poor boy walking behind the coffin,” she said, echoing the words of many others.For African-American Bernice Byrant the memories of the small tragic figure walking miles to his mother’s funeral are strong too. When she saw William and Harry on the day, “I cried, I cried, I cried. I look at him now and I still want to do mom stuff for him. I’m glad to see him grow up and be so happy.”Will the union of Prince Harry -- who is, after all, only sixth in line to the throne -- and Meghan have a lasting effect on British society?In the end, probably not. If the snide viciousness of some of the tabloid coverage surrounding Markle’s father and wider family is anything to go by, it will take more than one sunny day and an anything-but-average royal wedding out to tackle deeply-held prejudices, particularly at a time when those prejudices are resurfacing globally, rather than receding.But still, by any measure, the house of Windsor has come a long way from when King Edward VIII was forced to abdicate so he could marry an American orcee, Wallis Simpson. Saturday might not herald an overnight revolution, but it could just be the start of a shifting off attitudes.Babs Davies, who is 81, was on the Mall for the wedding of Charles and Diana, and made sure she was there again on Saturday to see the dawn of a new chapter. Harry and Meghan, she said, “are a breath of fresh air.”For Carolyn Miller, Meghan Markle’s heritage and independence are equally important. “I like the fact there’s a little colour in the castle now. I think she’ll spice things up a bit.” \u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"royal wedding countdown pictures prince harry meghan markles","story":"The newly married Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, leave Windsor Castle after their wedding to attend an evening reception at Frogmore House, hosted by the Prince of Wales.The bride\u0027s evening dress is designed by Stella McCartney and is a bespoke lily white high neck gown made of silk crepe.Cougar kills mountain biker and wounds another in Washington statePrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s order of service: The significance behind the music and readingsPrince Harry thanked Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding dress designer: \u0026#39Oh my God, she looks absolutely stunning\u0026#39Emmanuel Macron sets his sights on a Riviera Camp David to stage summits with view of Mediterranean Inside the royal wedding evening reception: First dance, Meghan\u0026#39s speech and a chance for the newlyweds to let their hair downSir Elton John \u0026#39performs Circle of Life\u0026#39 for Meghan and Harry at royal wedding reception Royal wedding timelapse: spot the newlywed Duke and Duchess of SussexRev Michael Curry\u0026#39s royal wedding address for Harry and Meghan: the sermon in fullNicola Sturgeon pledges to \u0026#39restart\u0026#39 independence drive with SNP report that could ditch the poundMeet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s family: The diplomat uncle, the yoga teacher mother and the cannabis-growing nephewRoyal wedding facts and figures: From how many people are invited, to the cost of Windsor parkingFrench director Luc Besson under investigation over rape allegations by 27-year-old actressRemoving shoes when entering the house could help people stay slim, scientists claimMeghan Markle\u0026#39s mother Doria Ragland wells up inside St George\u0026#39s Chapel during royal weddingRoyal wedding A-list guests give glimpse of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s intimate Frogmore House reception on social mediaWho is Michael Curry, the royal wedding preacher who stole the show at the ceremony?View from the crowd: Duke and Duchess of Sussex greet their publicWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/19/TELEMMGLPICT000083172704_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqQbIAlMgBBjstqL9vckGElvMFj-EuNbG4eq8q_sIkiY4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"orphan bonded prince harry 2004 enjoys prime spot royal wedding","story":"Prince Harry with orphan Mutsu Potsane in 2004 An orphan who Prince Harry befriended on a gap year trip to Africa in 2004 was among the lucky onlookers given a prime spot within the grounds of Windsor Castle for the royal wedding.The Duke of Sussex, who married former TV actress Meghan Markle at a star-studded ceremony inside St George\u0027s Chapel, struck up an immediate bond with Relebohile “Mutsu” Potsane, then aged four, when volunteering at the Mants’ase Children’s Home for orphans in the African kingdom of Lesotho.Mutsu, now 18, was among ten representatives at the fairytale wedding from the charity Sentebale, the  reports, which the royal co-founded in 2006 to support the wellbeing of children and young people affected by HIV in Lesotho and Botswana.A total of 200 representatives from different charities closely associated with the Prince were among the 2,460 members of the public with a “golden ticket” to enjoy the celebrations inside the grounds of Windsor Castle “to feel part of the celebrations”.Charities including WellChild and the Invictus Games Foundation gathered in the Horseshoe Cloister to welcome arrivals and were among the first to congratulate the newlyweds as they left the chapel to huge applause.Harry\u0027s close friend Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, with whom he established the charity, said he hopes the new Duchess of Sussex will visit the landlocked country with her husband in the future.“I hope he will bring Meghan to Lesotho to see what he\u0027s been doing all these years,” he said. “And when he comes, he can have a feast.”He added: “The young Harry who first arrived in Lesotho in 2004 is now a grown man getting married.“I\u0027ve come here with all the wishes of Lesotho, I\u0027m not here on my own behalf I\u0027m here representing the entire nation who are so happy.”Royal wedding day pictures: Best photos from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#039s ceremony and receptionSentebale shared a photo of some of its members enjoying the celebrations, tweeting: “Congratulations to the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex, from everyone at Sentebale.

Every few years – the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011, the Diamond Jubilee and London Olympics in 2012, and now, the marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex – we receive extraordinary evidence of our country’s “soft” power.

However, the General stayed there just one sweltering night, never to return after reportedly being e-bombed by mosquitoes in a bed far too small for his towering frame.Many French leaders have stayed in the 17th-century edifice since. The beach at the fort de Brégançon in Bormes-les-Mimosas, southern FranceGeorges Pompidou was a regular, as was Valérie Giscard d’Estaing, who said he “tasted perfect happiness” there.But its fortunes waned under Mr Macron’s predecessor, François Hollande, who decided to ditch the fort and open it to the public as a national monument in 2014 after an unfortunate experience there.Shortly after taking power in 2012, he irked the French for relaxing in the sun at Brégançon for a full fortnight as unemployment hit a record 10.2 per cent, sending his popularity into a tailspin.François Hollande and Valérie Trierweiler on holiday in Bormes Les Mimosas, FranceTo make matters worse, his then companion Valérie Trierweiler caused a scandal by ordering 14 cushions for the fort at a cost to the public purse of €200 (£175) each. In his memoirs, out last month, Mr Hollande said that failing to come clean on the pillow expenditure was one of his main regrets.From then on, he spent free weekends at La Lanterne, a hunting lodge outside Versailles with a swimming pool that Nicolas Sarkozy, his predecessor, requisitioned from the prime minister for breaks with wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy.Then in a reported act of revenge against Mr Macron for betraying him and running for president, Mr Hollande extended Brégançon\u0027s lease as a public monument until late last year - thus preventing his successor from staying there.However, its fortunes are about to change once again after Mr Macron visited the fort last weekend with his wife Brigitte and their dog Nemo, and was said to have fallen under its charm, despite the dated 1970s upholstery.Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron visited fort Brégançon and have decided to turn it into a summit venue and holiday homeThe dining room in the Fort de Brégançon, which has been a presidential holiday retreat for decades but which Emmanuel Macron wants to use for diplomatic meetingsTo avoid remaining off duty in the long French summer months, the Elysée says he wants to take back control of the fort and turn it into a Riviera-style Camp David.“The president and his wife want to spend long weekends here and receive foreign heads of state. This safe retreat is well-suited for bilateral meetings or summits,” said an Elysée source.It has been used for political meetings on rare occasions. François Mitterrand, a rare visitor, received then German Chancellor Helmut Kohl for a weekend in 1985.To this end, Mr Macron has already signed off an initial €70,000 overhaul, including €50,000 to “renovate the kitchen in order to receive international guests”, according to Le Canard Enchaîné.In all, the Elysée will spend €150,000 maintaining the property, which has no swimming pool – forcing bathers out to the beach, giving paparazzi opportunities to take pictures of presidential couples in swimwear.The Macrons wouldn\u0027t be the first to be caught on camera in swimwear at the fort by offshore snappers.France\u0026#39s ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy visited the fort de Brégançon but later preferred her luxury retreat in neary Cap NègrePhotos of Mr Sarkozy and his pregnant wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy sunbathing on Bregançon’s private beach hit the glossy magazines in 2011. He later favoured his model-singer wife’s more luxurious villa at nearby Cap Negre.Ms Trierweiler famously sued the paparazzi in 2012 for taking pictures of her and Mr Hollande in swimsuits, reportedly because she said they made them both look “fat”.As for Jacques Chirac, he is said to have done away with the swimming trunks altogether in the days of a more pliant press.French paparazzi are said to possess never-published photos of the Gaullist ex-president checking out Formula One ace Michael Schumacher’s mega-yacht from the fort in nothing but a pair of binoculars.Please review our commenting policyInside the royal wedding evening reception: First dance, Meghan\u0026#39s speech and a chance for the newlyweds to let their hair downRoyal wedding guests moved to tears by Prince Charles speech about his \u0026#39darling old Harry\u0026#39Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding dress: Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy designs the royal bridal gown of the yearCougar kills mountain biker and wounds another in Washington statePrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s order of service: The significance behind the music and readingsPrince Harry thanked Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding dress designer: \u0026#39Oh my God, she looks absolutely stunning\u0026#39Inside the royal wedding evening reception: First dance, Meghan\u0026#39s speech and a chance for the newlyweds to let their hair downSir Elton John \u0026#39performs Circle of Life\u0026#39 for Meghan and Harry at royal wedding reception Royal wedding timelapse: spot the newlywed Duke and Duchess of SussexRev Michael Curry\u0026#39s royal wedding address for Harry and Meghan: the sermon in fullNicola Sturgeon pledges to \u0026#39restart\u0026#39 independence drive with SNP report that could ditch the poundMeet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s family: The diplomat uncle, the yoga teacher mother and the cannabis-growing nephewRoyal wedding facts and figures: From how many people are invited, to the cost of Windsor parkingFrench director Luc Besson under investigation over rape allegations by 27-year-old actressRemoving shoes when entering the house could help people stay slim, scientists claimMeghan Markle\u0026#39s mother Doria Ragland wells up inside St George\u0026#39s Chapel during royal weddingRoyal wedding A-list guests give glimpse of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s intimate Frogmore House reception on social mediaWho is Michael Curry, the royal wedding preacher who stole the show at the ceremony?View from the crowd: Duke and Duchess of Sussex greet their publicWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/20/TELEMMGLPICT000163972923_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"five years last election lost 35kg twins despair venezuela crumbles","story":"Tatsienlu and Lamski Perez, 52, struggle to pay for food amid Venezuela\u0026#39s economic implosionThe only mirror left in the home of twins Tatsienlu and Lamski Perez, 52, remains tucked away in a kitchen drawer, only to be used by visitors.

Markle\u0027s wedding dress designer for her role in making his bride look absolutely stunning, she has disclosed.Birmingham-born Clare Waight Keller - the first female Artistic Director at French fashion house Givenchy - revealed the new Duke of Sussex spoke to her after the ceremony in St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor, on Sunday.He came straight up to me and he said \u0027oh my God, thank you, she looks absolutely stunning\u0027, she said.So I think for the both of them, they were just radiant at that time, she said.The designer added: Well I think everybody saw on television - he was absolutely in awe, I think. She looked just incredible and it showed.Ms Waight Keller also revealed she was told by the Duchess in early January that she was the chosen designer.She said: It was an extraordinary moment when she told me. Of course it\u0027s an incredible thing to be part of such a historic moment.Ms Waight Keller said the process was collaborative, adding: I think she had very much seen my work and knew what I did.I think she loved the fact that I was a British designer, and working in a house such as Givenchy which has its roots in a very classical, beautiful style.Ms Waight Keller said over time they quickly got to a point where the Duchess felt she knew exactly what she wanted after various meetings and trials.This meant that the designer got to know her, and she said of the new Duchess of Sussex: She\u0027s exactly what you see on TV. She\u0027s just so genuine and warm and radiant. She\u0027s just glowing.She\u0027s a strong woman. She knows what she wants, and it was really an absolute joy working with her.Asked about the moment the Duchess was able to look at herself fully dressed and ready in the mirror on Saturday morning, Ms Waight Keller said: She was just glowing.There\u0027s so much emotion on a day like that anyway. But I think particularly when it all comes together, I think, is tremendous. She was absolutely radiant.Asked if there was any tears from the bride, she said: No, she was incredibly composed. It was really quite extraordinary. She\u0027s just the most beautiful person.Asked what the Duchess\u0027s mother, Doria Ragland, had thought of her daughter, Ms Waight Keller said: As she went into her car, her mother was already sitting in the car and you just could see there was so much love between them.Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleDuchess of SussexDuke of SussexPlease review our commenting policyInside the royal wedding evening reception: First dance, Meghan\u0026#39s speech and a chance for the newlyweds to let their hair downRoyal wedding guests moved to tears by Prince Charles speech about his \u0026#39darling old Harry\u0026#39Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding dress: Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy designs the royal bridal gown of the yearCougar kills mountain biker and wounds another in Washington statePrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s order of service: The significance behind the music and readingsEmmanuel Macron sets his sights on a Riviera Camp David to stage summits with view of Mediterranean Inside the royal wedding evening reception: First dance, Meghan\u0026#39s speech and a chance for the newlyweds to let their hair downSir Elton John \u0026#39performs Circle of Life\u0026#39 for Meghan and Harry at royal wedding reception Royal wedding timelapse: spot the newlywed Duke and Duchess of SussexRev Michael Curry\u0026#39s royal wedding address for Harry and Meghan: the sermon in fullNicola Sturgeon pledges to \u0026#39restart\u0026#39 independence drive with SNP report that could ditch the poundMeet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s family: The diplomat uncle, the yoga teacher mother and the cannabis-growing nephewRoyal wedding facts and figures: From how many people are invited, to the cost of Windsor parkingFrench director Luc Besson under investigation over rape allegations by 27-year-old actressRemoving shoes when entering the house could help people stay slim, scientists claimMeghan Markle\u0026#39s mother Doria Ragland wells up inside St George\u0026#39s Chapel during royal weddingRoyal wedding A-list guests give glimpse of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s intimate Frogmore House reception on social mediaWho is Michael Curry, the royal wedding preacher who stole the show at the ceremony?View from the crowd: Duke and Duchess of Sussex greet their publicWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"rev michael currys royal wedding address harry meghan sermon","story":"The Most Rev Bishop Michael Curry, who was celebrated for his rousing royal wedding speech for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, said it was a real joyful thing to bring ersity to the ceremony.Rev Curry, the first black presiding bishop and primate of the Episcopal Church, said: It was a real joyful thing because there was a sense in which you had the fullness of the church represented in many respects.He said the event had brought everybody together: That happened today, in different ways, different songs, different perspectives, different worlds and all of it came together and gave God thanks.The speech was a lengthy one, with Mr Curry appearing to tell himself to bring it to a close towards the end.Asked whether it was planned or off-the-cuff, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, interjected, saying: Let\u0027s have an honest answer!It was planned and I thought it was going to be six minutes, Mr Curry said. It was a little longer than that because there were pauses in there, he added to laughter from Mr Welby.And now in the name of our loving, liberating and life-giving God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Amen.From the Song of Solomon, in the Bible:Set me as a seal upon your heart,as a seal upon your armfor love is strong as death,passion fierce as the grave.Its flashes are flashes of fire,neither can floods drown it.The late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr once said, and I quote: We must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love. And when we discover that, we will be able to make of this old world a new world, for love is the only way.There\u0027s power in love. Don\u0027t underestimate it. Don\u0027t even over-sentimentalize it. There\u0027s power - power in love. If you don\u0027t believe me, think about a time when you first fell in love. The whole world seemed to center around you and your beloved.Oh there\u0027s power - power in love. Not just in its romantic forms, but any form, any shape of love. There\u0027s a certain sense in which when you are loved, and you know it, when someone cares for you, and you know it, when you love and you show it - it actually feels right. There\u0027s something right about it.Who is Michael Curry, the royal wedding preacher who stole the show at the ceremony?How African-American bishop Michael Curry personified a very modern royal weddingAnd there\u0027s a reason for it. The reason has to do with the source. We were made by a power of love, and our lives were meant - and are meant - to be lived in that love. That\u0027s why we are here.Ultimately, the source of love is God himself: the source of all of our lives.There\u0027s an old medieval poem that says: Where true love is found, God himself is there.The New Testament says it this way: Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God, and those who love are born of God and know God. Those who do not love do not know God. Why? For God is love.There\u0027s power in love. There\u0027s power in love to help and heal when nothing else can.There\u0027s power in love to lift up and liberate when nothing else will. There\u0027s power in love to show us the way to live.Set me as a seal on your heart, a seal on your arm, for love is as strong as death.Our picture editors\u0026#039 22 favourite images of the Royal weddingBut love is not only about a young couple. Now the power of love is demonstrated by the fact that we\u0027re all here. Two young people fell in love, and we all showed up. But it\u0027s not just for and about a young couple, who we rejoice with. It\u0027s more than that.Jesus of Nazareth on one occasion was asked by a lawyer to sum up the essence of the teachings of Moses, and he went back and he reached back into the Hebrew scriptures, to Deuteronomy and Leviticus, and Jesus said: You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind and all your strength. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself.And then in Matthew\u0027s version, he added, he said: On these two, love of God and love of neighbor, hang all the law, all the prophets, everything that Moses wrote, everything in the holy prophets, everything in the scriptures, everything that God has been trying to tell the world - love God, love your neighbors, and while you\u0027re at it, love yourself.Now, someone once said that Jesus began the most revolutionary movement in all of human history. A movement grounded in the unconditional love of God for the world and a movement mandating people to live that love. And in so doing to change not only their lives but the very life of the world itself.The Most Rev Bishop Michael Curry, primate of the Episcopal Church, giving his addressI\u0027m talking about some power. Real power. Power to change the world. If you don\u0027t believe me, well, there were some old slaves in America\u0027s Antebellum South who explained the dynamic power of love and why it has the power to transform. They explained it this way. They sang a spiritual, even in the midst of their captivity. It\u0027s one that says There\u0027s a balm in Gilead... a healing balm, something that can make things right.There is a balm in Gilead to make the wounded whole.There is a balm in GileadTo heal the sin sick soul.And one of the stanzas actually explains why. They said:If you cannot preach like Peter,And you cannot pray like Paul,You just tell the love of Jesus,How he died to save us all.Oh, that\u0027s the balm in Gilead! This way of love, it is the way of life. They got it. He died to save us all. He didn\u0027t die for anything he could get out of it. Jesus did not get an honorary doctorate for dying. He wasn\u0027t getting anything out of it. He gave up his life, he sacrificed his life, for the good of others, for the good of the other, for the wellbeing of the world, for us.That\u0027s what love is. Love is not selfish and self-centered. Love can be sacrificial, and in so doing, becomes redemptive. And that way of unselfish, sacrificial, redemptive love changes lives, and it can change this world.If you don\u0027t believe me, just stop and imagine. Think and imagine a world where love is the way.Imagine our homes and families where love is the way.Imagine our neighborhoods and communities where love is the way.Imagine our governments and nations where love is the way.Imagine business and commerce where this love is the way.Imagine this tired old world where love is the way.When love is the way - unselfish, sacrificial, redemptive.When love is the way, then no child will go to bed hungry in this world ever again.When love is the way, we will let justice roll down like a mighty stream and righteousness like an ever-flowing brook.When love is the way, poverty will become history.When love is the way, the earth will be a sanctuary.When love is the way, we will lay down our swords and shields, down by the riverside, to study war no more.When love is the way, there\u0027s plenty good room - plenty good room - for all of God\u0027s children. Because when love is the way, we actually treat each other, well... like we are actually family.When love is the way, we know that God is the source of us all, and we are brothers and sisters, children of God.My brothers and sisters, that\u0027s a new heaven, a new earth, a new world, a new human family.And let me tell you something, old Solomon was right in the Old Testament: that\u0027s fire.Royal wedding day pictures: Best photos from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#039s ceremony and receptionPierre Teilhard de Chardin - and with this I will sit down, we gotta get y\u0027all married - French Jesuit Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was arguably one of the great minds, great spirits of the 20th century. Jesuit, Roman Catholic priest, scientist, a scholar, a mystic.In some of his writings, he said, from his scientific background as well as his theological one, in some of his writings he said - as others have - that the discovery, or invention, or harnessing of fire was one of the great scientific and technological discoveries in all of human history.Fire to a great extent made human civilization possible. Fire made it possible to cook food and to provide sanitary ways of eating, which reduced the spread of disease in its time.Fire made it possible to heat warm environments and thereby made human migration around the world a possibility, even into colder climates.Fire made it possible... there was no Bronze Age without fire, no Iron Age without fire, no Industrial Revolution without fire. The advances of fire and technology are greatly dependent on the human ability and capacity to take fire and use it for human good.Anybody get here in a car today? An automobile? Nod your heads if you did - I know there were some carriages. But those of us who came in cars, fire - controlled, harnessed fire - made that possible.I know that the Bible says, and I believe it, that Jesus walked on the water. But I have to tell you, I did not walk across the Atlantic Ocean to get here.Controlled fire in that plane got me here. Fire makes it possible for us to text and tweet and email and Instagram and Facebook and socially be dysfunctional with each other.Fire made all of that possible, and de Chardin said fire was one of the greatest discoveries in all of human history. And he then went on to say that if humanity ever harnesses the energy of fire again, if humanity ever captures the energy of love - it will be the second time in the history of the world that we have discovered fire.Dr. King was right: we must discover love - the redemptive power of love. And when we do that, we will make of this old world, a new world.My brother, my sister, God love you, God bless you, and may God hold us all in those almighty hands of love. Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarklePlease review our commenting policyRoyal wedding latest news: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle start married life after evening reception - liveInside the royal wedding evening reception: First dance, Meghan\u0026#39s speech and a chance for the newlyweds to let their hair downRoyal wedding guests moved to tears by Prince Charles speech about his \u0026#39darling old Harry\u0026#39Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding dress: Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy designs the royal bridal gown of the yearCougar kills mountain biker and wounds another in Washington statePrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s order of service: The significance behind the music and readingsPrince Harry thanked Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding dress designer: \u0026#39Oh my God, she looks absolutely stunning\u0026#39Emmanuel Macron sets his sights on a Riviera Camp David to stage summits with view of Mediterranean Inside the royal wedding evening reception: First dance, Meghan\u0026#39s speech and a chance for the newlyweds to let their hair downSir Elton John \u0026#39performs Circle of Life\u0026#39 for Meghan and Harry at royal wedding reception Royal wedding timelapse: spot the newlywed Duke and Duchess of SussexNicola Sturgeon pledges to \u0026#39restart\u0026#39 independence drive with SNP report that could ditch the poundMeet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s family: The diplomat uncle, the yoga teacher mother and the cannabis-growing nephewRoyal wedding facts and figures: From how many people are invited, to the cost of Windsor parkingFrench director Luc Besson under investigation over rape allegations by 27-year-old actressRemoving shoes when entering the house could help people stay slim, scientists claimMeghan Markle\u0026#39s mother Doria Ragland wells up inside St George\u0026#39s Chapel during royal weddingRoyal wedding A-list guests give glimpse of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s intimate Frogmore House reception on social mediaWho is Michael Curry, the royal wedding preacher who stole the show at the ceremony?View from the crowd: Duke and Duchess of Sussex greet their publicWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/20/TELEMMGLPICT000164133342_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqeo_i_u9APj8RuoebjoAHt0k9u7HhRJvuo-ZLenGRumA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"royal wedding a list guests give glimpse prince harry meghan","story":"Celebrity friends of the Duke and Duchess posting pictures of the outfits at the intimate Frogmore House receptionCelebrity friends of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle shared glimpses on social media of the intimate second reception for the couple following the Royal wedding.A select 200 close friends were invited to the evening party at Frogmore House following the main reception at Windsor Castle, which was attended by the 600 guests who were also at the St George’s Chapel ceremony.The smaller reception was billed as a private affair and a chance for the selected guests to relax and celebrate with the happy couple.Frogmore House, a 17th century English country house, stands in the home park of Windsor Castle and is part of the Crown Estate.

So I think for the both of them, they were just radiant at that time, she said.The designer added: Well I think everybody saw on television - he was absolutely in awe, I think. She looked just incredible and it showed.She revealed she was told by the Duchess in early January that she was the chosen designer.She said: It was an extraordinary moment when she told me. Of course it\u0027s an incredible thing to be part of such a historic moment.Ms Waight Keller said the process was collaborative, adding: I think she had very much seen my work and knew what I did.I think she loved the fact that I was a British designer, and working in a house such as Givenchy which has its roots in a very classical, beautiful style.Ms Waight Keller said over time they quickly got to a point where the Duchess felt she knew exactly what she wanted after various meetings and trials.This meant that the designer got to know her, and she said of the new Duchess of Sussex: She\u0027s exactly what you see on TV. She\u0027s just so genuine and warm and radiant. She\u0027s just glowing.She\u0027s a strong woman. She knows what she wants, and it was really an absolute joy working with her.Asked about the moment the Duchess was able to look at herself fully dressed and ready in the mirror on Saturday morning, Ms Waight Keller said: She was just glowing.There\u0027s so much emotion on a day like that anyway. But I think particularly when it all comes together, I think, is tremendous. She was absolutely radiant.Asked if there was any tears from the bride, she said: No, she was incredibly composed. It was really quite extraordinary. She\u0027s just the most beautiful person.Asked what the Duchess\u0027s mother, Doria Ragland, had thought of her daughter, Ms Waight Keller said: As she went into her car, her mother was already sitting in the car and you just could see there was so much love between them.The Queen was later seen being driven back to Windsor Castle soon after the service at the Royal Chapel of All Saints in Windsor Great Park.As a few Windsor Farm shop regulars watched, her Range Rover swept into a side entrance onto the castle estate.The Queen is driven into Windsor Castle after a Sunday trip to churchThere has still been no sight yet today of the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex who are expected to leave Windsor Castle, where they stayed overnight. They are due to travel home to Nottingham Cottage, in the grounds of Kensington Palace.The Duchess of Sussex was a calm and chatty bride with no signs of nerves on her wedding morning, according to her hair stylist.Serge Normant said it was dreamy to work with the Duchess, creating a bun that was messy in a controlled way.The Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s hair was styled into a bun that was \u0026#39messy in a controlled way\u0026#39Describing her demeanour on Saturday morning, he said: She was calm, yeah. Chatty, absolutely. We were definitely having exchanges, yeah for sure.She was very happy. It was a beautiful morning, just the perfect morning to get married.Asked if she had shown any signs of nerves the Paris-born hairdresser said: No, I don\u0027t think so, she was just very happy, very happy, very excited.Mr Normant, who flew from his New York base especially to style the Duchess\u0027s hair, said he had spoken to the newly-married couple after the wedding, describing Meghan as thrilled and Harry as fantastic.He said: She was thrilled, yeah she was very happy.On Harry, he added: He\u0027s Prince Harry, he\u0027s fantastic.

The couple spent their honeymoon at Broadlands House in Hampshire – although that would be no guarantee of favourable weather. Kensington Palace said the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex will continue to live in Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of the palace, but they are also reported to be moving to a bigger apartment.They have been been living in the cottage since their engagement in November 2017.Reportedly referred to as Notts Cotts, the property - only yards from the Duke\u0027s childhood home within Kensington Palace itself, has been a base for both the Duke and his brother, Prince William, over the past decade.  As the previous occupants, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge spent two and a half years at the cottage after their royal wedding in 2011, before moving to a permanent apartment inside Kensington Palace to accommodate their growing family. Harry moved into Nottingham Cottage shortly after. An aerial view of Kensington PalaceIt is the smallest of Kensington Palace\u0027s multiple residences, residing in a part of the grounds that once housed important members of staff. There are two rooms and a private garden. In the long term, the Duke and Duchess are expected to vacate Nottingham Cottage for a 21-room Kensington Palace apartment, adjacent to that of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.The apartment\u0027s roof and windows have recently been refurbished, while the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester moved out of it last November - giving legs to rumours the newlyweds will move there.As neighbours, the royal brothers could inhabit what was once a single suite of apartments at Kensington Palace, before it was split in two in the 1950s. The apartments are even suspected to share a secret door.The royal brothers will remain as neighbours at Kensington PalaceInitially however, the new Duke will have a cousin for a neighbour: Princess Eugenie and her fiancé Jack Brooksbank recently took-up residence at Ivy Cottage after announcing their engagement in January this year.That wedding will also take place at St George\u0027s Chapel, in Windsor, on October 12.Among the 200 guests invited to the evening reception at Frogmore House were senior members of the Royal family. The Duke of York was pictured driving his daughters to the event, as was Prince Edward.

He writes: The Corporation’s anchors were Kirsty Young (a reassuring voice as ever) and Dermot O’Leary (was he on the wrong channel?). This unlikely pair tag-teamed with Huw Edwards (solid, dependable, a bit boring), who appeared to have been on a pre-wedding diet. Sitting side-on to the camera for some strange reason, the newly svelte Welshman couldn’t quite get his autocue-reading right and kept glancing off-screen as if distracted by something more interesting.ITV\u0027s audience peaked with 3.6 million viewers, at a different time to BBC One - just after 2pm.On ITV, coverage - which was fronted by Phillip Schofield and Julie Etchingham - averaged 2.5 million viewers and a 18.6 per cent share between 9.25am and 3pm.The five-minute audience peak on BBC One is the biggest across all channels this year, the broadcaster said. On BBC One, the FA Cup final averaged 6.7 million viewers and peaked at 8.7 million.Click here to read what Michael Hogan thought about the rest of the TV coverage.Away from the star-studded evening reception, thousands of people who travelled to Windsor yesterday stayed in the town to continue celebrating in the evening.

Speeches, including from Meghan herself, were also expected at the evening reception where the couple were to take their first dance.Leaving for the evening reception earlier in the evening Prince Harry proved he was the perfect gentleman as he opened the door of a vintage car to let his bride step in.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex in a classic E-Type Jaguar heading off to their wedding receptionMs Markle wore a sleek Stella McCartney dress with a halter neck, showing off her shoulders and back with her hair up in a chic bun.The dress was described as a “bespoke lily white high neck gown made of silk crepe”, with satin shoes from Aquazurra with soles painted in baby blue: her “something blue”.Her hair had been styled by George Northwood especially for the more relaxed evening. The couple travelled from Windsor Castle to Frogmore House in a silver blue Jaguar E-Type Concept Zero. The number plate was E19 05 18, marking their wedding date. This vehicle was originally manufactured in 1968, and has since been converted to electric power, suiting the couple’s

america","story":"With sickness on the rise, soaring inflation and an infrastructure on the brink of collapse\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspthe socialist nation is at risk of becoming a failed stateVenezuela’s autocratic president, Nicolas Maduro, is widely expected to win another term in elections Sunday. But he soon could face a far bigger test – maintaining his grip on a country that is fast becoming a failed state.Since Maduro took over from Hugo Chavez – his mentor, who died in 2013 – Venezuela’s crisis has steadily intensified as a result of lower oil prices, corruption and a socialist system plagued with mismanagement. But as Maduro has sought to further consolidate power in the past 12 months, the economy, public services, security and health care have all but collapsed. Armed gangs and Colombian guerrilla groups are operating unchecked on Venezuela’s borders. Pro-government militias are terrorising urban areas, while police stand accused of extrajudicial killings. Four of the 10 most dangerous cities in the world are now in Venezuela, according to a 2017 study by the Igarape Institute, a Brazilian think tank that studies violence.Venezuela halts air and sea traffic with three neighbouring countriesHundreds if not thousands of members of the armed forces are deserting, in part due to meagre rations, according to military analysts.Power and water grids and the transportation systems are breaking down. In just the first three months of the year, Venezuela suffered over 7,000 blackouts.Saddled with a soaring inflation rate that has put food out of reach, weakened and thin Venezuelans are falling ill. Doctors say cases of diseases once thought largely eradicated – malaria, diphtheria, measles and tuberculosis – are not only resurfacing but surging. A child stands in front of water containers in Guarenas, VenezuelaIn a nation that lives off oil, production is collapsing as plants break down and the bankrupt government cannot fix equipment. Venezuela’s unpaid creditors are beginning to tighten the financial noose, moving to attach the country’s offshore assets. At the state oil giant, 25,000 workers – more than a quarter of its staff – quit last year in a mass exodus. Fleeing workers are joining a flood of humanity, at least 5,000 people a day, exiting the country. The outflow has left schools without teachers, hospitals without doctors and nurses, and utilities without electricians and engineers. “A failed state is one that cannot meet the most basic functions of government,” says Jean Paul Leidenz, an economist at Ecoanalitica, a Caracas-based analytical firm. Leidenz continues: “Venezuela now certainly has that characteristic.” Buses have become scarce along a Guarenas roadDuring a campaign stop in the eastern Guayana City on Wednesday, Maduro conceded his government “had made mistakes”. But he blamed the country’s crisis mostly on outside forces and domestic enemies and proclaimed the nation’s socialist revolution would see Venezuela through to better days.“Thanks to the social system created by the revolution, the people are protected and prepared,” he says. “We have a lot more to do, and that’s why we need victory.”In her cement block home in eastern Caracas, Zulay Perez, 63, walked into her kitchen and turned on the tap. “See? Nothing,” she says. “No water. No water at all.”For Venezuelans like Perez – the wife of a factory worker – life was never easy. But in the past, she says, the couple would get running water at least a few days each month. This year, they have had water once – and even then for just a few hours. The shortages have spread in 2018, reaching into middle-class and wealthy neighbourhoods, prompting hundreds of spontaneous, if small, protests.Venezuela\u0027s Maduro bids to be new ‘Christ of the poor’ with help from ‘Hand of God’Venezuela\u0027s Maduro bids to be new ‘Christ of the poor’ with help from ‘Hand of God’Argentina\u0027s football legend Diego Maradona takes part in the closing rally of the electoral campaign of Venezuelan acting President Acting Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro greeting his supporters during his campaign closing act in Cabimas, VenezuelaVenezuela\u0027s opposition leader and presidential candidate Henrique Capriles speaks to supporters during a campaign rally in Caracas Supporters of Henrique Capriles RandonskiSupporters of opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles cheer during a campaign rally in Merida, VenezuelaSupporters of  Venezuelan acting President and presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro wear a moustache during his closing campaign rally in CaracasVenezuela\u0027s acting President Nicolas Maduro holds his grandson as he stands with his family on stageSupporters of Venezuelan opposition candidate for  president, Henrique Capriles Radonski, cheer during his campaign closing act in BarquisimetoA portrait of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is held by a supporter of  Venezuelan acting President and presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro during his closing campaign rally in CaracasVenezuela\u0027s acting President Nicolas Maduro greets supporters holding Cuba\u0027s and Venezula\u0027s flags with during his closing campaign rally in Caracas, VenezuelaVenezuela\u0027s opposition candidate, Henrique Capriles, holds a dove as a sign of peace during a campaign rally in BarquisimetoAn Henrique Capriles\u0027 supporter holds a dove besides a photo of the candidate during a campaign rally in BarquisimetoSupporters hold a toddler wearing a Maduro-style mustache at the closing campaign rally for Venezuela\u0027s acting President Nicolas Maduro Supporters of opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles cheer for him at his closing campaign rally in BarquisimetoA supporter of Venezuelan opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski attends a campaign rally in CaracasVenezuela\u0027s opposition leader and presidential candidate Henrique Capriles greets supporters during a campaign rally Supporters of Venezuela\u0027s ruling party presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro, one dressed as Fidel Castro and the other as Cuban revolutionary hero Ernesto \u0027Che\u0027 Guevara, stand on a bus before the start of Maduro\u0027s closing campaign rally in Caracas, VenezuelaA sign poking fun of ruling party presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro is seen during an opposition campaign rallyA supporter of Venezuelan opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski shows a poster that reads \u0027my mom wants to be your mother-in-law\u0027The government blames a drought, as well as electricity outages partly attributed to sabotage by opposition activists. But community groups say the cause of the damage is more systematic – a combination of corruption, the flight of specialised workers from the country and the difficulty of buying imported spare parts in a nation were the currency is so worthless that you could wallpaper a building with money notes for less than the cost of paint.In past years, Perez says, water would run frequently enough to fill up the big blue tanks the couple keep in a corner. Now she goes outside, to a gutter where stray dogs defecate, to collect water that she boils and uses for cleaning. For drinking and bathing, her husband carries empty bottles to the home of her sister, who has larger cisterns and has been somewhat more fortunate with service.The road to Caracas – where cargo trucks have become a novel way of travelThe water crisis is one symptom of the failing state around her. Another is the lack of food. Perez’s daughter, a public school teacher, collected back wages last week. The family used the money to buy a rare treat – a dozen eggs. Skyrocketing inflation means they cost 480,000 bolivares – the equivalent of nearly one week of her husband’s salary. Perez, nearly emaciated, has lost 17 pounds in the past year.“I feel hopeless,” she says, adding that she fears the government will ensure a Maduro victory on election day, no matter what voters do. “We want change, but I don’t think we’ll get it.”Inside Caracas University Hospital – one of the capital’s largest – the first thing that hits you is the smell.“We’ve had no water for two weeks, and it just came back today,” says a 29-year-old doctor who guided two journalists through its dim halls. The doctor spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals, since the hospital’s administration is pro-government. “For a while,” she says, “some toilets couldn’t be flushed.” Medical shortages have gripped Venezuelan for several years. But things have markedly worsened over the past few months as water and power have become more intermittent. Three weeks ago, the electricity went out for a whole weekend, with generators able to power only the emergency ward, surgery rooms and the intensive care unit.As Venezuela has rocketed into hyperinflation, drugs and supplies – almost all of them imported – are increasingly unaffordable.Malaria was once rare here. Now the hospital is receiving almost 40 infected patients a day. The worst cases end up in the infectious disease ward, which on the recent visit was loaded with patients suffering from preventable or treatable illnesses that have run amok in a weakened population.Lethargic measles patients filled a room marked “isolation”. There was a round hole in the door from a missing knob, allowing the air inside to easily filter into a hallway. The corridors echoed with the coughs of skeletal HIV patients, some of whom are suffering complications from tuberculosis.A child carries a plastic container on the outskirts of CaracasThere will be fewer and fewer doctors to treat them. “A big part of our newly graduated medical students are leaving the country right away. I’d say 90 percent of them,” says Oscar Noya, a doctor who heads the hospital’s malaria department. On a recent afternoon, Leon Avila, a 54-year-old security guard, was waiting at a bus stop at the bottom of a hill in Guarenas, a slum 18 miles east of Caracas. To reach his home at the top, he would normally travel by public bus.But of the 25 buses that used to ply the route five years ago, all but two are out of commission because of a lack of affordable spare parts. In Venezuela these days, a single tyre can cost 100 times what a bus driver makes in a month. Even the two buses currently running are suffering from breakdowns – so frequent that residents have been forced into a relatively novel type of transit – cargo trucks, whose drivers charge them a fare.Zulay Perez has only had running water once in the past year“Travelling like cargo is now our day-to-day life,” Avila says.In Caracas, 70 per cent of the city’s 18,000 buses are not operating. The rest work only intermittently, says Hugo Ocando, a transportation union leader. Ten to 15 per cent have gone out of order this year alone, he continued. After a midsize cargo truck pulled up to Avila’s bus stop, he piled into the back with a mob of others. “Stop boarding people! We’re getting asphyxiated!”, someone shouted in the back.In moments, more than 30 people were crammed inside, holding on to ropes to keep from falling. Much of the cabin’s interior was dark. There were no windows, with the only light and air funnelling through the open back doors.“It’s like we’re animals,” Avila says. The mainstream opposition is boycotting Sunday’s vote, citing a lack of guarantees of a free and fair election. Maduro’s government has banned some key opposition figures from running, kept others behind bars and prompted at least one to seek asylum at the Chilean Embassy in Caracas. Maduro, 55, will still face two main challengers: Henri Falcon, a former governor, and Javier Bertucci, an evangelical pastor. But despite growing international pressure, including an escalating list of US sanctions, few here believe that Maduro is prepared to lose. The government was widely accused of fraud in an election last year for an all-powerful legislative body. Venezuela blocks opposition candidates from presidential electionVenezuela’s opposition refuses to recognise surprise win for MaduroEvidence of ‘crimes against humanity’ in Venezuela conflict, says UNYet with so many Venezuelans expected to skip the vote, Maduro may genuinely edge out his opponents Sunday. According to the Delphos polling firm, Maduro and Falcon are neck and neck among likely voters, with Maduro at 38 percent compared with Falcon at 37 percent. Bertucci is polling in third, with 20 percent support.Critics say some Venezuelans may vote for Maduro out of fear – of losing state jobs or government-subsidised food baskets. Maduro says they will vote for him out of national pride. “When you ask Donald Trump who’s going to win in Venezuela, even he says, ‘Maduro,’” the Venezuelan leader said at a rally last week. “And why are we going to win? Because we are the fatherland, of history, of dignity.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It came soon after we finally managed to taste the plumes coming out of Saturn\u0027s moon Enceladus, during the Cassini mission – which helped discover that the strange moon has the building blocks of life.While the discovery about Europa is brand new, the data used to do it was old. The plume itself might be ancient, and will help us to finally answer the questions that have been asked by humanity ever since we looked to the stars.

We might be able to find out what\u0027s going on in the ocean.We might find alien life on Jupiter\u0027s ocean moon, Nasa saysThe awareness that there might be a plume arrived gradually: first in pictures taken from the Hubble Space Telescope that appeared to suggest something strange was happening the moon, and then through further Hubble pictures that made that more clear. One of those later sets of images sent Jia and his team back to the data – which already been collected.The data actually comes from a spacecraft that set off in 1989, and was collected all the way back in 1997. But the new discovery was made when it was combined with a hunch and with brand new modelling techniques to actually make sense of it.We already had the data, we had a flyby over this region, he says, and the scientists resolved to look more carefully at the data we have.It worked. In fact, when we look at the dat more carefully – at the closest approach to the plume, we did detect strange changes which had not been explained before in the past, he says.So we looked at another data set, from around the time, which seem to indicate that during this interval the spacecraft is in a very different plasma environment. These two pieces of information immediately stood up – seeming to tell us that this minimal signal is being produced by a localised source, of particles.In scientific terms, the team had a very good hunch that something was going on. But they needed to prove it, so they used extensive computer modelling to work out whether the data lined up with what would be be expected if there were a plume – and it did, with what Jia calls stunning precision.That\u0027s why, thought the data is fairly old, the discovery could never have been made at the time.20 years ago, you might have had the idea that this was related to the plume, he says. But the models of the time wouldn\u0027t allow you to draw that conclusion – we\u0027d have to wait for better images from future missions.The Cassini mission to Enceladus – which Jia was not involved in – has already given scientists an understanding that they can bring to other plumes.The knowledge that has been developed on the Enceladus missions and the studies gives us a very good idea about, if you do have water plumes in space, how would that change the magnetic and the plasma environment?One of the central tragedies of the Cassini mission was that much of what it learnt about Enceladus made the case that this strange moon was worthy of much more study – but it only found that out as its mission was coming to a close. That is not the case with Europa. Both Nasa and the European Space Agency are gearing up to send missions to Jupiter and the system that orbits around it.The ESA hopes to send its Juice mission to Jupiter\u0027s moons in 2022 – and it will look at the other moons that are thought to have large oceans hiding beneath their surfaces, Ganymede and Callisto, as well as Europa. Nasa\u0027s Europa Clipper mission is being prepared for launch the same year.“If plumes exist, and we can directly sample what’s coming from the interior of Europa, then we can more easily get at whether Europa has the ingredients for life,” said Robert Pappalardo, Europa Clipper project scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “That’s what the mission is after. That’s the big picture.”  The two spacecraft they\u0027ll be very well prepared for sniffing the plume if they do: they will be carrying a whole host of instruments that will be perfect for coming to understand whether the strange world would have the ability to host alien life. They will also be carrying radars that can see down beneath the ice to help us learn more about where the plume is coming from – and also about the mysterious watery world that it is erupting up and out of.Habitable conditions require a certain balance of chemical elements: on Earth, life doesn\u0027t want it to be too acidic, too alkaline, though there are a range of conditions in which life could potentially exist, says Leigh Fletcher, senior research fellow in planetary science at the University of Leicester. The more favourable it is, the more likely it is they would be there.We\u0027ve already had a go at some of this, on Enceladus, where we were able to detect the so-called building blocks of life. Such a discovery doesn\u0027t prove there is aliens hiding in our own solar system, but it does suggest they could be.The time around, on Europa, we\u0027re going to get an even better look.The Cassini mission was able to characterise in exquisite detail what is happening on Enceladus, says Fletcher. I would say that has been our testing ground, with a spacecraft that was based on 1980s, 1990s technology.Now we know what we\u0027re looking for in the Europa environment. It\u0027s been a fantastically useful thing.All of the discoveries help to enliven our solar system, and represent an inspiring reason to keep exploring it. The question of alien life – but we have found already that they are living in an important sense, full of geological activity and energy.One wonders if we ever went out to Saturn and Neptune, with their icy moons, would we be able to see these plumes? Says Fletcher. These places are barely explored.It shows that this geophysical activity – this activity in a place where you would expect it to be dead – is happening, and things are changing, today.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We would give up our say over interest rate policy, exchange rate policy and inflation.“Scotland does not need, and the people of Scotland do not want, this tired argument again. The SNP should recognise that, and focus instead on jobs, schools and hospitals.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

His supporters successfully campaigned for social and political reform and against a corrupt and dysfunctional political establishment.It was the latest surprise in the career of a man who barely survived the murder of his father, the revered Shia religious leader Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr, and his two brothers, on the orders of Saddam Hussein in 1999.Four years later, after the US invasion of Iraq, he was in danger once again of being killed, this time by American forces who twice besieged him in the holy city of Najaf in 2004.Mr Sadr will be very much the kingmaker – though he will have no official position – in the formation of a new Iraqi government.His coalition, which includes the Iraqi Communist Party, independents and secularists as well as his religious followers, appealed strongly to Iraqis who feel that, with the war won against Isis, they need to rebuild their country.The Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi hoped to win the election – though no party was ever likely to win an absolute majority – by appealing to voters as the leader who recaptured Mosul from Isis last year.He followed this up with a largely bloodless reoccupation of Kirkuk, held by the Kurds since 2003, and the restoration of a large measure of government authority in Iraqi Kurdistan.The political movement formed out of the largely Shia paramilitaries, the Hashd al-Shaabi, which came second in the polls, had, like Mr Abadi, hoped to win more votes through their role in the war against Isis.Coalition led by nationalist cleric takes shock lead in Iraqi electionUS and Iran battle for influence in first post-Isis Iraq electionWomen brace for Iraq’s election after race marked by harassment What would Trump have done about Saddam Hussein? But the drop in violence to a level not seen since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein means that Iraqis are focusing on the theft by the political elite of hundreds of billions of dollars in oil revenues that should have been used to improve the supply of water, electricity, waste disposal as well medical care and education.Mr Sadr has been frequently underestimated as a political leader since he first emerged from house arrest in Najaf at the time of the US invasion.He was described by the western media as a ‘maverick’ or ‘firebrand cleric’, but his views were always more sophisticated and flexible than he was given credit for.The origin of Mr Sadr’s influence was his family’s role as religious leaders and the martyrdom of many of them, beginning with the execution of Mohammed Baqr al-Sadr in 1980.His father led a movement that appealed to the Shia poor of Baghdad and southern Iraq, combining religious revivalism with social and political radicalism. From the start, Sadrism had a strong element of Iraqi nationalism in opposition to all foreign interference in Iraq, be it American, British or Iranian.‘The near future of Iraq is dark’: Warning from Muqtada al-Sadr -In an interview with The Independent in Najaf in 2013 – the first he had given face to face to a Western journalist for 10 years – Mr Sadr spoke graphically of the ill effects of Iraq inviting in different foreign powers to try to solve its problems. He compared this to “somebody who found a mouse in his house, then he kept a cat, then he wanted to get the cat out of the house so he kept a dog, then to get the dog out of his house he bought an elephant, so he bought a mouse”,Mr Sadr created the Shia paramilitary Mehdi Army to resist the Americans. He was later to stand this down during the Sunni-Shia sectarian mass killings of 2006-7, saying that it had been infiltrated by people not under his control.He was denounced by the US as a pro-Iranian proxy, but he has made clear over the years that he opposes Iranian interference as well as that of other countries.The Sadrist success in the election this month will be unwelcome in both Washington and Tehran.The US had done everything it could to back Mr Abadi as a victorious war leader and a sort of Iraqi Winston Churchill – forgetting, perhaps, that Churchill lost the British general election in 1945.Mr Sadr’s influence over an incoming government in Baghdad puts in doubt the future of the 10,000 American troops and military contractors in Iraq, though a Sadrist spokesman said after the election that US training and the weapons procurement from the US could continue.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSanta Fe High School student Dakota Shrader is comforted by her mother Susan Davidson following a shooting at the school in Texas.

The day marks the killing of six Arab Israelis during 1976 demonstrations against Israeli confiscations of Arab land.Iran, for its part, has close links with the Hashd al-Shaabi and the group led by the former prime minister Nouri al-Maliki and will be wary of Mr Sadr’s Iraqi nationalism. Mr Abadi stays in power until the formation of a new government, which he may lead in an alliance with the Sadrists.Mr Sadr is perceptive about political developments in Iraq. When I interviewed him five years ago he warned against Sunni-Shia sectarianism and foreign interference. He said: “The Iraqi people will disintegrate, its government will disintegrate and it will be easy for foreign powers to control the country.” This prediction was to be fulfilled six months later when Isis took Mosul and the Iraqi army broke up.Mr Sadr said that sectarianism was spreading at street level and “if it spreads among the people, it will be difficult to fight”.Iraqi politics is still largely based on sectarian or ethnic identity – Shia, Sunni and Kurd – but the religious parties that were in the ascendant after 2003 have discredited themselves. The majority Shia community is also more confident, after its military victories last year, that it is firmly in control and is not going to be dispossessed from power.Mr Sadr said that the problem was that the Iraqi psychology had been shaped by a “constant cycle of violence: Saddam, occupation, war after war, first Gulf war, the second Gulf war, then the occupation war”.The election this month, in which so many voters gave priority to social rather than security issues, may show that, as violence ebbs, Iraqis are becoming less traumatised.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Heres all you need to know...Born Charles Edward Maurice Spencer on May 20, 1964, Earl Spencer is Princess Dianas younger brother and Prince William and Harrys maternal uncle.Queen Elizabeth II is his godmother and his parents were the Viscount and Viscountess Althorp.Earl Spencer had two other sisters, Sarah and Jane, and an elder brother John who died within hours of being born.He studied at Eton and then read modern history at Magdalen College, Oxford.He started his career as a journalist with NBC News where he worked between 1986 and 1995 for Today and NBC Nightly News.Earl Spencer also worked as a reporter for Granada Television from 1991 to 1993.He has written book reviews for several newspapers and a number of books about the family estate Althorp in Northamptonshire.On March 29, 1992, Earl Spencer succeeded as 9th Earl Spencer, 9th Viscount Althorp, 9th Viscount Spencer of Althorp, 9th Baron Spencer of Althorp, and 4th Viscount Althorp after his dads death.He was a member of the House of Lords until hereditary peers were excluded on November 11, 1999.Earl Spencer is a patron of homelessness charity Northampton Hope Centre and also helped establish Althorp Living History - a furniture line reproducing pieces from the collection at Althorp.Princess Diana died on August 31 1997, after suffering fatal injuries in a car crash in the Pont de l’Alma road tunnel in Paris.Her funeral was held six days later at Westminster Abbey and was shown on British television, attracting an audience of 32.1 million viewers.With the eyes of the world on him, Earl Spencer delivered an infamous eulogy to his sister where he lashed out at the media for how they treated Diana.He also used the speech to make a thinly veiled attack on the Royal Family for stripping Diana of her status.Earl Spencer said: Diana was the very essence of compassion, of duty, of style, of beauty.All over the world, she was a symbol of selfless humanity. All over the world, a standard bearer for the rights of the truly downtrodden, a very British girl who transcended nationality. Someone with a natural nobility who was classless and who proved in the last year that she needed no royal title to continue to generate her particular brand of magic.He also pledged to Princes William and Harry that their blood family would protect them from the problems of being Royal.The public reaction when he delivered the speech made him a temporary hero - and it has been nominated as one of the greatest of the 20th Century.Earl Spencer claimed a royal courtier lied that Princes William and Harry wanted to walk behind their mother’s coffin, in an interview with BBC Radio 4.He basted the truly horrifying public spectacle saying that it still gives him nightmares.He said: “I was liaising with some courtier at Buckingham Palace and he mentioned it and I said, ‘Of course they’re not going to do that’ . . . he said, ‘Well, it’s been decided’.“I said she would not want them to do this, and there was lots of embarrassed coughing at the other end and various other conversations.“Then eventually I was lied to and told that they wanted to do it, which of course they didn’t but I didn’t realise that.”In the interview ,the Earl also revealed that ghouls had tried to break into Dianas grave four times, but the family had seen them off from their estate in Althorp, Northants.Diana is buried on an island at the gated estate.Earl Spencer explained: “Originally we were going to bury Diana in the family tombs nearby but it wasn’t to be.“Both because it was impractical and because it would mean the local village being overrun.”Earl Spencer sat at the back of St Georges Chapel on Meghan Markles side during the Royal Wedding on May 19, 2018.Prince Harrys uncle was placed behind the Clooneys at the very end of the Quire beside the choristers for the lavish ceremony.He was among the first arrivals at the ceremony along with his daughter, Lady Kitty Spencer, who stunned onlookers with her similarities to her late aunt.Earl Spencer had also attended the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton at Westminister Abbey in 2011.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Veils, polka dots, puff sleeves, she was always trying new things.Would she have liked Meghan? I think so.She’d have run her eye up and down her because although she wasn’t the sharpest tool in the box academia-wise, she had an A+ in intuition, but the important thing to her would be to know that she loved her son.If you could show her that then that would have been enough.If Diana was alive today I’ve no doubt she would be heavily involved with Meghan and Catherine and her grandchildren – and she would have been a very fun grandma.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She got her Brexit inner Cabinet to agree that in the event of no trade deal being in place by December 2020, the UK would continue to apply the EU’s common external tariff.The decision goes back to the issue of the Irish border and the “backstop” May agreed last December. This said that in the event of no deal being done, the UK would keep Northern Ireland in line with EU rules on customs, agriculture and manufactured goods.The DUP, the Ulster party on which Mrs May depends for her Commons majority, would never accept a Northern Ireland-only deal. So the Government wants to apply this backstop to the whole UK.The situation is far from ideal. It shows why the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, was right to have such misgivings about the backstop. He argued that by agreeing what would happen in the event of ‘no deal’ the UK was reducing its negotiating leverage.There is also a danger the backstop reduces the EU’s incentive to negotiate a comprehensive free-trade deal.Brexiteer ministers are intrigued by new Home Secretary Sajid Javid’s idea of keeping the customs revenues collected under the backstop in trust, only handing them over to the EU once the final deal is done.The UK’s position in these talks has been weakened by its failure to properly prepare for no deal.The EU knows the UK isn’t ready to walk away so it keeps pushing, knowing the need for a deal means we will almost certainly fold in the end.The final problem is that the UK still doesn’t know precisely what it wants. The backstop is only meant to apply if either a trade deal or technology can’t solve the Irish border problem.But right now there is more agreement in the Brexit inner Cabinet on the backstop — which, officially, they don’t want to happen — than on either of those two options.I understand from those involved in ministerial working groups looking at customs options they are still a long way off any conclusions. I am also told these working groups aren’t coming up with answers but doing “preparatory work to inform a later discussion”.So why aren’t Brexiteers kicking off at all these cans been kicked down the road?Well, as one influential figure, explains to me: “It is all very unsatisfactory but it is what it is.” In other words, given the mistakes that have been made, there isn’t really an alternative.The other reason is the view among several of the most important Brexiteers that they can’t get what they want at the moment, so they should play it long. The thinking goes that it is better to accept more temporary measures than to agree to bad permanent arrangements.But it is being whispered in Westminster that if Brexiteers are to get what they want, they need control of the government machine — and that means one of their own in Number 10.Moving against Theresa May now is simply too risky.Bringing her down could bring Brexit down.But in the past week, the talk of a challenge to her shortly after Britain has legally, if not practically, left the EU has risen in volume.Those around Mrs May want her to fight the next election.They also argue that any leadership contest before the whole Brexit process is done would risk splitting the Tories beyond repair.But this week, the chances of a challenge to Mrs May soon after March 30 next year substantially increased.ALL eyes will be on Windsor today for the Royal Wedding – but in Westminster, Tories are getting increasingly excited about the possibility of some political nuptials.On Monday night, the Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson and Environment Secretary Michael Gove will launch a new group designed to craft a post-Brexit agenda for the party. This joint appearance has set tongues wagging and left Tories wondering if they could one day be joined in political union.Davidson and Gove were on opposite sides of the Brexit referendum and until recently, she was – in private – no fan of his. But that has changed.One ally of hers tells me: “Relations are warmer than they have ever been.” What has brought them together? Fish. Davidson knows it is politically vital for Scottish Tories to secure a clean break from the Common Fisheries Policy.And Gove, whose adopted father was an Aberdeen fish merchant, is an ally against Chancellor Philip Hammond’s desire to use fishing as a bargaining chip in the negotiations.The question is whether this alliance of convenience could develop into something more lasting. Many Tories still dream of Davidson coming south after the Scottish Parliament elections in 2021. They think her charisma, combined with Gove’s radicalism, would be just the ticket.But there are huge logistical challenges to getting Davidson to Westminster before the next election, even if she wanted to. So could she back Gove?I am told she is keeping her options open at the moment. But what is certain is that whoever she did back would get a massive boost.If Davidson is not going to try to be queen, she can be the Tory kingmaker.So one wonders what Bercow, the Speaker of the House, would say about a minister calling someone a “stupid woman”.Yet tellingly, his office’s statement doesn’t deny the claim that he called Andrea Leadsom, the Leader of the House of Commons, that in a private aside on Wednesday.But there are no signs of a public apology from Bercow.It is hard not to conclude that he is determined to hang on to his job whatever damage he does to the role.ITALY, one of the founding members of the EU, is set to be governed by a populist coalition who want to renegotiate key parts of the European project.The biggest threat the new Italian government poses is to the future of the Eurozone. The new coalition’s programme would cost more than 100billion euros. This will put them in breach of the Eurozone’s deficit rules. To add insult to injury, the European Central Bank (ECB) buys a substantial amount of Italy’s sovereign debt.So the ECB would effectively be financing part of this programme.The result will be a backlash in northern European countries. They will wonder why Italy should get away with this. The result: The prospect of proper reform to fix the Eurozone’s structural weaknesses is dead.This is the Eurozone’s problem. Politics makes the reforms it needs impossible. Next time a global financial crisis hits, the Eurozone will have unique vulnerabilities.She said Tory MPs were telling her that both the party and the country needed unity at this moment and noises off didn’t help with that.But I am told the Prime Minister’s appeals on this front are becoming so frequent they are losing their force.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Both sides want a deal. But if the EU also tries to cripple us as a trading power, there are 60 Brexit-backing Tories ready to veto it.The PM has made many concessions to the EU already. She must be more militant.WHY is the grotesquely self-important toad John Bercow still Commons Speaker?For years he has polluted proceedings with his verbose grandstanding, interrupting MPs to rebuke them at tedious length for some minor transgression.His endless convoluted put-downs take up precious debating time.Bercow already faces two bullying accusations which he denies and MPs strangely do not wish to probe.Now, after yet another unhinged rant, he seems to have branded Andrea Leadsom “a stupid woman”. Had a Tory frontbencher done similar, Bercow would have gone berserk.In our view he has now crossed a line.

We have become one family, just like we would have been when they got married. We know that would make them so happy.”Holding Caroline’s hand Chloe’s mum Lisa added: “They were the perfect couple and had their entire future mapped out.“They were so excited about moving in together this year and taking their first foreign holiday together to Spain to celebrate Chloe’s birthday in August.“Two years later they were going to get married then two years after that they said they would have children.“They were so mature and in love we were absolutely certain they were doing the right thing.“We feel fortunate they had already experienced and achieved so much during their lives.“They had the type of love most people spend a lifetime searching for and were completely inseparable.“I truly believe they were destined to be together. They were so similar we sometimes get confused which one we are talking about.”The couple, who had been together for three years, had huge dreams.Chloe, who was studying music at Newcastle College and had auditioned on X Factor, wanted to be a singer or a music teacher and Liam, who was studying sports science at Northumbria University, loved playing cricket.Both worked part time at the Hilton hotel in Gateshead, where a special ball will be held in their honour next month.Their dreams were cut short by the terrorist who targeted innocents leaving the concert.This week police revealed that more than 800 people are now known to have suffered physical and psychological injuries after the bombing.Or you can organise you own fundraiser and pass on the money to the trustees.The donation will be used to help aspiring artists and athletes who have been hand-picked by a board of experts.For details go to the Facebook page – facebook/ChloeAndLiamTogetherForever/.Speaking from the Rutherfords’ home in South Shields, South Tyneside, where the walls are adorned with heart-shaped photographs of the couple, the mums explained they did not want to talk about the extremist who committed the atrocity.Caroline said: “We want to concentrate on Chloe and Liam and all the joy they brought into the world — and the legacy we can build for them now.”Lisa added: “Chloe had been a huge fan of Ariana ever since she appeared on the American TV show Victorious.“She couldn’t believe it when she found out she was playing a concert so close to home. She was very excited to see her perform.”The families now want to look to the future, and are devoting their own lives to helping the stars of tomorrow.They have set up the Chloe and Liam Together Forever Trust to provide support to talented youngsters as they explore their passions in music and sport. Lisa explained: “Liam and Chloe’s dreams were stolen from them before they could make them come true. They were born to be together and we want to do everything we can to ensure their love lives on for evermore.”Chloe’s dad Mark, 47, a former confectionery worker and Lisa, 47, a former banker, have joined forces with Caroline, 47, to run the trust.They have also helped Caroline cope with the loss of both her son and his dad, Andrew, who died of cancer, aged 49, just a short time before the attack.Lisa said: “After Liam and Chloe died we were overwhelmed with how many people contacted us offering to raise or donate money in their honour.“Even strangers were messaging us saying they wanted to do something. We wanted to do something with all that generosity and the idea for the trust came to us almost straight away.“So we are raising money to help promising musicians and athletes of any age.“The amount we donate varies but we are already helping a talented ballet dancer with his tuition fees and we are also funding a talented archer so he can buy the equipment he needs.“The dream is that one day we will help someone perform at a West End show in London, or compete for a gold medal at the Olympics.“We are trying to help the stars of tomorrow realise their goals and do the things my daughter and Liam would have liked to do. We’re in a position that the kids are never forgotten and although their ambitions were torn away from them, somebody else’s children will hopefully be able to fulfil their potential — and that’s because of Chloe and Liam.“Chloe had such a pure and beautiful voice. She loved singing and would perform at events all the time.“She would have loved to have been on the big stage one day but she also wanted to become a music teacher.“That’s why we really want to turn this terrible tragedy into something positive.”On Tuesday hundreds of locals in South Shields will wear the trust’s colours of pink and blue as they gather next to the permanent memorial bench in the couple’s honour next to the Town Hall.Mark said: “It’s hard to describe what we’ve been through. There are days when you don’t want to get out of bed because you feel you have got nothing to get up for.“Sometimes you don’t want to leave the house and you can’t do anything but sit and cry.“But the trust has given us the strength we need to carry on.“It’s become a full-time job dealing with everything that goes with it and we know that Liam and Chloe would be so proud of us for what we are doing.“That is what keeps us going and what makes it worth getting out of bed in the morning — knowing that despite this tragedy we can bring some good into the world.”A BRAVE band of terror attack survivors are calling on the public to help them combat extremism.The group, which includes people caught up in the Manchester Arena atrocity, say more must be done to “take on the evil” that has claimed so many lives.In an open letter, members including Becky Rigby, 35 – the widow of soldier Lee Rigby, who was murdered on a London street in May 2013 – issue a clarion call on how to stop the extremists before they strike.The group say: “With just two days to go until the anniversary of the Manchester Arena attack, which also marks the murder five years ago of Fusilier Lee Rigby, we would like to ask the public, as well as honouring those we have lost, to think about how you can become part of the solution to terror.“We are a group of survivors of terrorism. Some of us were injured ourselves, others have lost loved ones. In all cases, the scars of those moments are deep.“As we know from our own experience, terrorists have targeted the innocent regardless of faith, ethnicity or politics, for generations.“Our members have lost loved ones to nationalists, Islamists and far-right extremists.“What binds these extremists together is not any particular belief.“It is the hatred of people not like them and the willingness to use violence against innocent civilians.“It is this we must take on and defeat. When terror hits, we all feel an impotent rage. We all want to help the victims and take on the evil that drives the attacks – but how?”The letter is signed by more than 40 relatives of terror victims who have lost loved ones to groups including IS and the IRA.Signatories include Dan Hett, whose brother Martyn, 29, died in the Manchester Arena attack, and Gina Van Dort, 32, who was shot in the face and lost her husband Chris Dyer, 32, in the Tunisian beach attack of 2015.Their aims include:Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Secure in our identity. Best in the world when it comes to pomp and circumstance.And open, warm-hearted, and brilliantly diverse.The number of non-white faces, from the Kingdom Choir to the cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason to the Speaker’s chaplain, the Rev Rose Hudson-Wilkin, was a sign of the confident, welcoming country we have become.It has not always been easy. There is more to be done. One wedding will not change that.But yesterday we saw a Britain, and a Royal Family, that has moved into a new era.Princess Diana would have loved it.Nothing would have amused her more than how unconventional some parts of the ceremony were, or pleased her more than the number of hard-working charity staff who were invited to join in.The forget-me-nots in Meghan’s bouquet, Diana’s favourite flower, were a touching tribute. The Queen looked at once the distinguished Head of State we are used to and a doting grandmother.This was Britain’s biggest moment on the global stage since the opening of the London Olympics.Just as we did that night, yesterday we revelled in our heritage but announced that we were looking forward to an even brighter future.We wish the Duke and Duchess of Sussex the happiest of lives together.Here’s to them and our Great Britain.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She could easily have become trapped in the web of regal traditions.But Meghan navigated the intricacies with aplomb to pull off the most contemporary and delightfully multi-cultural royal wedding Britain has ever seen.There was a gospel choir, a bride’s mother with a nose stud and a star-studded guest list that was far more Soho House than Buck House. And of course, the aforementioned preacher Michael Curry.He milked his moment at the pulpit with a relentlessly repetitive call to love that went on . . . and on . . . and on, and clearly tickled some royals so much they looked fit to burst.The younger, modernising royals are now regarded more as celebrities than figureheads and this was a highly public melding of the old and new.After all Meghan, 36, is a divorcee with life experience, not some privileged ingenue straight out of finishing school.In Suits, the US telly series she starred in, her character married in a dress Meghan herself chose and described as “classic and fairytale and the culmination of everything she’s been waiting for”.The same could be said of yesterday’s creation by British designer Clare Waight Keller.In a nod to history, Meghan topped it with Queen Mary’s 1932 diamond bandeau tiara.And her “glam squad” of make-up artists, hairdresser, eyebrow shaper and skin guru worked their magic to accentuate a naturally radiant glow without looking overdone.She walked into the chapel alone, a break with form spun as a “bold, feminist statement” but really borne from sad necessity by her father’s absence.Meghan passed her Suits co-stars and the majority of the other celebrity guests in the Nave — what might be described as the cheap seats. Even Patrick J Adams, who played Suits love interest Mike Ross, was there.Yet curiously, celebrity royalty George and Amal Clooney were placed in the Quire alongside the Royal Family. Go figure.As Meghan reached halfway, she took the arm of her now father-in-law Prince Charles.He was to “accompany” her to the altar, rather than “give away” the woman who, let’s face it, he’s only just getting to know. For Charles the last-minute role was perhaps a godsend, placing him centre stage where the presence of his ever-strong mother might have eclipsed him.Not to mention the ghost of his ex-wife, always painted as the touch-feely parent to his seemingly more remote style.For, although it’s been 20 years since Diana’s death, how could anyone in the same situation not think of their mother and muse and how she would have savoured being there?And how could even the ­hardest of Republican hearts not have felt a small pang of regret she wasn’t?After all, in the middle of it all was the very human story of a young man who stole the nation’s hearts when forced to walk behind his mother’s coffin at the tender age of 12.On his engagement, Harry was asked what Diana would have thought of Meghan. He smiled and said: “They would have been thick as thieves. I think she would have been over the moon — jumping up and down, so excited for me, but then, as I said, she would have probably been best friends with Meghan.”Indeed she would. Diana always took great pains to make sure her sons knew not everyone’s life was as privileged.So she would have adored Harry’s choice of bride for her normality and independence.He could have had his pick of socialites but he chose a normal woman who has grafted and earned everything she has.The downside is that, unlike poshies who are as badly behaved as the rest of us but keep it to themselves, Meghan’s unedited life is ripe for scrutiny.Diana would have understood and done her utmost to support her. In addition, the media-savvy Princess of Wales would have brought Meghan’s father into the fold weeks ago, knowing a mix of estranged family and lack of disposable income is a potentially damaging cocktail.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKBut all that was forgotten yesterday as Meghan’s 61-year-old mother Doria Ragland, a yoga teacher, watched her daughter (who she calls “flower”) from a front-row pew, compellingly regal in her solitude.Meghan is reportedly maternal herself apparent during their engagement interview, throughout which she guides Harry rather than the other way round.In Angela Levin’s book Harry: Conversations with the Prince, she quotes historian Dr David Starkey as saying: “She mothers him a bit, but he needs it and some women like to do it.”Harry says his mother’s death left him in total chaos and Levin feels his “air of vulnerability and sadness” has brought out Meghan’s mothering instinct.Good. In return, it’s plain to see she has Harry’s unconditional devotion, and that they’ll make fine parents.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But we have also watched him grow up.He is no longer the pampered prince surrounded by chinless sycophants, who got it horribly wrong at fancy dress parties and Las Vegas swimming pools.He has grown into an Afghan war veteran, a doer of genuinely good works that make a real difference to lives that have been shattered by combat.He has grown into the son that Princess Diana would have been incredibly proud of.Twenty years on from the death of Diana, this country desperately wants Harry’s life to have a happy ending.A wedding — even a royal wedding — is not the same as a marriage, of course. And a day — even a special day like yesterday in Windsor in the blazing sunshine — is not the same as building a successful relationship that endures a lifetime.But the wedding of Prince Harry to Meghan Markle felt like the start of Harry’s happy ever after.Many of us, I suspect, were caught off guard by the raw emotion of the day. Hardened old hacks who have covered their share of royal events do not usually shed a tear among all that pomp and circumstance.But it is 20 years since I watched William and Harry mourn their mother in Westminster Abbey, and I saw them grieve when the cameras were pointed away. And I could not watch this wedding without a lump in my throat. And I suspect there were millions like me.Windsor is not really built to host the wedding of the century. This ancient market town is more used to low-key royal nuptials — Charles marrying Camilla and Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones — and having Meghan and Harry’s wedding in the shadow of that 1,000-year-old castle was like ­throwing the Rio carnival in a telephone booth.But it worked. This was Woodstock for royalists, whatever part of the world they came from.The mood was good-humoured, stoic, polite and it all felt fantastically British. A lot of people brought their dogs.And there were Americans everywhere, like Fulvia Brooks, 52, of Washington DC, visiting the UK for the first time.“As an African-American, and a woman, and an American, this day means a lot to me,” Fulvia told me. “Most of all it means love is real.”Her sister Julietta Simmons, 54, said: “I wanted to be a part of history. And it’s amazing! Wonderful! Yeah!”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKHarry and Meghan have lit a fire under the special relationship. There are 1,000 graduates of Meghan’s old university, Northwestern of Chicago, living in the UK and it felt like most of them had come to Windsor.“She is a smart, powerful, sophisticated woman,” said Ellen Bencard, a Northwestern alumna. “She is going to be able to do so much.”Some things about the crowds were unchanging, such as the presence of servicemen and women, the backbone of these events. But this was noticeably a different crowd from William and Kate’s wedding in 2011.There were more black faces, more brown faces, and more of a sense the entire nation felt included in a way they never did in the past.“She will modernise the Royal Family,” said Val West of Staines, Surrey. “There are millions of us who have been living in mixed-race families for years. The Windsors have joined us in the 21st century.”The last time an American divorcee married into the Royal Family, the British monarchy had a meltdown.This time, it might be the American divorcee who saves them.But you had to wonder if Meghan Markle TRULY understands what she’s getting into. She will be scrutinised like no other woman for the rest of her life.The fact she is 36 and has had a life — Diana was 19 when she wed Charles and died at 36 — will hold her in good stead, as will marrying a man clearly crazy about her.But there will be unimaginable pressure on Meghan to keep smiling, to keep hugging, to make the fairytale come true and — oh yes — produce a baby before she turns 40. So, even on this happiest of days, you had to fear for the bride.Because on Saturday we watched a once-obscure actress cement her place as without ­question the most famous woman on the planet.And you have to worry, just a ­little, about Harry. Like his brother, Harry sometimes seems a tad sulky about the constant, never-ending interest in his life.Behind the charming smiles, the younger royals too frequently seem to lack the stoic sense of duty the Queen has displayed for a lifetime, as though being born into the Royal Family is a heavy burden — when of course it is also a fantastic privilege.And you can’t dream of the quiet life when you just married the Grace Kelly of the 21st Century, a woman who blends regal charisma with Hollywood va-va-voom like nobody else alive. But this was not a day for nagging doubts.This was a day for believing Meghan and Harry will have the happy-ever-after they deserve, that the boy and girl from broken homes will build a home that lasts.The build-up to this special day has been difficult.Arranging your wedding day is never easy when you come from a dysfunctional, divorce-riven family full of bat-crazy relatives — and that’s just Harry!But thoughts of the sad past melted away in the sunshine. In 1947 Churchill called the Queen’s wedding “a flash of colour on the hard road we travel”.Windsor on Saturday made you believe we have not changed as much as we may have feared. The last was George V when he married Princess Victoria Mary of Teck at St James’s Palace in 1893.Harry had to get special permission from the Queen to keep his facial hair.As he is no longer a serving officer, Her Majesty had to give the OK for him to wear his military uniform.Since it is customary to be clean-shaven when in uniform, it is believed that her permission also covered Harry’s facial fuzz.Historian Hugo Vickers said: “Theoretically the Army don’t like it.”Along with brother Wills, Harry was in the frock coat uniform of the Household Cavalry’s Blues and Royals.They were hand-tailored by royal outfitters Dege and Skinner, of Savile Row in central London.A Royal Crown on his shoulder indicated Harry has been promoted to Major since leaving the Army as a Captain in 2015.He would have had the honour bestowed on him by The Queen, who can promote members of the Royal Family in line with their peers because they hold military appointments.On his left chest Harry displayed his Pilots’ Wings, awarded when he served with the Army Air Corps as an Apache helicopter pilot.His medal ribbons were the Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order Afghanistan with rosette The Queen’s Golden Jubilee and Diamond Jubilee. These were our people on the streets of Windsor. Men like Ray Brown, dressed as Uncle Sam — his friend Janet Butterfield was in a Union Jack dress — who had travelled all night from Yorkshire to cheer on the Long Walk.And Grace Gothard, from London out of Ghana, who wore a homemade dress she wore to Kate and William’s wedding.And you had to admire their patriotism, their good-natured humour, the quiet fortitude it took to be on those streets for hours.And this is our country, you realised, the real country that exists beyond the soft, sneering elite in Westminster. These decent, patriotic, polite people who are so often ignored are the best of us.We are often told this country is bitterly and permanently divided.But on Saturday in the spring sunshine of Windsor, it felt like those cheering crowds held up a mirror to the nation’s soul. And we did not seem divided at all.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She clung to it all day.In an exclusive interview to mark the ten-year anniversary of his death, Brooke, 34, tells how the pain of losing her brother never leaves her.She said: “My wedding day was the happiest I have had in ten years. But my husband Simon never met Ben, the boy I loved more than anything else in the world.“It was in December. We’d had dreadful weather but that morning the sun came up. I knew my little angel would make it shine. He was there in his own way.“Mum made my flowers and put a locket with Ben’s picture in. I held it all day. My dad did a beautiful speech saying Ben sprinkled a little bit of magic over us on the day I met Simon.“We raised a glass and cheered but I couldn’t help crying.”To celebrate finishing their GCSEs, Ben and his friends were out in June 2008 near his family home in Islington, North London, when he was attacked by Juress Kika, Jade Braithwaite and Michael Alleyne, then aged 19, 18 and 20.It was over an argument he had not been involved in. The trio spotted Ben and his mates walking to get a taxi and cornered him.They stabbed him 11 times in just five seconds. In 2009 all three got life after being convicted of murder.Brooke, in her capacity as consultant to scriptwriters on EastEnders — the soap in which she played Kelly Taylor for three years, has been going over Ben’s death for a forthcoming storyline.As the plot, involving Shakil, played by Shaheen Jafargholi, and Keegan, played by Zack Morris, unfolds tomorrow night on BBC1, viewers will see how knife crime shatters the community.Brooke said: “It’s a huge responsibility to get the truth out there about the devastation it causes. It was terrible reliving it but I don’t mind if it helps other families.”The murder rate in London is now higher than New York. Of the more than 60 murders in the capital this year, more than half were knife victims.Brooke, who helped set up the Ben Kinsella Trust to campaign and educate young people about the dangers of carrying knives, said: “We’ve worked so hard to make a difference. Ten years on I’d like to say we are in a better place. But I can’t.“Every time I hear of another death I’m distraught knowing what the family are going through.”With her dad George, 59, a London taxi driver and mum Deborah, 56, an office manager, the family also set up the Ben Kinsella Exhibition at Finsbury Library, North London.It features a life-size prison cell and actors who show some of the consequences of knife crime.Brooke said: “We mainly work with kids around ten, when they’re susceptible to peer pressure and bullies who tell them to do things.“Education on knife crime at this age should be on the curriculum. They give feedback afterwards and one ten-year-old boy wrote, ‘One stab physically does a million mentally’. It shows the maturity they have at that age.“They know people who head out the door with phones, keys and a knife.“We explain they’re more likely to be harmed if they carry one but some think there are safe places to stab someone.“I hate knives. I know all the injuries that Ben had, how long and deep they were. When I see a knife of the same size I freeze.”Ben and Brooke were very close, living at home with their two ­sisters. Brooke said: “He was one of my best friends. He’d creep into my bed and watch Friends. We would read the Harry Potter books together. He never got to read the last one.“He was a wonderful young man and an annoying little brother who played pranks.“I hate that his killers will be out when they’re 40, have another life with family and kids. Life should mean life.”Next month the family will be asking people to do “Ten for Ben”.Brooke said: “We’re holding a memorial and a 10k walk.“We are asking kids all around the country to do ten acts of kindness for his charity, like making a cup of tea or doing some shopping for an elderly person.“We want to counterbalance the cruelty out there with kindness.”October is always tough, because that is when Ben would celebrate his birthday. Last year, Brooke did not get out of bed. But smiling now, she says: “On his 25th we did the things he’d never done — drank pink champagne, went to the casino, played ping pong. He’d have loved it.”She is convinced he would also have loved her husband, lawyer Simon Boardley.Brooke, a talent manager, met him through TV’s Judge Rinder — or “Judge Tinder” as she calls her husband’s Sun columnist pal.In December last year, 18 months after meeting, Brooke and Simon married.Brooke said: “It hurts so much that he never met Ben. I’ve shared Ben’s memory box with him, with his toothbrush in case we can clone him one day, a theatre ticket from our visit to see Wicked, and Ben’s ­Oyster card and art work.“Simon has brought happiness back into my life.“When you get married you think about having children but I worry about the world.“The thought of bringing a child into it truly petrifies me.“I know just how dangerous it can be.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Everybody was clapping because it was the first time he was using that term for Meghan so it was really nice.”The second in line to the throne is said to have acted as compere and introduced both his father, Prince Charles, and his brother.Those that heard the speech are remaining very tight-lipped although by all accounts Prince William’s speech was “naughty”.Prince Williams speech was seen very much as payback for Harrys hilarious tribute to William and Kate when they tied the knot.The bride and groom danced the night away with Harrys favourite House tracks and Elton John on the piano while guests tucked into dirty burgers and candyfloss.These were washed down with a cocktail featuring ginger and rum named When Harry Met Meghan in an apparent nod to Harrys red hair at the bash at Frogmore House hosted by Prince Charles.James Corden also played a surprise role as compere at the evening reception in a £300,000 glass marquee in the grounds of Windsor Castle as a firework display rounded off the night.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mr Bercow has failed to deny branding Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom a “stupid woman” and “f****** useless” in the Chamber last week.  The Speaker was already under fire over a string of bullying and harassment allegations, all of which he denies. Culture Secretary Matt Hancock said he would not tolerate such insults among his staff. He told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: “I don’t think anybody in my team would talk like that because there are all very professional people.”  Digital Minister Margot James believed it was “an appalling thing to say about a colleague”. She told BBC1’s Sunday Politics: “Andrea does a great job as Leader of the House, she’s the absolute opposite of a stupid woman. “It’s no way to talk about colleagues in the workplace.” Asked if it was acceptable to have a Speaker who talks to the Commons Leader in such a way, she replied: “No, it’s not.” But she added: “We do need to take stock and deliberate ... it has to be part of a wider picture really. “It’s unacceptable what he is alleged to have said. “But that on its own is not a reason for him to suddenly lose his job.” A senior Labour frontbencher defended the Speaker - but pointed out that when he took the role in 2009, Mr Bercow vowed to serve no more than nine years.  The term expires on June 22. Shadow Transport Secretary Andy McDonald told Sky News: “I think he’s ... indicated that he’s got a fixed term he’s set himself (when) he will be stepping down. “I’m not so sure he needs any encouragement from me. “He’s been a good Speaker in that he does protect the interests of Parliament against the executive and he’s not frightened of standing up to the executive when they misbehave as they did this week they treated everyone with total and utter contempt. “He’s absolutely excellent at standing up for Parliament when the executive wants to ride roughshod over Members of Parliament. “I think John Bercow’s been an excellent Speaker and I hope he carries on for a little bit longer. “I’m not going to be judge and jury on John Bercow if an allegation is made and it hasn’t been proved - I’ll wait for that, if you don’t mind.

In an excruciating interview Labour\u0027s shadow international trade secretary was forced to listen to a recording of himself at a private event rubbishing his party\u0027s policy.  It caused controversy at the time because he was directly contradicting Labour Party policy.  And other cabinet colleagues have lost their jobs for making the same error.   His former colleague Owen Smith , who was Northern Ireland Secretary, was sacked after penning an article calling for Britain to stay in the Single Market.   Filling in for Andrew Marr, Emma Barnett today asked him if he was grateful to Jeremy Corbyn for sparing him the chop despite him contradicting Labour\u0027s policy.    Gardiner is recorded ridiculing one of Labour\u0027s six tests for a Brexit deal which is that it achieves the exact same benefits as the current relationship with the EU.  On the recording he can be heard saying: “It’s b*****ks. Always has been b*****ks” – and goes on to dismiss the whole strategy of the six tests. “We know very well that we cannot have the exact same benefits. And it would have made sense, because it was the Tories that said they were going to secure the exact same benefits, and our position should have been precisely to say: ‘They have said that they will secure the exact same benefits and we are going to hold them to that standard.’”  Today he said: Our policy is that we will hold the government to account for the promises they made.  When he was quizzed whether he stood by previous comments that people were playing up the issue of security in Ireland, he failed to commit.

It has not yet been announced when the personal portraits of Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding day taken by Alexi Lubomirski will be released, but if they are anything like William and Kate\u0027s official pictures, they will be well worth the wait. With the wedding one of the most heavily photographed events of the year, he did not need to take pictures of the ceremony, but will instead have focused on the portraits. That meant he was able to attend the wedding as a guest with wife Giada.   He wrote on Instagram: Went to a little wedding today ) ...... Wow.. What a fantastic, surreal and wonderful day! Amazing to experience it as a guest and even more incredible to experience it as a photographer. Felt extremely fortunate to have been there AND to share the day with my beautiful wife (@ecoshaker) by my side, who looked stunning in her MASSIVE CONGRATULATIONS to the happy couple!!!! It seems a no-brainer to pick one of the world\u0027s top fashion photographers, who has shot the likes of Lupita Nyong\u0027o, Julia Roberts, Catherine Zeta Jones, Kate Winslet, Victoria Beckham, and Anne Hathaway. But perhaps the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex had more in mind when they first picked Lubomirski to take their pictures. Because he is a real Prince himself and has written an etiquette guide book called Princely Advice for a Happy Life.    At age 11 Lubormirski discovered a Polish royal lineage on his father\u0027s side that dates back 500 years. It was a Princess Diaries moment of sorts but with a catch — the house\u0027s reign had ended, and Alexi\u0027s seat would be the first not to bear any of the luxury trappings associated with royalty. In one generation, everything flipped completely, he told Harpers Bazaar . I was one generation away from 500 years of history.  According to the photographer\u0027s own website: The Lubomirski family is one of the most well- known and influential in Poland’s history. They were one of the largest landowners in Europe, and their members served as governors, statesmen, senators, diplomats, philanthropists, and patrons of the arts throughout the centuries. But he adds: After two world wars and the rise of communism, the family had lost centuries of art, land, palaces, and family treasures. It was a title with no physical riches. Lubomirski’s childhood was spent between England and Botswana with his Peruvian mother and English stepfather and he studied at The University of Brighton before he became Mario Testino\u0027s photography assistant. Of working with one of Princess Diana\u0027s favourite photographers, he told Bazaar : It was incredible to sit next to Mario Testino and just watch him work. You could be sitting in front of the Queen of England watching him make her smile or Gwyneth Paltrow trying to make her feel sexy when she [wasn\u0027t feeling] sexy.  Royal wedding in pictures: Most amazing photos from Harry and Meghan\u0027s beautiful day But it was his mother\u0027s words which have guided the photographer and he said: If you are to be a prince in today\u0027s world, she told him when he was young, you have to be a prince in your heart and actions. Since then, he says has lived life according to the spirit of the William Shakespeare quote from Henry VI, Part 3 that opens Lubomirski\u0027s book, Princely Advice for a Happy Life : My crown is in my heart, not on my head. The book has gathered celebrity fans, Kate Winslet said: This beautiful book, should become a bible for all! Without spiritual fluffiness, and free from preaching statements, this is a simple book of basic, gentle ideals that we sometimes forget about.

The football icon, 43, greeted the bobby before entering St George\u0027s chapel in Windsor. He and wife Victoria were among 600 guests who turned out to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle take their vows and exchange rings. Many people on social media said Becks\u0027 act of kindness towards the officer showed his true character. One woman said the act helped show police officers across the country their hard work did not go unnoticed.              Southwestdee17 said on Instagram: David Beckham, you absolute #legend! This may have just been a handshake and a ‘thank you’ to the police officer on your part, but it meant so much more to police officers all over the country. It hadn’t gone unnoticed. Thank you! Tracey Enn said on Twitter: The best part of the pre wedding coverage was David Beckham shaking the policeman’s hand when entering the Church. What a guy.  @AdamKechill added: You gotta love David Beckham - he paused as he entered the chapel for the #royalwedding to shake hands with the policeman. @youthfulmnds said: David Beckham shaking hands with the policeman, wow we love a respectful man. And @stephos1 said: David Beckham is just so sweet, shaking hands with the policeman, the only one who acknowledged him.  Becks was also praised yesterday for hugging a victim of the Manchester Arena terror attack outside the church. Amelia Mae Thompson, 12, was hugged by the Manchester United legend after he walked over to pose for a picture with her.

Harry has finally embarked on the most important and coveted chapter of his life – as a married man. He has felt ready to settle down for a few years and envies the domestic harmony of his brother William and Catherine and their fun with their children. Now he has a confident wife with a keen intelligence and a wide experience of the world. His marriage surely marks his coming of age.  Harry’s destiny was never entirely clear-cut. When he was about five, he and William were being rather noisy in the back of the car. Their mother Diana told them to be quiet, but Harry precociously retorted: “I’m not going to be King. William is. So I can do what I like.”  It showed the conundrum of being the spare, rather than the heir. Harry has had to learn he certainly can’t do just as he likes, which has proved hard at times.  Diana’s sudden death, just before his 13th birthday, was so traumatic he couldn’t face it for almost 20 years. He tried to shut out his grief and instead became the Party Prince, smoking weed, getting drunk, falling out of clubs and lashing out at paparazzi. Ten years in the Army, serving on the frontline in Afghanistan, helped calm his troubled mind. He had also sought professional support to get rid of the demons. In Meghan, the hope is that Harry has found his soulmate who has overcome her own difficulties. These have included a broken home, complicated family relationships, a failed marriage, and a measure of confusion about whether society classifies her as black or white.   Breathtaking gesture that proves Prince Harry has found true happiness as he and Meghan Markle sparkle at evening reception  The past week of turmoil, with her father Thomas staging paparazzi pictures, ending up in hospital for a heart operation and missing the wedding has probably brought the couple even closer. Harry tried to tell her what life in the royal goldfish bowl would be like. Now she knows. The new Duchess seems to be able to handle pressure. She is older than both William and Catherine, not to mention Harry. She is a mature, independent, successful woman. Harry is the least assuming and most grounded royal you could imagine. Now both have found a shared direction in life. A sincere drive to make a difference in the world of those less fortunate.  Now she will join forces with her husband, her new brother-in-law William, and Catherine to make up an Awesome Foursome with regal punching power. The newlyweds are powerful symbols of how the monarchy evolves to keep itself relevant. As Harry himself has said, Diana would have been delighted to know Meghan. And today, he ensured his mum was included. All three of Diana’s siblings were invited. Her sister, Jane, read a lesson. And Harry’s bride wore a ring encrusted with diamonds from his mother’s jewellery collection.  I suspect Meghan and Harry will concentrate on supporting the young people of the Commonwealth or shining a spotlight on the scourge of poverty in Africa. Both want children so the patter of tiny feet may come sooner rather than later. Harry said the stars were aligned when he was introduced to this American actress. Meghan said the thing that mattered most to her was that he was kind. I think he is. And I hope he was bang on about the stars.

Dodd admitted he used to be a street yob addicted to cannabis who made life a misery for ordinary people. The 33-year-old , who turned professional in 2012 after a glittering amateur career, later won the WBC International Lightweight title and then the Commonwealth Lightweight title. But he\u0027s now revealed what life was like before his glittering sporting career, growing up in Birkenhead, Liverpool.  He told the Liverpool Echo that during his time growing up on the Exmouth estate he received a phone call threatening his life.  He said: “I had been out with my mates in Birkenhead.  We ended up in a nightclub, and there was a bit of a disagreement. To be fair we had tried to calm things down. We were stood outside the club and I think a woman involved had phoned her husband. “Anyway the woman’s husband and his mates came down the club. I remember they were older than us. There was a confrontation and then a fight, which we won. “We all forgot about it but then I received a phone call telling me there was \u0026pound10,000 on my head, and there people coming over from Liverpool to shoot me or something because I had upset a gangster. “So I told the person on the phone that I would be at the Queens pub on Conway Street from noon tomorrow.  “So my mates and I all went down to the Queens and sat outside in the carpark drinking, waiting for them. Nothing happened, but it could of. And what would I have done if it had?” Dodd, 33, explained that he had to fight on a daily basis growing up on the streets of Birkenhead, and quickly fell in with a group of local hard lads. He said: “We became streetrats, always hanging around and causing trouble. We made life a misery for ordinary people, smashing windows and vandalising cars. We used to hit people during robberies, from lads in the park to anglers.” He said that when he got older the group began drinking, smoking drugs and fighting in pubs. He said: “It was all about football, drinking, smoking skunk and fighting. Obviously this lifestyle started to take its toll. One of my friends had a sort of breakdown and was sectioned.”  Sean said that one of his friends received a long prison sentence after he was involved in a serious incident in Birkenhead town centre. He said: “They were out and got involved in a disagreement with some bloke. He chased after my mate, who then tuned around and swung at him. The man was later admitted to hospital, and sadly died and my friend was jailed. I was not there at the time but I could have been.” Dodd said that his addiction to skunk cannabis became a growing problem. He said: “It became my life. I remember a period of time when all I wanted was \u0026pound20 to be able to buy a bag of skunk. I did not have enough money to heat my flat or feed my dogs. I remember sleeping in long johns and socks to try and keep warm. I was rock bottom and I had nothing.” Dodd said that an invitation to a boxing show changed his life. He said: “My uncle knew I was going through a bad patch and invited me to a boxing show. I remember seeing a 15-year-old local lad box, and that was it for me. I wanted to be him.

But it reminded some of one of his grandfather\u0027s famous gaffes.  The 96-year-old Prince Philip, who is still recovering from a hip operation he underwent roughly six weeks ago, was at the ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel to see Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle in a lavish and beautiful ceremony.  The Duke of Edinburgh is perhaps most famous for his history of gaffes and inappropriate remarks. Although he is thought to have been on his best behaviour alongside the Queen yesterday, that hasn\u0027t stopped one of his earlier remarks being dragged up again.  With Harry opening the door for the Duchess, politician turned comedian Gyles Brandreth reminded his followers on Twitter of what Prince Philip once reportedly said: If you see a man opening a car door for a woman, it means one of two things: it\u0027s either a new woman or a new car. In this case the woman was certainly a new wife and the car, while originally manufactured in 1968, has since been converted to electric power. The car is a concept model and the licence plate has a secret meaning.

Done right, they\u0027re funny and touching, but despite the wedding party\u0027s best efforts sometimes they end up just being a bit dull or cringe-worthy. But it sounds like Prince Harry got it just right with his big speech, paying tribute to his new wife and her mum.  He reportedly brought some of the 200 guests at the evening reception at Frogmore House to tears with his moving words.    Speaking to the Sunday Times , one of the couple\u0027s friends said Harry told Meghan: I can\u0027t wait to spend the rest of my life with you and said we make such a good team.  He also paid tribute to how Meghan has dealt with the extremely difficult week leading up to her wedding, which saw her dad drop out of the wedding to undergo heart surgery.  He also spoke about Meghan\u0027s mum Doria Ragland .   It was Harry\u0027s second speech of the day, as he also said a few words off the cuff during the earlier lunchtime reception .  Prince Charles also gave a speech and spoke about raising Prince Harry, making jokes about changing his nappy. The bride also spoke, but little is known about what she said.  The newlyweds had two wedding receptions - the first a formal sit down meal hosted by the Queen at St George\u0027s Hall, and the second a more laid back party hosted by Prince Charles. The fun evening reportedly had a carnival theme with music from celeb DJ am Totolee and a huge fireworks display.

The evening do is thought to have had more in common with a West End club night than a traditional wedding breakfast with a \u0027carnival atmosphere\u0027 being reported in the 230-year-old Frogmore House. Guests feasted on \u0027dirty burgers\u0027, candyfloss and enjoyed drinks-of-the-world themed cocktails - including one named \u0027When Harry Met Meghan\u0027, a play on the hit romantic comedy When Harry Met Sally. The drink featured rum and ginger, the latter a nod to Harry\u0027s famous red hair. Guests danced to famous celeb DJ Sam Totolee, who curated a selection of Harry\u0027s favourite house tracks for the evening with instructions from the groom to \u0027avoid cheese\u0027.  The DJ\u0027s personal website, which lists Kensington Palace as a client, has several testimonials from stars including Diana Ross calling him incredible\u0027 and Uma Thurman saying he is wonderful. Comedian James Corden acted as a comp\u0026egravere for the evening, it was reported and the sit-down dinner, paid for by the Prince of Wales, ran from 7.30pm until roughly 10pm. The father of the groom made a speech which had guests in stitches - including a gag about changing Harry\u0027s nappy - before a spectacular fireworks display. The prince reportedly had guests laughing and crying as he described bringing up the mischievous young Harry.  A guest at the wedding told the Mail: Charles spoke about feeding Harry a bottle and changing his nappy, and then said look how well he turned out. That\u0027s about as embarrassing as it got. At one stage the groom reportedly asked guests if anyone could play the piano before Sir Elton John, who had been a guest at the lavish lunchtime ceremony, played Your Song, Tiny Dance, Circle of Life and I\u0027m Still Standing. He was incredible. It became like a mini-concert in the reception area, said one guest. Some people were even crying. Guests had been able to rest and change before the start of the evening celebrations following the lunchtime reception in the castle\u0027s medieval St George\u0027s Hall hosted by the Queen.  The precise schedule of the evening reception is being kept secret by Kensington Palace officials and little is known about Meghan\u0027s speech - but she is thought to have thanked the Royal Family for welcoming her in. Celeb attendees are - so far - keeping quiet on social media about the evening. The reduced guestlist of 200 - compared to 600 at the wedding- meant there was no room for mere acquaintances or some minor royals, with Pippa Middleton and Harry\u0027s ex Chelsy Davy, who had both been at the ceremony, thought to have missed out. Jokes about Harry\u0027s playboy past were under a strict embargo - until the older guests had left. Guests even carried on partying at top celebrity hang out, Chiltern Firehouse for an after-after party.  Beautiful bride Meghan switched from her stunning elegant, formal pure white wedding gown by Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy, to a glamorous lily white halter neck by Stella McCartney for the black tie evening do. US star Meghan - now a duchess and an HRH - gave a speech at the party, which was hosted by her father-in-law the Prince of Wales.  Harry drove his new wife from Windsor Castle in a silver blue classic convertible Jaguar E-Type Concept Zero which was originally manufactured in 1968 and has been converted to electric power. The happy couple waved and smiled as they headed to meet their friends at the celebration, which stretched into the early hours. Meghan wore shoes from Aquazurra made in silky satin, with nude mesh, with soles painted in baby blue. Her hair - in a relaxed up do - was styled for the reception by George Northwood. The car\u0027s number plate bore the date of the wedding (which will, of course, now be their anniversary)- E190518.  Serena Williams was one of the lucky ones invited to the evening reception. She pulled out all the stops as she dazzled with her second outfit - a luxury designer frock. The tennis champion had already stolen the show during the wedding ceremony in a nude pink asymmetric necklined gown.  And she did it all again after taking a quick nap with baby daughter Alexis Olympia ahead of tonight\u0027s knees-up. Sharing snaps of the dramatic Maison Valentino gown on Instagram, Serena thanked creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli for making me look special on this special evening.  Following a ceremony which broke with tradition, Meghan was expected to stamp her own imprint on the evening celebration by giving a speech of her own. The couple were then expected to let their hair down and enjoy their first dance as husband and wife.  The closest friends of the newlyweds were in attendance including Canadian stylist Jessica Mulroney and other confidantes such as Benita Litt and designer Misha Nonoo.  The 17th century royal residence stands about half a mile south of Windsor Castle in Windsor Home Park. It offered the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex the privacy to celebrate their marriage away from the cameras.

There’s a touch of Donald Trump Fake News in the aggrandized billing of royalty’s latest wedding as the world’s greatest since, well, the last one conveniently involving the groom’s brother and best man. I’m not against Harry Wales and Meghan Markle. Indeed I send them my best wishes, as I do to everybody else who wed today (the others not charging us a small fortune, it should be noted). And I desperately hope this is a happier fairy tale than the 1981 edition mis-sold by stand-in father of the bride Charles when poor Di proved a lamb to the slaughter.  But I am against an elitist monarchy and today we were in the silent uninterested majority – 66% or two-thirds of us according to pollster YouGov – who felt what BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell diplomatically termed “polite indifference to it all”. Street party-free swathes of Britain and bustling shops on a sunny Saturday told us far more about public enthusiasm, of the lack of it, for the establishment production than the fawning subjects who’d travel to watch the Queen order a flunkey to pick up a corgi’s poo. If that in Windsor was the best the royals can do after months of North Korean propaganda, Harry Jong-un’s summit with his American darling hailed as an international moment of supreme importance, there’s hope yet for us republicans.  Leave me out of the monarchy myth when royalty performs a pernicious political purpose in adding a respectability gloss to unearned privilege and extreme inequality. Look up to them and the subservient look down on themselves, Windsor as much a people’s event as Eton’s a people’s school or Clardige’s is a people’s hotel. How mean not to feed the 1,200 “commoners” instructed to bring picnics as they stood in the grounds of Windsor Castle, unpaid TV extras denied even crumbs from the rich family’s table.

Instead, she decided to have lots of adorable children bridesmaids and page boys who all seemed to love their moment in the spotlight. But she didn\u0027t want to leave her friends out, so she bought them all a special present to mark her big day.  She had six gorgeous yellow gold bracelets made for her closest friends, including her new sister-in-law the Duchess of Cambridge, reports PEOPLE .   They were made by one of Meghan\u0027s friends, designer Lisette Polny from Zofia Day. Lisette told PEOPLE: It’s an overwhelming honor to be part of history and for my pieces to be given as a keepsake for this momentous occasion. It\u0027s a really simple, elegant piece that’s just very true to her personal style.  The gold bracelets, which have been named Kensington, have a simple gold disc on them and the design was approved by Meghan herself. And you\u0027ll be able to get your hands on the bracelet very soon, as they will go on sale for $450.  Meghan wore a simple but beautiful dress by British designer Claire Waight Keller with a delicate veil decorated with flowers representing all 53 countries of the Commonwealth.   She was also wearing a beautiful and very glamorous bandeau tiara, which was made in 1932 for Queen Mary. She later changed into a second wedding dress, a glamorous bespoke lily white high neck gown designed by Stella McCartney.

She once told me that the moment she \u0026shyrealised she was a prisoner of her circumstances was when she was staying at Buckingham Palace prior to her marriage and was desperate to get out into the real world. She took the lift from the old nursery floor to the Privy Purse entrance and got into her car parked in the courtyard. Just as she put the key in the ignition a burly detective got in beside her. “I am quite fine,” she told him. “I am just going for a drive.” “M’Lady,” he said, “You are about to be part of the Royal Family and I have been \u0026shyassigned to protect you.”  The realisation that never again would she be able to be a free person was a shock to the young Diana. It was a wake-up call to the life she was about to enter. “It’s too late, Dutch,” her \u0026shysisters told her, using their favourite childhood name for their sister. “Your face is on the tea towels.” But that was almost 40 years ago.  Today Meghan Markle, an independent, strong American woman of 36, is about to enter the ivory tower of royalty. She can have no real idea of what it entails and if she did she might have some serious doubts. But her love for new husband Haz, as she calls him, has almost certainly blinded her to the reality of the life ahead of her. The late Prince William of Gloucester, a cousin of the Queen who would have been a great uncle to Prince Harry, once remarked: “It is almost impossible to describe what it is like being a member of the Royal Family. I suppose in essence it comes down to this: you can never be your real self. Just to know you are royal inhibits you. You are automatically \u0026shyseparated from the rest of the world.” The Queen herself admitted: “I think the younger members of the family find the \u0026shyregimented side difficult.  “You can’t imagine what it’s like to have your whole life mapped out for you a year in advance.” Prince Charles once complained. “It’s awful to be programmed... at times I get fed up with the whole idea.” And his father Prince Philip has observed: “A small indiscretion can lead to all sorts of difficulties. “We soon discover that it is much safer to unburden yourself to a member of the family than just a friend. You see you are never quite sure.” The attention that any kind of failure or small indiscretion attracts is a relatively recent \u0026shyphenomenon. But it is one that Meghan, in the age of social media, has had to deal with. Her dysfunctional family has been dissected in a way that would have been unthinkable 20 years ago. But that is the climate in which she and they, however little she has to do with them, will have to live.  That makes it tough being married to the sixth in line to the throne. It is no longer Haz her man but Prince Harry her husband. And, as his wife, she will have to be part of the royal firm. It’s no longer about Meghan, the stunning actress who came from a broken home and relative poverty to \u0026shytelevision stardom. It’s about the institution of the monarchy. It’s a business and she is just a cog in the wheel. The protocol is archaic but it can be managed. She will learn that she must go through a door after the Queen and who she has to curtsy to. She will manage it perfectly, like a script from Suits. But it is real life, and life without freedom. She will find that hard. The qualities she learnt in Hollywood will stand her in good stead. Turning to just the right side for a picture and saying just the right thing to someone you will never meet again will be her forte. Harry is so in love he will do everything to protect her and try to take her away from the front line of royalty as much as he can. The Queen’s idea that together they can reconquer the Commonwealth is a good one. She knows they will face difficulties in readjusting to their new life.  If they manage to get it right they could perhaps conquer the world as Diana and Charles once hoped  they could do.  Meghan is a modern woman. America loves her because she is strong and independent, and I hope she doesn’t get crushed by the royal machine. She will have to be careful about what she says and does. But with the help of the world’s \u0026shydarling, Prince Harry, I have few doubts she will manage it and take on her greatest role to Oscar-winning success.

Climbing the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel, she gave royal fans across the globe their first glimpse of the most anticipated wedding dress in history. The 36-year-old American chose Givenchy\u0027s British artistic director Clare Waight Keller, 47, to design the \u0026pound200,000 ivory-white gown. And the details of their top secret relationship has now been laid bare. Dashing across London in a baseball cap or beanie, Meghan and Clare ran a covert operation in the lead up to the big day.  The commission was so secret, the bride did not go to Paris to visit the French fashion house\u0027s headquarters, but instead met Clare at her Chelsea home. According to reports, Meghan would dress down and dart into the West London flat. The process began in January, when Meghan began looking through sketches with best friend Jessica Mulroney, who runs her own bridal business in Canada. Until yesterday, only five people in the world knew details about the dress - the bride, Jessica, Clare and two discreet assistants at Givenchy. Once a design was decided on, expert seamstresses got to work.  The veil took hundreds of hours to make as seamstresses religiously washed their hands every 30 minutes. The delicate fabric had to be kept pristine and flowers from 53 Commonwealth countries were to feature. The result was a three-quarter length, simple gown with an elegant boat neck and 16ft veil made from silk tulle. The focus of the dress is the graphic open bateau neckline that gracefully frames the shoulders and emphasises the slender sculpted waist, Kensington Palace said in a statement. The lines of the dress extend towards the back where the train flows in soft round folds cushioned by an underskirt in triple silk organza. The slim three-quarter sleeves add a note of refined modernity.  The gown was made of double bonded cady silk with a sweeping train. Edward Enninful, the editor of British Vogue, called the dress beautiful while bridal designer Raishma said the gown was an example of couture design at its most classic and timeless. It was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales, but one that placed the woman proudly front and center, Vanessa Friedman, fashion director and chief fashion critic at The New York Times, wrote. It underscored Ms. Markle\u0027s own independence by divesting her of frippery, while also respecting tradition and keeping her covered up.  The well-kept secret over who would design the dress had kept royal fans and fashionistas guessing for months. Among the those cited as contenders were labels Ralph \u0026amp Russo and Burberry as well as designer Stella McCartney. Waight Keller, whose name has now been catapulted into the global spotlight, described the chance to work on the historic occasion as an honour.

The couple were later pictured driving off in a silver blue Jaguar E-Type Concept Zero as they headed to their reception at Frogmore House. As well as Diana\u0027s ring, the bride was seen wearing a bespoke lily white high neck gown, made of silk crepe and designed by Stella McCartney. Her shoes were from Aquazurra and made in silky satin, with nude mesh. The soles, which were painted baby blue, matched the vintage Jaguar.  Her hair was styled by George Northwood, and she looked stunning as she and her new husband left the castle in the open-top classic sports car. The Jaguar, which is a concept model, was originally manufactured in 1968 but has since been converted to electric power. Its licence plate is today\u0027s date - E190518 - which will, of course, be the pair\u0027s anniversary. Harry, who drove Meghan through the Windsor Great Park in the early evening sunshine, was dressed in black tie. The party-loving prince is said to have requested a Tiki-themed bar for his and Meghan\u0027s wild carnival and festival-themed \u0027afterparty\u0027.    Guests will reportedly be welcomed by a steel band before feasting on South African wagyu beef and quaffing iced beers, champagne and ice luges filled with vodka, in a throwback to Mahiki - the groom\u0027s favourite London nightclub. Prince Charles, who will host the private evening for the couple\u0027s inner circle, is expected to pick up the tab for the 200-strong party. Harry\u0027s polo pal Nacho Figueras posted a picture of his black tie evening outfit to Instagram, simply writing: Part 2.  Earlier, Harry and Meghan had shared a tender kiss on St George\u0027s Chapel\u0027s steps after pledging their love to one another at their wedding. The bride had donned an elegant and simple pure white gown, designed by Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy, for the ceremony. Her delicate veil was five metres long and made from silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza. Her hair was styled in an up do and she wore the glittering Queen Mary\u0027s Diamond Bandeau tiara, loaned to her by the Queen.

But one of the more unusual facts of the day was on Harry\u0027s face - specifically his beard .   The 33-year-old became the first royal to get married with facial hair for 125 years and he needed special permission from his grandmother, the Queen , to do so.   The last royal to tie the knot sporting face fuzz was George V , the son of Queen Victoria and Harry\u0027s great-great grandfather.  He wore a beard during his wedding to Princess Mary of Teck in 1893.  Ordinarily it is customary to be clean-shaven when dressed in an Army uniform - which Prince Harry and his best man Prince William both wore. In a statement, Kensington Palace said: Her Majesty The Queen gave her permission for Prince Harry to get married in his uniform. It is understood that the permission covered the fact Harry has a beard. It\u0027s not the only tradition broken by Harry, with the new Duke deciding to wear a wedding band, something his older brother, father and grandfather decided against. Historian Hugo Vickers said the permission may also have been granted because Harry, who once toured in Afghanistan, has retired from active service.  Mr Vickers told the Mail: \u0027Theoretically the Army don\u0027t like it which is why at one point he took the Salute at Sandhurst in a suit. Strict British Army rules do not allow bears in normal circumstances with the wearing of them only allowed due to skin complaints or religious reasons. Pioneer Sergeants are the only rank allowed to have a beard, although members of the Special Forces can when behind enemy lines. In December Harry wore a dark suit and overcoat, with medals on the outside, when he represented the Queen and inspected graduating officer cadets at the Sovereign\u0027s Parade at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst.

Curry, the first black head of the Episcopal Church in the United States, started by quoting civil rights hero Dr Martin Luther King and powered on citing spirituals, medieval poetry and the experiences of slaves in the American south. We\u0027re going to sit down, we gotta get y\u0027all married! he told Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and their wedding guests. By the end, he was referring to Harry and Meghan as my brother, my sister, and telling them God love you, God bless you Later he said: Two young people fell in love and we all showed up.  Meghan smiled throughout as Harry looked on intently. At the end of the sermon, Harry Harry had just one word to say. He turned to Meghan to his left and simply said: Wow. Harry\u0027s brother Prince William could be seen on TV smiling during the lengthy address. Some commentators took to Twitter to point out the facial reactions in the chapel to the Bishop\u0027s sermon. In particular, a close-up of the Queen\u0027s granddaughter, Zara, with her mouth open became a focus for social media. Meanwhile Harry\u0027s cousin Princess Beatrice was spotted giggling.  As the bishop got into full swing, Sky News journalist Mark Austin said: Lovely moment as the preacher takes the Royals to the edge of their comfort zone  BBC presenter Jeremy Vine said: The preacher is doing 50 in a 30 zone and it\u0027s brilliant. Bishop Curry, 65, is the presiding bishop of the American Episcopal Church. Bishop Curry is based in Raleigh, North Carolina, - but today he went global. Giving an address titled the Power of Love at the service, the Chicago native opened his energetic speech with the words of Martin Luther King, a devout Christian whose faith shaped his struggle against racial injustice in the US, hailing his views on love as right. We must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love. And when we discover that, we will be able to make of this old world a new world. Love is the only way, Bishop Curry quoted.      US ABC News anchor T.J. Holmes said: I\u0027m from West Memphis ... and my wedding wasn\u0027t even this black. I\u0027ve learned in my life that anytime a black pastor says I\u0027m wrapping up ... you should get comfortable. But take your time, Mr. Curry. I\u0027m loving this. Radio 1 DJ Matt Edmondson said: SOMEONE GIVE THIS MAN HIS OWN TV SHOW IMMEDIATELY.  Pop star Danni Minogue said: Windsor is waiting. Piers Morgan tweeted: OK, Rev... you need to wrap. One royal reporter noted: This is brilliant from Bishop Curry - some amazing facial expressions all around! Ed Miliband tweeted: Rev Michael Curry could almost make me a believer.      Princess Beatrice and Eugenie were both also seen smiling. There were more laughs when he asked guests if any of them had travelled to the castle in a car, and then joked that he knew there were carriages around. The Mirror reported last week how Bishop Curry is to march on the White House against Donald Trump four days after the wedding today. Bishop Curry will join a Washington protest over what he calls the president’s “dangerous” leadership.     The first African-American to be primate of the Episcopal Church – a US offshoot of the Church of England – he has branded Trump’s America First policy “a theological heresy for the followers of Christ”. And the Most Rev Bishop Curry has also previously blasted a “crisis of moral and political leadership at the highest levels of our government”.     His invitation came months after the Royal Family confirmed Mr Trump would not be invited to the wedding. Described as a stunning preacher by Archbishop Justin Welby the 65-year-old certainly grabs your attention. The bishop, from Chicago, has previously backed gay marriage and transgender rights. In his autobiography he revealed his parents were descended from slaves and sharecroppers.   He was ordained as a deacon in June 1978. He became the first black presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church in 2015. The Episcopal bishop\u0027s role in the service today was seen as a nod to the actress\u0027s US roots as she married into the British royal family.  Meghan was born in Los Angeles, California, to an African-American mother and was baptised into the Anglican Church ahead of her wedding to Prince Harry. The Episcopal Church is the US offshoot of the Church of England and forms part of the broader Anglican Communion. The bishop\u0027s words rose in a passionate crescendo as he spoke of the link between love and the divine, his style a stark contrast to the sober delivery of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was officiating.For the royal family, the animated performance would be a departure from the type of sermons they normally see at church services.  The wide-ranging address cited love as the key to curing global problems such as poverty. Love can help and heal when nothing else can. There\u0027s power in love to lift up and liberate when nothing else will. Such power could be seen in the service, he continued, saying: Two young people fell in love and we all showed up. In a moment of light self-deprecation, Bishop Curry noted he had to soon sit down, gesturing to the couple and adding we need to get y\u0027all married. The ideas of French thinker Pierre Teilhard de Chardin were called upon as the bishop brought his address to a powerful conclusion.

At a staggering \u0026pound3BILLION, the combined wealth on display as Harry and Meghan exchanged vows was bigger than the national debt of some countries. The Queen sang hymns with famous faces from the world of cinema, television and sport in an unprecedented gathering of stars and royals in one church. The extraordinary line-up saw David Beckham, 43, seated next to Tory MP Sir Nicholas Soames – Winston Churchill’s grandson. US TV superstar Oprah Winfrey – who is worth \u0026pound1billion alone and is a close friend of Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland – was among the first to arrive before taking her seat near the front of St George’s chapel.  British actor Idris Elba, 45, who shot to fame in gritty US drama The Wire, was joined by his fianc\u0026eacutee Sabrina Dhowre, 29. Idris followed Oprah, 64, into the grounds and was later seen hugging James Corden, 39, another successful British telly export.

Becks’ wife Victoria, 44, was dressed in a dark ensemble similar to the one she wore to William and Kate’s wedding.  And the surly fashion designer actually smiled as she hugged Nick Jones, 54, boss of Soho House, whose wife Kirsty Young, 49, was hosting the BBC’s coverage. Meghan and Harry enjoyed some of their first dates at the exclusive members-only club, and Meghan had her hen party at Soho Farmhouse in the Cotswolds. The group chatted as more stars – including singer Marcus Mumford, 31, and actress Carey Mulligan, 32 – took their seats.  Sir Elton John, 71, who famously performed at Diana’s funeral, sported pink-framed glasses as he made an entrance with husband David Furnish, 55. They were later seen talking to the Beckhams and James Blunt, 44, and his wife Sofia Wellesley, 34. Harry is a huge fan of singer James, who is also ex-Forces. Blunt performed at Harry’s Invictus Games in 2016.  Tennis ace Serena Williams, 36, was there to support her friend Meghan on her big day. She had given Meghan advice on walking down the aisle by herself. Like Meghan, Serena’s father was not by her side on her wedding day in November. The former world No1 this week revealed how dad Richard told her by text just an hour before her ceremony that he was “too nervous” to escort her down the aisle when she married Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, 35.  Retired rugby player Mike Tindall, 39, was seen tenderly rubbing wife Zara Phillips’ baby bump. Also in attendance was Joss Stone, who has been friends with Harry and William for years. The singer, 31, is an ambassador for Sentebale, the charity founded by Prince Harry in Lesotho. Meanwhile actor Tom Hardy, 40, looked stony-faced throughout the chapel service, with his actress wife Charlotte Riley, 36, by his side. Charlotte played Kate Middleton in BBC2 drama King Charles III. Bollywood actress Priyanka Chopra, 35, is one of Meghan’s closest friends. She made a splash in a glamorous Vivienne Westwood outfit and large lilac hat, arriving with Suits and Mad Men actress Abigail Spencer.  Meghan’s Suits co-star Patrick Adams, 36, and his wife, Pretty Little Liars star Troian Bellisario, 32, arrived with other cast members including Sarah Rafferty and husband Santtu Seppala, Gina Torres, Rick Hoffman, Gabriel Macht and his wife Jacinda Barrett,  Patrick tweeted: “70 years ago my grandparents Patricia and Cedric Marsh were married in a small service in Windsor,. Just found that out. Already getting misty...” Rugby star James Haskell, 33, and fiancee Chloe Madeley, 30, looked delighted as they joined the stream of famous faces. James used to play cricket with Prince Harry at school.

But while all eyes were on the happy couple, the dress and that kiss, you might have missed what was going on behind them.  There are always subplots to royal weddings - just ask Pippa Middleton , who became an international name on the back of the last one.  So what about this time round?  Let\u0027s take you through them with our sister paper, the Birmingham Mail ...  The British dress stole the show  Meghan looked amazing in a demure gown. And it was designed by acclaimed designer, Clare Waight Keller - who hails from Birmingham. Ms Waight Keller last year became the first female artistic director at the historic French fashion house Givenchy.  The palace said: “Ms Markle expressed the wish of having all 53 countries of the Commonwealth with her on her journey through the ceremony. Ms Waight Keller designed a veil representing the distinctive flora of each Commonwealth country united in one spectacular floral composition.” But while the world was watching here\u0027s some things you might have missed in all the excitement. David Beckham laughing - and Victoria not   David couldn\u0027t hold back a smile during the Royal Wedding address by Bishop Michael Curry.  But Victoria looked less than impressed as she failed to raise a smile for the nuptials, the Liverpool Echo reports . The Pageboys carrying the veil  Meghan had ten pageboys and bridesmaids and they did a sterling job during the wedding. Twin boys Master Brian Mulroney and Master John Mulroney both aged seven, did a great job of carrying Meghan\u0027s huge train. Princess Charlotte nailing the Royal Wave  Princess Charlotte is great at wooing the crowds and today was no exception as she carried out her Royal Wave with aplomb. The Princess stole the show when she went to see her newborn baby brother as she waved to photographers and the assembled crowd.  The three-year-old again delighted the crowds with her little wave. Amazing side-eye  The Royal family struggled to keep it together during the Bishop\u0027s unconventional sermon. Zara Phillips reaction was particularly hilarious, with her incredible side-eye.     The Choir singing stand by me The Choir singing Stand By Me was a real highlight of the wedding, with the crowd outside the chapel joining in the singing. The Kingdom Choir led by Karen Gibson performed Stand By Me—the 1961 classic by Ben E. King.   The choir\u0027s rendition caused goosebumps and was a modern addition to the Royal Wedding. Prince Philip looking well  Prince Philip\u0027s attendance at the Royal Wedding was in doubt as he recovers from a hip operation. But the 96-year-old managed to make it to the nuptials and walked down the aisle without a stick or any assistance.

She cut a solitary figure as Meghan’s only family member at St George’s Chapel, Windsor. Sitting on pews centuries old, where kings and queens went before, the enormity of her daughter’s new role as a royal was visible on her face. Thrust into the limelight in recent weeks as drama surrounded other members of Meghan’s family, Doria was today peerless as the last – and only – relative standing. It is hard to imagine the pressure and overwhelming impact of such a momentous occasion. Yet her \u0026shypresence was quiet and dignified. She smiled beside her daughter as they arrived by royal limo.  Then Doria took her place in the chapel and, once Meghan entered to gasps of admiration, she visibly relaxed. And, just like Princess Diana so often showed the world, love and pride was written across Doria\u0027s face. The controversial circumstances surrounding her family situation and her ex-husband Thomas, 70, who missed the wedding on health grounds seemed to be all forgotten. And Doria’s new family – the Windsors – was on hand to help put her at ease. The 62-year-old yoga teacher took her front row seat alone, yet she was warmly welcomed into the royal fold by Prince Charles – her daughter’s new father-in-law. Royal watchers spoke of heartwarming scenes as Charles took Doria’s hand when they left their seats to join the newlyweds for the signing of the register.  And on leaving the chapel he offered her an arm of support as they faced the world’s media and cheering crowds. Doria was on Charles’s right arm and his wife, Duchess of Cornwall Camilla, was on the other. Charles looked tickled and a smile broke across Doria’s face. Then the trio posed for photographs alongside Prince William and his wife Kate – and the Queen herself. Doria seemed to enjoy every moment after shedding tears earlier when, understandably, the royal occasion caught up with her. Dressed in green coat and matching dress by Oscar De La Renta, Doria was a picture of pride, taking every opportunity to gaze adoringly at her daughter. And Meghan looked back with equal love. Their bond mirrors the incredible warmth Harry and his brother William shared with mum Diana. The princess, killed in a car crash in 1997, would have been every bit as proud as Doria had she been able to share this special day. But she was not forgotten. From the flowers in Meghan’s bouquet – handpicked from Kensington Palace gardens – to the music and readings, the couple ensured that Diana’s presence was felt.  In one moving tribute they chose a Bible reading about the power of eternal love, read by Diana’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes. Lady Jane, 61, triggered tears among the 600 guests as she quoted from the eighth chapter of the Song of Solomon. She read: “My beloved speaks and says to me: ‘Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone’.” Lady Jane was joined at the service by Diana’s other sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale and her brother Earl Spencer, along with Harry’s cousins in the Spencer family. Also present in the congregation was former Prime Minister Sir John Major, who was appointed special  to Harry and William, responsible for legal and administrative matters when their mother died. No British or overseas dignitaries were invited to the wedding, but Sir John’s presence was a reminder of a pivotal role that he played in Harry’s life at a difficult time. Earlier, when Meghan arrived at the West Steps of St George’s Chapel at midday, she was carrying a bouquet with Diana’s favourite flowers.  Nestled among blooms picked at Kensington and myrtle sprigs, which are traditional in royal bouquets, were the distinctive white petals of forget-me-nots, the late princess’s most-loved flower. And adorning the walls of the historic chapel were arches of flowers including white roses, another of Diana’s favourites that were poignantly planted in her memory at Kensington Palace over the summer. As soon as details of the wedding were announced, Harry said he wanted to “celebrate the memory of the late Princess on the wedding day”. Harry would have been particularly moved as the congregation sang the final hymn. He and Meghan chose Guide Me O Thy Great Redeemer – which was played at Diana’s 1997 funeral. William and Kate also included it in their wedding. The poignant touches were important to Harry, who was just 12 when his mother died. In heartbreaking images, he and William walked behind their mother’s coffin at her State funeral in September 1997. Today the princes shared memories of their mother as they waited for Meghan to arrive at the chapel.  When Harry spotted a tearful Doria before the ceremony began he looked across to try to catch her eye in a supportive gesture. Doria sat with her daughter’s closest friends – Jessica Mulroney and Heather Dorak. She had accompanied Meghan to the chapel after spending Friday night together at nearby Cliveden House, in Taplow, Berks. There had been suggestions that Doria might have taken on the \u0026shyresponsibility of walking her daughter down the aisle after her ex-husband Thomas was admitted to hospital earlier this week for heart surgery. Thomas did watch the wedding on TV and he told celebrity news website TMZ: “My baby looks beautiful and she looks very happy. I wish them all my love and all happiness.” In his absence today, Charles stepped up to walk Meghan down the last part of her journey down the aisle. And as the pictures of Charles and Doria on the chapel steps showed, while they come from very different worlds, they bonded over a love for their children which is the same the whole world over. By Nicola Small and Victoria Murphy Harry and Meghan made sure Princess Diana was not forgotten on their special day. From the flowers in Meghan’s bouquet to the music and the reading at the service, the couple ensured her presence was felt – 21 years after her crash death. The only reading was about the power of eternal love, with Diana’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes, 61, triggering tears as she said from the Old Testament Song of Solomon: “My beloved speaks and says to me, ‘Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone’.” She was joined at the service by Diana’s other sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, and her brother Earl Spencer, along with Harry’s Spencer family cousins. Also present was former Prime Minister John Major, who was appointed special  to Princes Harry and William, responsible for legal and administrative matters, when Diana died in the Paris underpass. No British or overseas dignitaries were invited to the wedding, so Mr Major’s presence was a reminder of the pivotal role he played in Harry’s life at a traumatic time. When Meghan arrived at St George’s Chapel, she was carrying a bouquet with Diana’s beloved forget-me-nots. The white petals of Diana’s favourite nestled among blooms picked from Kensington Palace gardens and myrtle sprigs, which are traditional in royal bouquets. Adorning the walls of the 500-year-old chapel were arches of flowers, including white roses, another of Diana’s favourites that were planted in her memory at the palace gardens over the summer. As soon as details of the wedding were announced, Harry said he wanted to “celebrate the memory of the late Princess on the wedding day”. Harry was emotional throughout the service and was particularly moved as the congregation sang the final hymn, Guide Me O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Diana’s 1997 funeral. William and Kate also included it their wedding. Given pride of place in the chapel was Diana’s close friend Julia Samuel, with her husband Michael. Julia is godmother to Prince George and has remained close to William and Harry following Diana’s death, with Meghan previously talking about how much she enjoyed meeting her."},{"url":null,"title":"spare seat princess diana harry","story":"NewsSpare seat for Princess Diana?

As Meghan Markle met her prince at the altar, cameras showed Prince Charles, Camilla and Kate looking up at the happy couple. And in front of the Queen - next to Harry\u0027s big brother - was an empty spot. Royal fans said the sentimental move left them tearful and thinking of the late princess. There was also speculation the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did the same at their wedding in 2011. But according to Buckingham Palace sources, the spot in front of the Queen is always left empty.  If it\u0027s true, what a lovely idea, one person wrote on Twitter. Di will be looking down at her son feeling nothing but pride. I can\u0027t stop crying, another wrote. Such a moving day already - and now this. Harry and Meghan also had a floral tribute to Princess Diana at the wedding.    St George\u0027s Chapel, in Windsor, was adorned with floral displays of foliage, white peonies, white garden roses and other white blooms, which towered above the seats. White garden flowers were a favourite of Harry\u0027s late mum. And forget-me-nots, another favourite, were used in the bridal bouquet.      Sir Elton John also performed at Harry and Meghan\u0027s lunchtime wedding reception. The singer has a close relationship with Harry and his brother, the Duke of Cambridge, and was friends with the Princess of Wales. In 1997, he famously sang a re-worked version of his hit Candle In The Wind at the princess\u0027s funeral, changing the words to Goodbye England\u0027s Rose.    In a TV interview in June, 2008, he told how singing at the funeral was a surreal experience. He said: What was going through my mind was, \u0027Don\u0027t f*** this up. Don\u0027t sing a wrong note. Don\u0027t sing the wrong note. Be stoic. Don\u0027t break down and just do it to the best you can possibly do it without showing any emotion whatsoever\u0027.  The singer was also present at William\u0027s wedding to the Duchess of Cambridge in 2011. Meghan and Harry sealed their love with a kiss after being declared husband and wife this afternoon. The bride arrived at church in a wedding dress designed by Clare Waight Keller , which was set off by a veil made to represent all 53 countries of the Commonwealth. Harry arrived at St George\u0027s chapel at Windsor Castle a short while before Meghan alongside best man Prince William.  The couple kissed after the ceremony finished before getting into a royal horse-drawn carriage for a 30-minute procession as thousands of fans lined the streets . They are now back inside Windsor Castle for a reception where Meghan, Harry and Prince Charles will all make speeches. Global superstars including Elton John, Oprah Winfrey, David Beckham and George Clooney were there to watch the wedding, as well as the Queen and Prince Philip. The couple were this morning made the Duke and Duchess of Sussex by the Queen in a wedding day honour.

Becky Gendall suffered horrendous injuries when she jumped 60ft off a car park to end the anguish of a teenage battle with anorexia and anxiety. She shattered bones all over her body but was pieced back together by surgeons in 21 ops. As she lay for weeks on end in hospital, the nurses became her best friends. And now she has recovered she is training to become a nurse herself – on a placement at the hospital which saved her. Becky, now 20, says: “I wanted to end my life but now I feel so lucky to be alive. If I can help look after others the way they looked after me, I will be happy.”  Becky has bravely decided to tell her incredible story in a bid to help other youngsters with mental health problems. She was a talented competitive ice skater when her problems began while still at school. Desperate to keep her weight down, she plunged into a spiral of eating less and less until she was living on just 400 calories a day – a fifth of the recommended intake. Finally in May 2014, at the age of 16, she reached breaking point from the torture of her advancing eating disorder. She left the home she shared with her parents and little sister in \u0026shyBracknell, Berkshire, travelled to the town centre and hurled herself off the top of a car park. Horrified high street shoppers saw her plunge to the pavement, landing with such force she broke bones in her jaw, elbow, legs, feet, ribs, ankles, spine, pelvis and suffered serious internal bleeding.  She was airlifted 50 miles to University Hospital Southampton in critical condition. Doctors and nurses fought to save her life with repeated blood transfusions. She was then put in a coma for over a week as her injuries were treated. The gifted young athlete’s body was so badly smashed that dozens of metal bolts, screws and plates were needed to piece it back together. Becky’s car park leap came at the peak of her mental illness yet it also marked a turning point in her journey back to health. A year earlier she had tried to kill herself with an overdose at school, after which her eating disorder was uncovered. She was given weekly cognitive behavioural therapy and weigh-ins to track her weight, which fell to just 7st.  But as well as spurning food she hit the gym several times a day, making her even thinner and isolating her from her parents, who we have agreed not to name. She says: “It felt like I wasn’t underweight enough to get the proper care I needed. “I’d been suffering anorexia and depression for two years when I developed anxiety. It all got too much to cope with and I wanted it all to end.” Becky spent eight weeks in hospital, mostly bedbound. She recalls: “It was very lonely. I wasn’t always well enough to have visitors and when I was visiting hours were limited. “The nurses became my best friends. Sometimes their shifts had finished but they would sit with me for hours until my painkillers kicked in or I fell asleep. They were angels. “Seeing how nurses can make all the difference to a child’s life on the ward was eye-opening. “Hospitals are frightening places for children and when you couple that with pain or feeling unwell and being apart from your family, the nurses’ role becomes even more important.” Though Becky has now recovered enough to train as a paediatric nursing student, she has lasting reminders of her ordeal.  Repairs to her jaw, which was fractured in two places, have altered her face and her right foot is fixed, making skating and dancing difficult. Becky says: “My face doesn’t look the same as it did and finding shoes and heels to wear is harder, but I’m lucky to be alive so it’s a small price to pay.” While in hospital she was visited by the Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) team but there was no dedicated space for their appointments. She recalls: “I was talking about why I’d tried to end my life while sat in a communal kitchen with visitors popping in to make tea. “It wasn’t the mental health team’s fault, that’s just how limited the provisions are. But they were still a huge support.” Doctors also encouraged her to eat properly again and she credits golden retriever Leo, a specially trained Pets As Therapy dog, for giving her a boost. Leo cheered her up every week when he visited the children’s ward with his handler, volunteer Lyndsey Uglow.  Becky says: “I’d always wanted a puppy so having Leo pop in was great. Sometimes he gave me cuddles, other times he distracted me when the pain was too much.” Becky, who is now in the second year of her nursing degree, has become a vocal advocate of mental health support for teenagers with eating disorders. Research shows early intervention is the key for helping children recover from mental health problems, yet the NHS spends just 0.7 per cent of its budget in this area. Three in four children with a diagnosable condition do not get access to the support they need, and those who do have to wait 10 months on average. Tom Madders of mental health charity YoungMinds said: “Every day we get calls from parents who don’t know where to turn.” What she broke When Becky plunged to the pavement off a high street car park she landed with such force she was left with devastating injuries. She shattered bones in her jaw, elbow, legs, feet, ribs, ankles, spine, pelvis and suffered terrible internal bleeding. She was put in a coma and spent weeks in hospital.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle treated well-wishers to two special kisses on their wedding day, one on the chapel steps and the other in their carriage during their ride around Windsor.  But it was the first one, outside St George\u0027s Chapel, which will become one of the most iconic photographs from the happy day. And the sweet moment is even more special because there\u0027s a touching story behind it.  The tradition of popping out onto the Buckingham Palace balcony to wave to crowds was started by Princess Victoria in 1858. But newly married royal couples didn\u0027t always share a kiss after saying their vows, and they just used to stand awkwardly next to each other and wave. How romantic. It was Prince Harry\u0027s parents Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer who started the sweet tradition after deciding to have a little kiss during their balcony moment after their 1981 wedding.  Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson followed their lead and kissed, and Kate and Wills shared two kisses on the balcony.  Harry and Meghan married at Windsor Castle, which means they didn\u0027t get their balcony kiss moment. But they recreated it best they could on the church\u0027s steps, with members of the royal family and Meghan\u0027s mum standing behind them. They delighted crowds with a tender kiss, and they couldn\u0027t resist another smooch during their carriage ride.  After the procession the couple went back to the castle for a reception hosted by the Queen. They then changed into their party gear and drove in a Jaguar E-Type sports car to the evening reception, hosted by Prince Charles.

In the first, 15-year-old Meghan sits on black painted railings outside Buckingham Palace. The grainy photograph shows Meghan in slip-on sandals and sunnies, smiling alongside a pal with her whole life ahead of her. In the second, she is a 36-year-old bride - marrying a prince in front of the whole world. Life is full of surprises, one royal fan wrote on Twitter. One day you\u0027re 15 and posing outside Buckingham Palace and 22 years later you\u0027re marrying the prince. What a love story - a true princess in waiting, another said.  Prince Harry and Meghan got married in a dazzling ceremony that blended ancient English ritual with African-American culture yesterday. The celebration, watched up close by royals and celebrities and from afar by a global TV audience of millions, has made history. The two photographs placed side-by-side serve as a reminder of the vast opportunities that stretch out before you age 15. And a love story is made all the better when it has a happy ending. Harry and Meghan were first introduced in London in July 2016 through mutual friends, but they did not start dating straight away. Meghan was still based in her adopted hometown of Toronto, where her US drama Suits is filmed.    They met while Harry was promoting the Invictus Games - an event he helped launch for disabled military personnel - in London, and Meghan shared a picture of herself visiting Buckingham Palace on July 5. She had also been spotted in the royal box at Wimbledon in late June, prompting speculation she was already well acquainted with Harry\u0027s family. Then, in October 2016, the first rumours surrounding their relationship began swirling when the pair were seen at a halloween-party-ideas-budget-2017-9116382\u0026gtHalloween party in Toronto. It was first thought they pair had been dating for around a month, but Meghan later told Vanity Fair they had managed to keep their romance under wraps for an impressive six months.      We were very quietly dating for about six months before it became news, and I was working during that whole time, and the only thing that changed was people\u0027s perception, she said in October 2017. Nothing about me changed. I\u0027m still the same person that I am, and I\u0027ve never defined myself by my relationship. Once the speculation started bubbling, it did not take long before their relationship was blown into the public sphere. Just two weeks after the news broke, Harry took the unprecedented step of blasting the media for prying into Meghan\u0027s private life - and even called out trolls for making racist comments about her. The statement was the first time Harry called Meghan his girlfriend in public as he warned the media to steer clear.    His girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has been subject to a wave of abuse and harassment, the statement read. Some of this has been very public - the smear on the front page of a national newspaper the racial undertones of comment pieces and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments. It went on: Prince Harry is worried about Ms. Markle’s safety and is deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her. It is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms. Markle should be subjected to such a storm. He knows commentators will say this is ‘the price she has to pay’ and that ‘this is all part of the game’. He strongly disagrees. This is not a game - it is her life and his. He has asked for this statement to be issued in the hopes that those in the press who have been driving this story can pause and reflect before any further damage is done. He knows that it is unusual to issue a statement like this, but hopes that fair-minded people will understand why he has felt it necessary to speak publicly.  The pair fell love with Africa separately but it was their first trip together as a couple which sealed their romantic fate. Even before the pair met, they were both involved in various charity projects which saw them visiting the sun-soaked continent. Prince Harry often visited as part of his work for the royal\u0027s charity Sentebale and his role as patron for Rhino Conservation Botswana, while Meghan headed to Rwanda when she was a global ambassador for World Vision. However, it is Botswana that already sits at the forefront of their love story. Prince Harry whisked Meghan away for a luxury safari break just four weeks after their first date. Speaking to the BBC in their engagement interview, Harry said: I managed to persuade her to come and join me in Botswana. We camped out with each other under the stars. She came and joined me for five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic.  Meghan did a glossy covershoot and interview with Vanity Fair in October 2017, in which she repeatedly called the royal her boyfriend and gushed about their relationship. We\u0027re a couple. We\u0027re in love, she said. I\u0027m sure there will be a time when we will have to come forward and present ourselves and have stories to tell, but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time. This is for us. It\u0027s part of what makes it so special, that it\u0027s just ours. But we\u0027re happy. Personally, I love a great love story. I can tell you that at the end of the day I think it\u0027s really simple. We\u0027re two people who are really happy and in love. Just seven months after they met, Harry reportedly took Meghan to London to meet his brother Prince William and sister-in-law Kate Middleton - the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.  He is also thought to have introduced his girlfriend to the Queen on Mother\u0027s Day, Sunday March 26 2017. She came with him to Kate\u0027s sister Pippa Middleton\u0027s wedding in May, carefully avoiding the cameras by getting Harry to pick her up after the church ceremony and just in time for the evening reception. The two were seen together at the Invictus Games in Toronto on September 25 2017. Dressed down in skinny ripped jeans, a white shirt and sunglasses, Meghan laughed and smiled as Harry whispered in her ear in full view of spectators. They cosied up together with lots of affectionate touches - and were even spotted kissing inside their private box where Meghan\u0027s mum Doria and her best friends Markus Anderson and Jessica Mulroney were given seats. Kensington Palace announced the couple were engaged on November 27 2017 following weeks of speculation. Later that day, they did an interview with BBC presenter Mishal Husain and revealed extra romantic details about the engagemet.  Meghan admitted it was sweet, natural and very romantic and just a standard typical night in for the pair. The actress admitted she barely let her husband-to-be finish proposing before she said: Can I say yes now? One of their first appearances was at Reprezent 107.3FM in Brixton, south London, in January. The pair later made a trip to Cardiff where Meghan was asked by sisters Anne and Judy Daley - who brought a veil, plastic tiara and bridal sash gift for Meghan - to ask if she would hold her hen party in Cardiff. The beaming actress told them: I bet that would be a lot of fun, before being led away by Prince Harry. In reality the star had a rather quieter hen do in the Cotswolds. Days before the wedding, the pair\u0027s plans were thrown into chaos after Meghan\u0027s father, Thomas Markle, pulled out of the ceremony.

The glorious sunshine is set to stay for at least another two weeks meaning we are looking at a sizzling Bank Holiday next weekend with temperature soaring to 23C. This week is expected to remain dry with just a few scattered thunder showers expected to bring a short-lived dampener. Tomorrow the majority of the UK will have another dry, sunny and warm day - although north west Scotland and the bulk of Northern Ireland will be cloudy, damp and breezy, according to the Met Office.  Various computer models show the pleasant spell continuing until the end of May with the fine conditions dominating for some time. A spokesperson for The Weather Channel said: “From this weekend and throughout next week, temperatures will be above normal across much of Europe. “This is due to an area of high pressure becoming dominant. “Forecast models indicate that above normal temperatures are likely to persist for the rest of May.” The Met Office forecasts that most places will stay dry and warm this week, but there could be isolated thundery showers across England and Wales.

There was the pomp the world expects of the Royal Family. The ceremony which the Church of England does so well. The reminder that our Royal Family spans more than this nation with Meghan’s veil embroidered with the flowers of each Commonwealth country. And a guest list that mixed ancient titles with 21st-century celebrity – Oprah Winfrey, George and Amal Clooney, David and Victoria Beckham and Sir Elton John. Meghan and Harry wanted the world to know they are a thoroughly modern couple while maintaining centuries-old traditions.   His break with Royal tradition was to wear a wedding ring, hers not to promise to obey and to make a reception speech. Ben E King’s soul classic Stand by Me was perfectly in tune with Schubert, a gospel choir with the English Chamber Orchestra. Chicago bishop Michael Curry brought a touch of American evangelism to proceedings as he echoed Martin Luther King. “There’s power in love,” he said. And today who could disagree? You only had to look at the faces of Harry and Meghan.  They shone with the promise of a couple determined to use that power for good causes close to their hearts. Donations were preferred to gifts so others less fortunate would benefit. Politicians were cold-shouldered, aside from Sir John Major as a member of the Order of the Garter and Tory MP Nicholas Soames as Prince Charles’s friend. And instead 1,200 ordinary people who had gone about their lives quietly doing extraordinary things were recognised by being invited into the Windsor Castle grounds. It was a feelgood day for Britain and the watching world, and everyone felt good. For the 100,000 spectators who poured into Windsor early a glimpse of the happy couple was worth the wait. Princess Diana would both have approved and been delighted after her attempts to make the Royals less stuffy. Prince Harry must have felt her absence keenly.  She was the people’s princess. This was the people’s wedding. And it is a measure of just how far the Royal Family has come since 1997 and Diana’s death, when they seemed aloof and remote. The future of the Monarchy was genuinely in question and it was the Queen who gently steered it back into public affection. William and Harry have given it the youthful, human face it needs. Today we saw the best of Britain as Britain did what it does best – wrapping up our nation’s past in a gift of hope for the future. And on behalf of all our readers we hope the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are now embarking on a very happy future together.

Veronica German has spoken about her experience of being among the royals and famous names like George and Amal Clooney, David and Victoria Beckham and Oprah Winfrey. The charity director from Wales was one of the guests who was invited to the service at St George\u0027s Chapel and the drinks reception that followed it. Veronica, who runs Dolen Cymru, said some of her highlights were chatting to Meghan\u0027s former co-stars of TV drama Suits and hearing Sir Elton John performing at the drinks reception following the service. She told Wales Online how she grabbed a chat with Meghan\u0027s former on screen husband in the series, Patrick J Adams. I asked him if he was really upset that she\u0027s married someone else and he said, \u0027How can I be upset when I just got to listen to Elton John. He made my day\u0027.  Prince Harry has been the patron of Dolen Cymru, which builds links between Wales and Lesotho, since 2007 and Veronica received the invitation through her work. It was like being at a family wedding really, she said. It was quite normal in some respects with some nice music and it was lovely singing Cwm Rhondda. And then we went to the reception and there was Elton John singing Your Song. The mother of three, who lives in Llanfrechfa, near Cwmbran, set her alarm for 4.30am to leave the house an hour later for the drive to Windsor. She was driven by her husband Mike German, a former member of the Welsh Assembly and member of the House of Lords - but she didn\u0027t receive a plus one so he waited in the car with a picnic.  So how does being a royal wedding guest actually work out? After stopping at Reading Service Station to do her make up, they made it to the designated car park outside Windsor on time where guests had to wait in a holding room. Then they were bussed to the chapel more than an hour before the service was due to begin at noon - with toilet facilities only available until 11am. We walked past the crowds into the chapel and I recognised quite a few people, said Veronica. You could sit anywhere you wanted in the chapel and I was next to James Blunt and his wife. We just had a normal chat. Veronica even caught a glimpse of Harry and William.  She said: I couldn\u0027t really see the royal family as they came in through a different door to us but we saw William and Harry - and Harry looked a bit nervous. Meghan looked beautiful - when she arrived I just thought how much smaller she was than I thought she would be and her dress was so white with a lovely, lovely long veil. She looked like she was really enjoying herself. And the little bridesmaids were just hysterical - they kept looking all over the place. Meghan walked up the aisle as Welsh soprano Elin Manahan Thomas sung George Frideric Handel\u0027s Eternal Source of Light Divine. She sounded amazing, said Veronica. She really did Wales proud. One of her favourite parts of the service was the sermon by Bishop Michael Curry.  He was incredible - he was so genuine, so real. Following the service, the guests walked to St George\u0027s Hall for the drinks reception. Veronica told: The crowds were cheering when we walked out. We missed the carriage with the bride and groom but there were lots of people still there. While Veronica didn\u0027t meet the royals, she mingled with many famous names at the reception and listened as Elton John sang a few tracks, including Your Song. Both the groom and the Prince of Wales gave speeches during the reception. Prince Charles said it was a very emotional time for him seeing his youngest child getting married and every time Harry said \u0027my wife\u0027 everyone cheered.

This mighty brood – “unique” according to a fertility expert – left Julie and Lance Erickson feeling they’d really hit the jackpot. They spent years trying for kids and umpteen rounds of IVF failed. Then they won a draw in which the prize was a course of fertility treatment – and this time it worked. Doctors produced 10 viable embryos, implanted two in Julie and froze the rest for future use. Now the couple have seven kids. They are quite a handful and quite a mouthful – there’s Kaitlyn, Caleb, Cody, Chelsea, Kelsey, Caden and Colton. Fertility expert Rob Smith, clinic director at CARE London, said: ‘‘This is an amazing story.  “At CARE fertility we have had many babies born following one initial round of fertility treatment – each subsequent baby being born separately using a frozen embryo. “However, seven babies, conceptually septuplets from a single IVF cycle, is surely a unique event.” Julie and Lance had almost given up on having kids when they won the prize draw. The 10 embryos were all conceived in a laboratory at the same time in 2007. And their prize family includes THREE sets of twins. Julie, 40, said: “When we won the raffle, I think I just went into shock. Lance started sobbing. I was so happy. I felt it was a gift from God.” Kaitlyn, now nine, was the first born, in July 2008. The rest of the embryos remained in the clinic’s freezer and were taken out in twos as the couple underwent more fertility treatment over the years. Julie went on to have identical twins Caleb and Cody, six, and twins Chelsea and Kelsey, four. The youngest set are Caden and Colton, who will be one on May 31. The couple married in 2001 and waited a couple of years before trying for a family. But each month brought heartbreak as pregnancy tests showed “negative”.  Julie, from Minnesota, U.S., said: “It was one of the worst times of my life. Many people don’t understand how hard it is. “Going to other people’s baby showers and even going to church on Mother’s Day was very difficult during those years.” Eventually they decided to try IVF... but the first cycle failed. They had a further three rounds of treatment costing thousands of dollars – and each one brought disappointment. Doctors feared Julie’s immune system was going into overdrive and rejecting the embryos in her womb. Then a local fertility clinic hosted a Family Building Conference which put on a raffle with free IVF as the prize. The Ericksons attended the open day and entered the draw. By then, Julie feared that her dream of having a child would never come to reality. She admitted: “Sometimes I did start to lose hope. “It was an emotional rollercoaster and I doubted that I would ever be a mother.” But to their surprise and delight, the couple won the raffle and wasted no time in starting IVF. Julie had two embryos planted into her womb, with a further eight being stored in deep freeze.  But this time medics also suppressed her immune system to stop her body rejecting the embryos and give them a fighting chance of thriving. Julie added: “We had two embryos put back, but only one carried on growing. We were sad at the first scan that we could only see one heart beating, but we were so thankful for that one heart. It was beating so strongly. “It was surreal when Kaitlyn was born. It was amazing to be holding our baby in our arms after five years of trying.” Three years later, in 2011, the \u0026shyEricksons were ready to add to their family and Julie had two more embryos implanted. One failed and the second divided into two – producing healthy twins Cody and Caleb. And in 2014, doctors defrosted another two of the original 10 embryos and implanted those. Julie fell pregnant and had twins Chelsea and Kelsey. She went on: “Every time I find out I’m having twins I’m happily excited. But it’s definitely challenging. I’m not going to lie – it’s hard work. But it’s worth it.

Mary Kinninmonth, director of Dundee’s Citizens Advice Bureau, said UC’s online system hampers less computer-literate claimants.She said: “The main things we see are people still having difficulty in making and managing online claims due to lack of confidence and/or knowledge of computer skills.“The helpline is also very difficult to get through to with long waiting times.“Even though the waiting time has reduced, there is still a waiting time – which will often mean people going into rent arrears.”Full service UC rolled out in Dundee in November, following a trial period for new single applicants.The number of Universal Credit issues dealt with by Dundee CAB has risen by almost 50% following the introduction of the full service.Dundee City Council gives UC claimants a reprieve over their arrears, acknowledging the delayed payouts the DWP makes from month to month.A spokesman for the authority said a £250,000 hardship fund for council tenants was created in April 2016, boosted to £450,000 for this year.He added: “We continue to do a considerable amount work to support tenants on Universal Credit.“If a tenant is having difficulties paying their rent a referral to the Council Advice Service is made. Staff there can offer help and assistance.”A spokeswoman for the DWP said claimants can receive advance payments if required from day one.She added: “We have removed the seven-day waiting period from new claims and pay people’s Housing Benefit for two weeks while they wait for their first full Universal Credit payment.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/PA-28105789-843x564.jpg ","title":"dundee announce signing of french midfielder","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee have announced the signing of a French midfielder.Elton Ngwatala has penned a deal at Dens Park and is Neil McCann\u0026#8217s first signing of the summer.The Dark Blues have snapped up the 24-year-old attacking player on a two-year deal despite interest from down south.Ngwatala previously played for Kidderminster Harriers in two spells at the National League North side.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afc0094a37a7-e1526475640876-928x564.jpg ","title":"dundee boss neil mccann admits hes made mistakes but looks to learn from them","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee boss Neil McCann says he had higher targets for his team this past season but insists an early start can get the Dark Blues where he wants them to be this time next year.A ninth-placed finish in the Premiership fell short of his stated top-half aim but Neil insists he learned a lot from his debut campaign as a manager.He said: “I think you have to self-analyse.“I’ve made mistakes, as a young manager I think that’s normal but, hopefully, if you’re learning from those it will put you in a better position next season.“In terms of going into the last five games, I learned a lot from my squad.“There was huge pressure going into the Hamilton game.“We knew it could have been a total role reversal and our goal difference was poorer so we knew the risk we were playing under but the players were brave and in it together.“That’ll help me 100% next season.

The action kicks off at 6.30pm and entry is free.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ex dundee defender julen linked with inverness move","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee defender Julen Etxabeguren could line up against the Dark Blues\u0026#8217 rivals in the Championship next season.Inverness are reportedly leading the charge to sign the centre back.The 27-year-old was nearly sent on loan to the Highlands in January, only for injury to scupper any move.Dundee announced that the Basque defender was among nine players to have left the club yesterday.Julen\u0026#8217s last season at Dens was blighted by injury with an Achilles problem then a dislocated shoulder.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afe9a596562a.jpg ","title":"folk from jamaica and poland sleeping rough on dundee streets as numbers rise","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRough sleepers from as far as Jamaica and Poland have been spotted in the streets of Dundee, as charity bosses call for help to meet a rise in the number of homeless people in the city.Night Ministry Street Angels and the Eagles Wings Trust have both expressed concerns at a sudden increase of people sleeping on the streets not previously known to the organisations.Since the end of April, the Night Ministry has helped nine people without roofs over their heads.Although the charity was able to offer assistance to all of them, Night Ministry’s Gareth Norman, pictured, said attitudes towards the homeless problem needed to change. “This is Dundee, it’s the 21st Century – what’s going on with our society?” he said.“I have also come across what looks like just some old rags and litter thrown in corner.“This was actually a rough sleeper’s attempt to get some shelter from the rain. They had used an orange survival bag over an old duvet, sticking their head in under the old fireplace for cover and placing their feet in a thermal shopping bag for warmth.”Gareth said that on Wednesday night the charity helped two women who needed medical attention.He added: “Our outreach patrol was kept busy that evening as we gave out lots of hot chocolate drinks, made two new street friends, issued two sleeping bags, cleansed and dressed one girl’s self-harming wounds on both her lower arms and transported another female street beggar to A\u0026ampE.”On May 12 Gareth said the team gave hot drinks to two homeless people who were sheltering in a church foyer.Five days earlier he helped a 47-year-old Jamaican man sleeping on a bench in Riverside Drive who was heading north.“We were able to supply him with a sleeping bag, hot drinks and advice and directed him to more suitable sheltered location,” he said.Gareth said that, the day before, he had spoken with three rough sleepers who told him they had been refused assistance from the authorities.Mike Cordiner, of the Eagles Wings Trust, said: “There seems to be a rise in the number of people coming to Dundee from other areas. I am aware of someone from Jamaica and a person from Poland currently sleeping rough in Dundee.“If you come from outwith the city the authorities do not find you somewhere to sleep.“This needs to change.”A council spokeswoman said: “We understand that being homeless is difficult and traumatic and our aim is to offer a service that is sympathetic as well as meeting our statutory duties.“When we are contacted the first thing that happens is an assessment interview within three working days, or if a person is ‘roofless’ they will be seen on the same day.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afe9b7427711-e1526642317159-877x564.jpg ","title":"highly rated dundee youngsters mull over new deals","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee have offered new contracts to youngsters Matty Henvey and Jesse Curran.Two stars in the club’s impressive Development side last season, Curran and Henvey have stepped up to the first team on multiple occasions over the past year and the Dee are keen to keep them.Both have shown they have something to offer the senior side in the future.Henvey demonstrated his goalscoring prowess in his fourth appearance for the top team, netting an important goal at Hamilton in a 2-1 victory.That strike also spelled the end of his season, however, as he was caught on the knee by Accies midfielder Darian MacKinnon, who hurt himself in the process.Curran, meanwhile, was a real stand-out for the U/20s all season as they finished second in the Development League.The Australian made eight appearances for the first team in the last campaign, very much impressing against Partick Thistle, in particular.Both have their current deals coming to an end this summer.Meanwhile, Dundee have been linked with a move for Partick Thistle left-back Callum Booth.The 26-year-old could be brought in to replace the departing Kevin Holt and Jon Aurtenetxe with the squad bare in the left full-back department.That all depends on whether Partick can keep themselves in the top flight with the former Hibs man free to leave if the club get relegated.n the club have sold 2,500 season tickets for the new campaign, a “huge increase on the same stage” last year, according to Dundee.The Early Bird Period is still running until June

The police are never out of there,” she said.“Why are they creating a new community campus and putting this right smack bang in the middle?‘‘It’s disgraceful.”Tom Henney, who drew up a petition against the custody unit, said he wasn’t opposed to the SPS proposals.‘‘My opinion is still the same – nobody has any objection to what they’re trying to do but there are other areas better suited for this,” he said.“My biggest concern is if (offenders) get out.‘‘There are drugs, there is crime and it shouldn’t be here.”However, Ann Hutchison, 57, who lives two minutes from Our Lady’s, said she was “keeping an open mind” on the plans.She added: “I’m glad the prison service are out speaking to the community. They should be.”Councillors were also in attendance at the information session, but couldn’t comment directly on the proposals as they are yet to come through the planning system.The SPS’s Tom Fox said it was inevitable that locals were concerned, but added: “Most of these are based on ideas of something that this unit isn’t.‘‘It is not a prison.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afe9ae43941b-846x564.jpg ","title":"thousands across dundee celebrate ramadan and locals invited to join evening meal","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThousands of Muslims in Dundee have started celebrating the holy month of Ramadan – and locals are being invited to take part to find out more about the festival.Ramadan takes place in the ninth month of the Islamic calendar and commemorates the first revelation of the Koran to Muhammad.Bashir Chohan, head of Dundee Islamic Society, said that as of Thursday, Muslims from 13 nationalities across the city were observing the event.Mr Chohan said: “It is an important event in the Muslim calendar and involves a period of fasting for the next 30 days.“We fast from dawn until dusk when we are allowed to begin eating again.“I have my first meal of the day at 9.30pm when we usually begin eating with a selection of snacks.“We eat all sorts of food at this time from east and west and often begin with a cold drink or a milkshake.”Mr Chohan explained that fasting was for adults with children beginning to take part from the age of about 10-12.He said: “It is up to children and their families to decide when the children can cope with fasting.”Mr Choham said that at night, following the breaking of the fast, Muslims would be going along to the five mosques in the city to pray.“We listen to the Imam reciting from the Koran for an hour and we say special prayers,” he said.“And while at the mosque we serve around 300 to 400 meals a night to visitors.”During Ramadam, Mr Chohan said that Muslims were also expected to be on their best behaviour at all times.“Of course we should always be on our best behaviour but it is particularly important during Ramadan,” he said.“Ramadan is a very spiritual time for us. It is a peaceful time and an opportunity to repair body and soul.“We eat for the rest of the year and it is an order from God to obey his rules and take part in fasting and prayer during Ramadan.”Mr Chohan said that, as always, he would welcome Dundee residents to visit the mosques during Ramadan.He said: “Anyone is welcome to visit our mosques and take part in what is happening during the month.“We would be delighted for people to come along and see what we do and take part if they so wish.“Women as well as men are very welcome to attend. We are happy to share our religious beliefs and traditions with everyone in Dundee.”Ramadan began this year on May 15 and will end on Thursday June 14.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Times Past  Looking back at life Doon the Watter","story":"                          Evocative Images from the Archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7702341.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Everything drivers need to know about today s Race for Life road closures","story":"                          GLASGOW will be transformed into a sea of pink today\u0026nbspas the annual Race for Life event gets underway."},{"url":null,"title":"Celtic fans rush to buy new    Only the Bold    home kit ahead of Scottish Cup final","story":"                          CELTIC\u0026rsquoS new 2018/19 home kit has hit stores - and supporters can\u0026rsquot get enough of it ahead of the big Scottish Cup final on Saturday."},{"url":null,"title":"New footbridge is a link across the River Clyde","story":"                          A 130 metre lifted the five giant beams making up the base of Polmadie Bridge."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7777769.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Football on TV  Where to watch Celtic v Motherwell  Chelsea v Manchester United and more","story":"                          THE time has almost come for Celtic and Motherwell to do battle for the final major honour in Scotland this season."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7810186.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Public consultation to open next week on   9m plans for Byres Road","story":"                          A PUBLIC consultation on design proposals for the future of Byres Road will begin next week.

But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community. It\u0027 innovative and there are a variety of ways to use it.\"The artwork is believed to be static and radically different from the previous offering.Fellow city councillor Duncan Macpherson said: \"The whole thing looks good. I think people who use this walkway regularly will be impressed. It\u0027 enhancing.\"People will be happy with it because they\u0026rsquove heeded public opinion.\"They\u0026rsquove taken the key aspects of the best features of the River Ness \u0026ndash its shape, the salmon fishing, the popularity of it. It enhances a current meeting place and it\u0027 a natural walkway.\"It\u0027 a good design, in the right place and way better. It\u0027 a natural \u0026lsquogathering place\u0026rsquo unlike the previous design which was very modern. That may go on to be a great success in another city but it wasn\u0026rsquot for Inverness or the location.\"A two-day public consultation was held last December at the city\u0027 railway station and in the Eastgate Shopping Centre to gather opinions about the overall riverside arts project to consider \"how the river should connect with the people and community of Inverness\".The arts initiative has been plagued by complaints about design and costs.The council has consistently stressed that the overall \u0026pound759,000 project, featuring a range of different art installations, is publicly funded but largely through ring-fenced grants.They were \u0026ndash Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,600), the Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound281,000), the council\u0027 \"cities gateway\" initiative (\u0026pound66,000), Highlands and Islands Enterprise (\u0026pound66,000) and a further \u0026pound40,000 from the council.
